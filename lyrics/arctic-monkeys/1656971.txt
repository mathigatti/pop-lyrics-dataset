The painted faces congregate in the mating season
To second homes they go alone, in no rush to leave 'em
And theres a fountain and a scimitar shaped yellow light
It picks you up and cuts you down to size


The people there the furniture start to seem important
A moment more and you catch the floor with a vivid and absorbant
Sharpened arc, like the scimitar shaped yellow light
That picks you up and cuts you down to size

I had questions for the tap dancer sat on your lap
And she child proof caps on her answers
Stone blower, blow me a stone and show me that handsome enhancer
She had a rock on her throttle and a brown glass bottle full of
Shavings from the sun
Although those shoes affect your step don't forget
Whose legs you're on

And theres a fountain and a scimitar shaped yellow light
It picks you up and cuts you down to size
