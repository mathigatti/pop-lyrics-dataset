Open Sesame (we've places to go)
We've people to see (let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes
That I bet you can make
When you want to escape
Say the word


Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move
And you'll probably be leaving soon
So I'm telling you

Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you

Eyes the color of (water left in mud)
Incing sugar dust (crazy green flashes)
It’s a funny thing
That I cannot explain
Don’t you know the train keeps a-rolling

Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both oughta put 'em on hold
And I know you agree
Yeah

Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
