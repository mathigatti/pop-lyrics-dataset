Well oh they might wear classic reeboks
Or knackered converse, or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there ain't no romance around there


And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh, it's a funny thing, you know?
We'll tell 'em if you like
We'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

Is over there there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no sherlock holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just cause he's had a coupla cans
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh, it's a funny thing, you know?
We'll tell em if you like
We'll tell em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

I said no
Oh, no!
Well, oh, you won't get me to go!
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go
Oh, no, no!

Well over there there's friends of mine
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time
And they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
No not in the same way
So not in the same way
Oh, no, oh, no, no
