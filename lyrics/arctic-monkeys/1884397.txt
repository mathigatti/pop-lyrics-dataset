Topless models doing semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored
Illuminations on a rainy day
When she walks her footsteps sing a reckless serenade


I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I mean
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

The type of kisses where teeth collide
When she laughs her heavens hum
A stun gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens
With the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine

I left my message but did he fuck get back to me
And now I'm stuck still and wondering how it's meant to be

Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade

Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
