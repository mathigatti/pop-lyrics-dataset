When you left the house this evening
You said you'd be back in a little while
Well, I've been waiting for such a long time
And this wait is driving me wild


And while I wait I think about you
Do you need me when I'm not there?
Are you planning to be without me?
Do you have a new attract?

You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman

If he is on you
It keeps flashing through my mind
If you would only call
If you would be so kind
Imagine things
I see another man
And it's this waiting I just can't stand

You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman
