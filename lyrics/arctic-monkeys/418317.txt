Won't somebody let me out! 
Don't wanna stick around no more 
I said they're looking at yer strange 
I said yer stickin' to the floor 


Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer 
So now one of you's gonna have to stop! 

Fucking hell I'll break your nose 
If they keep on pushing you around 
Keep on steeping on your toes 
I'll pick you up when you fall down 

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer 
Said not one of you, no 

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer 
So now one of you's gonna have to stop! 

Ah ah, ah ah, oh! 
Ah ah, ah ah, oh 
Yea, yea, yea! 

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer 
Said not one of you, no
