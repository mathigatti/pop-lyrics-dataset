This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though, look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end


This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though, look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end

There's a room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those walls make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
In any anomaly you slip into familiar ways

And we're forever unfulfilled
Can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes

Forever unfulfilled
And can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes

The more you open your mouth the more you're forcing performance
All the attention is leading me to feel important
(Maybe I'm not just completely obnoxious)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far

Wriggling around just so that you won't forget
There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the blazers in the queue
Struggling with the notion that it's life not film

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
(We're forever unfulfilled)
We tend to see that as a perk though, look
(Can't think why)
What it's done to your friends, their memories are pretend
(Like a search for murder clues)
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
