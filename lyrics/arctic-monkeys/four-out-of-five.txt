Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike, it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night
Dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights


Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof
It was well reviewed, four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind’s eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget
Doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice
I don't want to be nice and you know that

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise the old headquarters

All the nights that never happened
And the days that don't exist
At the Information-Action Ratio
Only time that we stop laughing
Is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus, it’s all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio
(The Information-Action Ratio)
Is the place to go, four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, now, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon (the Information-Action Ratio)
It got rave reviews, four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five

(Take it easy for a little while)
Four stars out of five
