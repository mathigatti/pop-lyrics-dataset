Ladies you're damn right 
You can't read a man's mind 
We're living in two tribes 
And heading for war 
Nobody's perfect 
We've all got to work it 
But fellas we're worth it 
So don't break the law 


Your call's late 
Big mistake 
You've gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take 
Next time 
Read my mind 
And I'll be good to you 
We're gift wrapped 
Kitty cats 
We only turn into tigers when we've got to fight 
(Right) 
Let's go 
Eskimo 
Out into the blue 

Come take my hand 
Understand 
That you can 
You're my man 
And i need you tonight 
Come make my dreams 
Honey hard as it seems 
Lovin' me 
Is as easy as pie 

I'm just a love machine 
Feeding my fantasy 
Give me a kiss or three 
and I'm fine 
I need a squeeze a day 
Instead of this negligee 
What will the neighbors say 
This time 

I've been goin' crazy while you sleep 
Thinkin' of a language that the two of us can speak 
So Mr. Prehistoric make your wheel 
and I'll be underwater 'cause i like the way it feels 

(I said) Your call's late 
Big mistake 
You've gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take 
Next time 
Read my mind 
And I'll be good to you 
We're gift wrapped 
Kitty cats 
We only turn into tigers when we've got to fight 
(Right) 
Let's go 
Eskimo 
Out into the blue 

Come take my hand 
Understand 
That you can 
You're my man 
And i need you tonight 
Come make my dreams 
Honey hard as it seems 
Lovin' me 
Is as easy as pie 

I'm just a love machine 
Feeding my fantasy 
Give me a kiss or three 
And I'm fine 
I need a squeeze a day 
Instead of this negligee 
What will the neighbors say 
This time 

Oh 
It's very new 
Can anybody tell me what to do 
Oh 
This feeling's very strange 
Can anybody tell me what's your game 

Oh 
A little education 
Oh 
To give me motivation 
Oh 
We'll turn the situation 
'round 

Oh 
Oh 
Making you a stranger 
Oh 
I'll only rearrange you 
For now 

(Oh) I'm just a love machine 
Oh 
So give me motivation 
(Oh) I'm just a love machine 

(Oh) I'm just a love machine 
Oh 
So give me motivation 
(Oh) I'm just a love machine
