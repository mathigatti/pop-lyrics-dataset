Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse


Oh, the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend is talking to me
But it's alright
She's saying that he's not gonna slap me
Or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses that's much easier to say

I've been before
And all these capers make us too good for her to ignore,
She's talking but I'm not entirely sure

Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it wont make it that much easier
It might make it worse

A sudden disheartener
Somebody's partner is talking to me
But I don't that is what she isn't
She murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
And I knew how could she not she could have anyone she wants
And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response, like

I don't mind
Be a big mistake for you to wait and have me waste your time
Really love it's fine
Said, really love it's fine!

And then the first time it occurred
That there was something to destroy
And I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh but she carried on suggesting
A struggle to refuse
She said it's the red wine this time
But that is no excuse
