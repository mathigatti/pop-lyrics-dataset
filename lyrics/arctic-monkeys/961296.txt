I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight
Or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination
You're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs


Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that
My darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you
With your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought
That I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite
No, it's no harsher than the bark
A middle of adventure
Such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight
Or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination
You're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs
And a smile
