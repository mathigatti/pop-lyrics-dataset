One, two, three, four

She looks like fun
She looks like fun
She looks like fun
She looks like


Smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
I've got the party plugged right into my skull
Wayne Manor, what a memorable N.Y.E

(She looks like fun)
Good morning
(She looks like fun)
Cheeseburger
(She looks like fun)
Snowboarding
(She looks like)

Finally, I can share with you through cloudy skies
Every whimsical thought that enters my mind
There ain't no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

(She looks like fun)
Bukowski
(She looks like fun)
Dogsitting
(She looks like fun)
Screwballing
(She looks like)

Finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
Baby, but why can't we all just get along?
Dance as if somebody's watching, because they are

No one's on the streets
We moved it all online
As of March
I'm so full of shite
I need to spend less time stood around in bars
Waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
And how much I respect them

(She looks like fun)
Key changes
(She looks like fun)
Re-thinking
(She looks like fun)
New order
(She looks like fun)
