Come and take a leaf out of my book 
I'm a crack dealing crook 
Selling lots of rock and roll to the masses 
And I know if you wanna take a trip to the city 
We can go (to Gibraltar) 
We can go (to Gibraltar) 


Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on 
Come on, come on, come on, come on 
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on 

Give me your switch card - I'll book some flights 

1996 and I'm stuck at the bottom of a truck 
Got the road right in my ..., got detectives 
And I'll say if you catch me that I really wish 
That I had stayed (in Gibraltar) 
That I had stayed (in Gibraltar) 

Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on 
Come on, come on, come on, come on 
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on 

Give me your switch card - I'll book some flights
