Betwixed and between
The fantastic dream
And the fear
Do you wonder where she is this afternoon?


And does it get on your nerves
Make you slightly perturbed
That there's things that you don't know about her?
And even the places that she's never been with you, seem awful empty without her

You can't look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right first time?

You can't look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right first time?

Betwixed and between
The fantastic dream
And the fear
Do you wonder where she is this afternoon?

And with the needle in groove
Its there all too prove
And they tell me are your feet still tappin?
I know theres a first for the trip over the water
What is the worst that could happen?

You can't look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right first time?
