We all want some one to shout for
Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
But heroes aren't what they seem
When you've been, where we've been


Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the snigger
Are they there at all
Or is it just paranoia

Everybody's got there box
And doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns

Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

There's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Here long before you

Just because we're having a say so
And not lining up to be play doh
In five years time will it be
Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys'

'Cause everybody's got there box
And doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns

Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

All the thoughts that I just said
Linger round and multiply in the head
Not that bad to start with
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell him to take out his tongue
Tell him to take out his tongue

It's not you it's them that's the fake
I won't mess with your escape
Is this really your escape?
