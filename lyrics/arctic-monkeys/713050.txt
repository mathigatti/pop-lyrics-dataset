Well this is a good idea
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't one
Well my friend fancies you
Oh what a way to begin it all
You said they're always exciting words to hear


And they woke up together not quite realising how
Akwardly stretching and yawning
Its always hard in the morning

And I suppose that's the price you pay
Oh it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And oh there's nothing left to guess now

They left before the lights came on
Because they didn't want to ruin
What it was that was brewing before he absolutely had to
And how can you wake up
With someone you don't love?
And not feel slightly fazed by it, oh, he had a struggle

And they woke up together not quite realising how
Oh but he's stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning

And I suppose that's the price you pay
Oh it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And oh there's nothing left to guess now

Quick, let's leave, before the lights come on
'Cos then you don't have to see
'Cos then you don't have to see what you've done

Quick, let's leave, before the lights come on
'Cos then you don't have to see
'Cos then you don't have to see what you've done

(I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?)
(I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?)
(I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?)
