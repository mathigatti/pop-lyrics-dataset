She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms


I've been feeling foolish
You should try it
She came and substituted
The peace and quiet
For acrobatic blood, flow, concertina

Cheating heartbeat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

Hear who's your host
Sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heats starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms

She's been loop the looping
Around my mind
Her motorcycle boots
Give me this kind of acrobatic blood, concertina

Cheating heartbeat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms, in an unusual place
When you feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
