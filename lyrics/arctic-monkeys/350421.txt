Watch me... watch me go 
Well I'm struttin' up ever so slow 
And now sting me... get in the groove 
Cause they're bangin' on the door 
Yes they're hard and they'll make a move 


We're wakin' up those sleepers 
You know we're so mischievous 
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained 
We're wakin' up those sleepers 
You know we're so mischievous 
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained 

(Knock, run) 
She's got you up and she's run, run, runnin' away 
(Knock, run) 
You're knockin' first if you think that you're comin' to play 

And I don't mind 
Cause all the time you're talkin' at me 
No I don't mind at all 

Oh well cap-guns and polystyrene planes 
Well I'm buyin' penny bubblies with my change 
Cause sting me... get in the groove 
Cause they're bangin' on the door 
Yes they're hard and they'll make a move 

We're wakin' up those sleepers 
You know we're so mischievous 
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained 
Oh well now she says she's goin' 
That she's got the towel to throw in 
Was just about to blow him and run away! 

(Knock, run) 
She's got you up and she's run, run, runnin' away 
(Knock, run) 
You're knockin' first if you think that you're comin' to play 

And I don't mind 
Cause all the time you're talkin' at me 
Well I don't mind at all... no
