It's ever so funny
I don't think you're special, I don't think you're cool
And you're probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I'm struggling
I can't see through your fake tan
Oh, ya know it for a fact
That everybody's eating outta your hand


What do you know?
Oh, you know nothing!
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Say you don't know nothing!

Fancy seeing you in here
You're all tarted up and you don't look the same
I haven't seen you since last year
And surprisingly you have forgot my name
But you know it
And you knew it all along
Oh, you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbing go on tell me I'm wrong

So what do you know?
Oh you know nothing!
But I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing, no!

Woah

Yeah, so what do you know?
Yeah! Oh you know nothing, no!
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
I said what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing, no!

I fancy you with a passion
You're a topshop princess, a rockstar too
You're a fad you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you
But it's alright
Put it all on one-side
Everybody's looking
You've got control of everyone's eyes
Including mine
