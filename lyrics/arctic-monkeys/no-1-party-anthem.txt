So you’re on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like Cantona
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles


Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She’s having a sly indoor smoke
She calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent

Her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed, have got you going
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

She’s a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I don’t
I may suggest that there’s somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It’s not like I’m falling in love
I just want you to do me no good
And you look like you could

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Yeah, yeah

The look of love
The rush of blood
The she’s with me
The gallic shrug
The shutterbugs
The Camera Plus

The black and white and the colour dodge
The good time girls
The cubicles
The house of fun
The number one party anthem
