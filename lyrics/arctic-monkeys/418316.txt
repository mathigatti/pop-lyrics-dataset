Well I watch you tangle every weekend
It might start different but it ends up the same
One minute you're casually speaking
The next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame
With your Jerry can of words and tones


And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say, Apparently
Oh he says settle for a draw
Well you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for a draw
I told you once I'm sure
I told you once I'm sure
You should settle for a draw
Why don't you settle for a draw?

Well you're right it is one set of rules for her
And then another set for you
But that's just the way it is I suppose
And there's nowt you can do
And lets not fall in the trap
Of Answering back
I am just a beginner
But she'll be the only winner
That's for sure
So take the draw, if it's available
And if it sets on fire don't get out your jerry can of...
...words and tones

And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say, Apparently
Oh he says settle for a draw
Well you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for a draw
I told you once I'm sure
I told you once I'm sure
You should settle for a draw
Why don't you settle for a draw?
