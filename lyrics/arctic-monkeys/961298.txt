Old yellow bricks, love's a risk
Quite early to the escapologist
Looked so miffed, when you wished
For a thousand places better than this


You are the fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?

She was enraged by the way
That the emperors put traps in the cage
And her days she being dull
Lead to nights reading beer bottles

You're such a fugitive, but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us yeah you can't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in the city, that never wakes up?

You're at a loss, just because
It wasn't all that you thought it was
You're the fugitive, but you don't know what you're running away from

She said I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia
I know I said he wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up
But Dorothy was right though
