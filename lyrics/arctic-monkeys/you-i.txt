I like the way you look at me, baby
Please don't try and turn on the lights
I act as if I'm not going crazy
Girl, I'm on the road tonight


Will you tell me where you're gonna take it?
If I had a heart you're the one that should break it
The engine's running, can't decide if I should ride away

You and I, you and I

I had a woman
She went away
And now I'm lonely
Fuck it

You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I

Will you tell me where you're gonna take it?
If I had a heart you're the one that should break it
The engine's running, can't decide if I should ride away

You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I

I like the way you look at me, baby
Please don't go and turn on the lights
I act as if I'm not going crazy
Girl, I'm on the road tonight
