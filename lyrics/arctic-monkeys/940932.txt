Top marks for not tryin'
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted


And I wonder
Are you puttin' us under?
'Cos we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination

Well, see you later, innovator

Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cos you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours

She'll be sayin': Use me
Show me the jacuzzi
I imagine that it's there on a plate
You're whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened
To make 'em wait for a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set
Out to acquire
The odds are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm

Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not tryin')
You leave the other story standing
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept, 'cos you've stolen their

Thunder
Are you putting us under?
'Cos we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination

Well, see you later, innovator
