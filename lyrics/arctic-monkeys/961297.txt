If you were there, beware, the serpent soul pinchers
Three hundred and fifty; no, thank yous; and nobody flinches
Go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome, we require your grief
The thugs help the thieves as they're trying to rob
The words from her gob and take the source of the innocents


If you were there, beware, the serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant to fill column inches
And you've had enough, what you're trying to dig up, isn't there to be dug
The thieves help the thugs as they're trying beat
The good grace of a sweetheart out to the point she'll comply

Why leave her on her own
If I'd have known then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known

Why leave her on her own
If I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known

There's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
Our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
I don't know what it is that they want
I don't know what it is that they want
But I haven't got it to give
She hasn't got it to give
