I so wanted it long but she cut it short
And now I'm catching a cold
I told you not but no crack in the doobie
But it was already rolled


Oh, I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
Oh well, I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed last night
Oh baby, I must be mad

Well, I don't care about your massage oils
It's got my skin going red
Cause I'm a mad mother-fucker
With my curtains open
Sitting tucked up in bed

I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
Oh well, I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed last night
Oh baby, I must be mad
