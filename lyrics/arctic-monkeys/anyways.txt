Just another microcosm somewhere in the ether
Putting a world to rights with Bing Crosby eyes
Oversharing and its bitter aftertaste
Exactly the wrong time in exactly the wrong place
Save it for a rainy day
Baby, you go hard in the paint
It's just another race to anyways


Philanthropic toga party
What a place for both the opposite sides
Of my double life to finally collide
Sharing secrets I was taking to the grave
Nosebleeds from epiphanies I took full in the face
Oh, come all by the fire, babe, let’s all participate
In yet another race to anyways
Oh, how's your Mum and Dad been doing
With the generation gap?

Yeah, I'm behind my movie camera
I’ve got my megaphone
You can call me Alexander
It's nice to meet you all

Listening to the Shipping Forecast
Driving to the airport
Me and the guys
Metropolis ablaze in the rear view
Devising methods to both have and eat your cake
Mmm, just like the ones that Mother Nature used to bake
You look as if you know exactly what I'm gonna say
Is just another race to
Anyways
