I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
That comes to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind, when she's not right there beside me


I go crazy, 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is: Are you mine?
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Alright

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining, climbing on my desire

And I go crazy, 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is: Are you mine?
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say: You got me, baby
Are you mine?

She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy, 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is: Are you mine?
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
(Or just mine tonight?)
