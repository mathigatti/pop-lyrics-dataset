There's always somebody taller
With more of a wit
And he's equipped to enthrall her
And her friends think he's fit
And you just can't measure up no
You don't have a prayer
Wishing that you'd made the most of her
When she was there
They've got engaged
There's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird
And he'd probably kick your head in


Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts
You're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I know you were though

Bet you don't know what she's upto
You can only assume
She's not on't front of the shops then
They've gone to his room
Bet she's gone round in her school stuff
I Bet that's what he likes
I bet you thought she was different
And you thought she was nice

But she's not nice
She's pretty fucking far from nice
She's looking at you funny
Rarely looking at you twice

Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts
Oh, you're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah but it's clear you were though

Have you heard what she's been doing?
Never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gate
At twenty past three
She's been with all the boys but
Never went very far
And she wagged English and Science
Just to go in his car

They've got engaged
There's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched me bird
And he'd probably kick my head in, oh
Now the girls have grown
Yeah but I'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways

Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts
So, I'm better off without her anyway
I said I wasn't sad to see her go
But I'm only pretending, you know
Yeah, I'm only pretending, you know
Yeah, I'm only pretending, you know
Oh, I'm only pretending, you know
