Fake tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom


There's a super cool band, yeah
With their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars in the toilets

I don't want to hear, you know
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
I don't want to hear your

Fake tales of San Fransisco

All wishing they weren't there

And as the microphone squeaks

And she's running to the streets outside

And I'm not having a nice time

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)

Yeah, I'm sure that's pretty far

And yeah, I'd love to tell you all my problem
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham
So get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Yeah
