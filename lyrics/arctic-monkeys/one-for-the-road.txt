One for the road, uh uh
One for the road, uh uh


From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

The cracks in black out blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling, but you’re feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There’s no need to show me round, baby, I feel like I’ve been here before
I’ve been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go, will you pour me one for the road?

I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn’t fold
I saw this coming from start
The shake, rattle and roll

(One for the road)

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There’s no need to show me round, baby, I feel like I’ve been here before
I’ve been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go, will you pour me one for the road?

The mixture hits you hard
Don’t get that sinking feeling, don’t fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster

Uh uh
One for the road, uh uh
One for the road, uh uh
One for the road, uh uh
One for the road, uh uh
Uh uh
Uh uh
Uh uh

One for the road, uh uh

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There’s no need to show me round, baby, I feel like I’ve been here before
I’ve been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go, will you pour me one for the road?
