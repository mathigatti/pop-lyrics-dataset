Black as a beacon
In a river of shimmering fog
Yes she was


If you were heat seeking
She was hard to ignore
Yes she was

And she snapped
Wing mirrors off a Cadillac
With a particular pretty one

And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

Well Time tastes bland
When she's not around
And you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink
Before she showed you how to shake love's steady hand

And she snaps
Wing mirrors off a Cadillac
With a particular pretty one

And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

Shake love's steady hand
Shake love's steady
She floats like an niccy rush but she stings like a bee... flat (niccy as in a nicotine rush)

The Blond-o sonic shimmer trap
And she snapped the wing mirrors off a Cadillac
With a particular pretty ones

And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on
