So who's that girl there? 
I wonder what went wrong 
So that she had to roam the streets 
She don't do major credit cards 
I doubt she does receipts 
It's all not quite legitimate 


And what a scummy man 
Just give him half a chance 
I bet he'll rob you if he can 
Can see it in his eyes, yeah 
That he's got a driving ban 
Amongst some other offences 

And I've seen him with girls of the night 
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light 
They're all infected but he'll be alright 
Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know 
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

Although you're trying not to listen 
I bet your eyes are staring at the ground 
She makes a subtle proposition 
Sorry love I'll have to turn you down 

And oh he must be up to something 
Want half a chance to show he's more than likely 
I've got a feeling in my stomach 
I start to wonder what his story might be 
What his story might be 

They said it changes when the sun goes down 
And they said it changes when the sun goes down 
And they said it changes when the sun goes down 
Around here 
Around 

And look here comes a Ford Mondeo 
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous 
And he don't have to say 'owt 
She understands she's here to get picked up 

And she's delighted when she sees him 
Pulling in and giving her the eye 
Because she must be fucking freezing 
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky 
She don't stop in the winter, no and... 

They said it changes when the sun goes down 
And they said it changes when the sun goes down 
And they said it changes when the sun goes down 
Around here 

They said it changes when the sun goes down 
And they said it changes when the sun goes down 
And they said it changes when the sun goes down 
Around here 
Around here 

What a scummy man 
Just give him half a chance 
I bet he'll rob you if he can 
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan 
I hope you're not involved at all
