Just put your dukes up, John
Yeah, put your dukes up, John
You were preened and sanitised
Struck dumb by good advice


Your integrity was bruised
Your celebrity a ruse
They pulled the rug from under
Made way for new pretenders

Change your tune and change your hair
Or you're not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or you're not going anywhere
Be a C-Y-N-I-C

Be a C-Y-N-I-C

The profit margin blinds them
They groomed and ostracised him
His calm makes my blood boil
His calm makes my blood boil

Change your tune and change your hair
Or you're not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or you're not going anywhere
Be a C-Y-N-I-C

Be a C-Y-N-I-C
