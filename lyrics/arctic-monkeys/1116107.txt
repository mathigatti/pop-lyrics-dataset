When you leave us through the patient doors
That rattle in you ear will be the sound of our applause
Raptuous, considered and due


Oh, the nasty laughter and desperate smirks
Are tangled in the boredom where out brittle kisses lurk
Well how can I believe you
When you can't believe your luck?

And the shards of past attraction lie visible
But shy and blunt and weak and worn
Away by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak

Oh, the shards of past attraction lie visible
But shy and blunt and weak and worn
Away by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak

In the trap
You only want to be the first to laugh
You only want to be the first in the sandtrap
You only want to be the first to laugh

And you're climbing holes, and cinder claws
Ring out the (?) the center all towards

Farewell, farewell, farewell
