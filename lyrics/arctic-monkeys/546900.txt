We got thrown in a riot van
And the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin


Smoked a bong a last night
And stole somebody's telephone
He thinks it's all alright
But they've left him on his own, on his own

But baby stop calling
Over and over yeah
And give me some funny cigarettes
And do what they told you, yeah

Pinched a car with one headlight
And lost control the passengers were screaming
Made him shut his eyes reet tight
And think of you, and hope that he was dreaming

Then up rolled the riot van
And called the fire brigade
But it was already too late
And there was no arrests to make
Ohhhhh!

But baby stop calling
Over and over yeah
And give me some funny cigarettes
And do what they told you, yeah
