I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The first thing that she said


Temptation greets you like your naughty mate
The one that used to get you in bother
But one you could never bring yourself to hate

And she said we've got that spark
That only lights a fuse
Helps you see in the dark
But it's a sight you'll lose when
Temptation greets you like your naughty friend

I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead

Temptation greets you like your naughty mate
One that made you steal and set things on fire
But one you haven't seen of late

And I said that kind of talk
Only adds intrigue
To the cauldron of thought
It's already exceeding
Temptation, the very thing that held her back

I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead

I don't ever want to hate you
It's not part of the plan
So keep your charm where I can't see it
And your hands where I can

Dizzie Rascal:
We used to be in tight me and my naughty friends
Caused bare madness in the ends
I mean day 'n' night
We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight
Smoking, drinking, joyriding
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
Reckless gangsters no direction
No sign of correction
But then i switched it up
Changed my ways
What the hell!
Like, oh, my days
But like my naughty friends
They're not phased
Can't believe that this music pays
See no reason why we can't do
All the things we've always done
Still in my heart I know thats just what
But its hard to fight the temptation son

Arctic Monkeys:
The panic will fall down around you
If you don't do what i say

I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead

I don't ever want to hate you
It's not part of the plan
So keep your charm where I can't see it
And your hands where I can
