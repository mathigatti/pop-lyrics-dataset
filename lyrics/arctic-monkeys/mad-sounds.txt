Mad sounds in your ears make you feel alright
They’ll bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance
Make you get up
Yeah, they make you get up


Love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide
Mad sounds in you ears
They make you get up and dance
Make you get up
All night long they reappear
Make you get up and dance
Yeah, they make you get up

Suppose you’ve got up to what you gotta do
We just weren’t feeling how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes but you just can’t figure out what went wrong
Then outta nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an

Ooh, la la la
Ooh, la la la
Ooh, la la la, ooh
Ooh, la la la
Ooh, la la la
Ooh, la la la, ooh

You got those mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance
Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance

Don’t they make you get up?
Don’t they make you get up?
