Try and think of something colourful for this season
Pull the wool over the gullible for no reason
You are all i have these days, shake it up and run away
With the night squabbling behind you


From the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots.
I'm joining the dots.

Thought i heard them talking in their sleep yesterday
And i tried but i just can't believe a word they say
Hurry up they'll be here soon, sleeping in the afternoon
While the rain's trying to prove a point outside

From the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots.
I'm joining the dots.

Those people make me calm
Can't the flame
Come up to the moth for a change
And darling if it 's all the same to you
I'll have you to myself
I'm joining the dots.
I'm joining the dots.
