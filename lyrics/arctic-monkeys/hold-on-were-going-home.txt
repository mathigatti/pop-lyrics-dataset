I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you put your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion endlessly


'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion endlessly

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)

You're the girl, you're the one
I gave you everything I love
You think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

You're the girl, you're the one

You think there's something, baby
I think there's something
