Break a mirror, roll the dice
Run with scissors through a chip pan fire fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don't sit down, 'cause I've moved your chair


Find a well known hardman and start a fight
Wear your shell suit on bonfire night
Fit a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down cause I've moved your chair

(Ohh, yeah yeah yeah)
(Ohh, yeah yeah yeah)

Bite the lightning and tell me how it tastes
Kung-fu fighting on your rollerskates
Do the macarena in the devil's lair
But just don't sit down, 'cause I've moved your chair

(Ohh, yeah yeah yeah)
(Ohh, yeah yeah yeah)
(Ohh, yeah yeah yeah)
(Ohh)
