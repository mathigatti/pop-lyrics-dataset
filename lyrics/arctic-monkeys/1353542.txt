Up from the pastures of boredom 
out from the sea of discontent 
they come in packs like hungry hounds 
the seekers of the dark enchantment. 


They haunt the boulevards and bars 
they pray to wishing wells and stars 
they ride the hurricane of hope 
not looking back but on they go 
toward the distance and deceiving 
and all the while they keep believing 
they are special and apart 
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers. 

And when they pair off two by two 
they feel they are the chosen few 
and though their beds are made of straw 
they feel like velvet in the night 
and so the night is never ending 
it's made of distance and pretending 
coz they're special and apart 
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers. 

And when love goes away 
and when love goes... 
goodbye... 
catches in their throats like cotton 
rises in their hearts like rain 
the good times suddenly are all forgotten 
the hunt begins again. 

They search the subways and the streets 
their faces tired, like their feet 
their bodies aching to be warm 
and so they hide behind the moon 
their loneliness inside them growing 
but they take comfort in just knowing 
that they are special and apart 
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers 

And when love comes again 
and when love comes 
hello... 
rises from their throats like singing 
catches in their hearts like wind 
the good things 
strangers in their arms are bringing 
makes life all right again. 

They turn their faces to the light 
no longer hiding in the night 
so unashamed and unafraid 
that they can face each other's faults 
and though the waltz will have its ending 
there is no harm in just pretending 
that they are special and apart 
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.
