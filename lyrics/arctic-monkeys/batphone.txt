I want an interesting synonym to describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in
I'll use the search engine
(We've got much to discuss)
Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams


It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called Integrity
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again, but I'm usually alright
Thankfully, the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

I've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

You go in through the door
Vengeance trilogy wallpaper walls
They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

I've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
Vehicles will pass by, but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Killer Pink Flamingos, computer controlled
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul
