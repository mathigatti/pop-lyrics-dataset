Running off over the next door's garden
Before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks
And runny makeup alone


Or will blood run down the face
Of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish
Where you wish you'd never been born
You tie yourself to the tracks
There isn't no going back
It's wrong, wrong, wrong
But we'll do it anyway cause we love a bit of trouble!

Are you pulling her from a burning building
Or throwing her to the sharks?
Can only hope that the ending is
As pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you baffle 'em straight
It's wrong, wrong, wrong
She can hardly wait

That's right
He won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

That's right
He won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

That's right
He won't let her out his sight

That's right
He won't let her out his sight

That's right
He won't let her out his sight
You'll be able to boast
That today held the most
Flawless heist of all time

You knew that it'd be trouble
Right before the very first kiss
Quiet and assuming but you
Heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off
But you resisted and fought
Sorry sweetheart, I'd much rather
Keep on the balaclava
