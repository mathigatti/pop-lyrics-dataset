She's the victim, well fuck all that we ain't goin home today
And she's been too much magic beans to walk all men away
And she's been eatin' too much magic beans to walk all men away
Put up your picture and the playful love will get around
Yeah but we'll get around yeah
Yeah but we'll get around


Well everyones felling alright
I won't be sleeping today
No I won't be sleeping tonight

We're felling silly, I'm feeling oh so sick
And I can't see you through the smoke because the clouds so thick
And theres a fire as your dancing to the disco sound
Put up your picture baby and love will get around
Yeah but we'll get around yeah
But yeah we'll get around

Everyone's feeling alright
I won't be sleeping today
And I won't be sleeping tonight
