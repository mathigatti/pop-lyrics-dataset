He looks as if he hasnt slept, his hair is purposely unkept
And then he knew his people wept, when you crafted your plan
The shadows underneath the eyes, and everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise, you won't remember me
There's nothing really I can say, but sorry mate and walk away
I could be wrong unless you play your game, this world is full of most unkind
And horrible is redefined, I can't imagine that you'd mind at all


You're lying again, your conscious ain't your friend
And the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination
Lying again your conscious ain't your friend
And the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination
Is he really on the street, desperation on deceit
And what he's wearing on his feet won't solve our mystery
And I am baffled by how you stand there, soaking it in
And do you hide your identity where you hide your grin, better hide your grin

Shadows underneath the eyes, everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise, you won't remember me
There's nothing really I can say, but sorry mate and walk away
I could be wrong unless you play your game, this world is full of is most unkind
And horrible is redefined, I can't imagine that you'd mind at all
You're lying again, your conscious in your friend
And the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination, lying again your conscious in your friend and the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination
