Pussyfooting
Setting sun
Make a wish that weighs a ton
There are no handles for you to hold
No understanding where it goes


Jealousy
In technicolor
Fear by name
Love by numbers
Streetlight amber
Wanderlust
Hide her in a
Blunderbuss

She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time has got it in for Honey
That's where you're wrong

All the old flames
Fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a ton
There are no handles you can hold
No understanding where it goes

She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time has got it in for Honey
That's where you're wrong

That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
