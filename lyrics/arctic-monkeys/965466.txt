They've sped up to the point where they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen


They've sped up to the point where they provoke you
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
Sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the top one-hundred list

And it's the thousanth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told ya, but you were dying for it

(Saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it
Whatever that means)
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath?
That says that we are defenders
Of any poser or professional pretender around

When did your list
Replace the twist and turn like a fist
Replaced the kiss?
Don't concern us with your bollocks
I don't want your prayer
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousanth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told ya, but you were gagging for it

Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker
Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker

Assuming that all things are equal
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you?
