Space invaders flying home
Yeah, they're going to hit the sack
And they are probably going to die getting high
'Cause they're mixing crazy moments with the crack
And she's kissing all the boys
She's to clever to be slack
But she's bound to go away for a day
And she like it, so she won't be coming back


Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days have died
Baby, baby, baby
Now won't you dry your pretty eyes?
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days are taxed
So come on!

Spot big bell bottom chords
And a matching with a hat
And you're a rule breaker, baby
Can't you see me standing
Only in your way to hit the sack?

And she's kissing all the boys
She's too clever to be slack
But she's bound to go away for a day
And she like it, so she won't be coming back

Baby, baby, baby
The good old days have died
Baby, baby, baby
Now won't you dry your pretty eyes?
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days are taxed
So come on!
