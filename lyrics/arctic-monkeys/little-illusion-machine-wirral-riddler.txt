Swinging from room to room
Planting something new
Riddle, and I do it again
Back to the Wirral where it all began


Wirral riddler

Send a letter to me, baby
I'm on the edge of my seat
Send a letter to me, baby
Little illusion machine

Riding through the room
Something beautiful
He's riddling the riddle, he'll do it again
He's going back to the Wirral where it all began

Wirral riddler

Send a letter to me, baby
I'm on the edge of my seat
Send a letter to me, baby
Little illusion machine

I tried it and I liked it but,
It just never gets close enough

Send a letter to me, baby

(Wirral)
So tell me, where have you been?
(Wirral)
Little illusion machine
(Wirral)
Hoping tonight is gonna send me back to you
