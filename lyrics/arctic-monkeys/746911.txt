Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until the stars fall from the sky
Yours (yours) until the rivers all run dry
In other words, until I die


Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until the Sun no longer shines
Yours (yours) until the poets run out of rhyme
In other words, until the end of time

I'm gonna stay right here by your side
Do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothin' in the world can drive me away
Every day, you'll hear me say

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until two and two is three
Yours (yours) until the mountains crumble to the sea
In other words, until eternity

Baby, I'm yours
'Til the stars fall from the sky
Baby, I'm yours
'Til the rivers all run dry
Baby, I'm yours
'Til the Sun no longer shines
Baby, I'm yours
'Til the poets run out of rhyme
