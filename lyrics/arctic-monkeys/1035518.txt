The smiles as she walked in the room
Have all turned into frowns am I to quick to assume
That the love is no longer in bloom
The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune
To what they did before, the heads red raw
And the ending doesn't sound like the happiest around
When you sobbed before it felt much more
Like the product of a squabble
Now there's reason for it to be something more
And there would be, oh it's uncertain whether the curtain has shut for good
She said see if it's still raining, I'm not dressed for it
And if you loved me, I interrupted, received a scowl and stare
Still decided to stop her there


Would it be outrageous to say
We're either shouting or we're shagging docked in tempestuous bays
Or at least that's how it felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier and whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery
Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me like Sunday's frozen pitch fits the thermos flask
It's a pity, it's just hit me, we can't go back
To the chest touching on the back
