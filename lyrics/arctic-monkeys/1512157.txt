I'm pinned down by the dark

Been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
Yes I'm battling that well told gripe
The most frustrating type
You should have racing stripes
The way you keep me in pursuit
You sharpen the heel of your boot
And you press it in my chest
And you make me wheeze
Then to my knees you do promote me


I'm pinned down by the dark

A-N-I-M-A-L
She makes my head pirouette
More than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

The light it fidgets through, the thoughts will soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance
The first and final chance
And of course the audience of
Frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam
She broke everyone's heart

I'm pinned down by the dark

A-N-I-M-A-L
She makes my head pirouette
More than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

The most unsuitable pet
It's been long enough now
So let's make a mess lioness

I'm pinned down by the dark
