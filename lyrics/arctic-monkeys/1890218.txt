Caricatures of your wrecking ball gown, in my mind
All the time
I wanna be in that, damsel patterned alley
Where you go, for a smoke


And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lighting up
Taking no chances
Close but never close enough

Been watching cowboy films, on gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

All my own stunts
High noon changed it's tune
Linking arms, syncing hearts

And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Taking no chances
The last one out, to win a prize

Been watching cowboy films, on gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

Wooah
Wooah
Wooah
Wooah

Coz I'm from High Green, I'm from High Green
