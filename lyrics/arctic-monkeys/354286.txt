Now then, mardy bum
I've seen your frown and it's like
Looking down the barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer


It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Well, now then, mardy bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again
Aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear

Can we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
But I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs, oh, when you say I don't care
But of course I do, yeah, I clearly do

So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
