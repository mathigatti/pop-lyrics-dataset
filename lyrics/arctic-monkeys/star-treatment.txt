I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway


I'm a big name in deep space
Ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge

Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019
Maybe I was a little too wild in the 70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles

Karate bandana
Warp speed chic
Hair down to there
Impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police

Baby that isn't how they look tonight
Oh no
It took the light forever
To get to your eyes

I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that
You could forget
And then I
Haunt you via the rear view mirror on a long drive
From the back seat

But it's alright
Cause you love me
And you recognize that it's ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over
I know the place

Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, long Hot Summer
They've got a film up on the wall
And it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

Maybe I was a little too wild in the 70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police

So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police

Baby that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light
Absolutely forever to get to your eyes

And as we gaze skyward
Ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment

And as we gaze skyward
Ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment

It's the star treatment

The star treatment
