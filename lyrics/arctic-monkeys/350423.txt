Oh baby, I'm wanting to do you a swap 
I'll give you anything, yeah 
In return for the noises you've got 
And I can see you want to be attended to 
Just count to twenty-nine and I'll attend to you 
Oh for sure... well certainly, yeah yeah yeah 
Wavin' bye to the train or the bus 
I'm ever so worried because... 
I don't want to get all forgotten... 


So very comfortable.. 
Don't really need to put up my feet, 
And even in fat sam's grand slam, 
Can't see it being easier to speak. 
when you've karate-kicked your way to someone new 
And I'm a memory and don't know what to do 
All on his own... 
Collecting his dole n' stuff 

Wavin' bye to the train or the bus 
I'm ever so worried because... 
I don't want to get all forgotten... 
Cause we know 
Yeah, we know-oh-oh-oh 
Oh we know, a woah-oh-oh 

Don't know where we're going, baby 
I s'pose it depends 
But even if we're all far apart 
We can all come back and all be fine 
We'll be able to be together again 

Be together again 
Be together again 
Be together again 
... 
Everybody will be together again!
