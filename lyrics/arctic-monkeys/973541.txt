007 and  Bruce Wayne
Are shitting themselves because there's another name
Coming to claim what is his to claim
10% Faster with a sturdier frame


He's certainly come into his own
There's one on is arm in every land that he roams
And two consecutive nights alone
Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

They said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last
Are two thing's you'll never be my darling

Another run around and another push and shove
Further away from the idea of love
And his conclusion it must be good
Or when the penny has dropped with an incredible thud

Forgot to kick the tin
He knows where she's going but dunt' know where she's been
And there's the plus of the other thing
He'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in

They said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last
Are two thing's you'll never be my darling

Thing's you'll never be my darling
Thing's you'll never be my darling
Two thing's you will never be my darling
Thing's you'll never be my darling

Well, he sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
Not to feel like a twat at times is hard
But not for this kid, not when they come to you
