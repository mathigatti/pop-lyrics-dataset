Well, the mourning was complete
There was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak


It's the beginning of the end, the car went up the hill
And disappeared around the bend, ask anyone they'll tell you that
It's these times that it tends to start to breaking off
To start to fall apart, oh, hold on to your heart

Do me a favour and break my nose
Do me a favour and tell me to go away
Do me a favour and stop asking questions

And she walked away, while her shoes were untied
And the eyes were all red
You could see that we'd cried, and I watched and I waited
'Till she was inside, forcing a smile and waving goodbye

Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

Do me a favour and ask if you need some help
She said "do me a favour and stop flattering yourself"
How to tear apart the ties that bind?
Perhaps Fuck Off might be too kind
Perhaps Fuck Off might be too kind
