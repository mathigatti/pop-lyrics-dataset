Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band and all
And back there by the Baby Grand
Didn't Mr. Winter Wonderland
Say: Come here kid, we really need to talk?
Bear with me, man
I lost my train of thought


I fantasise and call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fall to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks
Thirsty for blood

Oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritised
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose the singer must die

Singsongs around the money tree
This stunning documentary that no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography, it's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe, I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man
I lost my train of thought
