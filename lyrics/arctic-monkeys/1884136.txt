Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of its kind to get to the moon
Trust some ellipses to chase you 'round the room
Through curvatures and metaphors and goo


Been watching all the neon blossom flickering
You look as if you've all forgotten where you've been
Going riding through the thundersuckle fuzz canyon
Ten, nine, eight, seven,  six-five-four
Three-two-one

Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of its kind to get to the moon
Give me an eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Of an 'ip-dip dogshit rock and roll
