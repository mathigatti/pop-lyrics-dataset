The mirror's image
It tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
'Cause you're not by my side


And as I arrive I thought I saw you leaving
Carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming
Of bumping into you

Now it's three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you reply
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
High, why'd you only call me when you're high?

Somewhere darker
Talking the same shite
I need a partner (aah)
Well, are you out tonight?

It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now it's three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you reply (message you reply)
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
High, Why'd you only call me when you're high?

And I can't see you here wondering where I might (might, might)
Sort of feels like I am running out of time (time, time)
I haven't found what I was hoping to find (find)

You said you gotta be up in the morning
Gonna have an early night
And you're starting to bore me, baby
Why'd you only call me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
