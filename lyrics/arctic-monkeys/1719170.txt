I wanna see something that used to be in your eyes again,
I'm waitin' to see it, you know it's only a question of when,
And I know how much I'm missin' heaven,
You know that it's missin'
And only you know where you have been to,
Only you know what you have been through,
But there's better things you're gonna get into,
And I wanna be there too.


I know it's not easy for you to start to believe again
And when the day comes don't let yourself be deceived again
Cause I know how you've been waiting,
Such a long time that you've been waitin
And only you know where you have been to,
Only you know what you have been through,
There's better things you're gonna get into,
And I wanna be there too.

And I know how you've been waiting,
Such a long time that you've been waitin
And only you know where you have been to,
Only you know what you have been through,
But there's better things you're gonna get into,
And I wanna be there too.
