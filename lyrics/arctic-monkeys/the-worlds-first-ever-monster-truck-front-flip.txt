You push the button and we’ll do the rest
The exotic sound of data storage
Nothing like it, first thing in the morning
You push the button and we’ll do the rest
Bastard Latin, that’s the best thing for it
You push the button and we’ll do the rest


You and Lizzy in the summertime
Wrapping my tiny mind around a lullaby

There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don’t ever have to

Pattern language, in the mood for love
You push the button and we’ll do the rest

You and Genie wearing Stetson hats
Trying to gain access to my lily pad

There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don’t ever have to

The world’s first ever monster truck front flip
I’m just a bad girl trying to be good
I’ve got a laser guiding my love that I cannot adjust

Forward thinking model villages
More brain shrinking moving images
You push the button and we’ll do the rest
