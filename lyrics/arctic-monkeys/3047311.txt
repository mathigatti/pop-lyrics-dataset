I saw you dancin'
You moved like Sinatra
On speed


Lights were a flashin'
And tongues were a waggin'
Over you
It's too late, for trying
Too late, for denying
All those little things
You and me have done
I'm sorry hon'
I was hoping
For a recall
A mix of you high from the Sun
Oh, but nothin'
Only lone magpies come

I saw you dancin'
You moved like Sinatra
On speed
