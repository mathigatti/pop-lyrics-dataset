Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
What it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to


And your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang, go

I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984

I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because you're sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair

That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang, go

I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984

And there ain't no love, no
Montague's or Capulets
Just banging tunes in DJ sets and
Dirty dancefloors
And dreams of naughtiness

Well, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Said from 1984
