I'm sure that he could give you everything,
stability and diamond rings.
All the things I do not have,
I understand you can't handle that.


But for everything that I lack,
I provide something you almost had.
Hot flesh that are yearn to grab,
pit in your stomach you're still so sad

Ooh whatcha you gonna do?
I'm in love with you, don't you wanna dance?
This may be the last chance,
that I get, to love you.

Out of sight ,not out of mind,
you want the world, I'll give you mine.
'cause you're the girl I'll never find,
and I'm the boy you've left behind.
I bet you think you're satisfied,
and God knows how hard ya try,
but if you showed up at my door,
I could give you so much more.

Ooh whatcha you gonna do?
I'm in love with you, don't you wanna dance?
This may be the last chance,
that I get, to love you.
Ooh what am I gonna do?
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
this may be the last chance,
that you get, to love me.

You sure don't make it easy,
to get myself to safety,
You tell me that I'm crazy,
but you're the one that made me this way.
You call yourself impulsive,
but that's what makes us so explosive.
So as I burn these photographs,
I wonder if you kept the ones you had.
Keep them locked up somewhere safe,
'cause it's the only place you'll see my face!

Ooh whatcha you gonna do?
I'm in love with you,why don't you wanna dance?
'Cause this may be the last chance,
that I get, to love you.
Ooh what am I gonna do?
I don't like to loose
You're not making sense
'cause this may be the last chance,
That you get, to love me.
'cause This may be the last chance,
that I get, to love you.
To love you, to love you, yeah!
