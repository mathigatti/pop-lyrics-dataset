You push me
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
To take me down
Take me down


You hurt me
But do I deserve this?
You make me so nervous
Calm me down
Calm me down

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed

So come here
And never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down
Slows me down

So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out
Why don't you help me out?

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed

So you say "Go, it isn't workin' "
And I say "No, it isn't perfect"
So I stay and stand
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it
Take it all
Take all that I have
I'll give it all away just to get you back

Fake it
Fake it all
Take what I can get
Knockin' so loud
Can't you hear me yell?
I try to stay away, but you can't forget

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed

So you say "Go, it isn't workin' "
And I say "No, it isn't perfect"
So I stay and stand
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it
Take it all
Take all that I have
Take it
Take it all
Take all that I have
