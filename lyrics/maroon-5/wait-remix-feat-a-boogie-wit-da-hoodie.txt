Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh


Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you

Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

Can we talk for a moment?
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holdin' on
Wasn't tryna get wasted
I needed more than three or four to say this, oh

Let me apologize, yeah
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times (all those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you

Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

Wait, can we work this out?
I've been thinkin' out loud all day
Don't let me down
Can't live without my bae
And she wanna leave, but I think it's easier
If you let me be
You should come and see me, girl
Just think about it, girl
You should know I still think about you, yeah
I know you're into diamonds
I can tell you everything defined in you
But I'm like

Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please?
'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please?
'Cause I wanna be with you
