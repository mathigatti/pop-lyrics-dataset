I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two


Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted
All of our bridges burnt down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the Sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Ohhh

You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burnt down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the Sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone

Now baby dont hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
Baby I'm begging just please don't go
So I can tell you what you need to know

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone
