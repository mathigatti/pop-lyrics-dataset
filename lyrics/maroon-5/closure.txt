You come over to tell me that it's over
Say you wanna do this face to face
Bottle opens, we pour out our emotions
Knew that if you came here, you would stay


If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for

I know what'cha want, baby
What'cha came here for
Closure
I know what'cha want, baby
What'cha came here for
Closure

How did we end up in this situation?
Guess it went exactly as you planned
I always give in to your manipulation
I tried to resist, but I just can't

If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for

I know what'cha want, baby
What'cha came here for
Closure
I know what'cha want, baby
What'cha came here for
Closure

Oh, yeah, oh

Oh, as soon as we make love
It's gonna break your heart again
'Cause we both know when we wake up
That we'll go back to war again, yeah

If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for

I know what'cha want, baby
What'cha came here for
Closure
I know what'cha want, baby
What'cha came here for
Closure

Oh, yeah, oh
