Yesterday when i was handsome
I took my hat off
Yesterday into some


Yesterdays gone and
Yesterdays gone and
Yesterdays calling at me

Yesterday when i was handsome
I didn't know you
Yesterday how i was so dumb
I couldn't show you
Yesterdays gone and
Yesterdays gone and
Yesterdays calling at me

Yesterdays gone and
Yesterdays gone and
Yesterdays calling at me

Yesterday when i was handsome
Yesterday when i was handsome
Yesterday when i was handsome
Yesterdays gone and
Yesterdays gone and
Yesterdays calling at me

Yesterdays gone and
Yesterdays gone and
Yesterdays calling at me
