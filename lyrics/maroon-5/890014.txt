Come talk with me
Take off your coat
Sit down for awhile
Stick around for awhile


It's been a long year
My luck is down
Think i'll skip town for awhile
To search for a smile

You look so nice
You shine just like an angel
But i'm sure that you must get that all the time

Have you heard that new song on the radio?
It reminds me of us
But i forget how it goes

Its been a long week
My mind is tired
I think i'll sit down for a while
Settle down for a while
You look so nice
You shine just like the morning
And at 9pm you glow just like the night

As all these weeks roll by i wonder why
You won't talk with me why
Why does it make me crazy when i know
You're coming down down down
You're coming down down down down down

You won't see me
You won't leave me
Leave me where i am i know

You won't see me
You won't leave me
Leave me where i am

As all these weeks roll by i wonder why
You won't talk with me why
Why does it make me crazy when i know
You're coming down down down
You're coming down down down down down

As all these weeks roll by i wonder why
You won't talk with me why
Why does it make me crazy when i know
You're coming down down down
You're coming down down down down down

Come talk with me
Take off your coat
Sit down for a while
Stick around for a while
