The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go
So won't you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make 'em turn their heads
Every place we go
So won't you please


(Be my be my baby) be my little baby
(I want it only say) say you'll be my darling
(Be my be my baby) be my baby now
(I want it only say) ooh, oh, oh, oh

I'll make you happy, baby
Just wait and see
For every kiss you give me
I'll give you three
Oh, since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you
Till eternity
So won't you please

(Be my, be my baby) be my little baby
(I want it only say) say you'll be my darling
(Be my, be my baby) be my baby now
(I want it only say) ooh, ohh, ohh, ohh, oh

So come on and please
(Be my, be my baby) be my little baby
(I want it only say) say you'll be my darling
(Be my, be my baby) be my baby now
(I want it only say) ooh, ohh, ohh, oh

(Be my, be my baby) be my little baby
(I want it only say) ooh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh
(Be my, be my baby) oh-oh-oh, ooh
(I want it only say) oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
