You left me hanging from a thread
We once swung from together
I lick my wounds but I can't
Never see them getting better
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same


Her hair was pressed against her face
Her eyes were red with anger
Enraged by things unsaid
And empty beds and bad behaviour
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged, oh

I'm sorry, I did not mean
To hurt my little girl
It's beyond me, I cannot carry
The weight of a heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right, yeh
Whoa, oh

The room was silent as we
All tried so hard to remember
The way it feels to be alive
The day that he first met her
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same

You make me think of someone wonderful
But I can't place her
I wake up every morning
Wishing one more time to face her
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged, oh

I'm sorry, I did not mean
To hurt my little girl
It's beyond me, I cannot carry
The weight of a heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right

So much to love
So much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you, oh
I know I can be closed
But I try my best to reach you

I'm so sorry, I did not mean
To hurt my little girl
It's beyond me, I cannot carry
The weight of a heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right, yeh
Whoa, oh…
Yeah…
