You say you need someone
But everybody does
I'm no different than you
I just believe what I do
You point your finger at
Everyone but yourself
And blame the ones that you love
Who're only try'n to help


As it's winding down to zero
I am yours like a hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever,
Forever, forever, forever

5,4,3,2,1 I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

I have no time for fear
Or people in my ear
Head down and running so fast
Try not to dwell on the past
I'm fighting through this pain
And things I cannot change
Running right into the flame
Rather than running away

As it's winding down to zero
I am yours like a hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever,
Forever, forever, forever

5,4,3,2,1 I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

Sweat drips down from every angle
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
You turn up the heat
Tossin' and turnin', you cannot sleep
Quietly weep, your in too deep

5,4,3,2,1 I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

5,4,3,2,1 I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all
