The crowd was getting old
The disco's back or so i'm told
There's really nothing here
Except a pair of tired ears and we say
Hey mama
I'm something
Check it out
See what it's all about cause this is
Soap disco
So charming
See the floor from a cleaner point of view
The kid's were set to go
We're rockin' new to something old
Just look around the scene and you'd see
Bright lights and
Clean colors
Check it out
See what it's all about cause this is
