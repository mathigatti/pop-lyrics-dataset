Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in


But things just get so crazy
Living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road
Get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you
Someday

That maybe all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
And back and forth we sway
Like branches in a storm
Change of weather
Still together when it ends

That maybe all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Yeah, oohh yeah

But things just get so crazy
Living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling
And I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it will bring me back to you
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
You may not know

That maybe all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow, yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

There's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair

Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Whoa, yeah
