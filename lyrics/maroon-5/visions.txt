I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this déjà vu


It's like I'm never riding solo
I feel you walking in my shadow
Never hit me quite like that though
'Cause now I'm under your spell

Late nights and I can't sleep
Choked up and I can't breathe
No one that can save me
'Cause now I'm under your spell

I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this déjà vu
Even in my darkest hour
Even when I know it can't be true
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you

Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
(I keep seeing visions of you)

I keep saying that I'm okay
They never go so I pray
Dear Lord, I hope that one day I
I get you out of my head

Late nights and I can't sleep
Choked up and I can't breathe
No one that can save me
'Cause now I'm under your spell

I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this déjà-vu
Even in my darkest hour
Even when I know it can't be true
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you

Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
(I keep seeing visions of you)

You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
This is just love playing tricks on my eyes
You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
Why can't I seem to let go?
You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
This is just love playing tricks on my eyes
You're a mirage
It's all in my mind
Why can't I seem to let go?

I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
I keep getting stuck in this day
Stuck in this déjà vu
Even in my darkest hour
Even when I know it can't be true
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you

Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
I keep seeing visions of you

Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
Ooh ooh oh-oh
I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you
