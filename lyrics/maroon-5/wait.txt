Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh


Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times
(All those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you
(Begging you)

Wait
Can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait
Can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait
Can you come here please?
'Cause I wanna be with you

Wait
Can you turn around, can you turn around?

Can you come here please?
'Cause I wanna be with you

Can we talk for a moment?
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holding on
Wasn't tryin' to get wasted
I needed more than three or four to say this, oh

Let me apologize, yeah
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times
(All those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you
(Begging you)

You say I'm just another bad guy
You say I've done a lot of things I can't undo
Before you tell me for the last time, yeah
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin' you

Wait
Can you turn around, can you turn around?
