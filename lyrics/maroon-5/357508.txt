Oh Vanessa holding up time with her beautiful velvet eyes 
She danced in the rained, got lost in our games 
Turned our backs to the world at night 
Fell asleep in the grass 


Watch out for the passing, of seasons 
As days take our innocence 
We curled up in safe 
But we cannot breach 
The summer too soon for Vanessa 

oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh 
oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh 
oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh 
oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh 

She's beautiful before she starts to cry 
How many stars reflected in her eye 
Vanessa 

oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh 
oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh 
oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh 
oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh 

She's beautiful when she starts to cry 
How many stars reflected in her eye 
Vanessa 

oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh 
oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh 
oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh 
oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
