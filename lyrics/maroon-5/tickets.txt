She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along, like there's no tomorrow


It's funny how you say that you made it on your own
When you haven’t worked for anyone your daddy didn't know
You say ya got a job but I don't know what you do
Such a fucking snob that you'll never know the truth
You’re perfect on the outside but nothing at the core
It’s easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, ‘cause you’ll never have my heart
But your perfect little body make, make, makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body make, make, makes me fall apart

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
Singing along, like there's no tomorrow

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I know you want to stay, but I think that you should go
'Cuz you got nothing to say, you just sit there on your phone
I tried not to give in, but temptation has me lost
So I will do my best to get, get, get, get, get you off
You’re perfect on the outside but nothing at the core
It’s easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, ‘cause you’ll never have my heart
But your perfect little body make, make, makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body make, make, makes me fall apart (yeah)

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody who wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along, like there's no tomorrow

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Yeah, she's got tickets to her own show
But nobody who wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along, like there's no tomorrow
She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody who wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along, like there's no tomorrow

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
