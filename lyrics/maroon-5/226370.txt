KARA'S FLOWERS
"Captain Splendid"


Nobody cares
bout ocean affairs
He's by himself 'cause nobody loves him
Cleaning his sand
Filled boots with his hand
Looking for something but nothing sees him

Happy was he
in spite of his knee
That wasn't there because of his day job
There was a man
who took to the band
paying attention tried to adhere him

And he ran
And he shot
But his rivals were sharp
And the kids
in the sand
struggled finding a plan

Seemingly fine
he sipped on his wine
Terror was healthy but not on a mission

There was a sea
A mystical tease
Our cannons were shot
'til we couldn't afford them

Others would have died alone
Angels all worked free
Timeless fairs and sing-alongs
Speaking naturally

And he ran
And he shot
But his rivals were sharp
And the kids
in the sand
struggled deep hand in hand
All the way
from the bay
We can hear them say
All the time
we were dead
And I'm Cap' Splendid

And he ran
And he shot
But his rivals were sharp
And the kids
in the sand
struggled deep hand in hand
All the way
from the bay
I could hear them say
I don't care
if we're dead
I am Captain Splendid
