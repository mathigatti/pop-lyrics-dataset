I have told
All of my enemies
Very polietly
To go home
I have seen
All of your remedies
Now won't you let me please
Go home?


I can't find anything to be sad about
They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine

I have tried
So very hard as hell
To stay away from hell
And live upstairs
But when I see
All of your remedies
I try quite desperately
To go home

I can't find anything to be sad about
They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine
But if I'm sitting here lonely with no one to hold me
At least I'll have my health
I'm trying to control myself

I have told
All of my enemies
Very polietly
To go home
I have seen
All of your remedies
Now won't you let me please
Go home?

I've been acting irresponsibly
But what could go possibly go wrong?
I have choked on all your remedies
Now won't you let me please
Go home?

But if I sit here lonely
With no one to hold me
At least I'll have my health
I'm trying to control myself

I'm trying to control

Myself
