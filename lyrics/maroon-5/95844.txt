I woke up this morning with the burden of love hanging over my
head as I
Walked into the living room
Sit with you, discuss whats going on
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something i forgot to do?
Tell me so that i understand


I just need some time
Gather all my thoughs
To make up for the love i just lost
You've been so good to me given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me

I woke up this mornign with the hurting that i would never ever
wish upon
Even my worst enemy
Who is she, what the hell do you people want?
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something i forgot to do?
Tell me so that i understand

I just need some time
Gather all my thoughs
To make up for the love i just lost
You've been so good to me given me everything
