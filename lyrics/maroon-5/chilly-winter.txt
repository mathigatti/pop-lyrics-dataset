You have been gone for so long
Don't know if you're ever coming back
Who knows if you'll ever come around again?


Baby, it's so cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York
Cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York, oh

I get so hungry
But what I got is not enough
Don't got any money
No fancy car, no sexy scars
But I, I do have something
That you want
And I'd love you till I crumble to the ground
Yeehoo

You have been gone for so long
Don't know if you're ever coming back
Who knows if you'll ever come around again?

Baby, it's so cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York
Cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York, oh

You have been gone for so long
Don't know if you're ever coming back
Who knows if you'll ever come around again?

Baby, it's so cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York
Cold
Where you are
Another chilly winter in New York, oh
