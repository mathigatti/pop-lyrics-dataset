I never knew perfection 'til
I heard you speak, and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things


Now waking up is hard to do
And sleeping's impossible too
Everything's reminding me of you
What can I do?

It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break

A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane

The city looks so nice from here
Pity, I can't see it clearly
While you're standing there it disappears
It disappears

It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break

Saw you sitting all alone
You're fragile and you're cold, but that's all right
Life these days is getting rough
It knocks you down and beats you up
But it's just a rollercoaster anyway

It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break, baby
