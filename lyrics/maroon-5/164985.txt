You let me violate you,
you let me disgraces you
You let me complicate you, you let me penetrate you.


(Ohhhhhhho)

Help me, don't pop out my inside.
Help me, got no soul to sell.

Help me, the only thing that works for me.
Help me, get away from myself.

I wanna fuck you like an animal.
I wanna feel you from the inside.

And I wanna fuck you like an animal.
My whole existence is flood,
you bring me closer to god.

You can't help my isolation, you can't help the hate it brings,

You can't help my absent of faith,
You can't help my everything.

Help me, turn on my reason. Help me, sex I can smell.
Help me, you make me perfect shape.
Help me, think I'm somebody else.

I wanna fuck you like an animal.
I wanna feel you from the inside.
I wanna fuck you like an animal.

My whole existence is flood, you bring me closer to god.
