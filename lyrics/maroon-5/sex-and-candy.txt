Hangin' round downtown by myself
And I had so much time
To sit and think
About myself
And then there she was
Like double cherry pie
Yeah there she was
Like disco superfly


I smell sex and
Candy here
Who's there lounging
In my chair
Who's there casting
Devious stares
In my direction
Mama this surely
Is a dream

Hangin' 'round downtown by myself
And I had too
Much caffeine
And I was thinkin' 'bout myself
And then there she was
In platform double suede
Yeah there she was
Like disco lemonade

I smell sex and
Candy here
Who's there lounging
In my chair
Who's there casting
Devious stares
In my direction
Mama this surely
Is a dream
Mama this surely
Is a dream
Yeah mama this must
Be my dream
