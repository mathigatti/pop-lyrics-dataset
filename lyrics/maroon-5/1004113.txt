Do you mean all the things you are?
Are you pleased with the way things are?
Wear that dress to protect this scar,
That only I have seen.


Do you give just to please yourelf?
Do you wish you were somewhere else?
Justified all the things you tried,
said that it was all for me.

And be near,
Just for the moment,
Stay here,
Never go home.

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true,
It comes true.

Have you learned all the secrets yet?
Will you burn by the things I've said?
Took the dive just to feel alive,
but never heard the truth.

Now I'm in love but I don't know how
I'm in pain cause I want it now
As I sit watching her eyes close,
I slowly open mine.

And be near,
Just for the moment,
Stay here,
Never go home.

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true, comes true.

I am so confused by this.
I know that life is hit or miss.
Days are stung by too much sun,
I think that you may be the one.

Cover yourself up in me,
Shrouded in what could have been.
I will listen to your pain,
if you listen to me.

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true,
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
And I know, the story of a broken heart comes True, 
Come true, 
True, 
It comes true, 
True.
