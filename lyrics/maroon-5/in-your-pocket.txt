No love, no love, no, no
Say what you're crying at me for, me for
Try to control your ego
That's not the way you show love, show love
No love, no love, no, no

But nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you
I never ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl

It should be really easy
If you have nothing to hide
