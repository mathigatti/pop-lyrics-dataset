This relationship is over,
Though my stomach still hurts.
And now I'm gonna live alone,
Why is the pain much worse?
Look so much better without make up,
Why would you hide your face?
Don't wanna spend the night and wake up,
Realise we've made a big mistake.


I cannot refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
I'll pretend like I dont care.
It hurts so much to know the truth,
But I'm still in love with you.

I never meant to keep you waiting,
And now your food is getting cold,
I keep denying I'm in love with you,
My routine is getting old.
And now you're stand in front the table,
You say you never look back.
Do something stupid when you're angry,
You only wake up sad.

I cannot refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
I'll pretend like I dont care.
It hurts so much to know the truth,
But I'm still in love with you.

No more kisses on your lips, or tender touches please,
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees.
All the cuts you gave me open up and start to bleed,
And I just cant get over you, and still you're over me.

I cannot refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight.
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
I'll pretend like I dont care.
It hurts so much to know the truth,
But I'm still in love with you.
