Baby, it's not alright,
The second that you turn your back she'll me outta sight
Baby, she'll break your heart,
The second that you spend the night apart


How could you do it?
Oh, how could you walk away
From everything we made
How could you do it?
Oh you better watch yourself
I think that girl's insane

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's a like cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

Baby, she'll eat alive,
As soon as she smells your blood in the water
You better run to survive,
Before she makes you her latest slaughter

How could you do it?
Oh, just come back to me,
Baby, I'm begging please
How could you do it?
Oh she knows I love you still,
You're just a ladies killer

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's a like cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

[Instrumental]

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's a like cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's a like cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller
