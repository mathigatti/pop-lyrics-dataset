What am I supposed to do with this time?
It tears so many holes, I stay afloat but I
Feel out of control, so petrified,
I'm petrified


What am I supposed to do to get by
Did I lose everything I need to survive?
Cause at 4 a.m. when the sweat sets in
Did you get my message, did it send,
Or did you just get on with your life?
Oh..

I've taken time and thinking I don't think it's fair for us
To turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling and I've finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and run away,
Run away

What am I supposed to do with these clothes?
It's my twisted way of keeping you close
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message, did it send,
Or do you get along on your own?

I've taken time and thinking I don't think it's fair for us
To turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling and I've finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and run away,
Run away

It breaks me down when I see your face
You look so different but you feel the same
And I do not understand, I cannot comprehend
The chills your body sends
Why did it have to end?

I've taken time and thinking I don't think it's fair for us
To turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling and I've finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and run away,
Run away

I've taken time and thinking I don't think it's fair for us
To turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling and I've finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around and run away,
Run away

Run away, run away (runaway)
Turn around and run away, run away (runaway)
Run away, run away (runaway)
But I can't tell you if you run away, run away (runaway)
Turn around and run away, run away (runaway)
