Is everything just right?
Don't want you thinking that I'm in a hurry
I won't stay afraid
I had this vision that has got me worried
Cause everyone wants someone
That's one clich√© that's true
But since you I want no one
Unless that someone's you


It looks like you, feels like you, smiles like you
I want someone just like you, true and through
I'm forever blue cause there's no one else like

I hope that you're not mad
You always said you want a man of passion
I'm not the hottest left, no
There's more than liking physical attraction
You've got your special someone
But between me and you, guess who
Was spending my whole life waiting for someone just you

It looks like you, it feels like you, it smiles like you
I need someone just like you, love me true
I'm forever blue cause there's no one else like
I want you in my heart, I see you in my dreams
I'm gonna make you mine, as crazy as it seems
Just you, yes you, you

I need someone just like you, love me true
I'm forever blue cause there's no one else.
There's no one else.
There's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
I need your help

'Cause you're so far, you're so far
'Cause you're so far, you're so far
'Cause you're so far
'Cause you're so far
'Cause you're so far
You're so far
You're so far
You're so far
