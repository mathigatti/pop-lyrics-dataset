This has not been easy?
This has been hard
I am scared
And I do not know what to do with you


Go inside, kiss your mouth with my lips
Grab your hips, cant remember why I fell in love with this

I miss you, I love you
Its a shame you cant stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You wont be getting my affection again oh no,
I dont need you

Who do you think you are?
No one cares about a name without a face
So dont go shooting up the place
Make no mistake, it love's not real
Cause the love I got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever feel

And I miss you, I love you
Its a shame you cant stay away from me this time oh no
You beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You wont be getting my affection again oh no
'Cause I dont need you tonight

It was really nice to know you
But, theres nothing left to show you
Got bills to pay get out the way its time to move on
And even with your boyfriend, will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him

I miss you, I love you
Its a shame you cant stay away from me this time oh no
You beg me you ask me
To kiss you and hug you
You wont be getting my affection again
So oh no, I dont need you
I miss you, I love you
Its a shame you cant stay away from me this time oh no
You beg me, you ask me to
To kiss you and hug you
You wont be getting my affection again
Cause oh no, I dont need you
