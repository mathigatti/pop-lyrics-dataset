She was at home and feeling fine
The family life it was divine
She sat alone with tired eyes
patiently listening to the sighs


I found out
I found out
She never has the time
I found out
to make his demons

They snatched her willingly she left
They wondered why she'd accepted that
She knew that she'd be saved but how
She knew that future kid was on the prowl

I found out
I found out
We could both run wild
I found out
me and future's child

I found out
I found out
We could both run wild
I found out
Me and future's child
I found out
Never's far too long
for me to sing this song
