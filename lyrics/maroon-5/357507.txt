The day is done 
And everyone has spent the summer day out in the rain 
Has wandered into someone else's lane 
You know exactly what I mean 


I bet everyone 
Has felt the sun 
We all have fallen, picked up to the day 
You know we've all been several minutes late 
You know exactly what I mean 

If you believe in everything you see 
In everything you read 
That's not me 
And I have this feeling no one knows me 

Today was fun 
For everyone 
We all have had our problems of our own 
We've all been sitting waiting by the phone 
You know exactly what I mean 

If you believe in everything you see 
In everything you read 
That's not me 
And I have this feeling no one knows me 

And if today were any other day 
I promise that I would wrestle the Powers That Be 
But I have this feeling no one knows me 

If you believe in everything you see and everything you read 
That's not me 
And I have this feeling 
And if today were any other day 
I promise that I would wrestle the Powers That Be (Powers That Be) 
And I have this feeling no one knows me
