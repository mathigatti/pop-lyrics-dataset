It's not time for conversation, no
I don't wanna complicate this for you
And I leave them other girls alone
If you'll be the one that I come home to


All of my love, all of my love
My time, my attention, my patience, I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No, this ain't the way that I usually play this, no, no

Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you?

Is it real, is it fake?
Would you leave, would you stay?
Will the night turn into day?
Will we get closer? Or will it be over?
I'm only hoping I don't waste, I don't waste

All of my love, all of my love
My time, my attention, my patience, I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No, this ain't the way that I usually play this, no, no

Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you?

If I bet my heart on you

It's not time for conversation, no
I don't wanna complicate this for you
And I leave them other girls alone
If you'll be the one that I come home to

Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you?

If I bet my heart on you
If I bet my heart on you
