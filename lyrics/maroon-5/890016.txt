Hello 
Where do you wanna go? 
Down to Mexico 
For a while? 


I find 
Here in the sunshine 
Everything's so fine 
Talked down by the world 

Someone told me long ago 
It feels the best when you take it slow 
Cos when it's 90 degrees and you're feeling alone 
It's like a cold drink for your mind 

Don't stop 
Fighting off rain drops 
Taking a turn style 
To the sun 

I find 
Here in the sunshine 
And you look so fine 
When you take it slow 

Someone told me long ago 
It feels the best when you take it slow 
Cos when it's 90 degrees and you're feeling alone 
It's like a cold drink for your mind

It's like a cold drink for your mind 
It's like a cold drink for your mind 
It's like a cold drink for your mind 
It's like a cold drink for your mind 
It's like a cold drink for your mind 
It's like a cold drink for your mind 
*Fades*
