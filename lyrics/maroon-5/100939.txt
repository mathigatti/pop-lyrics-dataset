She was a bad thing coming,
But I did not know.
And everytime I came over she told me I had to go.
I said "Hey, what's going on? I really want to know."
She said "I cannot tell you now, but I'll call you tomorrow."
That's not enough.
I want more.
I want it all.
I want to bang on your front door.
Turn off the lights
And shut out the world.
Cause at the end of the day,
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Yeah
She's snake me with sophisication,
So much class.
She drinks a Santa margarita,
Would you like a glass?
I don't know how to say no
And after three or four,
I was on the floor,
Singing my song,
La la la
No no.
That's not enough.
I want more.
I want it all.
I want to bang on your front door.
Turn off the lights
And shut out the world.
Cause at the end of the day,
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Yeah...
La la la.
No no.
That's not enough.
I want more.
I want it all.
I want to bang on your front door.
Turn off the lights
And shut out the world.
Cause at the end of the day,
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Aren't we all just boys and girls? (all just boys and girls)
Oh yeah. Oh
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Yeah... oh.
