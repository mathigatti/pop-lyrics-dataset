I count the ways I let you down
On my fingers and toes but I'm runnin’ out
Clever words can’t help me now
I keep you tight but you're slipping out


And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissin’ your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)
It’s drippin’ from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, whoa (bye bye, bye bye)
It’s drippin’ from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)

Oh, yeah
When did the rain become a storm
When did the clouds begin to form
Yeah, we got knocked off course by a natural force and we'll
We'll be swimmin’ when it’s gone

And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissin’ your tears goodnight
And I cant take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)
It’s drippin’ from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)
Your beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)
It’s drippin’ from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)

Oh, yeah
All the pain you try to hide shows through your mascara lines
As they stream down from your eyes
Let ‘em go
Let ‘em fly
Holding back wont turn back time
Believe me, I've tried

An your eyes were so bright
I remember your eyes were so bright
I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you
How in love were we that night
And now I'm kissin’ your tears goodnight
And I can’t take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)
It’s drippin’ from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, whoa (bye bye, bye bye)
It’s drippin’ from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
