As we kicked around downtown waiting for the sun to rise
we watched the clouds
take the shape of a chevrolet
and the way that I'm feeling is the color of my lover's eyes
she caught me lookin' the other way
thinkin' finally of our better days


As she climbs her way
up to the top of me
we look down on everyone
and we proclaim that we
don't know how long we'll be
as we kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
and we'll be gone
into the sky and out of our minds
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time
wish us luck

trippin' on a flat tire
dial up the triple A
time is running out for our escape
so much for that chevrolet
eyes shut tight as we venture to another place
as we listen to the music play
I can't remember what I had to say

As she climbs her way
up to the top of me
we look down on everyone
and we proclaim that we
don't know how long we'll be
as we kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
and we'll be gone
into the sky and out of our minds
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time
wish us luck

As she climbs her way
up to the top of me
we look down on everyone
and we proclaim that we
don't know how long we'll be
as we kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
0and we'll be gone
into the sky and out of our minds
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time
wish us luck
