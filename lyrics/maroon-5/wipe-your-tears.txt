Sabali! Sabali! Sabali yonkontê.
Sabali! Sabali! Sabali kayi.


Ni kêra môgô...

I'm afraid that I gotta do, but I gotta do.
But if I let you go, where you gonna go?
We gotta make it change, time to turn the page.
Something isn't right, I don't wanna fight ya.
We've been through couple times, you know it gets worse.
We can't turn this around, please let me be first.
And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt.
Something isn't right, I don't wanna fight ya.

Hey you, come on over and let me embrace you.
I know that I'm causing you pain too,
But remember, if you need to cry,
I'm here to wipe your eyes.

Tonight, before your fall asleep,
I'll run my thumb across your cheek.
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes.
I know, I made you feel this pain,
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay.
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes.

Sabali! Sabali! Sabali yonkontê.
('Cause I'm here to wipe your eyes)
Sabali! Sabali! Sabali kayi.
Ni kêra môgô...

When did we cross the line,
How could we forget?
Why do we let the pressure get into our heads?
Your broken heart requires all of my attention,
'cause something isn't right, I don't wanna fight ya.

Hey you, come on over and let me embrace you.
I know that I'm causing you pain too,
But remember, if you need to cry,
I'm here to wipe your eyes.

Tonight, before your fall sleep,
I'll run my thumb across your cheek.
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes.
I know, I made you feel this pain,
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay.
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes.

Please don't lose your faith,
Don't worry 'cause I'm here
To keep you safe.
I promise
If you let me see your face,
That I won't let you down,
I won't let you down.
I'm here to wipe your eyes.

Tonight, before your fall asleep,
I'll run my thumb across your cheek.
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes.
I know, I made you feel this pain,
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay.
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes.

Oh nah nah oh nah nah nah nah
