People never change
They seem to stay the same
They wear different clothes
But play the same games


Many different ways
To say the same thing
Searchin for the right words
The ones that would make you stay

Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be
Yeah
And choosing theses words
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

Oh I'm not even really sure
Who made this mess
And who threw what punch
But I could not care less
All I know is that I'm here
And you are not, ohhh
Once I put this wasted pride aside
Nothin's all I got, ohhh

Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be
Yeah
And choosing theses words
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

Ohh
Somebody make it stop
Yeahh
And pick me up
And just dust me off, Ohh
The rainy day flood
Will drowned all this love
Trapped at the bottom now
Please dig me up

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry
