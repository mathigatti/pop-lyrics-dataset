So nice to see your face again
Tell me how long has it been
Since you've been here
(since you've been here)
You look so different than before
You're still the person i adore
Frozen with fear
All out of love but i take it from the past
All out of words cause i'm sure it'll never last


I've been saving
These last words
For one last miracle
But now i'm not sure
I can't save you
If you don't let me
You just get me like i've never been gotten before

Maybe it's a bitter wind
That chilled from the pacific rim
Brought you this way
(brought you my way)
Do not make me think of him
The way he touched your fragile skin
That haunts me every day
I'm out of love but i can't forget the past
I'm out of words but i'm sure it'll never last

I've been saving
These last words
For one last miracle
But now i'm not sure
I can't save you
If you don't let me
You just get me like i've never been gotten before
Like i've never been gotten before
So nice to see your face again
But tell me will this ever end
Don't disappear

I've been saving
These last words
For one last miracle
But now i'm not sure
I can't save you
If you don't let me
You just get me like i've never been gotten before
Like i've never been gotten before
