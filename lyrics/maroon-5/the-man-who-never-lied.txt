Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh


In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other like oh oh oh
We can't take it anymore-oh-oh

Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
Laughing at each other
Laughing at each other like oh oh oh
It isn't funny anymore-oh-oh

I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you'd with mine yesterday

I was the man who never lied oh oh oh
I was the man who never lied oh oh oh

Sometimes honesty is the worst police
Happy ever after, happy ever after
Let it go-oh-oh
You never need to know oh oh oh

I don't wanna be picking up all these
Tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces
Of your heart oh oh
Won't do it anymore oh oh

I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you'd with mine yesterday

I was the man who never lied oh oh oh
I was the man who never lied oh oh oh

(I was the, I was the)

In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
What am I doing in Hollywood Boulevard
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other screaming

I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you'd with mine yesterday

I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you'd with mine yesterday

I was the man who never lied oh oh oh
I was the man who never lied oh oh oh

Yeah
