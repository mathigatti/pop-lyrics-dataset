I have told of my enemies
Very politely 
To go home


I have seen 
All of you remedies 
Now won't you let me please 
Go home

I can't find anything to be sad about
They say I'm doomed but I feel fine

I have tried so very hard as hell
To stay away from home
And move upstairs
But when I see all your remedies
I tried quite desperately to go home

I can't find anything to be sad about 
They say I'm doomed 
But I feel fine

But if I'm sitting here lonely
With no-one to hold me 
At least I'll have my help 
I'm trying to control myself

I have told of my enemies
Very politely 
to go home

I have seen 
All of you remedies 
Now won't you let me please 
Go home

I've been acting irresponsibly 
What could possibly go wrong?
I have choked on all you remedies
Now wont you let me please go home

But if I sit here lonely 
With no-one to hold me 
At least I'll have my help
I'm trying to control myself
I'm trying to control 
Myself
