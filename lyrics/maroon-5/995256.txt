You're such a flirt, I know you hurt
And so do I, I empathise
I see you out, you never care
A conversation that we never share


But it's so strange, it's something new
Amazing feelings that I have for you
I close my eyes when I'm alone
Wonder what it'd be like to make you moan

I wanna give you something better
Than anything you've ever had
A stronger and a faster lover
The world will disappear so fast

Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don't stop it before it begins

So give it up, and don't pretend
And spread your arms and legs across the bed
And when you shake, you won't regret
The things I whisper in your ear
(What?) I said:

I wanna give you something better
(You wanna give me something better)
Than anything you've ever had
(Than anything I've ever had)
A stronger and a faster lover
(A stronger and a faster lover)
The world will disappear so fast
(Will disappear so fast)

Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don't stop it before it begins

I can't wait to take you home
Fingers through your hair
Kisses on your back
And scratch me with your nails

Save me from myself
Show me how to care
Get everything out
Dripping everywhere

Lipstick smeared all over your face
How much longer must we wait?

â€¦Don't think that I can wait

Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don't stop it before it begins (hey, yeh)

Sweet kiwi (wanna give you something better than this)
Your juices dripping down my chin (hey, yeh)
So please, let me (wanna give you something better than this)
Don't stop it before it begins

Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins
