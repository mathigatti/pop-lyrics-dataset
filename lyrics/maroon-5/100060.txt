Leaning on a tree trunk
Thinking all the same junk
Fallin in and out of a dream


Back and forth i'm swaying
I'm contemplating staying
Laying and decaying when i know i must leave

Where do i am when i shoot the breeze
How do i call myself at times like these

I need a simple kind of lovely
The thought is just a novelty

You can spend the whole time
Dangling from a grape vine
Standin underneath you when they cut you free

What about when the sun leaves
And what about all those bad dreams
Who will walk you back into reality

I wish this could be like this everyday
But i know that i could never live this way
Was just a simple kind of lovely
The memories will be okay

I wish things could be like this everyday
But i know i could never live this way
Was just a simple kind of lovely
And the memories will be okay

Was jus a simple kind of lovely
And the memories will be okay
