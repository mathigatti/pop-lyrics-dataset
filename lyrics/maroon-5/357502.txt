It's time to ask myself what is the deal 
To try and find someway to feel 
Because it can't be this lonely 
Can't be this lonely in here 


Slowly we all disappear 
There must be time to define this grave condition 
It won't be long, it won't be long 
It won't be long, it won't be long 

It's time to find out who it is that i am 
To scrape away the garbage I can 
Because it can't be this lonely 
Can't be this lonely in here 

Slowly we all disappear 
It won't be long, it won't be long 
It won't be long, it won't be long 

Well I'm lonely and I'm strung out 
Let me be cause I'm not alright 
This is only my condition 
And I may be another night 

Well I'm lonely and I'm strung out 
Let me be cause I'm not alright 
This is only my condition 
And I may be another night 

Well I'm lonely and I'm strung out 
Let me be cause I'm not alright 
This is only my condition 
And I may be another night
