I'm sipping champagne 'til we throw it up
I drinked enough for both of us
You talking way, way too fast for me now
So pour up everything to slow it all up
I talked about this "finally famous" lifestyle way back
Baby, when we was growing up
Made a few plays
Now everything that we talked about showing up
And I could chauffeur up
But I still get lost on the map to your heart
So far gone let's take it back to the start
To the part where we carved
Our name in the bark
Preserved all the feelings
Like it came in the jar
I guess like, ain't no picnic basket
You put four years and came out a bachelor
This time around has does me and you sound
'Cause, honestly, to me it sounds mixed and mastered
Right?


I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I’m searching for a song tonight
I’m changing all of the stations

I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
Now I can’t get over you
No, I just can’t get over you

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in you darkest time
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night

Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in you darkest time
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
