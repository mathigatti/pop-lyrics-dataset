somebody left me on the line
sitting on the other end for a long long time
and i don't know what to make of all of this


now that summer's here
things come rushing back
and all the tears are dry for now
and i'm singing along to the song
i heard for the first time this time last year

is it me or does it feel like july
cause my soul is as hot as the weather outside
and my passion for you has returned
like the color to my face
and i'm smiling again

now that the moment's arrived
live in it don't sit on it
it's real
and besides
when was the last time
you have been kissed like this

wasting time in the middle of the night
our bodies are tangled our lips wrapped tight
and i'm lost once again
in the rip tides of an unusual fate
but i'm smiling again
