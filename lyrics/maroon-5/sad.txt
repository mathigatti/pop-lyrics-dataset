Man, it's been a long day
Stuck thinking about it driving on the freeway
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
Not knowing if I should try a little harder


Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess that I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
And I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt cause I never gave you
The place that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad

Man, it's been a long night
Just sitting here, trying not to look back
Still looking at the road we never drove on
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one

Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess that I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
And I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt cause I never gave you
The place that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad

I'm so sad, so sad

Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess that I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
And I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
And I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
I'm so sad, sad
