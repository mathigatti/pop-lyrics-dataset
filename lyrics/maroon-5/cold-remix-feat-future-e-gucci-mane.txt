Baby, why you turn so cold on me? (Brr)
All the things that you said took a toll on me
Told me you would take the charge but you told on me
I thought that you rock with me but you rolled on me
How my best friend turn into my enemy?
I really love you, girl, but I don't need the energy
You broke my heart, girl and I can't find the remedy
Now me and you can't even be in the same vicinity
Your friends interferin', they should throw a penalty
And you can't see it but them bitches full of jealousy
You played yourself, you had the baller of the century

[Adam Levine]
Baby, tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

Are we taking time, or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me

Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Adam Levine &amp; Future]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Future]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna' cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space

[Adam Levine]
Baby, tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Adam Levine &amp; Future]
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold
