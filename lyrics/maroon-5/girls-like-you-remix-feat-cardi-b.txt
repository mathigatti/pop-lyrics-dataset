You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that Backwood, babe

Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe you're thinking it's better if you drive

Oh, 'cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down, when I come through

Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars
Knew it's really real if I let you meet my momma
You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazy
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call? Cardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden?
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit
The red light, red light stop (stop)
I don't play when it comes to my heart (let's get it though)
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage
I'm thinkin' more white Porsches and karats
I need you right here 'cause every time you call
I play with this kitty like you play with your guitar

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
