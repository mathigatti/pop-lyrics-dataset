Like a sunrise happening at 3am on a walk in the middle of the night 
You may not have a clue 
Something you just knew 
And something you were always dreaming of 


But tip your hand towards the sky and stand back while your tears get dry 
Happiness is always on the move 
You can wonder if it's warm inside but stay out 'til your feet get tired 
Watch out for that Shayanni suprise 

Just because we're waiting for the lottery 
Doesn't mean we can live our lives for free 
And I've seen illusions but Shayanni's suprise 
Got me right behind the eyes 

Even in the midst of all lifes' so pleasant gifts 
Someone out there's got it twice as bad 
So thank your lucky stars and take a look at who you are 
And never waste another day again 

Get a note upon your sleeve and read it out before you leave 
Because everybody loves a Valentine 
And you know just as well as I that we are all in pantomime 
Waiting for a Shayanni suprise 

Just because we're waiting fot the lottery 
Doesn't mean that we can live our lives for free 
I've seen illusions but Shayanni's suprise 
Got me right behind the eyes 

hoo hoo, hoo hoo, hoo hoo ho hoo 
hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo 

Just because we're waiting fot the lottery 
Doesn't mean that we can live our lives for free 
And I've seen illusions but Shayanni's suprise 
Got me right behind the eyes
