im so tied of hearing this
my heart is filling up with fear
and you dont even care
you just stare
pretending like u didnt do anything


CHORUS

i know what your doing
just tell me
my heart is still for you
i still love you
i hope you belive in me

im still here for you
after all youve done
you can still make up for it
but my love is almost gone

CHORUS
