Every day, people sway 
Softly lulling me to sleep 
I look the other way 
But i still can't look too deep 
I think i'll fall asleep 
I think i'll fall asleep 


So call up and tell him that you will survive 
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes 
You and me and everything's gonna be fine 

Every night, people fight 
Gently lulling me to sleep 
What gives me the right 
To waste away and weep 
I think i'll turn away 
There's nothing left to say 

So call up and tell him that you will survive 
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes 
You and me and everything's gonna be fine 
So you wanna have everything your heart desires 
There's a fist full of people with their hearts on fire 
Make your way on up to the front of the line 

Get out of my way 
I'm here now to stay 
Get out of my way 
I'm here now to stay 

So call up and tell him that you will survive 
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes 
You and me and everything's gonna be fine 
So you wanna have everything your heart desires 
There's a fist full of people with their hearts on fire 
Make your way on up to the front of the line
