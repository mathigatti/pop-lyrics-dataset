I really, I really
Whoa
I really need to know
I really, I really
Whoa
Or else, you gotta let me go, oh
I really, I really


This time I really need to do things right
The shivers that you give me keep me freezing all night
You make me shudder
I can't believe it, I'm not myself
Suddenly I'm thinking about no one else
You make me shudder

I really, I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go

You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always

I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always

Give me affection
I need your perfection
You feel so good, you make me stutter, stutter

If I could touch you I would never let go
Now you got me screaming and I can not shut up
Oh, now I'm lying on the bedroom floor
Barely even speaking and I can not get up

And I really, I really, I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go, oh

You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always

I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always

Give me affection
I need your perfection
'Cause you feel so good, you make me stutter

I really, stutter, I really, stutter, stutter
You knock me down, I can't get up, I'm stuck
Gotta stop shaking me up
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't think, sinking under
I'm sinking under

You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always

I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always

You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always

Give me affection
I need your perfection

'Cause, you feel so good, you make me stutter,

I really, I really, You make me stutter
I really, I really, You make me stutter.
