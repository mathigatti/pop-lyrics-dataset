I'm happy you came to me first
Before the bubble burst
I'm happy you answered my calls
I'm bouncing off the walls
Impossible to be tamed
Her leads cellophane
I'm happy you like to play games
Why did you run away?


We could spend sometime together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So lets figure it out let's go

I'm happy you're so impulsive
Means that your passionate
I'm happy you're moving so fast
But will it ever last
I know you wanna break free
From this but not me
I'm happy you're coming with me
But by choice it's gotta be

We could spend sometime together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So figure it out let's go

I'm happy you're changing your speed
Slow down and lay with me
On bottom but always discrete
Kneel down and kiss her feet
I'm happy your going to far
Full strength before we start
Sometimes you make it so hard
Scream loud as we come apart

We could spend sometime together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So figure it out let's go

We could spend some time together
What he has he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So figure it out lets go
Figure it out let's go
Figure it out let's go
Figure it out let's
Go
