Danced all night
Slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games


You don't cry
You don't care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?

Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

Weather on a sunny day
Time slows down, I wish you'd stay
Pass me by in crowded, dark hallways

Try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

I heard you say you needed me now
What's the problem I can't see
You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart

Take what you want
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?

Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

I heard you say you needed me now
What's the problem I can't see
You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart
