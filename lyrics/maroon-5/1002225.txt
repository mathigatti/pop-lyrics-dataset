Making love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines in her smile
Something is not right


Where are you hiding (hiding)
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying (crying)
Just another crazy boy
Hungry for your

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and i
Feel the never need to
Go back to the way i was
The way i was

I tried and tried and tried and tried
But i have no concept of consequence
And i'm a master of self defence
Days get longer
Life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh dripping from head to toe

Where are you hiding (hiding)
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying (crying)

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and i
Feel the never need to
Go back to the way i was
The way i was

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and i
Feel the never need to
Go back to the way i was
The way i was

I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love
It was yours to take
Break down your door
Take a little more
When i need you around

And i'm so terrified of leaving
It's a new low
Try and pick me up again but
Let go see how far i get without you
Desperately need more of your

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and i
Feel the never need to
Go back to the way i was
The way i was

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and i
Feel the never need to
Go back to the way i was
The way i was
