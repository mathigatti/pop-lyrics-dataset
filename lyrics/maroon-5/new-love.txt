I'll be sunday moon tonight
I can be whatever you like
I was alone but I met it a few
I wanna show you my feelings are real, yeah
All this time I've been living it up
And every night I'd be falling in love
But I'm finally seeing the light
Falling in love with you every night
Yeah


But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me now
But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me
This is a new love
This is a new love
This is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me

What the fuck, I got nothing to lose
I'm a slave of the way that you move
I'm an addict for all that you do
You're the only drug I wanna do yeah
I can tell that you're needing my love
And all I want is to give it to you
And don't give up on the moment tonight
You'll regret for the rest of your life

But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me now
But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me
This is a new love
This is a new love
This is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me

I still don't get it
'Cause if you don't know it yet
You'll know that I'm not your enemy, your enemy, yeah
'Cause I know I lie
And it wouldn't kill you child
Won't go until you've forgiven me, forgiven me
Till you forgiven me, forgiven me, forgiven me

But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me now
But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me
This is a new love
This is a new love
This is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me
