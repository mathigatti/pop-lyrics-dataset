What do I do to ignore what's behind me?
Do I follow my fate to escape blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I let it go and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust none and live life in loneliness?
Because sunlight burns the skin of sleeping men
I make the right turns but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself


I can't hold on
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To anything watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I
Turn my back I'm defenseless
And to give in to fate seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on then they'll
Take from me till everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer
(By myself)

How do you think I've lost so much
I'm so afraid I'm now out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to

Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside
