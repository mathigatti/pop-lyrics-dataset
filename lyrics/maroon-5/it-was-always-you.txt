Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning


Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my whole life we’ve never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize

It was always you
Can’t believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you

Now I know why my heart wasn’t satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
Now I’m guessing who
Looking by now I know it was always you, always you

All my hidden desires finally came alive
Know I never told a lie to you so why would I start tonight

Hazel eyes, I was so colorblind
We were just wasting time
For my whole life we’ve never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize

It was always you
Can’t believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you

Now I know why my heart wasn’t satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking by now, I know it was always you, always you

(Ah, yeah, you, you, you, always you, you, you)
(Ah, yeah, you, you, you, always you, you, you)

Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling

It was always you
Can’t believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you

Now I know why my heart wasn’t satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking by now, I know it was always you, always you

It was always you
