Good at being gone
I've taken time to think about the words i said
And what they mean
And i've realized having you is just like having everything
When i see you dancing there
I get up and i throw my hands up in the air
When i have nowhere else to roam
I slowly start to think about coming home
It's been so long
Seems the only things i know
Are far from home
Where did i go?
It seems sometimes i'm only good at being gone
When i see you dancing there
I get up and i throw my hands up in the air
When i have nowhere else to roam
I slowly start to think about coming home
When i see you standing there
I get up and i throw my hands up in the air
When i have nowhere else to roam
I slowly start to think about coming home
When i have nowhere else to roam
I slowly start to think about coming home
When i have nowhere else to roam
I slowly start to think about coming home
