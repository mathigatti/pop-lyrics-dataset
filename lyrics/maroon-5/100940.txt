Slow is the memory
And I can picture her standin' right in front of me
Said that I'm behaving badly
And kind of driving her crazy,
But I know she wants me


I remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane
And sitting on top of me, yelling out my fucking name
Until I'm empty
But I know she wants me

But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry, yeah
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else’s tears
You let me down now I'm hanging you out to dry

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax, you know you want me

All the time and everywhere
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear

But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else's tears
Let me down now I'm hanging you out to dry

'Cause sometimes I don't know what to do
I'm scared to stand right in front of you
The way our pain subsides
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
In fact you may just wanna run away
Now all that I can really say is baby oh
Deep down you know, yeah

But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else’s tears
You let me down now I'm hanging you out to dry

...already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
I’m drowned in someone else’s tears
You let me down now I'm hanging you out to dry

Oh, no, no, Oh, no, no

You dry
