How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step cause if I do you'll need a miracle


You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
This double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to funkin' tread the ground I'm walking on

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there?
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday, will do you like I did?

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there?
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill?
Does it burn?
Is it painful to learn?
That it's me that has all the control

Does it thrill?
Does it sting?
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there?
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
