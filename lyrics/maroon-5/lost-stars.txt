Please don't see
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me
Reaching out for someone I can see


Take my hand
Let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans
Sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned
Cupid's demanding back his arrow

So let's get drunk on our tears

And God, tell us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season
And the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?

Who are we?
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?
Woe is me
If we're not careful, turns into reality

But don't you dare
Let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday
I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page
Maybe we'll find a brand new ending

Where we're dancing in our tears

And God, tell us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season
And the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same

God, give us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season
And this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying

But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up dark?

But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up dark?
