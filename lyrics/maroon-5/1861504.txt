I won't let anybody hurt you
And I'll stop them if they try to
Nobody knows you like I do baby
And I don't care where you run to
Because I am gonna find you
When the stars are all align we can try again.


(Wo-oah) Is anybody out there?
(Wo-oah) Can anybody see?
(Wo-oah) It seems like everything's gone crazy
(Wo-oah) You're exactly what I wanted
(Wo-oah) And exactly what I need
(Wo-oah) Don't need anybody but my baby

So where did all your love go?
You played me like a solo
Then you threw my broken heart away
And I know that we can make it
And more closer I can feel it
So stop fooling around and just stay

(Wo-oah) Is anybody out there?
(Wo-oah) Can anybody see?
(Wo-oah) It seems like everything's gone crazy
(Wo-oah) You're exactly what I wanted
(Wo-oah) And exactly what I need
(Wo-oah) Don't need anybody but my baby

[PJ Morton]
It's taking such a long time
To find what I've been looking for
And now that you are all mine
I never felt crying like this before
Still want more
Oh, you're reading my mind
Because it's so and you already know
You're all that I want and you're all that I needed

(Wo-oah) Is anybody out there?
(Wo-oah) Can anybody see?
(Wo-oah) It seems like everything's gone crazy
(Wo-oah) You're exactly what I wanted
(Wo-oah) And exactly what I need
(Wo-oah) Don't need anybody but my baby

(Wo-oah) Is anybody out there?
(Wo-oah) Can anybody see?
(Wo-oah) It seems like everything's gone crazy
(Wo-oah) You're exactly what I wanted
(Wo-oah) And exactly what I need
(Wo-oah) Don't need anybody but my baby
