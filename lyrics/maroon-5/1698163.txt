i just fell out of the sky
just like a comet
i've been busy chasing moonbeams just for you
when i come home
we can continue to talk about it
but for now
sh la la
i love you


i can tell you're looking for love
and you're gonna find it
while i'm busy chasing moonbeams just for you

when i come home
we can continue to scream and shout it
but for now
sh la la
i love you

whoa

i just fell out of the sky
just like a comet
i've been busy chasing moonbeams just for you
when i come home we can continue to talk about it
but for now
sh la la
i love you

we love you
we do
but why are you so blue?
lets get away and stare right at the sun
because it's dark out and i really need some fun
because it's dark out and i really need some fun
