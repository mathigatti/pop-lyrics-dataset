You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slammin' the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stop keepin' score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more


But, baby, there you go again, there you go again making me love you, uh
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head let it all go, ooh
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo, ooh
And now I'm feelin' stupid, feelin' stupid crawling back to you, ooh

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you no, but my body keeps on telling you yes
Try to tell you stop, but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
I'll be waking up feeling satisfied but guilty as hell

But, baby, there you go again, there you go again making me love you, ooh
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go, ooh
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo, ooh
And now I'm feelin' stupid, feelin' stupid crawling back to you, ooh

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Yeah, baby, give me one more night
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
Yeah, baby, give me one more night

Baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
