We filled the day with careless displays
Going sailing with nothing to say
When I fell
We could tell


Now you're torn apart
The sun's driving fast
Taking photographs
It's morning at last
And the sailors are taking a stand
With their heads buried deep in the sand

Feeling well
Life is swell
When I fell
We could tell
Hooray
When I fell
We could tell
Feeling well
Life is swell
