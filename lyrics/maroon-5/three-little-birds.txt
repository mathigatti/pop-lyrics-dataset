Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, oh


Rise up this morning
Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds
By my doorstep
Singing sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Saying: This is my message to you

Singing: Don't worry about a thing, oh
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah, yeah
Don't worry, oh, about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright, yeah
