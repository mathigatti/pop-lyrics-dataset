Oh yeah, oh, yeah

Hey you, don't want to love you on the telephone
You're hanging up and now I am all alone
Baby you got me doing dirt, doing dirt, doing dirt
And now I wanna find you but you're off the run
My heart's exploding like a burning sun
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts


Hold me we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up, when I get inside
So won't you touch me? cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up baby make it loud

Hey you, say that you're only having fun and then
You call me up at 3am again
Baby you got me doing dirt, doing dirt, doing dirt
And now all that I got is just a microphone
To let you know that I am all alone
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts

Hold me we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up, when I get inside
So won't you touch me? cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up baby make it loud

Yeah, come on

So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car let's go
Yeah let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home

So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car let's go
Yeah let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home

Hold me we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up, when I get inside
So won't you touch me? cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up baby make it loud
