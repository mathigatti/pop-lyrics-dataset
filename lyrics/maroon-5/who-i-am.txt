Hello, is this thing on? My man
See this one goes out to all the lovers
Lovers' lovers that is
Who spend their nights and days under covers
Girl, the sun could burn out, but you'll still shine
Aw, yeah


[Adam Levine]
No, don't ask me if I love you
'Cause I'm sure as the night is long
And don't ask me if I need you
'Cause I'm sure that the time will come

Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

Ooh ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
No, I do ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay ay

No, don't ask me if I love you
'Cause I'm sure as the day is gone
And don't ask me if I stay true
When you know you're the only one

Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

Ooh ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
No, I do ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay yeah

[LunchMoney Lewis]
Ya
Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you
Hug ya, hug ya, hug ya
Look into your eyes and I see the ocean
I ain't got no wings, but you got me floating on a cloud
Looking down, it's emotion
Champagne flutes, everybody toasting
Heart beat fast on this roller coaster
Love you up and down, spin you 'round and 'round
Can you hear me now?

[Adam Levine]
Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

Ooh ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
No, I do ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh
