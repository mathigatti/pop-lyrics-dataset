You keep me connected to you like I was your shadow
You're giving me answers to all of my questions here on my pillow, oh
Can't nothing get in between us, baby
We've been waiting on this moment for so long
You wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
Wait


When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

Just turn off the lights and you can be my private dancer
When we close the curtains
You and me can forget all our manners, oh
The neighbors must think that we're crazy, baby
'Cause look how easily we keep coming undone
You wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
Wait

When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me (through the night for me)
Baby, cry for me (baby, cry for me)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
