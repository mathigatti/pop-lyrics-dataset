I must have been a fool
To love you so hard for so long
So much stronger than before
But so much harder to move on
Now the bitter chill of the winter
Still moves through me like a plague
Only to wake up with an empty bed
On a perfect summer's day


My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself walking down the wrong side of the road, oh

I can't lie, you're on my mind, stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead,
I just die so much inside now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

I never did my best to express how I really felt
And now that I know exactly what I want
You've found somebody else

My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself walking on the wrong side of the road

I can't lie, you're on my mind, stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead,
I just die so much inside now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

My world just feels so cold
And I find myself thinking about the things I could have done
And it wounds my soul when you let me know
I'm not the only one

I can't lie, you're on my mind, stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead,
I just die so much inside now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

I can't lie, you're on my mind, stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead,
I just die so much inside now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
