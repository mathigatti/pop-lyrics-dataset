Put your hands all over
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over
Put your hands all over me


I can't seem to find the pretty little face I left behind
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a better place to call home
Gave her a place to stay
But she got up and ran away
And now I've had enough
That pretty little face has torn me up

Put your hands all over me
Please, talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything is gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please, walk with me, walk with me (now)
Love is a game, you say
Play me and put me away

Put your hands all over me

Now you've lost your mind, pretty little girl I left behind
I'm not yours, getting rough
but everybody knows you're not that tough
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a place to call your own
You're scared to death of the road ahead
You pretty little thing, don't get upset

Put your hands all over me
Please, talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything is gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please, walk with me, walk with me (now)
Love is a game, you say
Play me and put me away

Love is a game, you say
Play me and put me away

Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over me
Put your hands all over me

So come down off your cloud
Say it now and say it loud
Get up in my face
Pretty little girl, come make me day

Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Put your hands all over me
Gotta walk with me, walk with me (now)

Put your hands all over me
Gotta talk to me, talk to me
Put your hands all over me
Gotta walk with me, walk with me (now)

Love is a game, you say
Play me and put me away
Love is a game, you say
Play me and put me away

Put your hands all over
Put your hands all over me
