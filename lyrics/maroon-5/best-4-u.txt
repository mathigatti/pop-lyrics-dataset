I just want the best for you

Yeah, another night out
I get drunk, I get high
Then you call and I lie
And say I'm on my way now
Yeah, I say I'm on my way now
Show up when it's light out
When you're dressing for work
And I'm mumbling words
I don't know what to say now
No, I don't know what to say now


You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said "I'm sorry" maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt you if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

Parties with shots and powder, but
You'd rather sleep eight hours, and
I know you got your doubts, 'cause I
Can't turn this life around, baby
Thought it was just a phase, 'til I
Woke up a thousand days later
Realizing I'm the same as I was before I saw your face

You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt you if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh oh, baby
I just want the best for you

You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt you if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you (for you)
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through
I just want the best for you (just want the best for you)
I just want the best for you (just want the best for you)
But I'm just not the best for you (I'm not the best for you)
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through

Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put you through
Oh oh no, baby (yeah)
Oh oh no, baby (yeah)
Oh oh oh, baby
I just want the best for you

I just want the best for you
