So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper that they seem
You'd rather cover up I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be and I'll set you free oh yeah


I am in misery there ain't nobody who can comfort me
Oh, yeah
Why won't you answer me? The silence is slowly killing me
Oh, yeah
Girl, you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be and I'll set you free

I am in misery there ain't nobody who can comfort me
Oh, yeah
Why won't you answer me? The silence is slowly killing me
Oh, yeah
Girl you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna get you back

You say your faith is shakin' you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to run

Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah
Why do you do what you do to me yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah

I am in misery there ain't nobody who can comfort me
Oh, yeah
Why won't you answer me? Your silence is slowly killing me
Oh, yeah
Girl, you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad, you really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad, you really got me bad
