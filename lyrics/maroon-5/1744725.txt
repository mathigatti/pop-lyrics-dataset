Living inside my head, pulling my strings
Letting me think I'm in control
Giving you all my heart was a good start
But it turns out you want my soul


I don't know nothing about that
In fact, I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
Tell me what you really want
Cause I don't want to be
No, I don't want to be alone

Pushing me over the edge
Can't forget those things you've said
Cut to the bone
Go ahead, take your swing
What did you think?
I was just gonna roll over, oh nooo

I don't know nothing about that
In fact, I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
Got to tell me what you really want
Cause I don't want to be
No, I don't want to be alone

I've put myself on the line
I'm tired of wasting my time
There's got to be a reason why she will not go to me

I don't know nothing about that
In fact, I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong

I don't know nothing about that
In fact, I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
Tell me what you really want
Cause I don't want to be
No, I don't want to be alone
