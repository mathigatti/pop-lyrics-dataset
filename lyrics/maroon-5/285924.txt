All alone in my room, think of you at a rate that is truly alarming
I keep looping my memories of you in my head
I pretend that you want me


And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending when she still loves me

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about your love

Can't believe, I could think that she would just follow me everywhere I go
I just wrestle with you in my dreams and wake up making love to a pillow

And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending when she still loves me

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop, I can't stop

What I would give to have you look in my direction
And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention
And now I touch myself like it's somebody else
Thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind,
Let me show you

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about you

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about you
