Come with me
And you'll be in a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination


We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in a world of my creation
What you'll see will defy explanation

If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
You want to change the world
There's nothing to it

There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there you'll be free
If you truly wish to be

If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
You want to change the world
There's nothing to it

Come with me
And you'll be in a world of pure imagination
And you'll be in a world of pure imagination
And you'll be in a world of pure imagination
And you'll be in a world of pure imagination
in a world of pure imagination

There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there you'll be free
If you truly wish to be
