I'm getting kind of over this
I need a metamorphosis
Are you awake as me?
If not, do you wanna be?


Ooh, I need some temporary saving
Ooh, I need some, some uncomplicating

Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out

[Julia Michaels]
Help me out, 'cause I need something up to calm me down
Help me out, out

[Adam Levine]
I don't mean to bother you
But there's something that I want from you

[Julia Michaels]
Distract me from thinking too much
Loose ends all tied up with a touch

[Julia Michaels e Adam Levine]
Ooh, I need some temporary saving
Ooh, I need some, some uncomplicating

Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need something up to calm me down
Help me out, out

Hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When you, you need somebody to
Yeah, hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When, when you, you need somebody to
Help you out, help me out
Help me out, help me out, out

Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need something up to calm me down
Help me out, out

And hey, hey I know that there will come a day
When you, you need somebody to
Hey, hey I know that there will come a day
When, when you, you need somebody to
Help you out, help me out
Help me out, help me out, out
