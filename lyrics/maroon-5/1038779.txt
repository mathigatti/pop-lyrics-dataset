How you feelin?
The day has had its way with both of us
And no
I've gone out of my way
But I'm not free
From this pain I'm reelin
I was a fool to think someday you would come around
But no no no 
I'm not thinking that way
Cause now I see


You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wana scream

I think you should just go away cause
Theres no neccesity for you to stay yeah
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby 
you're not coming in

How's your day been? yeah
Cause mine has taken strange and lovely turns
But no no no 
I feel better today
Cause I'm off my knees

You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wanna scream, yeah

I think you should just go away cause
There's no neccesity for you to stay, yeah
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby
you're not comin in

a heart ready for a lot of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows
lock my doors
Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore
Yeah

I think you should just go away cause
There's no neccesity for you to stay yeah
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby
Your not comin in

A heart ready for a lot of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows
lock my doors
Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore
