I'm sick of picking up pieces
And second-guessing
My reasons why you don't trust me
Why must we do this to one another?


We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it's over

I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

Well I got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
Embrace the devil, so sly
You cannot hear'em coming

'Cause my defences are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take the evidence
And bury it somewhere

I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

Oh my, I don't mind
Being the other guy
Nice try, for these games
I do not have the time
If you want me, call me
Come and take a risk
Kiss me somewhere deep below the surface

I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
