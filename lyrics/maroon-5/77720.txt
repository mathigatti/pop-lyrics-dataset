Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do
Cause saying I love you
Has nothing to do with meaning it


And I don't trust you
Cause everytime you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think that you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Do you remember
The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you, oh
Cause I remember very well

And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you
And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you?

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through,
Called to let you know I'm through,
I called to let you know I'm through with you

I ain't ever coming back to you
