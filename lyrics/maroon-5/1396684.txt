Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes
Because you love me
So you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe cause you love me (yeah, you know it)


And then we tried - ain't feeling this love now
Because you weren't used to how fast
We touched (fast we touched)
And we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up 

And I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin (you know I love you babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I love you (you should stop frontin babe)

You trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl U love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gon' palm her ass like it was
She's gon love it (yeah)
And then we tried - ain't feeling this love now
Because you weren't used to how fast
We fucked
Then we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up (tear ya ass up)

And I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin (you know I love you babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I love you (you should stop frontin babe)
