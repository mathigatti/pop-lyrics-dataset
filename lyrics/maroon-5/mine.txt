You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk afraid of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts


I say can you believe it?
As we're lying on a couch
The moment i could see it
Yes, yes, i can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flashforward and we're taking on the world together
And there is a drawer of my things at your place
You learned my secrets and you figured out why i'm guarded
You said we'll never make my parents mistakes

But we've got bills to pay
We've got nothing figured out, yeah
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this what i thought about

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine, yeah

Do you remember that fight two thirty a.m. ?
Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
And i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Raised myself for goodbye
Cause that's all i ever know
And you took me by surprise
You said, you said, i'll never leave you alone

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine, yeah
That's ever been mine, oooh
That's ever been mine, yeah
That's ever been mine, yeah, yeah, yeaaah!
