Now, you've been bad
And it goes on and on and on
'Til you come home, babe, 'til you come home
Now, you taste best
The poison I've learned to love is gone
I'm all alone, babe, I'm all alone


I'm waiting for something
Always waiting, feelin' nothing
Wondering if it'll ever change

And then I give a little more, oh babe, ooh
Give a little more, oh babe, ooh

I'm not falling in love with you, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with you, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, babe, ooh
Get a little more from you, babe, oh

You were wrong
For turning me on and on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard

I'm waiting for something
Always waiting, feelin' nothing
Wondering if it'll ever change (if it'll ever change)

Then I give a little more, oh babe, ooh
Give a little more, oh babe, ooh

I'm not falling in love with you, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with you, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you babe, ooh
Get a little more from you babe, oh

I have no defense
I know you're gonna get me in the end
(Gonna get me in the end)
And I cannot pretend
I never want to feel this way again, ooh

I'm not falling in love with you, I'm not falling in love (not falling in love)
I'm not falling in love with you, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you babe, ooh oh
Get a little more from you babe, oh

I'm not falling in love with you, I'm not falling in love (not falling in love)
I'm not falling in love with you, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you babe, ooh oh
Get a little more from you babe, oh oh oh
