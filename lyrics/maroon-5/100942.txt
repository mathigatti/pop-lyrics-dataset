Here in this town they have all got the blues
As the paper boy takes off without any news
Angels have wings you can feel free to use
The corner store drugs you can freely abuse


And I'm yelling and screaming cause baby you're driving me crazy

So life on your own has been vacant and cold
Everyone's getting somewhere and you're getting old
Career opportunities they all have been sold
Along with your body and most of your soul

And I'm yelling and screaming cause baby you're driving me crazy
If I could spare more remorse from my emptied out pores I would maybe
Cause the fog's getting thicker the world's spinning fast
The chaos is building, it's going too last
And it's so hard to see and you're so hard to find
The days when I think I am losing my mind

So keep painting pictures of beautiful scenes
Striking the canvas with deep blues and greens
When you start frowning they think you're obscene
As you work overtime to make sure they can dream

I'm yelling and screaming cause baby you're driving me crazy
If I could spare more remorse from my emptied out pores I would maybe
Cause the fog's getting thicker the world's spinning fast
The chaos is building, it's going too last
And it's so hard to see and you're so hard to find
The days when I think I am losing my mind

And we yell and we scream
As the fog's getting thicker the world's spinning fast
The chaos is building, it's going to last
And it's so hard to see and you're so hard to find
The days when I think I am losing my mind

And the fog's getting thicker the world's spinning fast
The chaos is building, it's going to last
And it's so hard to see and you're so hard to find
The days when I think I am losing my mind
