You’re such a motivator
Got to get your way
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
You’re such an instigator
You wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that’s her, that’s her


And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rockin’
Keep me up all night
One in a million
My lucky strike

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me (yeah)
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Your body rockin'
Keep me up all night
One in a million
My lucky strike

Stuck in her elevator
She takes me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said I’ll feel you later
Go ahead and fantasize
She makes me want it right now, right now

And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rockin’
Keep me up all night
One in a million
My lucky strike

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me (yeah)
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Your body rockin'
Keep me up all night
One in a million
My lucky strike

Hey, you’re takin’ all my pain away
You’re shakin’ like an earthquake
Hey, you’re takin’ all my pain away
You’re shakin’ like an earthquake

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me (yeah)
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Your body rockin'
Keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

My lucky strike
My lucky strike
Your body rockin'
Keep me up all night
One in a million
