[Adam Levine]
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations


I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back

So I wonder where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you

Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause all these strangers come over me
Now I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do

[J Balvin]
Tu bien sabes que yo te ando buscando
Aunque en el tiempo aun yo te sigo amando
Tengo un mapa de papel
Y camino sobre él
Donde estes llegaré y
No tienes chance para escaparte
Te sigo buscando por cielo y tierra
Razón de ti nadie me da
Pa' toda mi piel ya no hay mapa
Que me conducirá
Esto parece ficción
Hasta en la televisión
Como entender la canción que estoy haciendo
Para encontrarte
Y yo fui quien te acompaño en la oscuridad
Quien nunca fallo ehhh

Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you

Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Eh eh eh
Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest time
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest nights
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest time
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest nights

Following, following, following
