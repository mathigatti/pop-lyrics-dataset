If you respect me
Don't protect me
You can tell me
I can handle it
Stop pretending, 'cause we're going down


If you let go
Then just let go
It's disrespectful
How you've handled this
Never ending, kinda run around

I lied to my heart 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire, if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me
If you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing
But if you're gonna
Well, then you better

Unkiss me
Untouch me
Untake this heart
And I miss this
Just one thing
A brand new start

Can't erase this
Can't delete this
I don't need this
I can't handle it
I just feel it that you're over us

If I wait here
If I see you
It won't matter
What's the point of this?
We're in pieces because you're over us

I lied to my heart 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire, if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me
If you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing
But if you're gonna
Well, then you better

Unkiss me
Untouch me
Untake this heart
And I miss this
Just one thing
A brand new start
So unkiss me
So unkiss me

So, baby, let go
Gotta let go
It's disrespectful
I can handle this
Never ending, kinda run around

Unkiss me
Untouch me
Untake this heart
And I miss this
Just one thing
A brand new start

So unkiss me
So unkiss me
Unkiss me
