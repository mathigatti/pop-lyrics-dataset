I have been searching for your touch
Unlike any touch I've ever known
And I'd never thought about you much
'Til I'm broken down and all alone


Oh
Though I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying
Took you for granted when you lifted me up...

I'm asking for your help, I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how, but how...

I can feel it in my guts, what's going on with him now
Don't patronize me with lies
I'm a man, be a woman now

Oh
I have been bound by the shackles of love
And I don't mind if i die tied up
Took you for granted when you lifted me up...

I'm asking for your help, I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how, but how...

But how, but how...

Why must we be so ugly
And please do not think it of me
Why does the one you love become the one who makes you want to...

Cry, and why, why, why
And how
(Though I don't understand the meaning of love, I do not mind if I die trying)
How
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying
