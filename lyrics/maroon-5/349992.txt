Your wind blows
Your mind falls down
Just give me
The time to drown


Your wind blows
Your mind falls down
Just give me
The time to drown

The boys are
digging the ground
But I can't stop spinning around

One day you will let me be
What I wanted you to be

The boys are 
stopping the ground
from taking
those things we found
Someday you will let me see
all of the things we used to see

Someday you will let me be
all of the things we used to be
Someday you will let me be
the champ you wanted her to see
