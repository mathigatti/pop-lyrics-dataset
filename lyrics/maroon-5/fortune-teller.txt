I'm not a fortune teller
I won't be bringing news
Of what tomorrow brings
I'll leave that up to you


I’m not a fortune teller
Don't have a crystal ball
I can't predict the future
Can’t see nothin’ at all

It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should just stay
Stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll by no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

I don't know why you’re acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why’d you have to go and ruin the night?
Don't worry about tomorrows mess

I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell ya, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell ya, I'm not a fortune teller

I don't like watchin’ TV
I don't know what it all means
And your American dream
Baby, it just isn't me

I know that what I'm thinking
May not be on your mind
I know the song I'm singing
Is not your favorite kind

It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should just stay
Stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll by no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

I don't know why you’re acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd ya have to go and ruin the night?
Don't worry about tomorrows mess

I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell ya, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell ya, I'm not a fortune teller

This feeling, keeps growing
These rivers keep flowing
How can I have answers
When you drown me in questions?

I’ll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell ya, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell ya, I'm not a fortune teller

I’ll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell ya, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell ya, I'm not a fortune teller
