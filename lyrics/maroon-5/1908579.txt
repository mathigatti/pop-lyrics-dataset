Oh, oh
Just shoot for the stars if it feels right
Then aim for my heart if you feel like
Can take me away and make it okay
I swear I'll behave


You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I make it
You say I'm a kid, my ego is big
I don't give a shit

And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Maybe it's hard when you feel like you're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me, I'll make you believe
That I've got the key

So get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here

And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

[Christina Aguilera]
You wanna know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh, baby, rub me right
If I share my secret, you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (take me by the tongue)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
