I don't know why I don't see happiness in this town
Everyone I meet seems so uptight wearing they frown
What good's living where dreams come true if nobody smiles?
Everyone's chasing the latest star, the latest style


You take me to another space and time
You take me to a higher place so I'm
I'm bout to get out of the race, I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you

I don't know if I'm the fool who's getting this all wrong
That's the dream, to sing the perfect girl the perfect song
All I know is I can't keep on wearing this disguise
When you're the only one that seems worth stealing my eyes

You take me to another space and time
You take me to a higher place so I'm.
I'm bout to get out of the race, I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you

You take me to another place, place
You take me to another place, place
You take me to a higher place

You take me to another space and time
You take me to a higher place so I'm
I'm bout to get out of the race, I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you
Space, space, space, space
Space, space, space, space

So I'm about to get out of the race, I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you
