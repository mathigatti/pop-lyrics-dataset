Spoke with Kate late last night 
With hopes to get my fix of her advice 
Inquired about a mutual thing and the feeling that I held in her life 


And she said when you gonna learn 
She must create her own reality to survive 
She said when you gonna learn 
That those Geminis will get you everytime 

But the conversation moved along 
I was mystified by the eloquence of her words 
Which made everything I said confusing and entirely absurd 

And she said when you gona learn 
She must create her own reality to survive 
She said when you gona learn 
That those Geminis will get you everytime 

Spoke with Kate late last night 
With the hopes to answer the phone that was ringing loud 
Jesse why don't you go get it because we don't want them to not leave a message for us 
And I said when you gonna learn 
(Who is it?) I don't know who it is 
But whoever it is will gain a new significance in our life 
Because while we were demo-ing this song they called to say hello 
They've just bought themself into this song 
They didn't know what they were getting into when they dialled the numbers 
Who is it? 
Oh my God she's now in this song for forever
