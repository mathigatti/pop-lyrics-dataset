Tell me actions speak louder
But there's something about her words that hurt


Clothes on the bed, so late and
I'm the last one still waiting for ya to lock the door

On our way home I realise
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
Cos we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes

Never asked you to change
But sadly you don't feel the same about me

I wonder does your man still shudder when you touch his hand
Like this man

On our way home I realise
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
Cos we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes
