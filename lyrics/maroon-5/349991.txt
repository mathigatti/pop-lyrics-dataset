I was overblown by all the card sharks.
And the muggers that day


Several million lovers
of that dress that's in the window display
And every day they'd say

Oliver
Oliver
Oliver
Oliver don't stay

She was quite a woman
Quite an understanding woman she was
Sure I really loved her
But she acted like a mother to me
And she loved me and I'd scream

Nancy
Nancy
Nancy
Please take care of me

Oliver, Oliver
Oliver, Oliver
Oliver


Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhh


I was overblown by all the card sharks
And the muggers that day


Several million lovers
of that dress that's in the window display
And every day they'd say


Oliver
Oliver
Oliver
Oliver don't stay
