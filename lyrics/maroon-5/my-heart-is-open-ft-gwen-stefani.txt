I know you're scared, I can feel it
It's in the air, I know you feel that too
But take a chance on me
You won't regret it, no


One more "no", and I'll believe you
I'll walk away and I will leave you be
And that's the last time you'll say no, say no to me

It won't take me long to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

If you don't ever say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Till my heart is open
Now you're gonna say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

It's just a moment going sea-saw
Don't be afraid to give your heart to me
And if you do, I know that I won't let you down, no
Yeah, so hand it over, trust me with your love
I'll do anything you want me to
'Cause I can't breathe until I can see your face

Oh, and I don't need time to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

If you don't ever say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Till my heart is open
Now you're gonna say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
