You are relentless, I am defenseless
Why did you knock me down tonight?
You keep me senseless, I just don't get this
How many times do I have to try?


Your whisper, so clear, the world disappeared
Cause I'll fall into the darkness, it's impossible to express
How good it feels, I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So entitled, I'll never be free
Oh, I don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
Please, don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

Beauty from many, you're so demanding
But I've got time, I don't mind at all
You're picture perfect, completely worthy
You got my back against my wall

Your whisper, so clear, the world disappeared
Cause I fall into the darkness, impossible to express
How good it feels, I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So entitled, I'll never be free (yeah)
Oh, I don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
Please, don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

And can you hear me calling?
I'm screaming, scratching, crawling
You ignore me cause I'm always
Coming back to you, coming back to you
And you know how much I miss it
And you know I can't resist it
See your lips and just come running
Running back to you, running back to you

Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I looking for? I think you should know
You started a fight, put me to the floor
I can't do this anymore
I'll never leave you alone
