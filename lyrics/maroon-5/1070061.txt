Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road


Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go Oh No

[Chorus:]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh No they can't

I'm Driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Where you at now
I feel around
There you are

Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe of beads of sweat
Slowly you say "I'm not there yet!"

Ain´t no sunshine when she´s gone
It´s not warm when she´s away
Ain´t no sunshine when she´s gone
And she always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she´s gone
Wonder if she´s gone to stay
Ain´t no sunshine when she´s gone
And this house just ain´t no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know, 
I know, I know, I know, I know, 
I know, know, know, know, know, 
I know, I know,
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain´t no sunshine when she´s gone
