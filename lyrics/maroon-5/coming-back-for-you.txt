Looking at the same sky that we used to live under
Are you thinking about the love that I took from us?
When you close your eyes
Do you see me, love?
Am I keeping you awake?
Whatcha scared about?
Are you giving up?
When you know, you know, you know


You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl
Don't you worry, girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl
I'll be back for you
So you better wait up
Keep the bed warm for me
All night when you whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do
I'll be back for you
Coming back for you

I know there are millions of miles in between our hearts
But I will come running for you I don't care how far
When you close your eyes
Do you see me love?
Am I keeping you awake?
Whatcha scared about?
Are you giving up?
When you know, you know, you know

You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl
Don't you worry, girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry girl
I'll be back for you
So you better wait up
Keep the bed warm for me
All night when you whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do
I'll be back for you
Coming back for you

You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl
Don't you worry, girl
I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry now
Don't you worry now

You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl
Don't you worry, girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry girl
I'll be back for you
So you better wait up
Keep the bed warm for me
All night when you whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do
I'll be back for you
Coming back for you
