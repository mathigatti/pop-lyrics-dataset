Come on,
I come home in the morning light
My mother says when you gonna live your life right
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls just wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun
Come on, nicki minaaaj!


[nicki minaj]
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna do with your life
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one
But girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

[nicki minaj e katy perry]
That's all they really waaant
Some fuuuun
When the working day is done
Oh girls they wanna have fun,
Oh girls just wanna have,
Girls wanna, wanna have fun,
Girls wanna have

[katy perry]
Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world

[nicki minaj]
I wanna be the one who walks in the sun
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

[katy perry e nicki minaj]
That's all they really waaant
Some fuuuun
When the working day is done
Girls, they want to have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun,
Oh girls just wanna have,
Girls wanna, wanna have fun,
Girls wanna have,
/just wanna, just wannaaa (x3)/
Oh girls they wanna have fun,
Oh girls just wanna have.
