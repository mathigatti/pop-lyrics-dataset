Remember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee under my skin?
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken
And my heart is still wide open


I can't stop don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

With each scar there's a map that tells a story
What a souvenir of
Young love's like jumping out an airplane
Riding a tidal wave on
An ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

I can't stop don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

And I cover up these scars
(We'll make it, we'll make it, but we break it)
And I can't stop seeing stars
(Let's hope not die)
Whenever you're around
Around

I can't stop don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

I can't stop
Oh, I can't stop
No, I can't stop
And I'm going down in flames for you
Oh, I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
