Roses in the sun, falling one by one
Every thorn storm, I was so numb
I almost didn't see it come
When the walls around me were caving in
You saved my life tonight


When there's nothing left but pouring rain
You saved my life tonight
And I found my heart inside your hands
You saved my life tonight
You showed me how to feel again
You saved my life tonight

Hearts on the run, we stayed young
Every mistake stun till I was numb
I almost didn't see it come
When the walls around me were caving in
You saved my life tonight

When there's nothing left but pouring rain
You saved my life tonight
And I found my heart inside your hands
You saved my life tonight
You showed me how to feel again
You saved my life tonight
