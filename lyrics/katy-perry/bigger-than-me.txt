I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening
I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it


Can't go with the flow, got to make waves
Even though I look at the sand, and I'm just one grain
But my intuition says there's a bigger mission I must embrace
So I'm, I'm pushing my thoughts to a new place

I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy to break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving, I'm just another robot taking up oxygen

It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it, but it keeps on growing out of control
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening

So I'll speak my truth though my voice shakes
(I must) try to summon the strength to look fear in the face

But I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy to break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving, I'm just another robot taking up oxygen

It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it, but it keeps on growing out of control
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening

Happening (oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening (oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
I can see it happen
I can see it, I can see it, I can see it happening

It's something bigger than me
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it, but it keeps on growing out of control (out of control)
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening
