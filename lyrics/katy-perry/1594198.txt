What`s somebody like you, doing in a place like this?
Say, did you come alone or did you bring all your friends?
Say, what`s your name, what you drinking
I think I know what you're thinking
Baby what`s your sign, tell me yours I`ll tell you mine
Say, what`s somebody like you doing in a place like this

I'll never be the same (if we ever meet again)
Won't let you get awaaay (if we ever meet again)
This free fall's, got me so
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same (if we ever meet again)

Say if we ever meet again

Do you come here much? I swear I've seen your face before
Hope you don't see me flash, but I can` t help but want you more, more
Baby tell me what's your story,
I ain't shy, don't you worry
I'm flirting with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight
So do you come here much, I gotta see your face some more
(some more cause baby I)

I'll never be the same (if we ever meet again)
Won't let you get awaaay (say, if we ever meet again)
This free fall's, got me so
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same (if we ever meet again)

If we ever meet again (again)
I've so much more to say (if we ever meet again)
If we ever meet again (again)
I won't let you go away (say if we ever meet again)
If we ever ever meet again
I've so much more to say (say if we ever meet again)
If we ever ever meet again
I won't let you go away

I'll never be the same if we ever meet again
Won't let you get awaaay (say if we ever meet again)
This free fall's, got me so
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same if we ever meet again

I'll never be the same if we ever meet again
Won't let you get awaaay (say if we ever meet again)
This free fall's, got me so
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same if we ever meet again
