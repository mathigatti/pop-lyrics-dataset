We're up, leaving all in the dust
Got a Cadillac, six pack vision of us
Tonight we ride hard into the desert sky


Hands up, feel the heat in the air
Legends never die
They play truth or dare
Tonight we stop time then go to the wheel and drive

How does it feel to fly

We are the stars that shine
We don't even have to try
We could go down in flames
But we'll melt the world away

All I know is you're my rock'n'roll
And wherever we go, we are heroes, heroes
They don't make 'em like you and I
Legends never die

Undressed in a beautiful maze
Gotta get your gold heart right here on my chest
They say we're crazy
So baby, let's go insane

It's? when we're together
I know we will live forever, maybe
One day, we'll make history

How does it feel to be free

We are the stars that shine
We don't even have to try
We could go down in flames
But we'll melt the world away

All I know is you're my rock'n'roll
And wherever we go, we are heroes, heroes
They don't make 'em like you and I
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die
Legends never

Burn out just to fade away
We keep the clock turning like a figure 8
Tonight we stop time then go to the wheel and drive

We are the stars that shine
We don't even have to try
We could go down in flames
But we'll melt the world away

All I know is you're my rock'n'roll
And wherever we go, we are heroes, heroes (heroes)
They don't make 'em like you and I
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die

All I know is you're my rock'n'roll
And wherever we go, we are heroes, heroes
They don't make 'em like you and I
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die
