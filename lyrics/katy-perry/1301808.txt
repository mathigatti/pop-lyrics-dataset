I wear the red shoes with the holes
And to remind me what we went through
Sit down here, kick 'em off enough
I've not had enough of you, I tell you


You know the car you drive
Keeps breaking down and never starts
Next thing, I'm pulling up to you
We're in the backseat driving it home

No one wants to be alone

What do you do, what do you do
When everything is broken?
What do you say, what do you say
When no words fit the moment?
'Cause you're not here
And even if you were, all I could say
Is: what do I do, what do I do?
We're broken but I can't throw us away

The video of our vacations
Chewed up in the drawer beside me
She thinks I never got to watch it
I'm so glad I made a copy

The sky got bitter twisted
Just like you and me, I miss it
You snap it, bend it, burn it
'Cause then you find that you can't fix it

Fall back on whatever still remains

What do you do, what do you do
When everything is broken?
What do you say, what do you say
When no words fit the moment?
'Cause you're not here
And even if you were, all I could say
Is: what do I do, what do I do?
We're broken but I can't throw us away

Breaking you and breaking your heart
I was taking it all and I tore you apart
Breaking me and breaking my heart
And the damage was done but I took what you've got

We were breakin' it, smashin' it
Takin' it, lovin' it
Hatin' it, drivin' it home
And now I'm all, and now I'm all alone

(Yeah...)

Oh, what do you do?
Oh, what do you do?

What do you do, what do you do
When everything is broken?
What do you say, what do you say
When no words fit the moment?
'Cause you're not here
And even if you were, all I could say
Is: what do I do, what do I do?
We're broken but I can't throw us away
