I saw you at the grocery store
Oh, you both looked happy
Picking out the usual
She's a carbon copy
Of everything you lost
Of everything I'm not
I guess you forgot
How to pick 'em


If she's the one I've heard about
I'm disappointed
If she's the reason why you left
I'm not impressed at all
Well, this looks like the end
Yeah, we can still be friends
Congratulations

Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse
That creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me

Again
And again
And again
And again

Someone had to tell the truth
And I'm always honest
I read you like an open book
And it's obvious to me
She's just the one between
Heading nowhere fast
Sure it's gonna last
Forever

Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse
That creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me

Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse
That creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me

Again
And again

Oh
You wish
You wish
You wish
