Preacher man walked into the bar and he said
He said "Hey girl, can't you walk a mile straight?"
Father, I'm torn and I'm selling my soul
To the rhythim, the beat and the bass


'Cause I can't confess my rock and roll ways
'Cause I'm so possessed with the music, the music he plays

I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love my rock, rock god

Preacher man took my hand and looked in my eyes
He said "Hey girl, can't you live your life right?"
Father, tames your daughter is so black and white
Don't cast the first stone 'cause I'm not alone

And it's not like I'm hurting anyone
But I can't confess my rock, my rock and roll ways

I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love my rock rock god

I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love my rock rock god

No I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
I chose a path and I'm not looking back
And I'm sorry if I left the angels cryin over me

I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love my rock rock god

Preacher man, preacher man
Preacher man, preacher man
Preacher man, preacher man
Preacher man, preacher man

'Cause I'm gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Yeah, I'm gone, gone, gone
Oh no!
