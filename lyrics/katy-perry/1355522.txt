Through this skin
You see my heart
Through this laughter
You feel my pain
Even through
This mask you see
My face
For You
Are the only one
Who really knows
Just who I am


And you search me
And you know
All the secrets
Of my heart
And you search me
Revealing
The mysteries
Of who You are
You search me

Growing up
Never comes
Easily
In Your Hands
You're the potter
Molding me
Then why do
I wear this mask
And play this game
Of hide and seek
When You
Are the only one
Wwho really knows
Just who I am

My Father
My Father
You are my Father
Oh
And I am Your child
And you hear my cry
Even at the midnight
