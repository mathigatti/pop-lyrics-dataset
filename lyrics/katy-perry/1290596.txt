I take these turns a bit too fast
Trying to leave you in my past
The CD skips our favorite songs
Our greatest hits just don't belong
I really love to hate this
Love hate, hate love


Relationships are over-rated
Over my dead body
Is how this will end
You said it's over
And I could go for
Another chance to do
This over again

So this is it
After all we've been through?
We called it quits
And now I'm about to
I've lost my grip
On the little I had left

You said it's over
And I could really go for
A cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
A cup of coffee and an overdose

I pop these pills like cracker jacks
And the price that plays dice just watching you react
When your depressed, you sleep too much
I'm not sure if I'm waking up

It's over-rated
Over my dead body
Is how this will end
You said it's over
And I could go for
Another chance to do
This over again

So this is it
After all we've been through?
We called it quits
And now I'm about to
I've lost my grip
On the little I had left

You said it's over
And I could really go for
A cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
A cup of coffee and an overdose

You said it's over
And I could really go for
A cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close

I stood in line without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I stood in line without you, I, I-I-I, I
I stood in line

I stood in line without you
And I don't tell you, my little every thought
(I stood in line without you)
Without you
(I stood in line without you)
Well, without you
(I stood in line without you)
Is everything I've got

Yeah, I'll be fine, yeah
After long as I have left in your pretty face
