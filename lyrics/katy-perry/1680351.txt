Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey


[Katy Perry]
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees, undone
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek, at us

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Snoop Dogg &amp; Katy Perry]
Toned tan, fit and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean, like, she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
The girl's a freak, she drives a jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play, I love the bait, just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach and Palm Springs, Summertime is everything
Homeboys bangin' out, all that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies, just a king and a queenie
Katy, my lady (yeah?), lookie here, baby (uh-huh!)
I'm all up on you 'cause you representin' California

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast, West Coast)
Now put your hands up (ay)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh (ay)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

California
California girls (California girls, man)
California (I really wish you all could be a California girls)
California girls
