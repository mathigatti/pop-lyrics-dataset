(Oh, oh) sipping on Ros√©
Silverlake sun coming up all lazy
(This is how we do)
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy
Still up, still fresh as daisy


(Oh, oh) playing ping pong all night long
Everything's all neon and hazy
(This is how we do)
Chanel this, Chanel that, hell, yeah
All my girls Vintage Chanel, baby (oh, oh)

It's no big deal
It's no big deal

(Oh, oh) big hoops and maroon lips
My clique hopping in my Maserati
(This is how we do)
Santa Barbara chic at La Super Rica
Grabbing tacos, checking out hotties

(Oh, oh) now we talkin' astrology
Getting our nails did all japanese-y
(This is how we do)
Day drinking at the Wildcat
Sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke (oh, oh)

It's no big deal

This one goes out to the ladies
At breakfast in last night's dress
(It's how we do, straight stuntin' like that)
Uh-huh, I see you

Yo, this goes out to all you kids
That still have their cars at the club valet
And it's Tuesday
(It's how we do, straight stuntin' like that)

Yo, shut out to all you kids
Buying bottle service with your rent money

Respect!

Going bed with a 10
And waking up with a 2 (this is how we do)
