Remember last summer
Under the shooting stars?
We made a wish on 'together forever'
And let nobody tear us apart


And how fun
Was that ride down to Mexico?
We took a chance on those road side tacos
And we got sick by the side of the road

And the Fall came
We had that big pot lot party
And your little 16 year old brother
Spilt wine all over my carpet
And I've got mad, you thought it was funny
I stayed mad all Winter
It's so sad, a thing like that
Become such a splinter

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

I'm almost 23
And I'm barely hanging on
I can't keep crashing couches
And going to sleep at dawn

And when were you gonna take me somewhere
That I can dress up?
Where we can act grown up?
Do you ever wanna clean up?

We share a car, you thought it was okay
You couldn't have cut it closer
I'm sick of it, this is it
And now the party's over

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

Someday you'll make some girl happy
I know, you'll get through
You'll know just what to say, to do
Because I showed to you

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

Let the credits start to roll
Oh, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
Will be the end of the road
