I know you’re thirsty, baby, standing in the heat
I got the juicy fruit, the sweet peaches and cream
You wanna wet your whistle, come and have a drink
Ice cold

Cool as a cucumber, you’re coming on to me
You say I got the ripest melons on the street
My honey dew and your banana make a treat

‘Cause, baby, don’t you know
All the boys are jealy of you?
But first comes, first serve
Don’t you know that it’s so
Delicious, yummy and new?
But first comes, first serve
So bottoms up!

You’ll have to cut your calories when you’re with me
Because my sugar gonna give you cavities
Don’t wanna share me ‘cause I’m such a tasty treat
Yum, yum, mmmm

I’ll let you double dip it in your favorite sauce
I’ll even let you eat the cherry on the top
You’ll beg for seconds in a diabetic shock
What?

‘Cause, baby, don’t you know
All the boys are jealy of you?
But first comes, first serve
Don’t you know that it’s so
Delicious, yummy and new?
But first comes, first serve
So bottoms up!

Open twenty-four hours
More than thirty-one flavors
To satisfy your craving
I know you’re sick of the Kool-Aid
I’ve got an upgrade
One sip you’ll be salivating
