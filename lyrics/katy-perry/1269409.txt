How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute
How will I know
The right way to love you


Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down the man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you

Oh oh oh
I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knocking on wood
Hoping there's a real boy inside

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull a string
For you to say anything

But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
But I can't seem to find your heart

Oh oh oh
I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

You're just a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand
But you're not a man

If the past is the problem
Our future could solve them, baby
I could bring you to life
If you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt
But in the end
You'll be a man

You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real

You're a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand
But you're not a man

You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
