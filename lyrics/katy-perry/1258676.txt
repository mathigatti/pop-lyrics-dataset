Voted most likely
To end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting 'em down
'Cause $7.75
Isn't worth an hour of my hard working time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh I'm worth more than an X
More than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
Oh I won't settle no oh
Oh I can't settle


I wanna break the mold
I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air
I'm not going down without a fight

It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you

Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history
Rather then end up
Begging on the streets
Trading under table favors
For a place to sleep

'Cause I'm worth more than this
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin
I can focus my attention

I wanna break the mold
I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air
I'm not going down without a fight

It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints

Don't give up
But don't give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh not in the sand, in the sand in the sand, in the sand

It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me

It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints in the END
