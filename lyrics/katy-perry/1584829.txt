Everything comes around again
The circus returns to town again
Oh, no
Oh, yeah


Now you are at my door again
Crawling around my floor again
Oh, yeah

'Cause your love is gone
And you're all alone
And you miss me
But you didn't miss me
When I was all alone
You're back 'cause you know

I can't help but love you
I can't help but kiss you
I can't help but let you in
You know
I'm off left to the slaughter
And off to the lifehole
Right back to where we begin
You know

'Cause your love has gone
And you're on your own
'Cause you miss me
La, la, la, la, la, la
You just press rewind
We go back in time

Everything comes around again
What goes up will come down again
Oh, no
Oh, yes

Wearing your old white dress again
Making my head a mess again
Oh, no, yeah

'Cause your love is gone
And you're all alone
And you miss me
But you didn't miss me
When I was all alone
You're back 'cause you know

I can't help but love you
I can't help but kiss you
I can't help but let you in
You know
I'm off left to the slaughter
And off to the lifehole
Right back to where we begin
You know

'Cause your love has gone
And you're on your own
'Cause you miss me
La, la, la, la, la, la
You just press rewind
We go back in time

'Cause your love is gone
And you're all alone
And you miss me
But you didn't miss me
When I was all alone
You're back 'cause you know

I can't help but love you
I can't help but kiss you
I can't help but let you in
You know
I'm off left to the slaughter
And off to the lifehole
Right back to where we begin
You know

I can't help but love you
I can't help but kiss you
I can't help but let you in
You miss me, you miss me
I'm off left to the slaughter
And off to the lifehole
Right back to where we begin
You miss me, you miss me
