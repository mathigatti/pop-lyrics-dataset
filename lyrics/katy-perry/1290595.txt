Uh oh, uh oh, diamond!

I got people to see, places to go
Dealdines to meet, a reputation to uphold
It's like a ton of bricks breaking on my back
It's like the force of gravity in full effect


I got money to burn and I'm on the sake
They bet their bomb on me 'cause I'm their ace of spades
I feel the walls getting closer
I'm like a bomb with all red wires

All this pressure, all this pressure
Maybe it means I'm gonna be
All this pressure, all this pressure
Maybe this means I'm gonna be

A diamond
It won't ever fade
A diamond
'Cause they're ladies best friend
Oh, diamonds
But there, there has to be more
Than what these pirates are gamblin' for

If not for the push, I'd probably be a pebble
If not for the pressure, I'd be forgotten forever
Just another stone skipped upon the water
Drowning fast with all the other failures

I don't wanna be a distant memory on your wall
Just another CD that you burned and never bought
Am I not worth it to you
After all the drama that we've been through?

All this pressure, all this pressure
Maybe it means I'm gonna be
All this pressure, all this pressure
Maybe it means I'm gonna be

A diamond
It won't ever fade
A diamond
'Cause they're ladies best friend
Oh, diamonds
But there, there has to be more
Than what these pirates are gamblin' for

Uh oh, uh oh, diamond!

(I gotta be a diamond)
I'm a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
That catch me if I fall

All this pressure, all this pressure
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be
All this pressure, all this pressure
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be

I'm a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
That catch me if I fall
Into the arms of a cold miner

All this pressure, all this pressure
I'm gonna be, baby, be your...
All this pressure, all this pressure
Why the pressure?

I'm gonna be a diamond, baby
I'm gonna be a diamond, baby
You're gonna see, I'm gonna be

I've gotta be a diamond!
