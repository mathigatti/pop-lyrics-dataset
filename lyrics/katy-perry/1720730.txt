He put it on me, I put it on
Like there was nothing wrong
It didn't fit, it wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know when you know
I don't know


I didn't feel the fairytale feeling, no
Am I a stupid girl
For even dreaming that I could?

If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah

Snow white said when I was young
"One day my prince will come"
So I wait for that date
They say it's hard to meet your match
Gotta find my better half
So we make perfect shapes

If stars don't align
If it doesn't stop time
If you can't see the sign, wait for it
One hundred percent
With every penny spent
He'll be the one that finishes your sentences

If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning

'Cause I know you're out there
And you're, you're looking for me
It's a crazy idea that
You were made perfectly for me
You see

Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Cinematic and dramatic
With the perfect ending

It's not like the movies
But that's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, you'll come undone
And your world will stop spinning
And it's just the beginning
