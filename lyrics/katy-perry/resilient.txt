I know there's gotta be rain if I want the rainbows
And I know the higher I climb, the harder the wind blows
Yeah, I've gone to sleep, night after night, punching a pillow
But do you know the darker the night, the brighter the stars glow


'Cause I am resilient, a full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, ooh, no
I am resilient, born to be brilliant
You'll see me grow right through the cracks, yeah
'Cause you're gonna watch this flower grow right through the cracks

I've got to shed all this skin if I want the distance
Let the sun in
Pull out the weeds and focus my vision

Look at me now, look at me now
I light up the room, oh, yeah

'Cause I am resilient (I am resilient), a full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, no
