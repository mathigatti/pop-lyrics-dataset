Is Mercury in retrograde
Or is that the excuse that I've always made?
'Cause I wanna blame you
But I can only blame myself


Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
Or call you crazy while I'm filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself

Oh, I can only take responsability for me

It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it
I'm not that innocent
Oh yeah

It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby
To say I'm sorry (I'm sorry)

I'll face my demons - yeah, I paid my dues
I had to grow up; I wish you could too
I wanted to save you
But I can only save myself

Oh, I can only be the change you want to see
Yeah, to see

It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it
I'm not that innocent
Oh

It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby
To say I'm sorry (I'm sorry)

I point my finger but it does me no good
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth, yeah
Why all these lessons always learned the hard way?
Is it too late to change?

Oh, it takes two (takes two)
Two sides to every story
Not just you (not you)
I can't keep ignoring
And I admit half of it
I'm not that innocent
Oh

It takes two (takes two)
Two sides to every story
Not just me (not me)
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby
To say, I'm sorry (I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
