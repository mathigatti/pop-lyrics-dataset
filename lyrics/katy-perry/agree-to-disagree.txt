You hate the sand between your toes
I like the beach on a sunny day
I like pink margaritas
It appears you like beer
I like a foreign accent
You just say "What? What the hell they say?"
We got different perspectives
Night and day, but that's okay


Sometimes I'd like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

You like to fight in silence
I like to scream while I'm breaking plates
You like the heavy metal
But I like songs to sing along to

Sometimes I like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

And I will, but you won't
And I do, but, but you don't
We won't budge either way
But we like it, we like it

Sometimes I'd like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(Let's agree to disagree)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
