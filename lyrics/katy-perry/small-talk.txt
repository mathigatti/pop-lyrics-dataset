Isn't it strange
That you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say hey


Isn't it weird
That you've seen me naked?
We had conversations about forever
Now it's about the weather okay

I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers

(Yeah)

Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain’t it funny?
'Cause now there’s nothing left but small talk

Isn't it wild
That I know your weakness
And everybody at the party thinks that you’re the best since sliced bread?
And isn't it awkward
I got a new somebody
And honestly it will probably be a while before we can just be friends?

I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers

(Small talk)

Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

Blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk

Blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk

And I just can't believe we went from strangers to lovers to strangers

Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

Blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk

Blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk
