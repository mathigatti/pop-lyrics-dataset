See the people there drivin in there cars
Drivin in there cars, drivin in there cars tonight
And all the people there getting in there cars
Underneath the stars
Driving in there cars tonight
And everybodys leavin, a million brakes are screachin
No one knows were there goin to


CHORUS
And i just wanna fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love
And i just wanna fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love

See the people there rollin in there cars
Cruisin in there cars, drivin in there cars tonight
See the people there drivin in there cars, drivin in there cars

Drivin in there cars tonight
All the people there jangalin there keys, standing at thee
doors
Getting in there cars tonight
Signals green i'm movin, the radio is groovin and everybody
Likes the same song

CHORUS
And i just wanna fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love
And i just wanna fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love

I'm dreamin about you
Were layin in the sun, with sun-block party on
And on, and on, and on, and on... ya ya ya

CHORUS
And i just wanna fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love
And i just wanna fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love
Lets take a walk and fall in love
