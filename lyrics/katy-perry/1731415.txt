You come over, don't talk
Turn the TV on, off
Disconnected, unaffected
Better take the call


Showed you pictures of my hometown
A pin could drop from miles down
What's the use in trying to be a girlfriend
When I know just what we are?

There's nothing in common
Except the bed we lay on

I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between

You're a habit I can't break
Disaster to eliminate
What part of "no" do I not understand
When you're not good for me?

'Cause I know we will never
Be some kind of forever

I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between

'Cause I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing
How did we become a one night stand?
Hanging on a thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no

Oh, it's empty in between

You come over
Yeah, it's over
Now we know just what we are

I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between

I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing
How did we become a one night stand?
Hanging on a thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no

Oh, it's empty in between
