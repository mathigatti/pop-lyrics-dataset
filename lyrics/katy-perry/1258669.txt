You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi
'Cause you're hung over and I'm broke


I lost my fake ID
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freaking dirty looks now
Don't blame me

You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

Why are these lights so bright
Oh did we get hitched last night
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?

Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

You got me into this
Information overload
Situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.

And get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town
No don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Told me, told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

That's what you get, baby

Shake the glitter
Shake, shake
Shake the glitter

Give me some cash out baby
Give me some cash out baby
