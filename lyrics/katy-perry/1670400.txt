I've played the song
Now it drives me crazy
I've run the race
Now I'm too damn lazy
This love of ours is a fading photograph yeah yeah
Now I must approach to life today
Seems a little different
Hard to say
But it look like the end


Times up,
Promise this time I get enough
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes
Nothing changes.
Times up,
Promise this time I get enough
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it even when it's gone

We've served the way
Now we've hit the short end
We've squeezed the fruit
Till there no more juice left
We're both so good
Good at keeping up the lie yeah yeah
Hey but no one's got to die
We can get it in prospective
Kiss my lips
Live is what we make it

Times up,
Promise this time I get enough
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes
Nothing changes.
Times up,
Promise this time I get enough
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it even when it's gone

As I'm waving you goodbye
I want you to smile
Save the picture in your frame
File it right next to my name
I'm willing to die
For love willing to try
But not willing to lie for love
I know that this cakes already baked
Now its burning burning

We can get it in prospective
Kiss my lips
Live is what we make it

Times up,
Promise this time I get enough
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes
Nothing changes.
Times up,
Promise this time I get enough
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it even when it's gone

Times up,
Promise this time I get enough
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it even when it's gone
