We can be mr. and mrs. smith tonight
You push me and I'll push you back, we'll start a fight.
We're speeding down the highway, without the lights.
I've got this, I hate you, I love you, can't deny.



We're reckless like a hurricane we're taking over
Numb you like some novocain, 'cause we taking over.
Set it down with everything, like a super nova.
'Cause we can never ever stop doing us.

Chorus
We can be mr. and mrs. I don't give a fuck!
Giving them something to talk about, so what?
'Cause we're breaking free, it's just you and me.
So, we can be mr. and mrs. I don't give a fuck!
Uh ooh uh ooh oh ooh. uh ooh uh ooh oh ooh.

We can run around and we can shut it down.
We could climb up hills and we can streak the town.
Why don't we just go and crash a party, or two?
We can watch the sun rise if we want to.

We're reckless like a hurricane we're-we're taking over
Numb you like some novocain ''cause we taking over
Set it down with everything, like a super nova.
'Cause we can never ever stop doing us.

Chorus
We can be mr. and mrs. I don't give a fuck!
Giving them something to talk about, so what?
'Cause we're breaking free, it's just you and me.
So, we can be mr. and mrs. I don't give a fuck!
Uh ooh uh ooh oh ooh. uh ooh uh ooh oh ooh.

Why don't we forget about the rules, guidelines, and the games?
'Cause with us there never is no boundaries.
Even if the sky fell, still be the same.
So there's no need to worry like yesterday.
We'll take tomorrow as it comes, 'cause it's ours today.
So look at how they got their panties in a bunch. we can be mr. and mrs. don't give a fuck.

Chorus
We can be mr. and mrs. I don't give a fuck!
Giving them something to talk about, so what?
'Cause we're breaking free, it's just you and me.
So, we can be mr. and mrs. I don't give a fuck!
Uh ooh uh ooh oh ooh. uh ooh uh ooh oh ooh
