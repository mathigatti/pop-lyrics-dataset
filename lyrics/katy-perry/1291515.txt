If You came by me would I crown You my King
Or brush You off as though I really didn't see
If You walked by my side would our souls then be unified
I swore Your name would never be denied


But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your face and passed You by
(I'd forgotten those words "your name won't be denied")

But time and time again I'd live that life of sin
I knew it hurt you bad but I wasn't ready to give in
"Maybe someday," but not this day I said
I wanted to live my life I was willing to pay the price

CHORUS

But looking into my eyes I knew You felt this heart's cry
I needed You bad my life was oh so sad
But looking back at all this pain, this guilt, this strife
Would You take it all away if I were to give you back my life?

But You said "I've forgiven thee"
And You said "I've forgiven thee" (repeat)

He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns in His head (repeat)

But You said "I've forgiven thee"
And You said "I've forgiven thee" (repeat)
