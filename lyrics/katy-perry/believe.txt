Take a second look in the mirror
And see who you really are
You've got something different about you
That makes you a super star
Don't act like you don't know
How everyone says
Face the facts, you've made it now
So let go of your fears


You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
In yourself
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
You're the best

Glow in the dark
Light all the haters
Be who you are
Because love is all that matters

Sometimes you take of a leap of faith
And hope you land on solid ground
You'll never know if you don't try
And you'll be stuck in the lost and found
As/rise above the groping broken crowd
And find the strength inside
Hear the voice from within
Cause you only got one life

You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
In yourself
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
You're the best

Glow in the dark
Light all the haters
Be who you are
Because love is all that matters

You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
In yourself
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
You're the best

They try to take you down
So far that you'll never be found
It's time to turn around

They'll try to mess you up
But you're never gonna give up
You're so high! Like a star!

Glow in the dark
Light all the haters
Be who you are
Because love is all that matters

You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
In yourself
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
You're the best

Take a second look in the mirror
And see who you really are...
