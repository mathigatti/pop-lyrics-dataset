How could I see you when I was so blind
How could I grasp you when I was far behind
How could I hear you when I was so deaf
How could I get up when I had been left


But You said, "don't worry"
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, "don't worry"
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in Me

How could I be clean when I was so dirty
How could I be made whole when I was torn apart
Make me whole, make me whole
Make me whole again
