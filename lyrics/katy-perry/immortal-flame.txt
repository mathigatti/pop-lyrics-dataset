Lightning strikes only once in your life
I guess I'm lucky cause I found myself
In the line of fire tonight
My heart beats like thunder under my skin
And my world speaks in wonder since your appeared
Now we are here


And I could die (I could die)
In your arms tonight
But it would be a shame (a shame)
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame

Dreams hardly ever do come true
I guess I'm lucky cause I found myself
Waking up right next to you
Oh and with this raging heart of mine
I'll love you till' the end of time
I'll thank the gods, that our stars aligned
From the ocean floor to the distant sun
Forever more till kingdom come
Have no fear
I'll be burning here!

And I could die
In your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame
(Your immortal)
I'll be your (your immortal)
Oh, I'll be your (your immortal)
I'll be your (your immortal flame)

And I could die
In your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame

Love you again and again
An everlasting fantasy
I'll be your immortal
