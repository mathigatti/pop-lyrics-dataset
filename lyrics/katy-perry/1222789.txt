I'm used to opening my opening my own doors
And splittin' the checks
He introduced me
Was always just the friend
I bought a new dress
He never noticed


Always fallin for these bad boys
Such a challenge
I'm getting tired
Of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman

(CHORUS)
Oh love, I think I'm ready
Ready for it

(V2)
You were such a surprise
An unexpected gift
Said I was PRETTY
And I believed it
Not really used to
All this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you
And this is just a phase
Could I get used to
Being loved the right way
I wanna argue but there is nothing to say

(CHORUS)
Oh love, I think I'm ready
Ready for it, ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready

(BRIDGE)
Cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
Yeah we talk for hours
You still wanna listen
Won't hold it against me
If I just need you to hold me tonight

My mother always told me
That you'd show up one day
So scared to feel this way...

(CHORUS)
But love, I think I'm ready
Ready for it, ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready
Ready for it, ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready
