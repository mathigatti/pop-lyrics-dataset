Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens


I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
(I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock)
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight I'm walking on air)
Tonight I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air
Tonight I'm walking on air (another one in the basket)
Tonight, tonight I'm walking on air (can't touch this)
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (another one in the casket)
Tonight I'm walking on air (swish, swish, bish)
Let's go!
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
But they don't know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?

They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
