If you want me
The cherry on top
The pick of the pack
The créme de la crop
If you want me
You better do better than that tonight
Oh, oh


If you want me
It takes more than a wink
More than a drink
More than you think
If you want me
You're gonna have to break the bank tonight

'Cause some don't have the patience
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill
'Cause that's the deal

If you wanna ride
Just name your price
Don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet
If you can't write the check
For me, for me
'Cause I can be bought
But you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you want me
I'm not a piece of ass
A one night stand
A storage shed
I think you better walk by tonight
Oh, no

If you want me
Then stop begging
I don't put out
For charity
If you want me
There's no discount price tonight

But I don't need your dollar bills
I just want something real
'Cause nothing's free
Except loving me

If you wanna ride
Just name your price
Don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet
If you can't write the check
For me, for me
'Cause I can be bought
But you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you want me
The cherry on top
The pick of the pack
The créme de la crop

If you wanna ride
Just name your price
Don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet
If you can't write the check
For me, for me
'Cause I can be bought
But you'll pay the cost
If you can afford (me)

If you wanna ride
Just name your price
Don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet
If you can't write the check
For me, for me
'Cause I can be bought
But you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me
