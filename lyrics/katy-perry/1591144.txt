i took advantage of you a stepping stone to my pedestal
when you had enough of it i said fine good luck replacing this
caz i seem strong and independent self sufficient confident
and im like mercury rising to the top so selfishly


the better half of me was you
im like a hive without a bee without you
i gotta find ya gotta remind ya
that two is better than one

so please accept my apology caz im feeling
like a branch without its tree
it took me a fall to really see
that your the catch i wanna keep

caz i get weak thinking about you
living without you life has no value
baby come back to me
caz youre the only missing piece

caz the better half of me was you
im like the hive without its bee without you
i gotta find ya gotta remind ya
that two is better than one

ooh it took a little earthquake
to appreciate the stability youve given me
so consistanly

the better half of me was you
im like a bird without its wings
without you
i gotta find ya gotta remind ya
that two is stronger than one

the better half of me oh its you
im like a heart without its beat
without you
i gotta find ya gotta remind ya
i promise you that im gotta try to
im gonna love ya caz two is better than one
