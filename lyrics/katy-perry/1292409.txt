When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before
When there's nothing left left to say
I'll say it all again, but until then...


And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, cause I do, Jesus

No music to play so I sing you my own song
Come on and sing along
When there's nothing that remains
You still stay the same
You're looking so strong

CHORUS

When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before
