Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed


You said: Move on â€” where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night?
Oh, I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian Summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth, oh
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night?
Oh, I wish that I was looking into

You're the best
And, yes, I do regret
How I could let myself let you go?
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched it, I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
Oh, what you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night?
Oh, I wish that I
Was looking into your

Your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through
And bust in the door and take me away?
Oh, no more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay
Stay
