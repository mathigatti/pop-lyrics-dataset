That you'll stick around
Stay on my side of town
Now I'm covered in blood
And I'm feeding off your pretty little lies


For once why can't you just come and chase me
Dig up my grave and save my body
Now I'm rotting to the bone
But my hearts still beatin'
Hopin' you won't leave me

Creepy girls
You're just my style
Blood-red lipstick
You don't smile
Falling victim to your fantasy
Damn, I love it that you're so creepy
