You love who you love?
Who you love?
You love who you love?
Who you love?


My girl she ain’t the one that I saw coming
And sometimes I don’t know which way to go
And I’ve tried to run before
But I’m not running anymore
'Cause I fought against it hard enough to know

That you love who you love
Who you love?
You love who you love?
Who you love?
You love who you love?
Who you love?
Oh you can’t make yourself stop dreaming
Who you’re dreaming of
If it’s who you love then it’s who you love

My boy he ain’t the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart’s too hard to hold
And it takes a litle time, but you should see him when he shines
'Cause you'd never want to let that feeling go
When you love who you love

Who you love?
You love who you love?
Who you love?
You love who you love?
Who you love?
Oh you can’t make yourself stop dreaming
Who you’re dreaming of
If it’s who you love then it’s who you love
Oh you love who you love?

Who you love?
You love who you love?
Who you love?
You love who you love?
Who you love?
Oh you can’t make yourself stop dreaming
Who you’re dreaming of
If it’s who you love then it’s who you love

You're the one I love
