You could throw me 
In the fire 
And I won't be burned 
For my faith 
Is Your desire 
And Your love endures 


You could throw me 
In the prison cell 
Shackle me up 
Against the rail 
But time 
And time again 
My faith won't fail 

Chorus:
For He'll prevail 
In the midst of all 
My trials 
And tribulations 
And He'll prevail 
In the midst of all 
My sin 
And temptations 
He'll prevail 
When I fall 
And He 
Will pick me up 
For time 
And time again 
My faith won't fail 
Time and time again 
My faith won't fail 

You could cast me 
In the lion's den 
But they won't harm me 
For Your grace 
Surrounds me 
And it sets me free 

And I can walk 
Upon the water 
And I will not drown 
For my eyes are 
Set upon You 
And no one 
Can bring me down 

For His angels 
Surround me 
And You've poured out 
This blood covering 
And I will walk 
And not fail 
For time 
And time again 
My faith won't fail
Time 
And time again 
My faith won't fail
