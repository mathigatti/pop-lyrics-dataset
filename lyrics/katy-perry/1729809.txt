Release a fall on when I was seventeen
We've been
Lock in lips
Craving hips
Smoking cigarettes
We toke a drive in your 99?D
Humming down from other town
I was California


Oh my legs are not shave
And you have dirty between your fingers
They told us to behave
But hey

It's not like running in bike
It's not like flying in the kite
It's not like easy as I
There's nothing like the 1st time
It's not like taking back
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading the map
There's nothing like the 1st time

I have seen in the magazine
We would
Change the channel of a TV screen
'Cause it's such a sin watcha do to me
Straight the hell is what they sell
If you don't the deed

Open what can be so bad
Oh everyone is guilty
I guess we want but we can't have
'Cause I've heard

It's not like running in bike
It's not like flying in the kite
It's not like easy as I
There's nothing like the 1st time
It's not like taking back
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading the map
There's nothing like the 1st time

Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?

La, la, la?
There's nothing like the 1st time
La, la, la?
There's nothing like the 1st time

Walking in the park
It's not like shadow in the dark
It's not like juvenile crime
There's living like the 1st time
It's not like dying in the night
They so convicted the dance
In case you forgot
There's nothing like the 1st time

La, la, la?
There's nothing like the 1st time
La, la, la?
There's nothing like the 1st time
