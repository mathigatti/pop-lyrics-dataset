I forgive mistakes were unforgivable
I did things on impulse
but I've let others down.
I screamed and jumped for joy,
have lived in love and I swear eternal
and broke my face many times!
I cried listening to music and viewing photos,
I called just to hear a voice,
I fell in love with a smile,
ever thought I would die so nostalgic
and I was afraid of losing someone special (and ended up losing).
But I lived!
And still alive!
Do not step in life.
And you should not pass!


Viva!
Chorus
I loved and was loved,
but has also been rejected,
I was loved and not loved

Already embraced to protect,
have laughed when I could not
made friends forever,
and friends that I never saw.
Living is easy with eyes closed,
confusing everything you see.
It's getting hard to be somebody,
but everything works
does not matter much to me.
The great secret of life is to live on
Tomorrow does not know what will be better to live now
Life moves so fast, like the wind
Do not wait for love after
May not give more time
Love was made for loving
Forgiveness was made to be given
Do not sow to reap later, this resentment
So it is better to live
Thinking it was the farewell
Looking at everything around you
As anyone who goes away
If I could live my life again,
next try to commit more errors.
Do not try to be so perfect,
relax more, it would be sillier than I have been.
In fact, I'll take fewer things seriously. I would run more risks,
more vacations, contemplate more sunsets,
climb more mountains, swim more rivers.
Go to more places where it never was,
would take more ice cream and fewer beans,
would have more actual troubles and fewer imaginary problems.
I was one of those people who lived sensibly
and deeply every minute of his life;
Of course I had moments of joy.
But if I could live again treat only
having a good time
