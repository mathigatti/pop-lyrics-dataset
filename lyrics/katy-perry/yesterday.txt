Silverlake sun coming up all lazy

Slow cooking pancakes for my boy
Still up, still fresh as daisy

Everything's all neon and hazy

Santa barbara chic at la super rica
Grabbing tacos, checking out hotties

Getting our nails did all japanese-y

Day drinking at the wildcat
Sucking real bad at mariah carey-oke (oh, oh)

At breakfast in last night's dress
