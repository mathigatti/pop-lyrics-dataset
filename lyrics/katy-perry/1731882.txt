Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel
Feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in?


Do you ever feel
Already buried deep
Six feet under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing?
Do you know that there's
Still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the 4th of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go: Ah, ah, ah!
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go: Ah, ah, ah!
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel
Like a wasted space
You're original
Cannot be replaced
If you only knew
What the future holds
After a hurricane
Comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why
All the doors are closed
So you could open one
That leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt
Your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the 4th of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go: Ah, ah, ah!
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go: Ah, ah, ah!
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go: Ah, ah, ah!
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go: Ah, ah, ah!
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
