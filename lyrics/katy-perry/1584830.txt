get used to it katy
everyone trashes you under the table
as theyre smiling at your face
curl words like a stun gun
life can be hum drum
knock to the ground oh


but if you get them talking
starring and stalking
you know its working
but you only get a minute or two

cause nobody hates you
are you aware
you're just one note in a symphony
nobody needs you
nobody's there
your name will go down in history
live on an infamy
more to the point
would you care
(would you care, would you care)

get used to it katy
people's attention
sure is focused on you
your the subject of the day
they need something to speak about
no need to freak out
tomorrow is over
today you got them talking
starring and stalking
you know its working
but you only get a minute or two

cause nobody hates you
are you aware
you're just one note in a symphony
nobody needs you
nobody's there
your name will go down in history
live on an infamy
more to the point
would you care

mean worlds, mean words, mean thoughts, meanwhile
dont let it get to you
girl dont cry
they lie
dont let it get to you
get used to it

nobody hates you
are you aware
you're just one note in a symphony
nobody needs you
nobody's there
(nobody, nobody, nobody)

cause nobody hates you
are you aware
you're just one note in a symphony
nobody needs you
nobody's there
your name will go down in history
live on an infamy
more to the point
would you care
more to the point
would you care
(would you care, would you care)
