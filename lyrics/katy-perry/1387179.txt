I can still see the light at the end of the tunnel shine,
Through the dark times even when I lose my mind.
But it feels like no one in the world is listenin,
and I can't ever seem to make the right decisions.
I walk around in the same haze, I'm still caught in my same ways.
I'm losing time in these strange days,
but somehow I always know the right things to say.


I don't know what time it is,
or who's the one to blame for this.
Do i believe what i can't see?
and how do you know which way the wind blows?
Cause i can feel it all around,
I'm lost between the sound.
And just when I think I know, there she goes.

Goodbye for now, Goodbye for now (so long)
Goodbye for now,
I'm not the type to say i told you so.
Goodbye for now (so long)
I think the hardest part of holding on is lettin it go.
When will we sing a new song? A new song.

I'm still smiling as the day goes by,
and how come nobody ever knows the reasons why?
Bury it deep, so far that you can't see.
If your like me, who wears a broken heart on your sleeve,
Pains and struggles that you know so well,
Either time don't, it can't, or it just won't tell.
I'm not the type to say i told you so,
I think the hardest part of holding on is lettin it go.

I don't know what time it is,
or who's the one to blame for this.
Do i believe what i can't see?
and how do you know which way the wind blows?

And just when I think I know, there she goes.

Goodbye for now, Goodbye for now (so long)
Goodbye for now,
I'm not the type to say i told you so.
Goodbye for now (so long)
I think the hardest part of holding on is lettin it go.
When will we sing a new song? A new song.
When will we sing a new song? A new song.

And you can sing until there's no song left (song left)
And I can scream until the world goes deaf (goes deaf)
For every other word left unsaid,
you should've took the time to read the signs
and see what it meant (what it meant)
In some ways everybody feels alone,
so if the burden is mine then i can carry my own (carry my own)
If joy really comes in the morning time,
then I'm gonna sit back and wait until the next sunrise.

Goodbye for now, Goodbye for now (so long)
Goodbye for now,
I'm not the type to say i told you so.
Goodbye for now (so long)
I think the hardest part of holding on is lettin it go.
When will we sing a new song? A new song.
When will we sing a new song? A new song.
