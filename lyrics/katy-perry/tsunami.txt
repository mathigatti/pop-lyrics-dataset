Please don't tip-toe
Come close, let's flow
Anchor in me, and get lost at sea
The world's your oyster and I am the pearl
Open waters
Sink into me slowly


So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

Don't fight
Just ride the rhythm of the tide
We swirl, we spin
Salted, sun-kissed skin
We float together
Whatever weather
Embrace the breeze and sail away smoothly

So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

Oh, you're waking up an ocean of emotion
That my body can't hide (can't hide)
Tsunami (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now you're soaked in my devotion
'Cause you opened up a paradise (inside)
Tsunami (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tsunami

So baby, come and take a swim with me (take a swim with me)
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy (make me ripple, baby)
Don't be scared to dive in deep (don't be scared to)
And start a tsunami
Tsunami
