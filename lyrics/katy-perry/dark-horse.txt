Yeah, ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J


I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
‘Cause I'm coming at ya like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
‘Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don't walk away

It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it all to me

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
‘Cause I'm coming at ya like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
‘Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

She's a beast
I call her Karma
She eats your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart was on steroids
‘Cause her love was so strong
You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She is sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending
With a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma
Woo!
Damn, I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
(You should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?
‘Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse
(Like a dark horse)
Are you ready for
Ready for (ready for)
A perfect storm?
Perfect storm (a perfect storm)?
‘Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine (oh)
There's no goin' back
