I've never asked
To define our time
It's understood, so crystal clear
When your eyes lock mine
We so connect
But we're almost scared of it
So no strings attached is where it's at
For the moment


So, just relax
Baby, lay back
And let's just spend the night
Spend the night, woah oh oh
Undo my dress
Let down my hair
And let's just spend the night
Spend the night, oh oh oh

Yeah, I play cool
Like I've met a hundred you's
And for tonight, you're just right
To be the one I use
But you break me down
I forget the games I play
Oh, you wrap me up in your arms
And I just melt away

So, just relax
Baby, lay back
And let's just spend the night
Spend the night, woah oh oh
Undo my dress
Let down my hair
And let's just spend the night
Spend the night

Oh, if I could freeze this moment
In my heart shaped locket
Wear you around my neck
So, you won't be forgotten
I would, I would

Oh, if I could tell you everything
I feel for you, baby
Spill my heart out on the floor
And have it be reciprocated
I would
You know I would

So, just relax
Baby, lay back
And let's just spend the night
Spend the night, woah oh oh
Undo my dress
Let down my hair
And let's just spend the night
Spend the night

Oh, baby, relax
Oh, baby, lay back
And let's just spend the night
Spend the night

Oh, if I could freeze this moment
In my heart shaped locket
Wear you around my neck
So, you won't be forgotten
I would, I would
