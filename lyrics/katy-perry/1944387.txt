It's a friday night
Now here we go
I ain't no strippin but i work the pole
Bartender can you pour some more
And i'm so tipsy comin out my clothes
Fly high high high
And I can't see so I can't drive
I party till im out my mind
I kiss on him but he dont mind
Then I wake up in the morn
I got a guy in my bed like "hello good morn"
Dont remember how I got him home
But friday night it was nice and long


Last friday night
Yeah, we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but i forgot
Last friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bars
So we hit the boulevard
Last friday night
We went streakin in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois
Last friday night
Yeah, i think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop op owwhoaa
This friday night, (do it all again)
This friday night, (do it all again)

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier's on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think i need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail
Pictures of last night ended up online, I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur but i'm pretty sure it ruled, damn

This friday night, (do it all again)
This friday night, (do it all again)

Le't do like every weekend
T.g.i.f, t.g.i.f, t.g.i.f, t.g.i.f, t.g.i.f

T.g.i.f, t.g.i.f, t.g.i.f, t.g.i.f, t.g.i.f
