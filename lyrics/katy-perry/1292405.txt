Living in fear is not what you had in mind for me
But holding to you is so hard,
I cling to what I see


In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You

Here in this haze a distant light seems to draw me near
But in the shadow of my doubt
My faith just disappears

In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You

You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You

You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
