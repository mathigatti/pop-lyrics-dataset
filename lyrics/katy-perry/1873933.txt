My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir


There's nothing wrong with lovin' who you are
Cause he made you perfect, baby
So hold your head and you'll go far,
Listen to me when I say

You're beautiful in your way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
You're on the right track baby
You were born this way

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
You're on the right track baby
You were born this way

Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby you were born this way
Baby you were born this way

Ooo baby there ain't no other way
Baby you were born this way
Baby you were born this way
