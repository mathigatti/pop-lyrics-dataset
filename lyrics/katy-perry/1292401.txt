You would think that I could find
A simple song, a photograph of mine
To show this public eye what I have to offer
I may not have a PHD
Or speak in eloquent philosophy
I'm nothing more than simply me, you see


What I am trying to say, hey, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways

I'm still growing, still stretchin'
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through

I don't regret, I'm not ashamed
That I haven't yet begun to speaketh ways
- As the wisest of men - oh, perhaps some day
But for now I'm grateful
To be a part of the family tree
While The Man upstairs does His work on me
It's a job that may take eternity to complete

Just when I've learned all I can
Those growing pains up and kick on in again

I'm still growing, still stretchin'
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through

Time after time
One more time, and again
Will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives that make us wise
But young or old
I am told, it's the same
Oh, these growing pains never go away
So I'll just keep on trying

What I am trying to say, hey, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways

I'm still growing, still stretchin'
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a Spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
These growing pains...
Oh, baby, don't worry about a thang

Thank you
Thank you very much
Thank you, thank you!
