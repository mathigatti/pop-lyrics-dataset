Boy, tell me, can you take my breath away?
Cruising down a heart-shaped highway
Got you swerving lane to lane, don't hit the brakes
'Cause I'm feeling so safe


I'll be your baby on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we go out of town?
Call me your baby, on the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowing down

You and I, I
Riding Harleys in Hawaii
I'm on the back, I'm holding tight
Want you to take me for a ride, ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good you'll take me to the jeweler, jeweler, jeweler
There's pink and purple in the sky
We're riding Harleys in Hawaii

Let me run my fingers through your salty hair
Go ahead, explore the island
Vibes so real that you can feel it in the air
I'm revving up your engine

I'll be your baby on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we go out of town?
(Why don't we go out of town?)
Call me your baby, catch the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowing down (let's go)

You and I, I
Riding Harleys in Hawaii
I'm on the back, I'm holding tight
Want you to take me for a ride, ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good you'll take me to the jeweler, jeweler, jeweler
There's pink and purple in the sky
We're riding Harleys in Hawaii

(Ah, ooh)
No, no
(Ooh)

(You and I)
You and I, I
Riding Harleys in Hawaii
I'm on the back, I'm holding tight
Want you to take me for a ride, ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good you'll take me to the jeweler, jeweler, jeweler
There's pink and purple in the sky
We're riding Harleys in Hawaii

(I'll be your baby on a Sunday, oh)
(We're riding Harleys in Hawaii)
(Call me your baby, catch the same wave)
(We're riding Harleys in Hawaii)
