You look so funny to me,
When you pretend to be something you could never be
You try to make us think you live a tough life,
But you've got your daddy's money so you'll always get by
There's a little bit of hip missing from you're hop,
You're from beverly hills stop pretending you're not
You're the full ten baby all of the way,
You will never be south central la


Got your air force ones &amp; your sean john jeans
Way to big hanging down at your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with you're worn out jeans
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

You got you're twenty inch pins as i enter the club
You're gonna keep it real you're get no love
Never seen the streets never stunned for words
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

We all know you've got it made
Drive around town in you're escalade
No matter how you fight to fix it right
You're just a trustfund baby on the inside
I'll admit for me life hasn't been to tough
I've got my own problems but they aint that rough
You can act the part you can wear the clothes
You can talk the talk everybody knows
Everybody knows yeah...

Got your air force ones &amp; your sean john jeans
Way to big hanging down at your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with you're worn out jeans
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

You got you're twenty inch pins as i enter the club
You're gonna keep it real you're get no love
Never seen the streets never stunned for words
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

Just hanging with your homies out on a friday night
Turn up the bass it's time to rock
Now don't forget the shorty's out in the club tonight
Time for you to show me all you're ice ice
Baby boy...

Got your air force ones &amp; your sean john jeans
Way to big hanging down at your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with you're worn out jeans
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

You got you're twenty inch pins as i enter the club
You're gonna keep it real you're get no love
Never seen the streets never stunned for words
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be
