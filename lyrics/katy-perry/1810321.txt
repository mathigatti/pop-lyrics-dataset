Dressing up (for you)
Dressing up (for you)


Saucer of milk, table for two
You wanna pet my kitty,
You're such a dirty doggie

It's your lucky night, 'cause I'm in the mood
Oh, I'm feeling spicy, I'm feeling real naughty.

Pick a part, you dream it up.
A dark vixen, a Lolita.
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you.

I could tell you're obsessed, by your shortness of breath.
Ooh, my Cookie Monster wants a taste test.

Be a good boy, and I'll show you the rest
Ohh, my little voyeur, wants to play explorer.

Pick a part, you dream it up.
Librarian dominatrix.
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)

Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your nine-to-five,
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you (dressin' up)

You're getting hot, so let's call the nurse,
Ooh, I feel a fever, let's take your temperature.
Better behave or a police officer will have to hold you down,
Give you what you deserve.

Pick a part, you dream it up.
Use your imagination.
Oh boy, I'll be your fantasy,
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)

Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you.

Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your nine-to-five,
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you.

Tide
Tight
Tip
Teasing
Push
Pull
Pressure
Pleasing

Beads of sweat drip down your neck
Breathing deep, gaining speed, about to peak
Trembling
Trembling
Trembling

Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.

Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you.
Dressin' up for you.
I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up for you.
I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up for you
