I'm losing all direction
Slipping into quicksand
I've shattered the illusion seen behind the curtain
I'm disenchanted
Dancing on a wire
Juggling desire
Every hit gets harder when you're fighting without armor
I'm disheartened


Do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

It's a mind maze
All these head games
Caught in a cage
A complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way

I used to be so sparkling, but now it's not so charming
What used to stimulate me now can barely wake me
I'm unresponsive
Will I find salvation, some kind of moderation?
Spinning all these plates is gonna be a challenge
A delicate balance

So do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

It's a mind maze
All these head games
Caught in a cage
A complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way

Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way

Do I start over, rediscover?
I submit to your, your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
