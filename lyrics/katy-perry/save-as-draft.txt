I remember when you used to be my every other thought
But now my calendar's so full, it's easier to move on
Sometimes I swear I pass your SUV on Sunset Boulevard
I don't fuck with change but lately I've been flipping coins a lot


I struggle, I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it, erase it, repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

You don't have to subtweet me, my number's always been the same
But all's been said and done, will we ever really close this case?
Yeah I will always be here for you but I could no longer stay
Still my body goes in shock every time I hear your name

I struggle, I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it, erase it, repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

I've heard you've done some changing, I've been rearranging
Wish that I could know but I just don't know
Never get that time back, fear we'd fall in old traps
Why can't we just let go?
Staring at a fork in the fucking road

I struggle, I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it, erase it, repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft
