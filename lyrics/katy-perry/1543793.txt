Nice legs, Daisy Dukes,
Makes a man go...
That's the way they all come through like...
Low-cut, see-through shirts that make ya...
That's the way she come through like...


'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up to knock them down,
'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them to knock them down them down

I think I should know how
to make love to something innocent
without leaving my fingerprints out,
Now, L-o-v-e's just another word
I never learned to pronounce,
How, do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word
Is just never gonna come out,
Now, L-o-v-e's just another word
I never learned to pronounce

Tight jeans, double d's makin' me go...
All the people on the street know...
Iced out, lit-up make the kids go...
All the people on the street know...

'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up to knock them down,
'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them to knock them down them down

I think I should know how
to make love to something innocent
without leaving my fingerprints out,
Now, L-o-v-e's just another word
I never learned to pronounce,
How, do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word
Is just never gonna come out,
Now, L-o-v-e's just another word
I never learned to pronounce

You know that type of shit just don't work on me
Whistlin', trying to flirt with me
Don't take it personally
'Cause we were never in love
It doesn't really matter who you say you are
Singing out the window of your car
Find another girl across bar
'Cause L-O-V-E's not what this was

I think I should know how
to make love to something innocent
without leaving my fingerprints out,
Now, L-o-v-e's just another word
I never learned to pronounce,
How, do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word
Is just never gonna come out,
Now, L-o-v-e's just another word
I never learned to pronounce
