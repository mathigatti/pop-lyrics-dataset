You gotta take the highs with the lows
Sometimes its just how it goes
And when your down to nothing at all its always predictable
Postpone your broken dreams
While flippin through the pages of a magazine
You gotta take the highs with the lows


Preacher mcgrath was always eager to ask
Why his mother rubbed her hands beneath his pants at mass
And if he missed a prayer he best beware her wrath
Caz moms would whip his *** to keep him on the path
To the son and the father plus the holy ghost
Run for cover or she bust his nose
Behind closed doors he dressed in hookers clothes
And shoot *** on his catechism, listen close
One day he got married to a bird named Peresphone
Who died giving birth to his only child Stephanie
Whose destiny was flawed, undeserved
Because god made her father a filthy perv

You gotta take the highs with the lows
Sometimes its just how it goes
And when your down to nothing at all its always predictable
Postpone your broken dreams
While flippin through the pages of a magazine
You gotta take the highs with the lows

Little Steph used to be so innocent
Now she never slept, from all the crystal meth
Her papa was a preacher so she knew the good book
And when he tucked her into bed, he fondled the nook
But baby look goof in the Honda Accord
With the chest pressed up against the dashboard
A pocket full of cash and a bottle of coors
Rev the throttle hit the gas and nash on the floor
Toward the end of the night Steph would go to score
And when the dealer dished it out she hit him up for more
A bag of skittle for the baby while Steph gets crazy
From a shot to the neck hot we and hazy
Lady of the eve maybe shed be in better health
If her father learned to keep his hands to himself

You gotta take the highs with the lows
Sometimes its just how it goes
And when your down to nothing at all its always predictable
Postpone your broken dreams
While flippin through the pages of a magazine
You gotta take the highs with the lows

Norm was born to Stephanie in '73
He became a therapist real swift with the ladies
As a baby he was brought to cop with moms
He got his face filled with candy while she marked her arms
A long shot from the start but the kid was smart
He would hit the books while the other hit the yard
He started breaking hearts back in junior high
Caz Norm could stop em dead in their tracks with his eyes
Friecely piercing past their thighs and into the stars hello goodbye
College was a breeze got A's and B's
And never missed a single party
He opened up his practice in the deep deep south
And helped damaged debuatantes ease their woes on his couch

You gotta take the highs with the lows
Sometimes its just how it goes
And when your down to nothing at all its always predictable
Postpone your broken dreams
While flippin through the pages of a magazine
You gotta take the highs with the lows
