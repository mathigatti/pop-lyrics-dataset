There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbecue
There's a hickie or a bruise


Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn!

Last friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Last friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa-oh-oah

This friday night
Do it all again
This friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail
