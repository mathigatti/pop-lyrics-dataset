Don't stop me now
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world is turning inside out yeah
And floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now
Don't stop me


'Cause I'm having a good time having a good time
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like lady godiva
I'm gonna go go go
There's no stopping me
I'm burning through the sky yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me mister fahrenheit
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time just give me a call
Don't stop me now ('cause I'm havin' a good time)
Don't stop me now (yes I'm havin' a good time)
I don't want to stop at all

I'm a rocket ship on my way to mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh oh oh oh oh explode

I'm burning through the sky yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me mister fahrenheit
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
I'm gonna make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me, don't stop me

I'm burning through the sky yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me mister fahrenheit
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time just give me a call
Don't stop me now ('cause I'm havin' a good time)
Don't stop me now (yes I'm havin' a good time)
I don't want to stop at all
