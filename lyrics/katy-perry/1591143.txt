tweleve noon watch her sleeping in your room
why cant that still be me
two o clock and im still driving round your block
feeling a little crazy


you change your number and move to the suburbs
you run but you cant hide
you thought id forget all of your passwords
but i like showing up at your place
so suprising is that look on your face

underneath your street light
blowing kissing every night
psycho love forever
im right outside your window
throwong rocks and starting fights
psycho love forever

so weeks pass and i found myself another guy
someone who loves me equally
the tables turn and youre not happy
when you learn hes moving in with me
he bought me a big ring we moved to the city
now you wont stop calling
caz you always thought that youd always your candy
now your showing up at my place
not suprising we both play this game

your underneath my street light
blowing kisses everynight
psycho love forever
your right outside my window
throwing rocks and starting fights

lalalalala....forever
