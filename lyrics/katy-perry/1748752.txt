KP: Hi Elmo!
Elmo: Hi Ms. Katy
KP: Are you ready to play "dress up"?
Elmo: "Dress up"?
KP: You say that you wanna play "dress up", don't you?!
Elmo: Hmm
KP: C'mon Elmo, don't you wanna play?


You wanna play so I wore dressed up clothes
Then you runaway, leave me here in this pose
How am I suppose to play with you?

You're up then you're down
You're running around
You're faster then you're slow
You stop then you go

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
I'm starting to doubt

You
You don't really wanna play, no
You just really wanna go

We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
Used to love, how we played
Now you just runaway
Didn't know, that you are gonna change

You're up then you're down
You're running around
You're faster then you're slow
You stop then you go

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
I'm starting to doubt

Someone stop the monster
Gonna chasing me all over
How to catch him, I wonder
He is to quick for me

You
You don't really wanna play, no
You just really wanna go

You're up then you're down
You're running around
You're faster then you're slow
You stop then you go

KP: Elmo, do you wanna play?
Elmo: Elmo is playing Ms. Katy. I'm a
KP: Not again
