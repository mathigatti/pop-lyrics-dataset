1, 2, 3, go!

If the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking


And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
Now I am looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter

'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold

I looked up into the gray sky
And see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black

I feel the weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter

'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter

'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
