I leave the gas on
Walk the allies in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention?
Cause I'm sending all the signs that


The clock is ticking
And I'll be giving my 2 weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black
You'd best prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me

I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship, oh

Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education
I swore way too much
But I swear you didn't care
'Cause we were in love

So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
Know it's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me

I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Oh, we've been diagnosed
So let's give up the ghost

'Cause I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship, oh
