I made it through
The wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you


I was beat incomplete
I'd been had
I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Chorus:
Like a virgin
Touched
For the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
(After first time
"With your heartbeat")
Next to mine

Gonna give you
All my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine
And you're mine
Make me strong
Yeah
You make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah
Your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

(Chorus)

Oooh, oooh, oooh

You're so fine
And you're mine
I'll be yours
'Till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah
You made me feel
I've nothing to hide

(Chorus)

Like a virgin
Ooh, ooh
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, baby
Can't you hear
My heart beat
For the very
First time?
