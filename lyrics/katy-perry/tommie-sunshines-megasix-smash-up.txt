Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
The one
Baby, you're a california gurls


Let's go all the way tonight, no regrets, just love
We can dance until we die,
You and I will be young forever

You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch now baby I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'mma get your heart racing in my skin tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water

You can travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love

California gurls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun kissed skin, so hot, will melt your popsicle

California gurls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West coast represent, now put your hands up

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one, the one
The one, the one
The one, the one

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away

There's a stranger in my bed,
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room,
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar,
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbecue,
There's a hickie or a bruise

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a black top blur,
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn!

Last friday night,
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots,
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last friday night,
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar,
So we hit the boulevard

Last friday night,
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark,
Then had a menage a trois
Last friday night,
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop, oh
This friday night,
Do it all again

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

You're so hypnotising
Could you be the devil, could you be an angel
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
They say, be afraid
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA, they don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, kiss me
Infect me with your loving and fill me with your poison
Take me, take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
It's supernatural, extra-terrestrial

Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again

Do you ever feel
Feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in

Do you ever feel
Already buried deep
Six feet under screams
And no one seems to hear a thing

Do you know that there's
Still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta

Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "ah, ah, ah"
As you shoot across the sky

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
