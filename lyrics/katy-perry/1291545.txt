What are you lookin' at?
(Yeah)


I saw this coming 
From a mile away
I saw a crack 
In the egg
A little rip 
In the page

I found 
Your necklace 
On the floor
Underneath the bed
Where you said
I was the only one

You thought i'd cry
(You-thought-i'd-cry)
You thought i'd lay 
Down and die
You thought 
There's no 
Hetting over you
(Ha-ha)

And all this time
(All-this-time)
You've been having 
Your fun
I've been having 
Some fun too

Cause' it 
Takes one to know one
Congrats 
You've met your match
You think I'd lie here 
Heartbroken
But the knife 
Is in your back
(In-your-back)

You left your suit 
You left your tie
And looked me in the eye
And swore that it 
Was business baby
(Yeah right)

And when you left 
I got a call
That started it all
And now 
It's not your business 
Ba-by

You thought i'd cry
(You-thought-i'd-cry)
You thought i'd lay 
Down and die
You thought 
There's no 
Getting over you
(Ha-ha)

But all this time
(All-this-time)
You've been having 
Your fun
I've been having 
Some fun too

Cause' it 
Takes one to know one
Congrats 
You've met your match
You think i'd lie here 
Heartbroken
(I'd-lie-here)
But the knife 
Is in your back
(In-your-back)

You're such a wreck
The cutest accident
Makes so much sense
You'll come 
Back to me 
Oh
(Ahhhh)

And i'll let you

Hey
Huh 
You're back

Cause' it takes one 
To know one
Congrats 
You've met your match
You think 
I'd lie here 
Heartbroken
(I'd-lie-here)
But the knife 
Is in you're back
(In-your-back)

Cause' it 
Takes one to know one
(Hi, nice to meet you)
Congrats 
You've met your match
You think 
I'd lie here 
Heartbroken
(I'll-lie-here)
But the knife 
Is in your back
(In-your-back)
