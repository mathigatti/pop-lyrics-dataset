I felt it
The wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter
I never saw it coming
I started to black out and
Then someone said "good morning"
I took it as a warning
I should've seen it coming
So now I'll take a chance on


This thing we may have started
Intentional or not I
Don't think we saw it coming
It's all adding up to something
That asked for some involvement
That asked for our commitment
I think I see it coming
If we steped out on that limb

My heart beat, beats me senselessly
Why's everything got to be so intense with me?
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot
But I say "why not?"
If I say "forget it"
I know that I'll regret it

It's a long shot
Just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take the long shot

I realize
That there is all this doubting
Since we're both scared about that
We'll never see 'em coming
Throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing
And 'til it's fooling no one
Will never see it coming
'Til it's much to close to stop

My heart beat, beats me senselessly
Why's everything got to be so intense with me?
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot
But I say "why not?"
If I say "forget it"
I know that I'll regret it

It's a long shot
Just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
'Cause I'm the best you got
So take the long shot

What a pleasant surprise
What a breath of fresh air
You knock the wind out of me
Blindsided and so unaware

Oh, I waited
For fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming
But we'll make it even though

It's a long shot
But I say "why not?"
If I say "forget it"
I know that I'll regret it

It's a long shot
Just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take the long shot

You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw me coming
You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw this coming

I take the long shot
I take the long shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
'Cause you're the best I got

Oh, I'll take on this chance on you, baby
I'll take on this chance on you, baby
I take on this chance
I'm taking a chance
