This was big for us
Forever changing you and me
Allow me to be ambiguous
Though I can't stand ambiguity
I'll beat around this burning bush
Trying to put the fire out
When all the shoving came to push
The words just stayed stuck in my mouth


'Cause it's ok to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone
Ba dum ba dum
It's ok to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba dum ba dum

So we might lose
But I'm glad I didn't leave
I wear my soul on my shoes
If not my heart upon my sleeve
If I'm not allowed to speak aloud
Of what you really mean to me
Then I'll type it bold when I spell it out
I-T-S L-O-V-E

'Cause it's ok to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba dum ba dum
It's ok to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba dum ba dum

So why do I hesitate?
Wait for my cocoon to break?
Second guess every move that I make
(Second guess every move that you make)

This was big for us
Changing you and me

It's ok to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
It's ok to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba dum ba dum

Oh, somebody tell me

'Cause it's ok to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba dum ba dum

Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
