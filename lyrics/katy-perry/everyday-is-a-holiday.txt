My fire through cold nights
The brightest of all lights
You are my home
Wherever we go


We don't need a thing under the tree
You're giving me all I need

Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason, you are the reason

My heart can't stop singing
You can't fight this feeling
Unspeakable joy
Ringing through my soul

We don't need a thing under the tree
You're giving me all I need

Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason, you are the reason

We don't need a thing under the tree
Cause you give me all I need

Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason, when you're the reason
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason
