Chorus

Please do not analyze me
It is not looking
my every weakness
If anyone stand up to scrutiny
deep, the more I!
Jealous, demanding, insecure, needy
all full of life left marks:
See each requirement
a cry of need,
a call for love!


Love, love is short,
a data integration:
that there is nothing less.
I do not cut into slices,
(Nobody hugs a piece)
wrap me in your arms all
And I'll be perfect, love!



If so get at me
Wanting me, looking
I do not know I'll love
I was not even thinking
But you got me sinking
And now matter where you go

I won will have to take me
You see me just the way I am
It is and it makes me all that well either
That I know so little about you
And you want me to fear

If so get at me
Wanting me, looking
I do not know I'll love
I was not even thinking
But you were taking
And now no matter where you go
I won, will have to take me
Is good with you anywhere

{chorus} walk tired of life,
Waiting for your love,
Looking for an exit,
To forget my pain ...

Day in and day out,
Without ever find you,
And power in a nice hug,
My love to tell you ...

I cried for hours,
Already choked my pain,
Just could not yet
Forget this love ...
Sometimes I get flustered,
Trying not to think of you,
But my ungrateful heart,
Can not get enough of love ...

I will not live my life,
Running away from your love,
I'm afraid migrant,
Suffer for lack of love.

"None"


I devoured all dictionaries

there,

searching for a word

I set up the

I feel for you,

I lost my time,

I feel for you,
