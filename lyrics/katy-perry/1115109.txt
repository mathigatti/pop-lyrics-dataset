(Your mind may refuse to believe)

I hope you hang yourself with your H&amp;M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway


You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock, it's almost an art
You need SPF forty-five
Just to stay alive

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a happy meal
You're so skinny, you should really super size the deal
Secretly, you're so amused
That nobody understands you

I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you outta your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love
With someone that wears more makeup than

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like

You're so gay
You're so gay

You walk around like you're, oh, so debonair
You pull 'em down and there's really nothing there
I wish you would just be real with me

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys

You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like penis!
