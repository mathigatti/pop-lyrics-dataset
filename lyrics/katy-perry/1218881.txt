You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch
I would know
And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me


'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You)
You don't really want to stay, no
(You)
But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain' boring
I should know
That you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You)
You don't really want to stay, no
(You)
But you don't really want to go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up and you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You)
You don't really wanna stay, no
(You)
But you don't really wanna go
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down
