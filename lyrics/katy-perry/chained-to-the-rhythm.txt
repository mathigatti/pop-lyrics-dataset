Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white-picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble


Aren't you lonely?
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

(Aah)
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie

Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie

Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we can do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

(Aah)
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie

Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie

Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie (like a wasted zombie)

Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

(Turn it up) it goes on, and on, and on
(Turn it up) it goes on, and on, and on
(It goes on, and on, and on)
It goes on, and on, and on
(On, and on, and on)
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
