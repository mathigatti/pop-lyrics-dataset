One day I was sitting in class
''Gotta know'', they'd said,
"Watch your back"
Someone told me who it was from
She wasn't happy
'Cause she just got dumped
It was over
But not in her mind
It's not my fault he left her behind
I always knew they had a history
I didn't know that it included me


She wasn't ready to let him go
Now I'm dealing with a psycho

My boyfriend's
Ex-Girlfriend
I think she's going off the deep end
She loves him
She hates me
They broke up
Now she wants to blame me
Na, na, na, na, na

Went to a party on the Saturday night
I wasn't planning to getting a bite
All I wanted was to have some fun
You know I never wanna hurt no one
She walked up thinking she was so tough
She stood me down but she had to look good
Then she started to lose control
What can I say?
That's rock and roll

I wasn't sure but now I know
That I'm dealing with a psycho

My boyfriends
Ex-Girlfriends
I think she's going off the deep end
She loves him
She hates me
They broke up
Now she wants to blame me

Wake up girl 'cause it's over
It's time to get a life
Go cry over your own shoulder
Hey you see now he's mine

My boyfriends
Ex-Girlfriends
I think she's going off the deep end
She loves him
She hates me
They broke up
Now she wants to blame me

My boyfriends
Ex-Girlfriends
My boyfriends
Ex-Girlfriends

Na, na, na, na, na?

My boyfriends
Ex-Girlfriends
My boyfriends
Ex-Girlfriends

Na, na, na, na, na?
