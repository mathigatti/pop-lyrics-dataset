The leaves were falling I was seventeen
We'd been locking lips
Grabbing hips, smoking cigarettes
We took a drive in your 1990 the hand me down
From out of town I was California
Oh my legs were not shaved
and you had dirt between your fingers
They told us to behave, but hey


Its not like riding a bike
Its not like flying a kite
Its not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time

Not like taking a bath
Its not like having a laugh
Not like reading a map
There's nothing like the first time

I had seen it in the magazines
We would change the channel on the TV screen
'Cause its such a sin what you did to me
Straight to hell is what they sell if you done the deed

Oh but what could be so bad
Oh if everyone is guilty
I guess we want what we can't have
'Cause I've heard
Its not like riding a bike
Its not like flying a kite
Its not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time

Not like taking a bath
Its not like having a laugh
Not like reading a map
There's nothing like the first time

Do you remember? Do you remember?
Do you remember? Do you remember?

La la la la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time

Its not a walk in the park
Its not a shot in the dark
Its not a juvenile crime
There's nothing like the first time

Its not like tying the knot
There's no connecting the dots
and in case you forgot
There's nothing like the first time

There's nothing like the first time
There's nothing like the first time
There's nothing like the first time

Its not like reading a map
Oh ya you give me laugh
There's nothing like the first time
