'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a- bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a- bon appétit, baby


[Katy Perry]
Looks like you've been starving
You've got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cooking, boy

[Katy Perry]
(Let me take you)
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
(And it's okay)
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

[Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy

Bon a- bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a- bon appétit, baby

[Katy Perry]
So you want some more
Well, I'm open 24
Wanna keep you satisfied
Customer's always right
Hope you've got some room
For the world's best cherry pie
Gonna hit that sweet tooth, boy

Sweet potato pie (sweet)
It'll change your mind (change)
Got you running back for seconds (runnning)
Every single night (ay)

[Takeoff]
I'm the one they say can change your life (Takeoff)
No waterfall, she drippin' wet, d'you like my ice? (Blast)
Say she want a Migo night, I ask her: What's the price? (Hold on)
If she do right, told her get whatever you like (Offset)

[Offset]
I grab her legs and now divide, I
Make her do a donut when she ride, I
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine and my diamonds change the climate

[Quavo]
Sweet tooth (sweet), no tooth fairy (no)
Whipped cream (whipped), no dairy (no)
She got her hot light on, screaming: I'm ready
But no horses, no carriage

(Go ahead)

[Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy (all that you want)
All that you can have, boy (oh)
Got me spread like a buffet (ay)
Bon a- bon appétit, baby (eat it up, eat it up, eat it up)
Appetite for seduction (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fresh out the oven (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a- bon appétit, baby (bon appétit)

Under candle light
Bon appétit, baby
