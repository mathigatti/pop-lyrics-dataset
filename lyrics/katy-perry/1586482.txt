I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in period one
Fridays at 8:15


Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
I saw you talkin' to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen

I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

I used to work in a record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off of hard wood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in L.A.
That seems to be where everbody else ends up these days

But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

And I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
If you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for  you
