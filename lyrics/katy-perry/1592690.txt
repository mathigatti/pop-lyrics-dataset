I'm the dandy highwayman who you're too scared to mention
I spend my cash on looking flash and grabbing your attention
The devil take your stereo and your record collection!
The way you look youll qualify for next years old age pension!


Stand and deliver your money or your life!
Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife!

I'm the dandy highwayman so sick of easy fashion
The clumsy boots, peek-a-boo roots that people think so dashing
So what's the point of robbery when nothing is worth taking?
Its kind of tough to tell a scruff the big mistake hes making

Stand and deliver your money or your life!
Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife!

And even though you fool your souls
Your conscience will be mine
All mine

Were the dandy highwaymen so tired of excuses
Of deep meaning philosophies where only showbiz loses
Were the dandy highwaymen and heres our invitation
Throw your safety overboard and join our insect nation

Stand and deliver your money or your life!
Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife!

And even though you fool your souls
Your conscience will be mine, all mine

Da diddley qa qa da diddley qa qa
Da diddley qa qa da diddley qa qa

Stand and deliver your money or your life!
Stand and deliver your money or your life!...
