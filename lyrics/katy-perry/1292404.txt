Did it seem to disappoint you
Living alone?
By the banks of your dilemma
Out of control
No one seems to give the answers that you wanna hear
What you'd give to find a welcome here


Miles and miles of lies behind you
Those were the days
So many lives you'd hope would guide you
Help you find a way
Now it seems to your surprise that they left you lying here
What you'd give to dry these bitter tears

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

Heaven waits, the hours of silence
Finds you on your knees
Broken in a sweet surrender
Of peace
All the years of searching for a love you didn't know
Now you've finally found a welcome home

CHORUS

Music break

BRIDGE:
I love you, I have and I always will.

CHORUS(2x)
