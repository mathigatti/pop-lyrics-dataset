I turn my head, there's nothing there
All I own is my thoughts for my fears
I close the door to keep out the bad
I plug my ears to keep out these fears


And I cry...

So hold me close for I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me. (Repeat)

I listen to these voices or is it this house that's giving me chills,
As I lie upon this little girls bed
Who's at the door? Who's walking near? Or has my imagination spilled?
This little girl all grown up still fears

Oh and I cry!

CHORUS(2x)

Where can I go where can I hide from these evil sufferings?
Oh these images painted on my walls
They say there's a place that I can hide in the shadow of your wings
Oh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge

No more tears.

CHORUS(4x)
