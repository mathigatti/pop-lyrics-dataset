I got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways
I'm tryin' to bathe my ape (ape) in your milky way (way)
I'm a legend, I'm irreverent, I'll be reverend
I'll be so far up, up, up, up
We don't give a fuc-, uh oh
Welcome to the danger zone, step into the fantasy
You are now invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me an alien, a big-headed astronaut
Maybe it's because your boy, Yeezy, get ass a lot


You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say, be afraid!
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your loving
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
(Boy,) boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extra-terrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your laser
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your loving
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
(Boy,) boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extra-terrestrial

This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all, all

I know a bar out in Mars
Where they're drivin' spaceships instead of cars
Coup a Prada space suit about stars
Gettin' stupid high, straight up out the jars
Pockets on shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next, alien sex?
I'ma disrobe you, then I'ma probe you
See, I abducted you so I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your loving
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
(Boy) boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extra-terrestrial

Extra-terrestrial
Extra-terrestrial

Boy, boy you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extra-terrestrial
