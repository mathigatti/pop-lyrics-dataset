We can't keep playing house
With such a big world outside
How do we shut it out?
At a fork in the road
Should I stay or should I go?
I'll keep the cat
Leave a spare under the mat
If you need to cash one day


Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don't you think we're just too young
To play these grown up games?

Cause you know me too well
It'd be like me lying to myself
But I'm so scared to be alone
And go back to sleeping with the lights on

Cause I can be myself
Drunk or sober fat proactive poster
Wouldn't it be nice
If we were older

Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don't you think we're just too young
To play these grown up games

Some days I wanna take my chances
Not live so modernized
Some day I wanna be a Mrs.
But it's not yet quite right
No it's not yet quite right

So there go our future children's names
I put the rest of us in a box in the closet
That I cannot open without getting full
Full of emotion
Because you know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you

Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don't you think we're just too young
To play

One day I wanna take my chances
Not live so modernized
One day I wanna be a Mrs.
But it's not yet quite right
No it's not yet quite right
No it's not yet quite right
