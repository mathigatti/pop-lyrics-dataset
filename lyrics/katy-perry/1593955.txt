I will not philosophize about the meaning of life
Let's take no time, cause the teasing isn't right
Let's skip the foreplay, we know were gonna do it anyways
'Cause all I'm selling is


Sex, sex
On your radio, selling is
Sex, sex
Just like a machine

Have you seen my video
Look at me, I'm dancing in slow-mo
And the ad campain I'm bathing in champagne
'Cause I'm a lady
Good for one thing maybe
And all I'm selling is

Sex, sex
On your radio, selling is
Sex, sex
Just like a machine

A machine
Yeah, a machine

All I'm selling is
Sex baby
Sex baby, sex
On your radio, all I'm selling is sex
Just like a machine

Will you be my sugar daddy if I promise to behave
Then you can have me but you'll be digging your own grave
Oh its not worth it I've already done my circuit
All I'm selling is, all I'm giving is, all I'm selling is

Sex, sex
On your radio, selling is
Sex, sex
Just like a machine

I'm selling it, sex
On your radio
I'm selling it, sex
Just like a machine
