Were lookin in the same direction
but you dont see what i see
just a half moon in your perception
it looks full to me
oh my head is caught, caught in clouds
and your buried so, so far down


You drag me down to earth
you stomp my heart it hurts
you weigh me down
the way your pulling me, youre worse than gravity
you weigh me down
you weigh me down

Your words can pollute the future
so you should choose carefully
cynical is a natural born killer
if it were up to me i would say
lets get you all medicated
so we can get dedicated

You drag me down to earth
you stomp my heart it hurts
you weigh me down
the way youre pulling me, youre worse than gravity
you weigh me down
you weigh me down

This is not a race this is the relationship
but you take the cake at being the worst in it
try and keep me grounded
you took my faith and nearly drowned it

This is not a test this is the relationship
you are the best in being mr negative

You weigh meee down..

You drag me down to earth
you stomp my heart it hurts
you weigh me down
the way youre pulling me, youre worse than gravity
you weigh me down
you weigh me down

You drag me down to earth
you stomp my heart it hurts
you weigh me down
the way youre pulling me, youre worse than gravity
you weigh me down
you weigh me down

You..weigh..me..down...mee..down
