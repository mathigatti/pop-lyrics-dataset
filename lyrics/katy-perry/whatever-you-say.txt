Crazy that the world is round
And we have our upside downs
And it's more than a miracle
That I even met you
Crazy how I went on dates
For you to say the words you say
And sometimes it's the little things that
That come to get you


I can feel the distance
Baby, maybe you can save me
This is real love, real love
I can see the problem isn't
Hanging onto any piece of you love, you love

Now don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life and never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life but never, ever let go now
Oh, oh

Save me when I rip the cord
And hang on so I don't get bored
And pull me when I kiss the ground
It's so nice to know you
Go 'head, you can chase the light
Kick back when it gets too bright
'Cause my world is another world
I'd, I'd like to show you

I can see the problem isn't
Hanging onto any piece of you love, you love

Now don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life and never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life but never, ever let go now
No, no

I can see the problem isn't
Hanging onto any piece of you love, you love

Now don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life and never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life but never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
