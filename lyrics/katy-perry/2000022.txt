You know it's crazy, 'cause nights like this
Would start out with a little private party
You sneak me in your mom's house
I know I gonna spill my drink, but
I wasn't tryin' spill my heart out
It started as a conversation
I was really tryin' to get my toss out
But then we make moves and we make plans


Had the whole thing mapped out
See, you were gonna go to college
And to pay for bills, I'd figure a job out
And you knew I had to say it
But that days gone
Now I moved on and you switched phones
Hopefully reincarnation will
Bring us back to the place we belong

Summer after high school when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parent's liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The o-o-o-o-o-one (x3)
The One That Got Away

Falling for you like dominoes
From the top of the hundredth floor
Look out below Geronimo
Tryin' to get behind the closed doors to your soul
Why'd you have to and the show
We had such a beautiful plot
There was still more story to go
Now look, I'm not insinuating that
You're some type of fear weather player

But even if the whole world falls over
I wouldn't be aware of a glacier
I just wanna see you wake up
Doing your hair in the mirror
With your make-up
Then, maybe in the next lifetime
We could make up

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The o-o-o-o-o-one (x3)
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
