My mama warned me about boys like you
It's the reason I wear these steel-toed boots - yeah
And let me give you a little piece of advice
My papa packs heat and he won't think twice - yeah


Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Too much trouble, better stay away
Grab your hat, better get gone
But if you stay, you've been warned

I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for you heart
Yeah, yeah
Be careful what you start

I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for you heart
Yeah, yeah
It's gonna leave a mark

Well, every now and then I make a man break a sweat
Watch him work overtime, earn my respect - yeah
'Cause I'm the kinda girl that you wanna show off
I'll tell 'em all your friends with a Southern drawl - yeah

Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Sweet as a peach, impossible to tame
Fingers on the trigger and you'll be to blame
'Cause if you stay

I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for you heart
Yeah, yeah
Be careful what you start

I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for you heart
Yeah, yeah
It's gonna leave a mark

Yeah, I ride where the wind wants to take me
Leaving lovers in the dust, every city
'Cause my heart was like a ghost town, baby
But now I met a man that breaks me

My mama warned me about boys like you
It's the reason I wear these steel-toed boots

I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for you heart
Yeah, yeah
Be careful what you start

I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for you heart
Yeah, yeah
It's gonna leave a mark

Straight for your heart
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for you heart
Yeah, yeah
It's gonna leave a mark
