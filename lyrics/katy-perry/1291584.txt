We woke up late, said goodbye
Now I'm standing outside, on the street
I walk through the city I'm laughing
Bouquets staring down at my feet


And I look up and this sky might fall
Open up and pull me in
I feel like an angel who's fallen
I just got to have this first taste of original sin

Damn, can you feel it?
Damn, I can't believe it
Damn, you got me feelin' good

Damn, do you dig it?
That's the way you do it
Damn, you know, you give it good

Two minutes later, I'm counting
The seconds and hours to go
I'm working a sweat out of bed
Just the thought of you is making me glow

I'm goin' about it, you gave it good
You're back up, can't just leave it alone
I'm walking from acres across
Now I'm going home to do it all again on my own

Damn, can you feel it?
Damn, I can't believe it
Damn, you got me feelin' good

Damn, do you dig it?
That's the way you do it
Damn, you know, you give it good

You got my tongue It's so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair Is standing up on my skin
And I keep sayin'

Damn, do you dig it?
That's the way you do it
Damn, you know, you give it good

Waltz through the door and into your room
'Cause this whole world lies
But you tell me the truth

Think I'll give you up?
You're not gonna let me down
Your love is like an ocean
And I'm starting to drown

Damn, can you feel it?
Damn, I can't believe it
Damn, you got me feelin' good

Damn, do you dig it?
That's the way you do it
Damn, you know, you give it good

You got my tongue it's so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep sayin'

Damn, do you dig it?
That's the way you do it
Damn, you know, you give it good

Oh yeah, yeah
I can't believe it, I can't believe it
Oh yeah, you got me feelin' good
Good Good Good
Uh!
