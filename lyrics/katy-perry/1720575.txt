I think about you all the time,
One look, my knees get weak practically die
So hard to sleep
When I'm so close to this dream coming true
True, true
How do I tell, tell you?
When...


[Kesha and Katy]
I can't speak
I'm terrified 'cause if I
Say the wrong thing
You might see how hard I'm trying
Is this made up or true love?
Is this true love
Is this true love

Walk by and I'm a nervous wreck
The way you smell
The way you dress ( is so perfect )
My tongue is tied 'cause I can't
Translate these feelings inside
Ide, ide, Oh.

[Kesha and Katy]
I can't speak
I'm terrified 'cause if I
Say the wrong thing
You might see how hard I'm trying
Is this made up or true love?
Is this true love
Is this true love

I want to tell you my secrets and tell you everything,
My heart is racing i'm waiting for some time from you
How do i say your too my (true love)
Tell me you feel it too my (true love)

[Kesha and Katy]
I can't speak
I'm terrified 'cause if I
Say the wrong thing
You might see how hard I'm trying
Is this made up or true love?
Is this true love
Is this true love
