I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agree politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything


You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready, ‘cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
‘Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're gonna hear me

I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
‘Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
‘Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
There's no going back
There's no going back

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion

It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

You think I'm pretty
Without any makeup on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punchline wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me
I was alright, but things
Were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my valentine, valentine

You make me feel
Like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now, baby, I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys, break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek

California gurls
We're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh, oh, oh, oh

California gurls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Missy be puttin' it down
I'm the hottest 'round
I told y'all mother-ooh
Y'all can't stop me now
Listen to me now
I'm lasting twenty rounds
And if you want me (nigga) then come and get me now
Is you with me now?
Then biggie-biggie-bounce
I know you dig the way i sw-sw-switch my style
(Holla) people sing around
Now people gather 'round
Now people jump around

Go, get ur freak on

Get a pedicure, get your hair did

Music make u lose control
Music make u lose control

Thick legs n shape
Rump shakin both wayz

Flo froppa head knocka
Beat stalla tail droppa
Do ma thang muthafukas

Everybody here
Get it outta control
Get yo backs off tha wall
Cuz misdemeanor said so

Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Music make u lose control

Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again

Do you ever feel
Feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in

Do you ever feel
Already buried deep
Six feet under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing

Do you know that there's
Still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta
Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the 4th of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah!"
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah!"
You're gonna leave them all in "Awe, awe, awe"

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah!"
You're gonna leave them all in "Awe, awe, awe"

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Yeah
