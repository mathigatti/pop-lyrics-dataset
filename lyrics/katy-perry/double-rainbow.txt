You’re a one-of-a-one, a one-of-a-kind
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks open a gold mine


They say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
When I found you it was all pitter-patter

Secretly, I hit the lottery
‘Cause you’re brighter than all of Northern Lights
You speak to me, even in my dreams
Wouldn’t let you go for even the highest price

They say one man’s trash is another girl’s treasure
So if it’s up to me, I’m gonna keep you forever

'Cause I understand you, we see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

Was a phenomenon when you came along
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science
It was defining, loud like lightning
It was striking, you couldn’t deny it

They say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
The two of us together make everything glitter

'Cause I understand you, we see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

To the bottom of the sea I’d go to find you
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you
Every step I take I’m keeping you in mind

'Cause I understand you, we see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

It’s hard to find
Oh, it’s hard to find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
