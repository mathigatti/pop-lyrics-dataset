Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember, to let her into your heart
Then you can start, to make it better


Hey, Jude, don't let me down
You have found her now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain
Hey, Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders

For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Na na na na na na na na, Hey Jude
Na, na na na na na, na na na, Hey Jude
Na, na na na na na, na na na, Hey Jude
