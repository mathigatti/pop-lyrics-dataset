If I ever broke up with you, I regret it. If I find a picture of me alone,
It would be a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad photograph. If I ever dumped you,
Never ment it. If I find a memorie by myself, it's badly, badly, badly,
Badly cursed for my memories. If I ever wanted you back, I think I would
Run fast. I want you, you want me.
If I ever broke up with you, I regret it. If I find a picture of me alone,
It would be a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad photograph.


What the heck was I thinking running away like that? How stupid of me, yeah
Yeah.
