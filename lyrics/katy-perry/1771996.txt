I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention


You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration, could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
Oh, just, just, just wasting time

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out 'till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Oh, don't take my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

Throw it away
Throw it away

I made a fire and I'm watching it burn
Thought of your future
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last
No, no, no, have you no ambitions?

My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air
And dreaming I'm a doctor
It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand
Oh, I feel so...

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out 'till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Oh, don't take my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

And this is my four-leaf clover
I'm on the line
One open mind
This is my four-leaf clover

Nanananana...

Funny how times flies
