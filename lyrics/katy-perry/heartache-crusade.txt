It's a heartache crusade
Nothing but a heartache crusade
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down


It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fools game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache crusade
Nothing but a heartache crusade
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you
It's a heartache crusade
