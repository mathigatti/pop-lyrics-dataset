Word on the street, you got somethin' to show me, me
Magical, colorful, Mr. Mystery, ee
I'm intrigued, for a peek, Heard it's fascinating

Come on baby let me see
What you're hiding underneath

Words up your sleeve
Such a tease
Wanna see the show
In 3D, a movie
Heard it's beautiful
Be the judge
And my girls gonna take a vote

Come on baby let me see
what you're hiding underneath

I want the jaw droppin', eye popin', head turnin', body shockin'
(Uh, uh, oh, Uh, uh, uh, oh)
I want my heart throbbin', ground shakin', show stoppin', amazin'
(Uh, uh, oh, Uh, uh, uh, oh)

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken boy, stop acting like a bitch
I'ma peace out if you don't give me the pay off
Come on baby let me see
