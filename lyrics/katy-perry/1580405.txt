Got a call from my friend
She saw my picture again
In a magazine
We laughed out loud
'Cause she said: Remember when
This was all a silly dream?


Now I wake up every day in a different city
A smile on my face, somebody pinch me!
She said: All the world's your stage â€” but, girl, you know
Those cameras and lights won't ever change me

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into blue jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

Yeah, it's amazing to hear
People singing along
Hear the radio playing my songs
Still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside
In the spotlight

But every now and then on those Friday nights
Cruising down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend Saturday sleeping in late
Yeah, those were the good days

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into blue jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

And even when I'm miles away
I'll always have the roots from where I came
'Cause when it all fades away
My home will still be the same

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into blue jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into blue jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into blue jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
