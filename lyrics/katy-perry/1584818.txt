I've played the song,
now it drives me crazy
I've run the race,
now I'm too damn lazy
this love of ours
is a fading photograph
yeah yeah
now I must approach to laugh today
seems a little different hard to say
but it looks like the end


Time's up
promise this time I'm getting off
better we slam the door shut
didn't you know if nothing changes
nothing changes
Time's up
promise this time I'm getting off
better we turn the lights off
love is a train we wait for it
even when it's gone

We've surfed the wave
now we've hit the short end
we've squeezed the fruit
till there's no more juice left
We're both so good
good at keeping up the lie
yeah yeah
hey but no one's got to die we can
get it in prospective,
kiss my lips,
life is what we make it

Time's up
promise this time I'm getting off
better we slam the door shut
didn't you know if nothing changes
nothing changes
Time's up
promise this time I'm getting off
better we turn the lights off
love is a train we wait for it
even when it's gone

As I'm waving you goodbye
I want your to smile
save a picture in your frame
file it right next to my name

I'm willing to die
for love willing to try
but no willing to lie for love
I know that this cakes already baked
now its burning, burning

We can get it in prospective
kiss my lips
life is what we make it

Time's up
promise this time I'm getting off
better we slam the door shut
didn't you know if nothing changes
nothing changes
Time's up
(even when it's gone)
promise this time I'm getting off
(even when it's gone)
better we turn the lights off
love is a train we wait for it
yeah yeah yeah
even when it's gone
even when it's gone
if nothing changes,
nothing changes
Time's up
(even when)
promise this time I'm getting off
(even when)
better we turn the lights off
love is a train we wait for it
even when it's gone
