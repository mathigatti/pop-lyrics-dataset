This is the last time, you say
After the last you line you break
It’s not even a holiday
Nothing to celebrate


You give a hundred reasons why
And say you’re really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I’d own the bank

Thought that I was the exception
I could rewrite your addiction
You could've been the greatest
But you’d rather get wasted

You fall asleep during foreplay
‘Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I’m not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can’t be your savior, I don’t have the power
I’m not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

You say it helps you write your rhymes
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You’ve become what you despise
A stereotype

You think you’re so rock and roll
But you’re really just a joke
Had the world in the palm of your hands
But you're fucking choked

Should've been my teammate
Could've changed your fate
You say that you love me
You won’t remember in the morning

You fall asleep during foreplay
‘Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I’m not sticking around to watch you go down (oh)
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can’t be your savior, I don’t have the power
I’m not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(You, you, you, you)

You fall asleep during foreplay
‘Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I’m not sticking around (I'm not sticking around) to watch you go down (I'm not sticking around)
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can’t be your savior, I don’t have the power
I’m not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain

You’re going down
You’re going down
You’re going down
You’re going down, down

You fall asleep during foreplay
‘Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I’m not sticking around to watch you go down
