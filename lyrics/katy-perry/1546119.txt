So, when my voice breaks
It's called interpretation
When I hold a note
It's 'cause I want to
Not 'cause I feel anything about you
So don't flatter yourself thinking that I love you
Make you emotional
From major to the minor
When I lose control
I'm not trying to impress you
Break it down and I get your attention
But it's just formula, I don't need your validation
Validation


This is just a song
The music plays and then
Then it's gone again
This is just a song
The words don't mean a thing
So every time I sing I loved you all along
Remember, remember this is just a song

Now, I feel nothing
Yes, I'm on auto pilot
I have sung these words
Even sing 'em while I'm sleeping
Just 'cause you have showed up here to see me
Doesn't mean I'm going home with you this evening
I know December is the month we met
But it rhymes with remember
Or did you forget I was only giving a performance?
I hadn't noticed you were in the audience
In, in the audience

This is just a song
The music plays and then
Then it's gone again
This is just a song
The words don't mean a thing
So everytime I sing I loved you all along
Remember, remember this is just

Everybody knows that this is just a song
And I don't feel a thing for you
Everybody knows that rhythm, rhyme and structure
Doesn't mean I love you
Oh, no

This is just a song
The music plays and then
Then it's gone again
This is just a song
The words don't mean a thing
So every time I sing I loved you all along
Remember, remember this is just
It's just a song
