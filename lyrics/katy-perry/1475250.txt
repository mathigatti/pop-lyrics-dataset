The weight of my words
Are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves but you won't hear a thing


Cause I've dug myself deep
I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach

In one ear
And out your other
So lock and key
You won't open up for me

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving, ah...
I'm not giving, ah...
On us

And it feels like you're in China
And I am in Peru
Whenever I am sleeping next to you, oh...
We can hear the crickets singing
Oh, all throughout the night
Oh boy, can't you just get used
To something so right?

And sure, I confess
I'm a mess
I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten
Before you go and throw it all away

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh between you and me
I'm not giving, ah...
I'm not giving, ah...
On us

'Cause if you give up
Then, what am I supposed to do?
All of our dreams
Never will come true
Without you

So, brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I'm not giving, giving, ah...
I'm not giving, giving, ah...

Oh baby,
Don't give up on this love
