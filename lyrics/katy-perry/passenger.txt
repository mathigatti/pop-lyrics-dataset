I can't let go of control
I can't let go and not know
Don't know the way you're heading me
One day at a time is all I need


There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
I could handover the keys oh

I'll let you lead the way now
'Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel

The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger no
But we'll see more without a map

Without a map
Without a map
Without a map

So let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new

It's hard to jump with no net
But I've jumped and got no regret
My co-pilot yeah that's right
Now I can just enjoy the ride

I'll let you lead the way now
'Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel

The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger no
But we'll see more without a map

Without a map
Without a map
Without a map

I know we're finally falling
'Cause I was giving you half now I'm all in
My hands in the air while you're drivin'

This is livin'
This is livin'
This is livin'
Yeah

I'll let you lead the way now
'Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it would feel

The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger no
But we'll see more without a map

Without a map
Without a map
Without a map
