Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this love
Your electric lips have gotten me speaking in the tongues


I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose

Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual
Under your spell
Phenomenal
The way you make me feel
Like an angel
All aglow
Like a feather
You make me float

Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a Nirvana finally

Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual
Under your spell
Phenomenal
The way you make me feel
Like an angel
All aglow
Like a feather
You make me float

You make me float
You make me float

This is spiritual
Under your spell
So Phenomenal
The way you make me feel
Like an angel (like an angel)
All aglow
Like a feather (like a feather)
You make me float

You make me float
You make me float
