Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it


Slow motion, sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys, oh, yes they will
They don't want to define it

Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh, no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants, your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess you left
Lay your head down and feel the beat
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last but this is now
So love the one you're with

You wanna chase, but you're chasing your tail
Quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh, no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants, your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with a snap of your fingers
Oh, oh, oh yeah

Oh, no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants, your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
'Cause you don't wanna miss out
