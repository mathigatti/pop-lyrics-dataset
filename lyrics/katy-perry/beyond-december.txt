There is this girl, she is my world...
She doesn't know me, but I wish she did.
Now this girl, she kissed another girl...
She's so pretty, oh Mrs. Perry.


And I'll please you better than he could have ever,
Let's run away together, you and me.

She's so pretty, oh Katy Perry won't you run with me, far away
Where Mr. Brand can't take you from me
She's hot and she's cold, she's yes and she's no,
My firework, california girl, Oh Katy.

And you don't know what you mean to me,
You'll always be my teenage dream,
And with a *&amp;^% like that it's hard to say no,
I tried to get a glimpse at your last show,
Your hot short skirts doing my head in, not long now and you'll be my girlfriend.

And I'll please you better than he could have ever,
Let's run away together, you and me.

She's so pretty, oh Katy Perry won't you run with me, far away
Where Mr. Brand can't take you from me
She's hot and she's cold, she's yes and she's no,
My firework, california girl, Oh Katy.

And it hurts to know wherever you go, I can't follow.
And darling can't you see, it was supposed to be you and me, all along.

She's so pretty, oh Katy Perry wont you marry me, lets run away...

She's so pretty, oh Katy Perry won't you run with me, far away
Where Mr. Brand can't take you from me
She's hot and she's cold, she's yes and she's no,
My firework, california girl, Oh Katy
