I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends


Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down
My mother says I should come back home
But can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
So if I pray am I just sending words into outer space

Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?
Another night waiting for someone
To take me home
Have you ever been so lost?

Is there a light, is there a light?
At the end of the road
I'm pushing everyone away
'Cause I can't feel this anymore
Can't feel this anymore

Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?
Another night waiting for someone
To take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Have you ever been so lost?
