Shit man
Nigga gotta go on the got down
Get the shit straight when I got damn get out
Well shit
This what really goin down


Whassup my nigga another day the same shit
Punk-ass C.O.'s on a nigga dick
Got me up at three o'clock cookin nappy grits
I'm a G from C.P. I can't take the shit
Tryin to hold a nigga down in this country ass town
I'm used to smokin chronic movin pounds
They got a nigga on some "Sir, yessir, left right
left"
Throw me in a hole if my ass outta step
They treat you like a motherfuckin slave
Dopefiends, cryin Jesus, swear they saved
Niggaz better get they game tight
Cause these crackers tryin to take a nigga life and they rights
I'm surrounded by fake-ass crooks
They swear they kingpins but don't have money on they books
I hear so many lies it make me sick
These niggaz called ballers sellin dimes and licks
I can't wait til the day they let me go
So I can eat some steak and shrimp
grab a mic, and bust a flow
I'm Audi 5 nigga lights out
Hold it down on the streets until the day that I get out

I'm out man
