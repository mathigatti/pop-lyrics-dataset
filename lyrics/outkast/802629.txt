"Percy Junior, Percy Junior...what's that...what's that you playin'?" 
"Workin' on something new." 
"Sounds like some bullshit. Man, you really think the audience is gonna -- " 
"Well, Rooster said I could play what I wanted." 
"No, never mind anything that Rooster tell you. We'll play stuff that I like, kay?" 


Ain't nobody like my style, yeah 
I light my fire, yeah (I light ba-ba, I light ba-ba) 
They blow it out, yeah (They blew it out, they blew it out) 
And don't nobody wanna feel like that, no 
Monkeys on my back crawl 
And watch them all fall 
Go fall, look out 

Nobody wanted to dance 
When I had a lot of time on my hands 
Now I got a lot of hands on my time 
And everybody wanna be a friend of mine 
Whoa whoa, I wouldn't mind a friend 
The fellas back home all tryin' to win 
Moon keeps shinin' on bootleg bottles 
Cops in the street keep ya feet on the throttle 
Selling what ya got in a Ford A-model 
Yellin' "Go, PJ go!" 

Ain't n'ing idle, everything is wild, yeah 
You can be hit now, yeah (soon as you turn around) 
He in the ground, yeah (boy died, six feet underground) 
And ain't no Bible, at this here Church, no 
You won't find God no, might meet Him first, aw 
Oh God, look out 

Nobody wanted to leave 
House so packed that we couldn't even breathe 
And ain't no better place to fall in love 
Angel sent from Heaven above 
Swing down and come change your life 
You might make a baby, might meet your wife 
But one sure thing that you're gonna say 
"Deep down South there's a 'lil old place 
Them Idlewild cats, man, they don't play 
Don't make me send a telegram to Rooster, he'll shoot ya." 

"You better come harder than that, sweetie...this ain't no mortuary!" 

And you don't want to take it to the gat so soon 
[Still stick it to the] Jenkins waitin' in the upper room 
'Till ya make her say her prayers 
You some players but you made us mashed potato 
That potato, blast you hater, blast the gator 
So you might just wanna kick back and drink goose 
Take that to ya woman, relax, break loose 
Cuff her soon, if she choose, she gon' walk away from you 
Straight to the Rooster, 'cause he's cock-a-doodle-cool, what they do fool 
Moonshine run, the small town, crap shootin' all time 
Phat you and that's gotta matchin' suit and hat 
[All casper suing kinda robbers out da wild] 
Time to break it on, break it on down, now 
Percival, take it on out 

Say whoa Nelly, whoa Nelly 
Say whoa Pappy, whoa Pappy 
Say whoa Mammy, whoa Mammy 
Say whoa Pappy, whoa, everybody get up 

No, no, no, no get down 
Everybody get up 
No, no, no, no get down 
Everybody get up 
No, no, no, no get down
