Can I dance? (Can I dance?) 

Ahhhh Shit. 

(whisper)Big Boi... Big Boi... 

What up baby then you ever knew or known was lost 
Got these intents to freeze you when you're gathering
your thoughts 


You pause but the cause try to recall and remember 
but the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the
center 

Cause your mind aint free, 
restricted by the motherfucking bounderies 

An ounce or three 
or a pound of dro 
couldn't place you on the planet web I'm transmitting
life from bro 

bra, bra, brother, broham 

Cadillac on 4's strike a pose and the door slam 

wham nigga wham! 

Don't they say that in they show Dad? 

Fo' Sho' man 

you're acting like a tadpole out of gonads 
you know I'd ask the truth if the boot we makin' mo'
jams(?) 

Spread them strawberry preserves on your nervous
programs 

Fuck the learning curve! 

We took a ramp to no man's land 

Hello? 
Is anybody home? 
Is anybody givin' dome? 
Serve me up, I want some 

-CHORUS- 

Bug face, Toe Jam 
From your face up, 'cause we don't give a jam 
Jam to the jam from jelly to the jam 
Imagine we not jammin' shove it up your monkey jam(?)


Bug face, Toe Jam 
From your face up, 'cause we don't give a jam 
Jam to the jam from jelly to the jam 
Imagine we not jammin' shove it up your monkey jam(?)
(JAM!) 

When I'm left alone I get to thinkin' to myself 
The mind is a terrible thing to waste so use to none
left 

Like everything is alright 
clearly tight to death 
I can see clearly now 
analyzing every step (step) 

Clearly you can feel me 'cause it's beatin' through
your chest 
And you can see me clearly 
through the window paint 

Drip but wet 
But no tint 
not just yet 

Clearly I'ma a betta not no vetinarian but clearly pit
bulls are the best 

Like the O-U-T-K-A-S clearly nigga you know the rest 
and if you actin' like you don't then clearly you
tryin' to test 

Crystal clearly I confess and I suggest you clear the
runway 
'cause the ticket is a one way clearly back we won't
be coming 

Bug- 

-CHORUS- 

Bug face, Toe Jam 
From your face up, 'cause we don't give a jam 
Jam to the jam from jelly to the jam 
Imagine we not jammin' shove it up your monkey jam(?)


Bug face, Toe Jam 
From your face up, 'cause we don't give a jam 
Jam to the jam from jelly to the jam 

On the dance!... Can I dance? (JAM!) 

Whoa-oh-oh-Whoa-oh-ohhhh (Can I dance?) 

Whoa-oh-oh-Whoa-oh-ohhhh (Can I dance?)
