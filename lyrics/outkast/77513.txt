One, two, three, four, go!

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure


But does she really wanna?
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door

Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone
Is killin' me right now

Thank God for mommy and daddy
For sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
'Til there's nothing at all

We've get together
Ohhh we've get together
But separate is always better
When there's feelings involved

If what they say is: Nothing is forever
Then what makes then what makes
Then what makes then what makes
Then what makes love is an exception

So why you, why you
Why you, why you
Why you are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here?

(Ya'll don't wanna hear me you just wanna dance)
Hey ya! Hey ya!
(Don't want to meet your daddy)
Hey ya!
(Just want you in my caddy)
Hey ya!
(Don't want to meet your momma)
Hey ya!
(Just want to make you comma)
Hey ya! Hey ya!
(I am, I am, I am, just being honest)
Hey ya!

Hey! Alright now alright now fellas
(Yeah) now, what's cooler than being cool? (ice cold)
I can't hear ya I say what's
What's cooler than being cool? (ice cold)
All right

Ok, now, ladies (yeah)
We gonna break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
I wanna see ya'll on ur badddest behavior
Lend me some sugar
I am your neighbor

Ah, hear we go now

Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it like a polaroid picture

Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, sugar
Shake it like a polaroid picture

Now all Beyonce's and Lucy Lui's
And baby dolls get on the floor
You know what to do
You know what to do
Ah, you know what to do

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
