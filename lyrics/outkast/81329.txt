Yeah
Oh yes I love her like Egyptian, want a description, my royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yellin' crickets and crows, bitches and hoes to queen things
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen things
like Kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
talkin' like that, man fuck them niggaz I'm goin' off
and comin' right back, like boomerangs when you throw em
With these old ghetto poems, Bankhead is better for em
When they can let they throw em, down from hitchikin' and bitin' niggas
until the temple they call the body, now everybody got it
Had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Comin' around my crew lookin Jazzy, wanna pretend
like you Ms. Goodie, Four-Shoes, even Bo knew, that you got caught poked
like accupuncture patients while our nation is a boat
Straight sinkin', I hate thinkin' that these the future mommas
of our chillun, they fuckin' a different nigga every time
they get the feelin' to, I'm willin' to go the extra kilo-meter
just to see my senorita get her pillow
on the side of my bed where no good ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
but now it's real Jazzy Belle...[Big Boi]
See what if you was a playa, real playa not no slouch
Havin' the very best of life lots of steak and Perignon
Smokin' an ounce of weed yeah every single day was personal FreakNik
Freakin' these hoes in Polo clothes life as you conceived it
but your conception, deception, lookin' into your eyes I see
your weapon and it's depressin', they're diggin' up in your thighs
leavin' deposits keepin your closets open knockin' your boots and jaws
Hopin' to get you sprung like bell-bottoms, steadily callin' me Antwan
cause you thinkin' that you my lady bitch don't play me cause you're chanky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, you runnin' that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don't even know yo name
it's a shame, you crackin' em up and fuckin' a nigga like Tupac up
I'm leavin' these foes to be the flowers and wake don't get me see
I gotta be feedin' my daughter, teach her to be that Natural Woman
Cause you'll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be
Dumb and Dumber, yeah you know what I'm sayin?[Andre, Big Boi]
One two, yessss, ummkay, check this out right here now
See me ain't no good, in the black on black 'Llac no star
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Strap stickin' together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog eat dog world, kitty cats be scratchin' on my
furry coat to curl, up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl, cause most of the girls that we was likin'
in high school, now they dykein' *laughin*Havin' no mercy for the disrespect-ful ones, some
be hangin' around the crew lookin' for funds, dumb
deaf and fine, they be, askin' me all about mine
How she doin' how she be, I know she's sippin' that wine
behind my back they skwak like vultures
Off and On like Trendz of Cultures baby
hey he, fakin' it like these sculptured, nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
Cause they burnin' anyway, Big Boi user and abuser
