[Chorus]
Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain, nothing lastsforever
But until they close the curtain, it's him and I, Aquemini


[Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, "Get on thebus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping is a must
Is you on the that dust or cornstarch familiar with that smackman
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman how and the fuck you think we gon do that man
Riding around Old National on 18's without no gat man
Im strapped man and already to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it wasfittin
But now we tappin the breaks from all of them corners that we beheadin in a
Volkswagon and Bonevillies, Chevrolets and Coupe De Villies
If you aint got no rims nigga dont go get wood grain sterringwheel
For real you can gon chill out and still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya fuckin beeper bill bitch

[Chorus] x2

[Andre Benjamin]
Twice upon a time there was a boy who died and
Lived happily ever after but thats anotha chapter live
&amp;gt;From home of the brave with dirty dollas
And beauty pallors, and baby bottles and bowling ball impalas
And street scholars that majoring in culinary arts
You know how to work bread, cheese, and dough
&amp;gt;From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what cha bought so cut that big talk
Lets walk to the bridge now meet me half way
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
Its them poor babies walkin slowly to the candy lady
Its lookin bad need some hope like the words maybe if orproblay
More than a hobby when my turntables get wobbly they dont fall
Im sorry yall I often drift Im talkin gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of coarse you know I feel like a bearer of bad news
Dont want to be it but its needed so what have you
Now question is every nigga wit dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall?..nah
So dont get caught in appearence
Its OutKast Aquemini another black experience

OKAY

[Chorus] x2

[Big Boi]
The name is Big Boi Daddy fat sax the nigga that like themCadillacs
I stay down with these streets cause these strets is where myfolks at
Betta know that some say we pro-black boy we professional
We missed alot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicales and the nut sacks you must bust a ryhme wemust bust
back
Get get back for reals niggas thats out here trying to spitfacts
You here dat you cant come near dat maybe you need yo quit
Because Aquemini is Aquaries and Gemini runnin like this/(Yea YeaYea)

[Andre Benjamin]
My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben welcome to the lion's den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it, thats the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on on end wit yo kin
Look again cause I swear I spot one every now and then
Its happening again wish I could tell you when
Andre this is Andre yall just gon have to make amends

[Chrous] x2
