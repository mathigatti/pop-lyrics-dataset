[Big Boi]
Yo
Just so you all know what time it is
It's your homeboy
Straight from the A-T
I ain't even goin say the motherfucking rest
You know
We talk about it all day long baby
We fin'a break you off with some brand new shit


[C-Bone]
This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Ridin like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rappin lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and had a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
She'll be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe

[Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Lil' Brotha]
You see, I cock back glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots by givin hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we takin this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch
To all my real niggaz, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx
Fuck the cops, we makin noise and we won't stop
Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's goin drop
Old school, big shoes, nigga, no socks
We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock

[Big Gipp]
They call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Scrotum, Mr. Poke Em with the
Noodle
Mr. Cockerspanielle in Your Poodle, after school tutor
Roto Rooter, addicted to follies
Like brown collies, stay soft fro
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide
Come to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now
Push a glock for me now, sale cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you, now out wit me now

[Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Supa Nate]
I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight
Fuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed and bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
It's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game
You can fool the record labels but not the street fame
I just tell it how I see it nigga, fact is fact
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props
Konkrete and Big Boi beatin through your Speakerboxxx

[Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Ludacris]
Ludacris, yeah I keep a glock in case you like to leak alot
Meanwhile, crank the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx
Get the fuck on the ground
Is just a phase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
They don't believe I will stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
So put your fist up boy, you wanna romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through neighborhood stop signs
It's my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman
A hundred though, bitch, diamonds shimmerin
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for the strap below
I'm with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

[Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Big Boi]
Fourth and goal
Should I take the three point field goal for the score or should
I roll
Around and take the ball up the middle up the gut, the what, the
hole
Cranium overload, overthrowed
Now we got seven more points on the board, fa sho
B-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think he's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Player, pimp, ganster, poet
We goin spit it, we goin show it to your ass
"You're a champion" were my dad's last words before he
passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say "Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga
Dre"
I say "people, stop the madness cause me and Dre be
okay"
OutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division
We jus tsplit it down the middle so you can see both the visions
Been spittin it damn near ten years, why the fuck would be be
quittin
Fuck, nigga
