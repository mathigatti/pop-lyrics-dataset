im with whateva like wheatstraw
stuck servin my cocaine raw
stop 62 off the brick, jump back
20 over now thats more money to get
slick, we fin to LICK on this corner without gettin caught
but time, keep  a sleepin and money gettin short
plus that crooked cop Brock think we blow sangin *(fuck him)*
that why he ride thro the hole w/the do swingin
but i make moves -- shake them tricks up they shoestrings
be more precise when we do things
cuz life like shakin the dice, but i buck back twice
like 5--deuce, fo -trey, okay

sheyit
cops and robbers niggaz be bound to get them $s and cents
they get in a slump like baseball players
when they short on they rent
anything gion you aint knowin how much money YOU spent
but in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents
who hang around you cuz you be buyin all the weed
and ALL the chicken
feedin everybody, smokin em out
when you was broke tho they was missin
now you ridin bout fo deep startin to tear up YOU suspension
and your baby mamma on child support
my fault, forgot to mention
you dont even have a checkin account
wasnt thinkin about no pension
i used to work at Steak -n- Ale, Old Gold off in the kitchen
had determination and graduated
now i got the whole rap world fascinated
i wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so i made it
continue to sell dope, its payin the bills so you gon do it
but legislation got this new policy
3 strikes and youre ruined.......now where your crew at?
yea.......

and quit re'in-up and standin on this same old block
before our gangsta ass partna get both of us shot

you cant be tryin to showcase, just put it down for your spot
and improvise and work with that little you got
so i think when i finish sellin my last sack
imma take some of this money, go and give some back
cuz people wont forget about the time you gave, know what imsayin?
and start thinkin bout a path to pave
