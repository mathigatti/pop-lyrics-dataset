[Chorus]
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do


[Verse 1]
People don't you worry bout me
Evil don't get buried by me
Well, I'm gonna shoot out this lil town
Soon as I do it I'm gon get down
Come on, Come on

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Mama dont you worry bout me
Papa dont you worry bout me
I live a life but it just ain't mine
Know I'm a your sun won't you let me shine
Come on, come on

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sally don't you worry bout me
Sally don't you worry bout me
Don't worry bout me I'll be fine
Well that's what I tell 'em but I'm lying
Come on, all people come on

[Andre talking]
Yall know bout the blues don't you
Everybody get the blues
Even babies get the blues

[Hook]
Some call it baby blue
Some call it midnight blue
Some call it baby blue
Whatever hue is what we gonna do
We gonna play until you feel happy
Till there ain't no more blues

[Andre talking]
Idlewild
Be there
