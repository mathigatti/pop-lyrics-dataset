ANDRE 3000:   Hello, well good evening ladies and gentlemen 
What we like to do right here 
Well first of all, let me let you know who I am
Well, I go by the name of Andre 3000, right  
And we hail from a place called like Stankonia, GA, right 
You know right now everyone wants to be from space
And like want to be from the country and everything like that 
You know, like really like the south is like 
It's cool to be from the South right about now 
Girls listen up 


Torn between Saturday night and early Sunday morn 
I don't know i'm somewhere stuck in between, tween 
I'm out here knowing Hip Hop is dead  
The average nigga on my corner yelling 
What the fuck you mean, mean 
See we ain't even seen, the mountain top counter clock
Wise goes the neighborhood hand-me-downs and canned goods Won't cut the Grey Poupon we got that make you run 
Back to the drawing board can't afford to lose y'all make me yawn 
One slash one slash ninety-one 
My teacher sees potential in me says sit down son 
Now let me tell you like I heard it, when I felt deserted 
It wasn't no other way to word it got my feelings murdered 
By the bullet of bad the singer of sad 
Songs to make you long for your mom and your dad 
Plaid clash with polka dots I hope you ain't mad 
Back up little mama i'm about to react

Yep, we ain't just funkin' around 
Nope, you don't want to see me clown 
Nope, tomorrow sounds like right now 

SLEEPY BROWN:
People have your 
party and please don't be late 
It's time to bounce, rock roller skate, bounce rock , roller skate Hey sex mama, there's no time to waste
It's time to bounce, rock, roler skate, bounce rock, roller skate Grab your partner, roll around 
And feel the sound ah baby 
People have your party,don't be late 
It's time to bounce, rock, roller skate 

BIG BOI: Well Scotty,is beaming, Lil Pookie 'nem scheming  What's the use in living my nigga
While you snoozing, I'm dreaming 
No Tylenol PM, you amount to the same thing 
Everyday like Per Diem
Never trying to be nothing, better than what you are being
One nation under the cool, should be the rule 
When a young man or a young lady begins or 
Starts grade school silent before violence 
Nine times out of ten times the quietest is livest 
Fumbling through your privates Daddy Fat Sax can I have you back? Naw! 
Ooh! You such a player, ooh! Your southern drawl 
Got me sprawled out, in your black book my name is crossed out Went from starting second string, now you in the dog house  Reminiscin', a part of you was missing 
Instead of arguements you think about the hugs and kisses
If this is something hard for you to take 
You better bounce, rock, roller skate
