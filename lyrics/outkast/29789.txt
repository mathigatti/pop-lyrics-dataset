man a nigga dont want no trouble
   a playa just want to kick back with my gators off
and watch my lil  gull blow bubbles
   but still ready to rhyme
standin my ground never back down
   willin to rob steal &amp; kill any thang that threatens mine
but good luck couldnt be bought see
   many a fights had to be fought G
for a nigga to ride these Vogues
   oh so close to the sidewalk to be gawked at
watch your side my nigga cuz we got gats
   the first nigga to buck gon be the nigga we attack
dont want that but it comes tho
   most of the time you dont know
stickin together like flour and water to make hat
   slow dough we worked for everything we have
and gon stick up for each other like we brothers
   from another mother
kinda like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
   strickly  for the Caddy lovers and never the nut huggin
punk mother fuckers
