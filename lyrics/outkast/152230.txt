I hope that you are the one
If not
You are the prototype
We'll tiptoe to the sun
And do things
I know you like


I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

Today must be my lucky day
Baby
You are the prototype
Do somethin out of the ordinary
Like catch a matinee
Baby
You are the prototype
I think I
I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

If we happen to part
Lord knows I dont want that
But hey
We can't be mad at God
We met today for a reason
I think I'm on the right track

I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again
Let's go
Let's go
To the movies

(Come here)
(Love, come here)
(Uh huh, I said come here)
(Come here)

I think I'm in love again

Girl, right now
Say

I think I'm in love again

I wanna say
I wanna say stank you
Stank you
Very much
Very much
For pickin me up and bringin me back
I been so
I think I'm in love again

I cant
I'm not
I cant afford to not record
I think I'm in love again

I think I wanna say
I think I wanna say stank you
Stank you, smelly much
I think I'm in love...again
For pickin me, for pickin me out of this world

I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

I think I'm in love again
Stank you, smelly much
