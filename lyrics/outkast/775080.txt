[Verse 1]
N-n-n-not too far but long ago
When life was straight up and cars would move slow
When you were cool if you were pigeon-toed
But things have changed (it ain't so simple)
Now life is a musical


I called Big Boi on the telephone
I said "hey hold up 'fore we put out another song"
Say no matter what goes down we stand strong
Cause ain't nothin changed (it's simple)
Now let's make a musical

Based on big infaction
No words like such grow in some action
And you got us well to a fraction
Cause things have changed (it's all hood)
The Kast go Hollywood

[Chrous]
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Change us change us
Change us change us
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Change us change us
Change us change us
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Change us change us
Change us change us
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em

Don't (echoes)
