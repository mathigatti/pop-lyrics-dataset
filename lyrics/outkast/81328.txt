One for the money yes uhh two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin' good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin' to find that hookup
Now everyday we look up at the ceiling
Watchin ceiling fans go around tryin to catch that feelin
off instrumental, had my pencil, and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes tryin' to find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowin' that we could rock
Doin the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin' the crowd move but we not makin no G's
And that's a nono[Big Boi]
Yeah, uhh, check it
Ahh one two, ahh one two dope niggas
in the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin' the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin
Niggas say motherfuck that playin, they payin'
We stayin' layin vo-cals, locals done made it with them big boys
up in thdis industry, Outkast yea dem niggas they makin big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggas that take it lightly
Ninety-six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
...around this bitchHook (2x)
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors[Big Boi]
Back in the day when I was younger, hunger
Lookin to fill me belly with that Rally's, bullshit, pull shit
off like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick I was, stoned like white boys
Smokin' them white golds before them blunts got krunk, chunky asses
passes gettin' thrown like Hail Mary's and they lookin' like Halle Berry
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sippin' wine
We's just chillin', I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smokin' freely, me Lil B, Greet, Mon and Shug
And my little brother James, things changed in the hood
where I live at, them rats know, mama I want to sing but
Mama I want to trick, and mama I'm suckin dick, now
We movin' on up in da world like elevators
Me and the crew we pimps like eighty-two
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone
Like this Eastpointe and we goneHook (2x)[Andre]
Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way
that I just came from, some nigga was sayin' sumpin
talkin' bout "Hey man, you remember me from school?"
Naw not really but he kept smilin' like a clown
facial expression' lookin silly
And he kept askin' me, what kind of car you drive, I know you paid
I know y'all got buku of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made
And I replied that I had been goin' through tha same thing that he had
True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me
to the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check
If you don't move yo foot then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck
Yes we done come a long way like them Slim ass cigarettes
from Virginia, this ain't gon' stop so we just gonna continueHook (repeat till end)
