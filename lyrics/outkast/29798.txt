Our shit don't mix like llao and lukewarm water
Better make it hotter splash ice and watch it rock up
I oughta duct tape your infant daughter
Show y'all soldier ass niggaz
I'm murder city's Sargent Slaughter
Guaranteed to get more cut than a barber
I betcha I'll drill your heifer like Black &amp; Decker
This pussy wrecker and white water couldn't get it wetter
I'm guaranteed to leave her swiss cheese for more cheddar
I give a fuck, suede bucks and coogi sweaters
What up whatever sable fur to lamb leather
I've seen it all in the trap with fitted caps for cold weather
And creased denim threats delivered when I send 'em
Niggaz know I, Fed Ex my shit, overnight express my shit
Deliver my hits quick, who next on my shit list
Banana niggaz need to split
Quit fucking with this through Atlanta click
This here is Slum Lordz we make your terrific shit tragic
My pen and pixel make violence more graphic
I take raw coke cook it crack, saran wrap it
One muthafuckin' verse and it's already a classic
One muthafuckin' verse and it's already a classic
Killer Mike nigga!
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating
'cause I'll box you in the motherfukkin' mouth
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating
'cause I'll box you in the motherfukkin' mouth
My Cadillac got that boom, boom in it, listen to it drop
Like cereal in your breakfast bowl just jumpin' off the top
A nigga don't stop for squares or octagons prepare
I'm not the one you scared, the Piccolo Pimp done set up shop
Nigga you pop lock, for pop rocks, but I'm only poppin'tweeters
And woofers and pussies be blowing purple wit my feet up
I'm a eat up anybody who tests this, I'm blessed wit
Super human powers, poke your chest in, the next of kin
Gone be the first one of some Mexicans to buck
Nigga you stuck like a truck in red dirt, you's in church
And I'm the deacon speakin' while ya tweakin'
The preacher preachin', reachin', teachin', speakin', being,breathin'
You're not, your clock stop, and now you laying in a pretty box
And now the pastor is only talking 'bout the pretty parts of yourlife
Your brother fuckin' your damn wife
You look for the pearly white gates, but you realize your fate
It's too late, 'cause you hate, you hate, it's too late, ' causeyou hate
Punk pussy ass bitch, game over, who want some!
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating
'cause I'll box you in the motherfukkin' mouth
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating
'cause I'll box you in the motherfukkin' mouth
Roll my blunts thick, like I like my bitch
Lick my blunts and spit, like she do my dick
Attempted murder dick, for ways I choke chicks
Spit it in her eye make it hard to focus
Killer Mike gonna calm down, things gonna get a little crazy
Ol' girl might rape well G, you might as well give her a throatbaby
Goop goobler, goop gravy, no dicking her down to the ground
Now you doing the Dirty South, know what I'm talking 'bout
Big Boi, my mentor, hear what you hollering about
But fuck that, I'm looking for love all in her mouth
Need her to gobble up jism, like school lunches
Need her to take cat beatings and throw punches
Like a swarm of locusts, no hocus-pocus
You wanna approach us, buzzards and vultures
We two of the dopest mic controllers
Stack big bank, honey folders
Even wit rollers, I'm trying to told ya
Even loving, lavish, ladies, leaving, landmarks
Of Lemon-lime, lip gloss on your lavender lappets
Leaping lizards, keep me slizzard, my mind's expanding
Readily rappin' and snappin', snappin' and trappin'
That's just what's happening
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating
'cause I'll box you in the motherfukkin' mouth
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating
'cause I'll box you in the motherfukkin' mouth
