Movin' cool, movin' cool, movin' cool 
I can make a stone cold blind man see a better way 
But when I'm around you, you don't have much to say 
La, la, la, la, la, la, whoo, whoo

You see there will always be someone, taller, darker 
Maybe wit a little more cheese than I got 
But really, shawty you don't need nobody else 

Hook 
You see baby I am the opening act 
The headliner (headliner) and the after party 
After party, after party, after party, after party, after party


Joi 
I am all that you'll ever need 
I trip on how everybody sees what I am but you 
I thought you'd be brave enough to taste my bitch's brew 
Well I thought I was dealing with a man, but you're a boy 
You're a boy, you're a boy 
I can give you everything you want, but I can't be your toy

Hey shawty, look here for a minute, shawt, shawt 
Oh, my bad, my bad excuse me 
You corporate America, you corporate America 
I meant to say lil' lady, you look so lovely lying in wait 
Like a lemon licorice, lollypop 
Waiting to be licked, we don't play 
But you think you the shit 
Was that too harsh for you lobes 
Too heavy for your mentality I suppose 
Got nerves like kryptonite 
Superman couldn't bend those 
Kindness kills callous 
Like a D-Boy movin fifty p's of that work 
From A-Town to Dallas - Movin' Cool
