deliver this thro your audio, ghetto mafioso
   grow hydro, then bag it up yo
price the longevity, suggest make moves
   slow take time grow eight, react nine blow
hydro slide raw like fuck Renaldo
   fly ride tho, shit lookin wild dope
then glide yo, flippin the page, i go
   watch 5--oh jump on my meat, ride slow
watch those, undercovers, cop those, rock those
   glocks blows leave em baggy and collect spot grows
keep a watch froze, lean on the yacht and wash clothse
   let the chop blow, bag a half a block plot grows,
what?
