chorus: 
I,m an outkast 
But don,t count me out 


Underground dwellaz, roaming beneath the cellars 
Failed us with this system, ain,t living how they tell us 
Hideaway place, it,s safe, they raise a nation of hate 
Erase a main for his faith 
They feed us lies, dress up my King in false disguise 
Behind those eyes, soul of a savior I recognize 
No compromise, while the whole world becomes corrupt 
Tonight we break the surface for lives, We coming up 

Brother take my hand 
Lets separate ourselves 
Leave behind this place 
Don,t ever look back 

Disgraced man, survivors of the wasteland, 
Looking for a home of his own 
No place to run, now place to hide 
It,s time for you to stand on your own 
Militia, coalition, not of this world 
Resistance, we the alliance 
We freedom fighters, its honor we defend 
We follow truth and never your trends 

Brother take my hand 
Lets separate ourselves 
Leave behind this place 
Don,t ever look back 

chorus 

Brace yourself like a man
