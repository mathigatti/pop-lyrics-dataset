Verse 1 : Andre 3000 (16 bars, 32 lines) 

You ain't a hater can't tell 
Either wish me well, go to hell or go to yale 
Study human behavior so that* you know who the hell 
You dealin` with ain't nutty but the study goin` unvail 
My relative in jail (Ha) stay in engaged 
TO whatever make money now he married to that cage 
Divorce is not an option and prenumptual is void 
Eat up what ever after but I'm tangled in my cord (hum) 
Bored, kind of like a night with the sword 
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow 
and immpossible feat and I repeat 
and immpossible feat and I repeat 
and immpossible feat and I repeat! 
The damsel's in distress but they a mess 
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer 
They read one magazine and think that they gon get warmer 
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw 
a double diamond party in the north pole 
Invite all the writers and journalists 
Even biters will turn up man*, to see who can be me 
Better than me it's a permanent, smile on my face 
Because you said you don't like my style 
but that's ok just make sure you don't touch that dial 
and we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool 
look, I'll get you hooked, ya'll crooks might even move 
to Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter 
start a new life, and all that wrong you do you make it right 
but hell, all a dream, I wear the crown, I'm king 
Respect this mandatory, end of the story 
Go fly a kite, category ain't got none 
You know I'm right

Verse 2 : Big Boi (16 Bars, 32 lines) 

Congratulations I'm a play-er 
I thought you were one too but now I hear you loud and clear 
SUbliminal, criminal minded niggas so be aware 
Black dog broke out the pits and told yo` ass it's a bite a tear..(uhm..I had no idea what he said) 
Intimid by anyone filling out this application 
And estimate is needed for your under estimation 
I'm firing on the spot go back and check your calculation 
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle abutation 
Waiting, now that's a virtue 
Cause pussy nigga, I'll hurt you 
Like the president's approval rating by serving your ass with words fool 
Slam yo` back to the curve bra, like sanitation worker 
Cause ya trash, I'm taking out the trash and all trash 
Get mashed and compacted because it's no longer valid 
Go head recyled, repackaged and put it back in my cabinet 
Boy thats germs*, I'm fresh up out the store eery time 
That nigga that b-i-g, go hard eery rhyme 
Crowns all around I'm right after Martin Luther 
No J or period senior cause bamboo is Antwone Junior 
Dungeon Family and biologicals intact 
Talk bad about the fam test diabolical attack 
No gats or no raps, you get slapped about that 
As a matter of fact, not fiction 
Rumpelskiltsken you WACK 
Decipher words is like the code of da vinci 
Don't go against me, (Hey) 
I want you to go out there and kill them marks boy is you with me* 
Mighty ighty ighty ighty ighty ighty O 
The worse thing since Crack/Cocaine distributing it to the poor* 
By the government, oh I meant, don't nobody know 
Conspiracy theory, you be the judge, nobodys slow
