Everybody needs a glass of water today
to chase the hate away.
You know you've got company coming over, 
so you scrub extra hard.


Chorus
And everybody needs somebody to love
before it's too late..... it's too late

Don't nobody wanna grow old &amp; alone

Everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders,
scratch their dandruff.
And everybody needs to quit actin' hard and shit,
before you get your ass whooped (I'll slap the fuck out ya!)

Chorus

Love hater, Love hater, hater of love (3x)
love hater

Everybody needs somebody to love (3x)
