[Andre 3000]
My suit is dark my clouds are gray
And all things around me pass away
Well what if I leave
Yeah thats what I'll do I'll leave


Cause 88 keys is all I got to lose
That ain't much you can have those shoes

I'm dyin to love dyin to play
Dyin to get out of here
I'm dyin to live

(female singers)
Percival (ohhh)
Says goodye (ohhh)
An angel dies
