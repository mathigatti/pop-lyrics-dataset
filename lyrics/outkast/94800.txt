(::verse one::: Andre 3000: 
Leather in the summer, silk in the winter 
This is such an art, where do I begin uh.. 
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir 
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fine 
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs 
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin 
To look sexy, but even if she was so what 
Mother fucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt 
But that lets me, know that she's a human being 
And being human's hard, on the boulevard 
Girl you got it bad, glad I'm not one 
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one 
But I'm Andre, Benjamin Andre to be exact 
You hoped to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that 
In fact, Dookie introduced at a show 
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me 
I'm in the southern states, you know where all the pimps be 
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups 
And yes you're getting booed if your shit does not get down 
And yes you're getting sued by women who didn't get up 
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust 
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust 
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks 
Ask Scott to match the socks, what's in your +Speakerboxxx+ 
+Pink and Blue+, you're lolly gaggin, you're slow pokin 
You got me open, you're playin wit me, darlin I'm not a toy 
As if I need a baker bring's the joy, you're a kiner, the Tyner
meanin the real McCoy 
I can't wait..

(::verse two::: Big Boi: 
So luscious she's the real deal, but even he gets ancy 
Some honeys try to +Kill Bill+ beneath the underpants see 
But patients is the virtual to being anxious, just might hurt
you 
Like Mike Vick returning to the line of scrimmage too soon 
A line of nigga's tryin' get in vengeance on a full moon 
Should I play it cool, or be the one to make the first move? 
Anticipatin, and contemplatin, she got you sprong dude 
Shit, I'm fin to get her might emit her, what you gone do?
(--wha?--) 
I tell you what, we wont be fallin for that one, two 
Just kinky sex up off in the boom boom if she want to 
And if she don't, then I'll dial another date 
That means find another face to replace, cuz I can't wait
