OutKast - So Fresh, So Clean

Chorus:
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean


(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy I'm dressed so fresh so
clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean

(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so
clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

(Big Boi)
Sir Luscious got gator belts and patty melts and Monte
Carlo's
And El Dorado's I'm waking up out of my slumber
feeling like Ralo
So follow it's your time at the Apollo
Minus the Kiki Shepard what about a ho in a
leopard-print
Teddy Pender-grass cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sippin a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left my throat warm in the dorm room at the AU
We do hey you And might do some cake too
But you must have me mistaken with them statements
that you make
Cause

Chorus

(Andre 3000)
Canary yellow seven house of business on display
My nigga Bungle whipped it up so I gone get my rims
today
So a nigga can ride out to the colorful hideout
I'ma show you how to wild out like Jack Trippa
Let me be bambino on your snippas
YKK on yo zippa lick you like a lizard
When I'm slizzard or sober 6 million ways to fold ya
Like Noah I get crews to choose and you get pretty
deep
But i'll call yo ass round 8-ish I know you'll be
there for me
Cause

Chorus

(Andre 3000)
Those huge baby eyes get to runnin off at they mouth
Tellin me everything that's on yo nasty mind
They say your malnutrition in need of vitamin D
And inviting me to that tingle in yo spine
I love who you are love who ya ain't you so Anne Frank

Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
With change and no chains and whips I do suck lips
Till hips jerk and double time the boy next door's a
freak
Ha Ha

Chorus

(And we are...) the coolest motherfunkers on the
planet
(In my mind ...) the sky is fallin ain't no need to
panic
(But Oh oh.....) I got a stick and want yo automatic
(Oh oh oh...) Compatible created in the attic
(repeat)

Chorus 2x
