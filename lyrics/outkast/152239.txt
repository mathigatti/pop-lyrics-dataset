[Chorus 1]
I don't want to move too fast, but
Can't resist your sexy ass
Just spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)
Don't want to come on too strong, but
I'll play in you all day long
Just spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)


[Verse 1]
I... I can't read minds, but I can read yours
I think she says that she wants to pour your..
your... yourself all over me
What you think? I could be wrong, but peoples don't lie
And if they do, bu God, they must fry! (fry?!)
You know, like electric chair
The way you stare (yeah I'm there)
You committed a crime and I'm the victim

[Rap]
I've got an eye out for she who cries out passionately
We'll do things backwardly, forwardly, horizontally
I'm too young to be settling down
quick to change my mind tomorrow
So now can I borrow your timid torso
More so than your soul, honest me gotta be how I roll
Fuck the rhythm, fuck the rhythm under your bosom
You're the prism, Shirley Chislom
Was the first, let's rehearse making a baby
Put in your order, I want a baby daughter
Dance on the tip of my tongue
Shake the clouds 'til there's no more wetness in them
Tell your homegirls that you will send them
A postcard from 3000... HARD!

[Hook 2]
Don't want to make you feel strange, but
Don't let these words be in vain, so
Spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)
Nature knows that I want you, but
Not unless you want me too, so
Spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)

[Hook 1]
