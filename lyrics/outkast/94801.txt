Chorus

You just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things go slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time


Verse One:

When that * be thinkin of cruisin'
The Braves cap is to the side
Thinkin' the police gon' pull me over
With this herb off in my ride
So I hide the brick of weed
Under the arm rest, under the leather
Thinkin' of startin ways
To make my life a little better
Then the dope peddler
Never pay no * taxes
Takin a chunk up out my check
And makin my rhymes just look like practice
Buyin' clothing, Range Roving
With my folks
Don't speak about the Dirty South
My crew ain't bout no jokes
I know some people don't like the way we flow
Because they envy
They talkin bout they * my *
And that they could have been me
You lookin to be that butterfly
Without the caterpillar
Take your time and do it right
Cause you gon make it
I swear my
Or collapse 1
Falling a victim to your greed boy
Your looking to be Big Willie
But you're still a seed boy
The information in my skull
Be pokin' some of ya'll on the shoulder
But on the other side of the fence
They got * breakin' boulders
For quick money

Bridge

Struggling is just a part of my day
Many obstachave been placed in my way
I know the only reason that I make it through
Is because I never stop believing in you
Some people wonder why we're here in the 1st place
They can't believe because they ain't never seen your face
But even when you pray, the next day you gotta try
Can it wait for nobody to come down out the sky
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let him do the rest
You've got your life, you've got your health
So quit procrastinating and push it yourself
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let him do the rest
You've got your life, you've got your health
So quit procrastinating

Verse 2:

Who said good folks is not supposed to die
The same * that said * is not supposed to cry
United States giving out milk and cheese to pacify
I'm sure they got a cure for AIDS, but yet it's classified
You wonder why I spit the truth and not to make no dough
To make a differencefo' this * up and blow
In piece, I could thinkof many reasons
Only when * is going bad you want to holla Jesus
I pledge allegiance, they got my knuckles bleeding
From crawling , got these * thinkin they ballin'
When they isn't, don't take my word,
there's * off in prison
That will tell yo, that's locked up for a long time and won't
sell you
No flex, so congregation will turn you text,
To the book of OutKast, chapter two, verse one
The first one, that feel me jump up and make a joyful noise
You'se OutKastic, meaning you now have a choice like that

Chrous
