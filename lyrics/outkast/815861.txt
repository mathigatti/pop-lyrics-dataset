[Verse 1] 
In the eye of the storm 
Looking out through the rain 
Gabe will blow your horn 
They shield me from Saddam and the hurricane 


[Chorus] 
Gangsta ride ride in the nick of time 
Soldiers stay affronted then they blow your mind 
Bold ass soldiers marching out for war 
No idea what we in for 
Powerful magnificent and so divine 
Soldiers stay affronted it'll blow your mind 

[Verse 2] 
Hear a thunderous voice 
Shouting there will be no peace 
Until our people rejoice 
When every boy and girl is free 
You see it's going down 
The war is a mystery 
But my friends they'll be better days 
And a better way 
According to the prophecy 

[Bridge] 
It would be so nice 
To hook up in paradise 
But all these things must go 
Or are you in the know 
Like all the way up so shy 

You been a friend of mine 

[Chorus] 

You been a friend of mine 

[Bridge]
