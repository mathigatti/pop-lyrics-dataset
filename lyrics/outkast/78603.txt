Boom, boom, boom
Heh, heh


Ready for action, nip it in the butt
We never relaxin', Outkast is everlastin'
Not clashin', not at all but see my nigga went to do a littleacting
Now that's for anyone askin' give me one pass 'em
Drip drip drop there goes an eargasm
Now you cumin' out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks (Thanks!)
So flickle the tickle let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin' like two midgets in the back seat wrasling
Speakerbox vibrate the tank, make it sound like aluminum cans inthe back
But I know y'all wanted the 808 can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass
But I know y'all wanted the 808 can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass

I like the way you move
I like the way you move (whoo-o-o!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
I love the way you move (whoo-o-o!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

Then the whole room fell silent (Shh!)
The girls all pause with glee, turning left turning right hardlylooking at me
But I was looking at them, there, there on the dance floor
Now they got me in the middle feeling like a man whore
Specially the big gurl, big gurls need love too nodiscrimination
So keep your hands off my cheeks, and let me study how you ridethe beat
You big freak!
Skinny, slim women got the ghetto within them
You can fuck them, lift them, bend them, give them something toremember
Hail out timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale your ex male friend, boyfriend wasboring as hell
Now let me listen to the stories you tell and we can make moveslike a person in jail
On the low, hoe

Sleepy Brown
Hey baby, girl don't you stop
Come on baby dance on the top of me
You so fine (you so fine) you so fine
You drive me outta my mind (my mind, outta my mind!) ooh
If I could I would, just be with yooou baby
Oooh, 'cause you like me and excite me and you know you gotta leave baby!!
Ooh!

I like the way you move (I like the way you move)
I like the way you move (ooo you so sexy baby!) (whoo-o-o!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way (Whoo-o-o!)

I love the way you move (I like the way you move)
I love the way you move (oooh you so sexy baby!) (whoo-o-o!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
