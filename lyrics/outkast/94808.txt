[Masada]
Mahogany team queens up on the rise
Be careful, watch your back, blackbirds don't wear disguise
How we comin, comin hard.. camels too slow
Stick up kids do anything, hustlers keep loot to show (what?)
The game is hot you could never be a winner
Just begun a game so considered a beginner
Masada for real, this shorty here is here to say
Mahogany go platinum after after that we just parlay
I'm from the Bricks we get kicks, offa loud gun shot licks
Fuck stones and sticks, loudmouths get nicks
This life is plus I be the bill-be-board, Scarface want
italiano, I'm the real McCoy, nigga what?
Can't be a joke I've been through too many games
Niggaz laugh, but my expression wasn't hardly the same
Show me respect cause it's due, you keep the fear 
cause I'll get over and believe I'll come back at you

Yo, now
You and your nigga shit shaky
And at the time your heart feel down and broke like Achy Breaky
Lump in your throat, feel like a trachea, oh dummy
The pain that's in your chest done made it's way
down to your tummy, you wide open, you start smokin wit ya girl
She nigga bashin sayin you don't need em in your world
Niggaz all dogs?  If niggaz all dogs, then what you call broads?
Felines in heat, meowin for some yawn balls
Now you and hear done got to drankin
Oh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drink
and your girl done got to thinkin
She talkin bout, "Girl you look so beautiful"
You say thank you bein nice you try to change the subject
Want some beans and rice?  But she's back at you like a pit
mixed with a chihuahua how much meaner can you get?
Don't let her have her way with you she's gonna have a fit
You're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
here's what you do -- you
grab her by her neck, throw her on the wall
Say, "Bitch don't ever disrespect me never not at all"
These simple words can put a pause to half of the applause
Them black ball laws of balance at all cost

Que pasa, que pasa?  Check this out
Quiet nights like this, might twist one for the moda
on the balcony, I got a sofa
Nights like this is perfect, for this Spanish Fly
Can you come over, somethin, I wanna show ya
Told ya once we was gon' take a trip, touch you 
with my lips where you like it, it's time, don't fight it
Piggy-back ride to the sofa, in the microwave
I got your favorite Stouffer's, lasagna, that's how much
I want ya, fuck flowers
The ceremony starts from the shower with the water
I got somebody's daughter in the Doctor headquarters, chillin
Prepare for this sex drillin, she said somethin in Spanish
Got me feelin mannish, me and you fin' ta vanish
real quick, feel this shit, got cheese, tryin to make cheese
to get you pregnant overseas
Maybe make sho' that's my seed
Quiet nights like this, bachelor like me is single
Talkin to you Miss Bilingual
Let's mingle in the crowd, watch them show, pop some Moet
Tryin to get you so wet, never been to Spain
Never been a lame, horny, ever since I been a tiny
Fuckin with niggaz with ageless bodies
Talkin to me, while I squeeze it bare
Let me talk to you while I run my fingers through your hair

Friday night boi, breakin the old school out, boi we cruisin
Bout fo' niggaz and fo' hoes, it ain't gon be nobody losin
but they choosin
Better get in where you fit in cause it's crucial
I'm tryin to cut bout two of them girls
cause that just what I'm used to
I mean that, the first that look my way 
just gon' get splack packed
To the front to the back there's Cognac
Got my throat, burnin like burlap
Everybody cheezin, knowin these hoes gon' cut like pleasers
These hookers they praisin my crew
like Reverend Hodo be praisin Jesus
The easiest was the meanest, but the skeezer was a beanie
she thought we was some motherfuckin genies
So I checked her, like the king I am, no disrespect intended
Told her, and her silly friends,
"Get out" before they got offended
To the Laquinta we went, layin them hoes down
on the freestyle tip, geyeah!
