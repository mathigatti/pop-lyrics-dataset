(Big Boi)
Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass
niggaz
But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out, or even pull your fuking head
To make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch
full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like King shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I say Lakewood
You better be strapped cuz them niggaz over there just ain't
good
Just being a hustler, servin the loyal customers
Rent was due on the 1st of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggaz be wanting drinks and shit from the fuking sto', yo
But that's aight, tho', cuz I be getting paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that jive



(Chorus)
If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime (2x)

Hey 'Dre, Let 'em know what's up

(Andre)
Time is slippin, slowly but surely
Niggaz I used to hang wit wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots alot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall, I'm havin a ball, makin my nickel sacks
crawl
To my niggaz got to servin when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain
from being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous
I'm hanging with the P.A., nigga, ain't no changin us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fly shit, yo niggaz gonna always toke
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggaz don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fuked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's
up
I rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm slangin it from the South
Talk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fuckin mouth

Chorus
