Here's a little somethin for the players out there hustlin
Gettin down for theirs
From East Pointe, College Park, Decatur, DeVries...


My man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, Seventy-Seven Sevilles
El Do's, nuttin but them 'Llacs
All the players (DePorte in the house) all the hustlers
I'm talkin bout a black man heaven here
YouknowhatI'msayin?  Yeah

*singing*
Cadillacs are comin, from everywhere (yeahhh)
Limbo boppin good cause love is in the air
To all you players and you pimps smoke out and have a ball
And if your hoe is actin crazy --

-- put her on the wall
Now now now everybody's dancin and just feelin right
I see all of you players got yourselves laid in on ice
I hope when all y'all dance is over, can I get onn, yeah
My kids'll have a story, that still be told, whoooa, about

All the players came, from far and wide
Wearin afros and braids, kickin them gangster rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player ball is happenin, all day erveryday
