Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend


Big Boi:
I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger couple of kids in minivans
Standin in the stands like a fan watch her little man
Run ball
And everytime you see the family they look happy
Got her mama and her daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had her cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride decide not to divide
Kept the yam in the (hide) the spouse in the house
Boy its cheaper to keep her you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog cuss words flow like
(Too Short sample: Motherfuckaer shit gotdamn asshole)
Took my shit (Too Short sample: Beeitch!) fuck

Big Boi:
It was the night that they done dipped and all throughout the palace
That didn't do his part heartbroke or no more marriage
When it happens you'll be slappin yourself rememberin
You coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend
Now you sittin in the courthouse plaintiff and defendant
Pleadin to the judge you was in it to win it
In the beginnin was splendid see she was grinnin and spendin
All of her time wit the kids an' in the kitchen she'd cook
She was fierce on the stove it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late
But now we just debate like some candidates damn I hate
Friction wishin I had paperwork on the misses but I didn't
Damn... fuckin around
