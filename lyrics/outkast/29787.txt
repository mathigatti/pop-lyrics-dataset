{Chorus}
Ah ha hush dat fuss
Everybody move to da back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and skrump wit us
We da type of people make da club get crunk


{BIG BOI}
Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We taking another route to represent the Dungeon family
Like Grade A, me and and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin every city when we headed to that bat cave
A-T-I, Georgia, what we do for ya
Bull doggin hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy you soundin silly, thank my Brougham aint sittin pretty
Doin doughnuts round you suckas like them circles around tittiesDAMN we
committee gone burn it down
But us gone bust you in the mouth with the chorus now

{Chorus} x2

{ANDRE BENJAMIN}
I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To simulate then activate the left and right brain
Said baby boy you're only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past your ass'll be a has what
Thats one to live by or either that one to die to
I try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure
Andre, got to her station heres my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head forhours
Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group aint commin witit
But im witcha you cause you problay goin through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt, went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin, but examine all theflawsky-wasky
Awfully sad and its costly but thats all shit
And I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shits creek its week is the last quote
That I want to hear when Im goin down when all's said and done
And we got a new joe in town
When the record playa get skippin and slowin down
All yawl can say is them niggas earned that crown, but untilthen..

{Chorus} x2
{Hermonicas}
