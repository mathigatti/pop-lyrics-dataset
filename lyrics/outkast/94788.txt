Intro/Chorus:

Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
And ahh, if you let me give inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly


Verse 1: Society of Soul

Oh baby, would you like to take a little ride with me
Unleash your sexual fantasies
It would be so nice
Ahh, relax your body next to me
As I sing this OutKast melody
On this funky ride
So just relax baby

Chorus

Verse 2: Society of Soul

Now baby, now the smoke is in the air
Martell and Coke has got me there
And we wonder why you're high?
Well baby umm, it's nothin but that
SESS in your CHEST that got you feelin kinda crazy
So let your spirits fly
Uhh and enjoy the ride
Oh yeah baby
