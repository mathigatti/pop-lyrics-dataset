lets say her name was suzy screw cuz she SCREWED alot
makin a nigga hit that chonk, at ligitimate spots
not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
had to hate ya playa, im dickin the hoe down never said i paidher
straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Daver, made her
from College Park and Fayetter, all the way dont to Decatur
like jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
safe as a snake on eggs in a beamer 840
its foggy, i went to the crib to call her but she lost me
my baby mamma beeped 7 oclock its gonna cost me
bit i still wanna cut her tho, maybe she had to work
caught her at the mall, wearin a real tight skirt
she was fine as FUCK i wanted to sex the hoe up
she said "lets hit the parkin lot so i can sick your duck"
i said "cool i really wanted to cut you but this'll do,

3 in the mornin yawnin dancin under street lights
we chillin like a villian and a nigga feelin right
in the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
all of the bullshit we on our back starin at the stars above
*(awww man)* talkin bout what we gonna be when we grow up
i said "what you wanna be?" she said "alive" *(hmm)*
it made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
i coulda died, time went on, i got grown
rhyme got strong, mind got blown, i came back home
to find lil sasha was gone
her mamma said she w/ a nigga who be treatin her wrong
i kept on singin my song and hopin at a show
i would one day see her standin in the front row
but 2 weeks later she got found in the back of a school
w/a needle in her arm, baby 2 months due, Sasha Thumper
