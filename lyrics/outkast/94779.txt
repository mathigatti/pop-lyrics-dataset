Yessuh 
Let me dig into your brain, folks fallin like rain 
Property got me sellin thangs, guess I'm gon' explain 
Jane is rolled up, no gangs be throwed up 
But still Andre got action, they Sweat like Keith, all on my
teeth 
I take it upon myself to handle mine, thinkin that you 
gots ample to do this have you shot I thought you knew this 
I'm crumblin', no time for fumblin sellin my sacks watchin my
back 
Wettin em up like splish, leavin em in a splash 
of blood, the clock is tickin niggaz from my block is missin 
I'm puttin it down like it be hot before we all get shot 
Got, only so much time in this bastard 
Bitter be claimin broke but I be sayin they pro-cras-ti-natin 
Settlin for less, bet' be ready 
when they roll up in your nest and, sink one in your chest and 
youse gone, up outta here for good 
Y'all be bobbin back and forth to let me know you understood 
Yeah, whassup 


Chorus: 

There's only so much time left in this crazy world 
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb 
Niggaz can't let niggaz they don't understand (what's the master
plan) 
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb 

Verse Two: Big Boi 

So check me out, see 
Once in a while when niggaz be tryin to test me I gets frisky 
Grab a pint of golden whiskey then they swing but shit they
missed me huh 
I'm gettin nice with them thangs, because I do like that 
You heard me on the radio and yes my man I'm true to dat 
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear em 
And shoot my dice like it's the brick the way that wall done
flicks em 
Nigga, so ring around the roses diamonds around my neck from
flexin 
But I'm runnin niggaz over like a ninety-fo' Lexus, test it 
Ten millimeters count em nigga fuckin high 
See I added a millimeter for y'all niggaz doin crimes and
drivebys 
Kiss yo' ass bye-bye, sayanora suckers 
I flipped the script and turned the page ain't scared of you
motherfuckers 
Be boppin shots, like them hoes be poppin coochies 
and I still be spreadin bullets like them freaks be spreadin
cooties 
So look here niggaz, I'm Huntin Red October 
I said my shit and ran my lyrics and now my verse is over 

Chorus 

Verse Three: Big Boi, Andre 

Wooo! Big Boi 
Got a type of nugget, blunt box, it's empty 
That's where the erb be droppin, it's simply marvelous time is
tickin 
But some of that time when I be layin vocals in the Dungeon 
Sugar Bear and Mon be smokin ounces like it ain't nuttin 
It ain't shit, to take another hit so hit it 
of the canibus seteva weed reefer yeah smoke shit 
It's all day any til they label me deceased 
so fire up another one and smoke out and fuck the world peace 

We, is gonna smoke out, until we choke out 
like some merry men, cowards I be buryin 
Comin around my shop with that see nigga you gets nothin 
just like DJ do the cuttin I be havin your posse duckin nothin
but 
King Shit, I am askin, sucka can you hand 
That player with the pepper throwin salt off in your game 
Sprinkle sprinkle motherfucker don't be cryin on me 
That stuff the sess be in my chest until I'm chillin in peace,
yeah 

Chorus
