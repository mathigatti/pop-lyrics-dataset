Whether you like it or not, he's back 
D-A-double D-Y Fat Sacks 
Ridin' in the Cadillac 
Beatin' like some beat it up(?) 
The game dun' changed Out- 
Kast came to heat it up 


Sharp as a tack like I just left church (clean) 
... ... than a tack ... ... ... ... 
Ridin' in the Cadillac 
Beatin' like some beat it up(?) 
The game dun' changed Out- 
Kast came to heat it up 

And everybody wanna know whus really goin' on 
Is you and 3000 still makin' songs? 
So on and so on 
I can o-on and o-on 
and on, and on, and on 
Hell yes! 

Music makes the world go 'round 
Where it goes (where it goes) 
Ya' just don't know (ya' just don't know) 
My heart is like a marching band 
I'm a fan in the stands 
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' hey baby 
sayin' hey baby 

So baby please believe me 
Don't you go (don't you go) 
Baby no no no (baby no no no) 
My heart is like a marching band 
I'm a fan in the stands 
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' hey baby 
Sayin' hey baby 

Two dope boyz in the Cadillac still 
'Kast ... the crown on ya Cadillac Seville 
I'll make your wheels of steel stand (still) 
Like your DJ got killed 
The fire marsh- 
Fire marshall 
Shut 'er down, time to go! 
OutKast royalty by design of logo 
Wanna count it out loud? 
93, 94, 95, 96 
Plus a dime, still that's fire 
HOT like the perm on the back of your neck 
Left it in too long 
Now ya got Cabbage Patch silky 

Ridin' in the Cadillac 
Beatin' like some beat it up(?) 
The game dun' changed Out- 
Kast came to heat it up 

Bendin' corners like a crowbar, oh so unique 
Got the pedal to the floor, but the 4-door just creeps 

Ridin' in the Cadillac 
Beatin' like some beat it up(?) 
The game dun' changed Out- 
Kast came to heat it up 

Exotic, melodic melody jep, we got it 
Fuckin' for the funk of it and everybody want it 

*ROOF* You make it make it put a dog on it [?] 
*ROOF* You make it make it put a dog on it [?] 

(Chorus) 

I'm tippin' my off to ya baby 
cuz you're so fine, blow my mind 
I put in the time 
Everybody knows you can't let a pretty one pass you by 
Without sayin' hi 

I'm so gone over you 
Yes it's true 
Baby do what you do 
My nose is open so wide (so wide, yeah) 
Lookin' at you such a pretty sight (so wide, yeah) 
My heart is on my sleeve (my sleeve, yeah) 
And this is how it sounds to me (this is how it sounds) 

(Chorus) 

Baby you and me 
We make a musical masterpiece 
I travel the land 
Me and the band 
We bringin' the church [?] back to your feet 
So wait baby 
Don't leave me, baby 
Say wait baby 
Don't leave me, baby 
[2X]
