Yeahh.. mmm mm mmm
That shit sho feel good
Hey playa, dis Peaches
Comin back at ya one mo gen, wit a big whayssup
Break out your black low, and your booms phone
As I send it out one more time
For East Pointe, College Park, Decatur, and the SWATS
We got that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik for yo' trunk
And it's fat like herringbone, and tight like nap booty
So let me take you deep, straight to the point
Cause it ain't nuttin but King Shit, all day, erveyday
