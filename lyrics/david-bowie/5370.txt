I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done


I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

Never gonna fall for

Modern love, walks beside me
Modern love, walks on by
Modern love, gets me to the church on time
Church on time terrifies me
Church on time makes me party
Church on time puts my trust in god and man
God and man, no confessions
God and man, no religion
God and man don't believe in modern love

It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try, I try

Modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, walks beside me
Modern love, modern love, walks on by
