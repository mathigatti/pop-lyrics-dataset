I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you that sets the test


So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter

I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
Dry
I crushed my heart
To ease their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can they spare
What of me?

Who praised their efforts
To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked their way
I braved their cause to guide
For little pay

I ravaged at my finance just for those
Those whose claims
Were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world
New ways ever free
Those whose promises
Stretched in hope and grace for me

I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time
At times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you that sets the test

So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream
Where all is God
And God is just a word

We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but ours

We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill our needs
Now we are strong

And the road is coming to it's end
Now the damned
Have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in our way
The silent guns of love will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were
The tongues of crying rage

Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt

Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through our sleeves
Yeah, and we slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor on slogans such as

Wish You Could Hear
Love Is All We Need
Kick Out The Jams
Kick Out Your Mother
Cut Up Your Friend
Screw Up Your Brother
Or He'll Get You In the End

And we know the flag of love is from above
And we can force you to be free
And we can force you to believe

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book
In which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words
Of the Free States' refrain
It said
I believe in the power of good
I believe in the state of love
I will fight for the right to be right
I will kill for the good of the fight
For the right to be right

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers
Through desolation rows
Plowing down man, woman
Listening to it's command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich

And I want to believe
In the madness that calls Now
And I want to believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

And I want to believe
And you want to believe
And we want to believe
And we want to live
Oh, we want to live

We want to live, we want to live
We want to live, we want to live
We want to live

I want to live, I want to live
I want to live, I want to live
I want to live, I want to live

Live
Live
Live
