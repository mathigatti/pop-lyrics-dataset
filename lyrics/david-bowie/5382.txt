All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same


Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two

(Throw me tomorrow)
Now that I've really got a chance
(Throw me tomorrow)
Everything's falling into place
(Throw me tomorrow)
Seeing my past to let it go
(Throw me tomorrow)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child

(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was)
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was)

Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet

Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms (Oh-neh don' go)

(Throw me tomorrow)
Now that I've really got a chance
(Throw me tomorrow)
Everything's falling into place
(Throw me tomorrow)
Seeing my past to let it go
(Throw me tomorrow)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child

(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was) Thursday's Child
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was) Thursday's Child
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was)
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was)
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was)
