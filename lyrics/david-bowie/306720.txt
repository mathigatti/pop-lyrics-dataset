You can go where you may
But I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know
I'll be waiting there


You can stray out of sight
'Cause I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know
I'll be waiting there

See you strong in the failing light
Just as strong, late at night
You can't lose my trail on you
Just you try, just you try

See me now, lost me now
But I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know
I'll be waiting there

See you strong in the failing light
Just as strong late at night
You can't lose my trail on you
Just you try, just you try

You can go where you may
I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know
