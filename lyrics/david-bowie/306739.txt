London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta


Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
Take me today
The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy
And his sellings thorny crown

I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away
But I loved her!

Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're far too un-kind
She loves to love all beauty
And she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money

I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now
But I loved her!
Ahhh!

Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Ahh

Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, eh
