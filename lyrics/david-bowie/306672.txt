Once we were lovers, can they understand?
Closer than others I was your, I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches, (ohh), I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day, to see if I'm
Faking it all


Can you hear me?
Can you feel me inside?
Show your love, love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right ahh)

There's been many others (Oo-oo-oo-oohh) so many times
Sixty new cities, an' what do I
What do I find?

I want love so badly, I want you most of all
You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall
Can you hear me call ya?

Can you (hear me?)
Can you (feel me inside?)
Show your (love, love)
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

Well, can you hear me? (yeah)
Can you feel me inside (I do)
Show your love, show your sweet,(your love) sweet love
