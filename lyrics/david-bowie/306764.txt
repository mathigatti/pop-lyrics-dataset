Don't look back
Whatever it takes to save your life
I've believed I belonged to you for a long time
And my heart says no, no one but you


Like a rescue on a darkened street
Love walked into town
I was a victim of my own self-persecution
I'm a prisoner of love-but I'm coming up for air

Now don't be fooled by fools who promise you
The world and all that glitters more fool you

I'm such a hungry man that I beg you over and over and over and
over
And I might take any highway to be there with you
Even the best men shiver in their beds
I'm loving you above everything I have
I'm a prisoner of love-just stay square
Like a sermon on a blues guitar
Love walked into town
I was drowning so slowly
One step in front of your shadow
I'm a prisoner of love but I'm coming up for air

Now don't be fooled by fools who promise you
The world and all that glitters more fool you

I smell the sickness sown in this city
It drives me to hide you, yeah, even deceive you
I'm so afraid for you that
I'll break any thug that maps out your passage to ruin
Even the best men shiver in their beds
I'm loving you above everything I have
I'm a prisoner of love
I'm a prisoner of love-just stay square
Take care take care
I'm a prisoner of love
Just stay square
Just stay square
Stay out the shooting gallery
Just stay square
I seen the best mans of my generation lay down in cemetary of
clematry
Just take care
Just stay square
Just stay square
Don't look back 
Beautiful soul
Don't look back
