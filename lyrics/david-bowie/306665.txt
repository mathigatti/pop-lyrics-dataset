My, my, the time do fly
When it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For I've never been a winner in my life


I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

My, my, but time do fly
When it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For I've never been a sinner, la di da

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
