I'm going home
I've been gone much too long
She said she missed me
Since I been gone
I'll be back soon
Ain't no doubt
'Cause she said she wanted my loving, my loving


No holding back I'm going home
No holding back I'm going home
I'm going stateside with my convictions
No holding back I'm going home
No holding back I'm going home
I'm going stateside with my convictions

I said I'm coming home soon
I don't know when
It i'll be sometime soon
Sooner than
I thought I'd be
I thought I'd be 
I thought I'd be stateside sooner or later

Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a blonde with no brain

I'm going stateside
I'm going stateside

I'm going home
It's been so long
She said she missed me
And all the fun we've had
I think it be the best way
She said she missed me
Every, every way, so

No holding back I'm going home
No holding back I'm going home
I'm going stateside with my convictions
No holding back I'm going home
No holding back I'm going home
I'm going stateside with my convictions

I've been gone so long
I've been gone, I've been gone
I'm missing you

Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a ten dollar raise

I'm going stateside
I'm going stateside
