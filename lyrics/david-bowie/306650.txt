Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away
Across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened
mind
Possessing and caressing me


Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on 
Across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open
ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million
suns
It calls me on and on and on
Across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing's gonna
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing's gonna
Noth, nothing's gonna change my world

Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Hey yeah, Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change my world

Nothing's gonna change it (nothing's gonna change it)
Nothing's gonna change it (no no no no no)
