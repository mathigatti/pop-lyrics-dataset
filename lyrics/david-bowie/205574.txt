Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was twenty-five
Don't wanna stay alive when you're twenty-five


Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
And Freddy's got spots from ripping off the stars from his face
A funky little boat race

The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Man, I need a T.V. when I've got T-Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed

I'm a dude 

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Booga-loo, dudes
Carry the news

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Booga-loo, dudes
Carry the news

Now Jimmy's looking sweet, though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule, it's a real mean team
We can love, we can love

And my brother's back at home with his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag, too many snags

Well, I drunk a lot of wine and I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around, or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed

I'm a dude

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Booga-loo, dudes
Carry the news

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Booga-loo, dudes
Carry the news

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Booga-loo, dudes

All the young dudes

Booga-loo, dudes

All the young dudes
