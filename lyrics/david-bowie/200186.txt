If you want it, boys, get it here thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing


Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?

Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal, and a taste
It's got claws, it's got me, it's got you
