I can go anyway (way I choose)
I can live anyhow (win or lose)
I can go anywhere (for something new)
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose


Do anything (right or wrong)
I can talk anyhow (and get along)
I don't care anyway (I never lose)
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Don't follow the lines that been laid before
I get along anyway I care
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere

I can go anyway (way I choose)
I can live anyhow (win or lose)
I can go anywhere (for something new)
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

(Oh oh oh) anyway, (oh oh oh) anyway I choose
(Oh oh oh) I wanna go
(Oh oh oh) do it myself, do it myself, (oh oh oh) do it myself
Do it myself
