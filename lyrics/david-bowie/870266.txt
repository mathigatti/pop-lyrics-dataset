Oh pity us here we angels of lead
We're dead, we're sick hanging by thread
Get real
Get real


You can't stop meaningful teenage cries
From deep behind fifty year old eyes
Get real
Get real

Chorus
I'm scared to touch
Too tense to be undone
I walk the streets
Not expecting morning sun

Against the voice of doom
Failures fall all over town

I guess i should, i feel i should
Get real
Get real

What's up?
What happened when i wasn't around?
Who did what?
What went down?

Get real
Get real

Think about myself it happens to me
It happens in the tunnel when i let myself feel

Get real
Get real

Chorus

I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town
I feel i should, i guess i should

Get real
Get real
Get real
Get real

The dazzle of light
The rape of life
The seed, the curse
The jazz of life

Get real
Get real

Get real
Get real
