Jacqui loves her work, and her work is love
For there is no other
She says "god has given me a job"
Jacqui loves her work
There is no other
Jacqui's aiming for the stars but landed on the clouds
There is no other
Sitting in her corner too afraid to run away
Like a slave without chains


The wonder turns to danger, spring turns to winter
God bless the girl
But I will treasure, treasure every single moment
God bless the girl
Fire turns to water, light becomes darkness
God bless the girl
And I don't wanna hurt you, just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl
God bless the girl
Yeah, I don't wanna hurt you, just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl

You don't need another friend, you just need a reason
There is no other
Jacqui loves her work, and her work is love
For there is no other

The wonder turns to danger, spring turns to winter
God bless the girl
But I will always treasure, treasure every single moment
God bless the girl
Fire turns to water and light becomes darkness
God bless the girl
I don't wanna hurt you, just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl
God bless the girl
God bless the girl (god bless the girl)
I don't wanna hurt you, just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl (god bless the girl)
The years pass so swiftly
God bless the girl (god bless the girl)
Years pass so swiftly
God bless the girl (god bless the girl)
God bless the girl (god bless the girl)
God bless the girl (god bless the girl)
God bless the girl (god bless the girl)
