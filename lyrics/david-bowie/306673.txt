Question-time that says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
Mother says that she can't stand
The neighbours talking
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home
Start walking, yeah
I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime


I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

Remember when we used to go to church on Sundays
I lay awake at night
Terrified of school on Mondays
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again

I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends
Always been found and I can't

I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

Now I leave them all in the never never land
The station seems so cold
The ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name: "Hi Dave
Drop in, see around, come back
If you're this way again"
Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a long way to go
I hope I make it on my own

I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
