I'm waiting for my man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man


Hey white boy, what you doin' uptown
Hey white boy, you chasin' our women around
Oh pardon me sir, it springs to my mind
I'm just looking for a good friendly behinde
I'm waiting for my man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Real shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man

Dirty brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Nobody's tried to pinn you but nobody cares
He's got the works gives you sweet taste
Then you gotta split because he's got no time to waste
I'm waiting for my man

Baby don't you holler, honey don't you ball and shout
I'm feeling good, I know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feel oh so fine
Until tomorrow but that's just another time
I'm waiting for my man.

To welcomeing home
