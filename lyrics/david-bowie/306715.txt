My love wherever you are
Whatever you are, don't lose faith
I know it's gonna happen someday
to you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
You say that the day never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
to you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
Please wait
Please wait
Please, don't lose faith
Don't lose faith


You say that the day never arrives
And it seems so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
Someday to you
To you
Please wait
Please wait
