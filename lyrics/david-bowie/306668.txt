You promised me the ending would be clear
You'd let me know when the time was now
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear
Memories that flutter like bats out of hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasn't worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on


Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible

Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible

We could dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire

Feed me no lies
I don't know about you
I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you
I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you
I don't know about you

Dead or alive
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king

Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the '70s
Smelling of love through the moist winds
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Close me in the dark, let me disappear
Soon there'll be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release

Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire

Feed me no lies
I don't know about you
I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you
I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you
I don't know about you

Dead or alive
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
