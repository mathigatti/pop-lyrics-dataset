Where's the pain in the violent night?
I'm depressed by the grill
I stay over many years
I should have thought of that
For the love of the money
Like a black-hearted vile thing
It's the nature of being


It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell bad from wrong
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me

When the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view
I should have thought of that
And the sound of tomorrow
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Like the silence of tension

It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell good from bad
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me

You've been around
Can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me

Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change!

Too exchanging

You've been around 

but you've changed me

You've been around 

can't pass you by

You've been around 

but you've changed me

You've been around 

can't pass you by

You've been around
