Turn and turn again
Turn and turn again


I shake
And stare the sun
Till my eyes burn

I shake
At the mothers
Brutal vermin

I shake
And stare
At the watery moon

With the same desire
As the sober Philistine

And I shake

Turn and turn again
Turn and turn again

Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again

The screw
Is a tightening Atrocity

I shake
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell

The need
To have seen it all
The voyeurOf utter destruction
As beauty

And I shake

Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again

I shake

Turn and turn again

I shake

I shake

I shake

Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day
Call it a day
Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
Call it a day
Call it a day
