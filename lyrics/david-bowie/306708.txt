When you speak, you speak to me
When you sleep, you sleep by me
When you wake, you wake with me
When you walk, you follow two steps behind in life


Shadows stalking, ever grasping sinking for a need
It wasn't love it was the fix of never wanting me
Now I'm gone, you're tossing and you turning in your sleep
That's the name of the game, of the game, of the game

Cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are

When you speak, you speak to me
When you sleep, you sleep by me
When you wake, you wake with me
When you walk, you follow two steps behind in life

Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are

Some days are heaven, I will not deny
Probing the daylight cascading the skyline
Tripping and diving and losing it all
Back came the night time living for more

Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now that I'm gone
I was the devil monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are

When you speak, you speak to me
When you sleep, you sleep by me
When you wake, you wake with me
When you walk, you follow two steps behind
