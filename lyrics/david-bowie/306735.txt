I'll give you back my right to be free
I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free


I've got moon, I've got sun
Lightning, lightning, lightning
I've got me, I've got you
Frightening, frightening, frightening

I'll give you back my farmland and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I'll give you back my farmland and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free

I've got moon, I've got sun
(I've got) Lightning, lightning, lightning
I've got me, I've got you
(It's) Frightening, frightening, frightening
