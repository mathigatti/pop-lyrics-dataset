I'm lazy
You're crazy, girl
Stay by my side


I'm scared you'll
Meet someone
In whom you'll confide no no no

Life's still a dream
Your love's amazing
Since I found you
My life's amazing

I pledge you
Never be blue
There's too much at stake to be down

My nightmare
Rooted here watching you go
Divine in both, our lives

Life's still a dream
Your love's amazing amazing
Since I found you
My life's a roll
Go go go
And it's amazing

It's amazing
Go go go
It's amazing
Oh
Oh
Oh
Go go go
Oh
Oh
It's amazing
