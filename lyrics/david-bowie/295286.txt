Said you'd took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh, so quietly
They say


Should've took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame
Something cheap for you

Everyone says hi

Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing to say

I'd love to get a letter
Like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good
And it's not too hot for you

Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi

Everyone says
Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says hi

If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do all the old things
We can do all the bad things

If the food gets too eerie
You can always phone
We could do all the good things
We could do it, we could do it
We could do it

Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are

Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi

And the girl next door
Everyone says hi
And the guy upstairs
Everyone says hi
And your mum and dad
Everyone says hi
And your big fat dog
Everyone says hi
