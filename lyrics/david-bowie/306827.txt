Grown inside a plastic box
Micro thoughts and safety locks
Hearts become outdated clocks
Ticking in your mind


Now it's time to close our eyes
Now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's time to face the lie
That we'd never cry

What's really happening, what tore us apart
What's really happening
What's really happening, what tore us apart
What's really happening

All the clouds are made of glass
And they're slowly sinking
Falling like the shattered past
Were we built to last?

What's really happening, what tore us apart
What's really happening
What's really happening, what tore us apart
What's really happening

Now it's time to close our eyes
Now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's time to face the lie
That we'd never cry

What's really happening, what tore us apart
