Two by two, they go walking by
Hand in hand, they watch me cry
(Two by two, hand in hand)


Lonely nights, I dream you're there
Morning sun and you're gone
(Lonely nights, morning sun)

(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
Do anything you say, do anything

One desire I ask of you
Please be mine, please be mine
(One desire, please be mine)

Thousand years and I'll return
You'll be mine, you'll be mine
(Thousand years, you'll be mine)

(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
Do anything you say, do anything

Two by two they're walking by
Hand in hand, they watch me cry
(Two by two, hand in hand)

(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
(Maybe) ] I'll do anything you say
(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
Do anything you say, do anything

(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
