Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out


Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo

She was born in a handbag
love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey
try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about

Chorus:
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo

First thing she learns is she's a citizen,
some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
something rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out her way
stealing for that one good rush

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

She could use a little money
she's hangin' on his arms like a cheap suit
she's got no money, honey
she's the other side
Oh come on little baby
late night, big town, police, shake down

Oo Oo
Oo Oo
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Oo Oo
Oo Oo
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

She's got a ticket to nowhere
she's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
she's in the pocket of a home boy
Oo she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make them well aware
she's an angry gal

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shootin' her down
Shootin her with video-drugs-bullets and promises
