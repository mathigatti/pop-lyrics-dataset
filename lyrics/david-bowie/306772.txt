Wish I was a sailor
Crossing an azure sea
Under leaden skies
Under your eyes


But I can't see too far
With these animal eyes
Can't hold my breath
Without your voice

And I'm danger-prone
For I'll be bound
I'll be as fast as hell
Without your touch

And I'll run run run run run run run
And I'll run run run run run
Without your love

I'm a goldman
In a soaring tower
And it's cold in here
Without your love

And there's trouble in here-trouble out there
Mainline problems till you no longer care
It's a long-low life-it's duty bound
No hope-no life-no you-ah ha

And I run run run run run run run
Yeah run run run run run
Without your love

I duck the shots-and tilt the world
I talk myself crazy-shoot the breeze
Shout to live-shoot to kill
Double up in pain-I'm on my knees

And I run run run run run run run
