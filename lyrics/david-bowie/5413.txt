This story is about love
The woman I loved is dead


There was a boy.
A very strange enchanted boy.
They say he wondered very far, very far, over land and sea.
A little shy, and sad of eye
But very wise was he.
And then one day
One magic day he passed my way.
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me:

The greatest thing
You'll ever learn
Is just to love
And be loved in return.
