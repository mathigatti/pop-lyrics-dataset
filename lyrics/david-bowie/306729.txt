Well, Annie's pretty neat, she always eats her meat
Joe is awful strong, bet your life he's putting us on
Oh lordy, oh lordy, you know I need some loving
Oh move me, touch me


John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on, but I'm only dancing
She turns me on, don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing

Oh shadow love was quick and clean, life's a well-thumbed
machine
I saw you watching from the stairs, you're everyone that ever
cared
Oh lordy, oh lordy, you know I need some loving
Move me, touch me

John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on, but I'm only dancing
She turns me on, but don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing

John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on, but I'm only dancing
She turns me on, but don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing

Dancing 
Won't someone dance with me?
