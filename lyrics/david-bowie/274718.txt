Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide
I'll take it by your side
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide
I'll take it by your side
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies
I'll take it by your side
Over-saturation curls the skin and tans the hide
I'll take it by your side


Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock

Tick, tick
Tick, tick, tick
Tick, tick, tick
Tick, tock

Tick

I'm unclean, a libertine
And every time you vent your spleen
I seem to lose the power of speech
You're slipping slowly from my reach

You grow me like an evergreen
You've never see the lonely me at all

I
Take the plan, spin it sideways
I
Fall

Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing

Take the plan, spin it sideways
