Skeletal city highs
Crazies with dumb replies
Nobody's eyes anymore


Frown on your beggar's face
Walking this lunarscape
Nothing in my lackaday

We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes

Somebody's space to rent
Somebody's soul to dent
Dog is in every word

Hiding the flames of power
Hiding us home by home
Nearly got out yesterday

We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes

Trouble, it travels on the wing
Doorway to door
Open your eyes
Nothing remains
A secret love between us

Nothing can hide for long
We are the morning song
Holding my breath anyway

We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes
