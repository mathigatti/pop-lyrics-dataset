I was
Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But I've been having a mid-life crisis
And I've been dreaming in a sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored english
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are


I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone

I am with name
I am with name
I am with name
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone

She should say: twitch &amp; stream
It'll end in chrome
Night of the female
Good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
She should say
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone

A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millenium fetish
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
I am with name

Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone

(Give it to me one more time!)
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descending
