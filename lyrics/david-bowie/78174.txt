The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you
If one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you
If one can grasp it


A series of shocks, sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling, witnesses falling
It's got nothing to do with you
If one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you
If one can grasp it

Yea, yea, yea
Up the hill backwards
It'll be alright

While we sleep they go to work
We're legally crippled
It's the death of love
It's got nothing to do with you
If one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you
If one can grasp it

More idols than realities
I'm ok, you're so-so

Yea, yea, yea
Up the hill backwards
It'll be alright
