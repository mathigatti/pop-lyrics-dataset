Johnny's in America
Low-tech's at the wheel
No one needs anyone
They don't even just pretend


Johnny's in America

I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

Johnny's in America

Johnny wants a brain
Johnny wants to suck on a Coke
Johnny wants a woman
Johnny wants to think of a joke

Johnny's in America

I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

Johnny's in America
Johnny looks up at the stars
Johnny combs his hair
Johnny wants pussy and cars

Johnny's in America

I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world

I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world

I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
