Once upon a time there was a toy soldier and he lived in the play
room


Once upon a time there was a toy soldier with a whip lash in his
hand
and every night little girl Sadie would take all her clothes off
and wind up the toy soldier and he raised his whip and said

On your knees little sadie
Little Sadie on your knees
Taste the whip and love might given likely
Taste the whip and bleed for me

Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she run home from school each day

Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she locked her door so she could play

Little Sadie got ambitious
And wound the clockworks so to tighter
So he could whip her harder and harder

On your knees little sadie
Little Sadie on your knees
Taste the whip and love might given likely
Taste the whip and bleed for me

One day Sadie wound and wound
and wound and wound
and wound and wound

Til suddenly the little toy soldier spring, went. . .

(ugly, beat her to death)

Ahhhh
