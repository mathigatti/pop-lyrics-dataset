Well I stood stone like at midnight
Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
Came out with my soul untouched


I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said 'Sit down' I stood up
Ooh-ohh ooh hoo growin' up

The flag of piracy flew from my mast 
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate 
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed the B-52 and bombed em with the blues 
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school 
Never once gave thought to landing, no

I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd 
But when they said Come down I threw up
Ooh-ooh growin' up

I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere 
And you know it's really hard to hold your breath
And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared 
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well my feet finally took root in the earth 
But I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe 
In the engine of an old parked car

I hid in the mother breast of the crowd 
But when they said move down I moved up
Ooh ooh ooh, don't you know that I'm growin' up
