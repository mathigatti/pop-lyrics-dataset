No-one ever saw you
Moving through the dark
Leaving slips of paper
Somewhere in the park
Hidden from your friends
Stealing all they knew
Love is thrown in airless rooms
Then vile rewards for you


But I'm gonna tell
Yes I've gotta tell
Gotta tell the things you've said
When you're talking in the dark
And I'm gonna tell the things you've done
When you're walking through the park

Some night on the thriller’s street
Will come the silent gun
You've got a dangerous heart
You stole their trust, their moon, their sun
There'll come assassin’s needle
On a crowded train
I bet you'll feel so lonely
You could die

Buildings crammed with people
Landscape filled with wrath
Grey concrete city
Rain has wet the street
I want to see you clearly
Before you close the door
A room of bloody history
You made sure of that

I can see you as a corpse
Hanging from a beam
I can read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room
Oh see if I care
Oh please, please make it soon

Walls have got you cornered
You've got the blues my friend
And people don't like you
But you will leave without a sound
Without an end

Oblivion shall own you
Death alone shall love you
I hope you feel so lonely
You could die
You feel so lonely
You could die
You feel so lonely
You could die
