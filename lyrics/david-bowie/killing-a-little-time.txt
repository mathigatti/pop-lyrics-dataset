I staggered through this criminal reign
I'm not in love, no phony pain
Creeping through this tidal wave
No warm embrace, just a lover's grain
This symphony
This rage in me
I've got a handful of songs to sing
To sting your soul
To fuck you over
This furious reign


I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
And a broken line
I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
Just killing a little time

I love the sound of an empty room
The screams of night, the end of love
Two beating hearts, one labored scarred
One open wound, wasted and drowned
No sympathy
This furious reign

I lay in bed
The monster fed, the body bled
I turned and said
I get some of you all the time
All of you some other time
This rage in me
Get away from me

I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
And a broken line
I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
Just killing a little time

This symphony
Get away from me
