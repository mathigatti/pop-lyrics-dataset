Tell me when you're sad
I'm gonna make it cool again
I know you're feeling bad
Tell me when you're cool again


Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me

We fly through the night
The tears on your lips
Life has your mind and soul
It spins on your hips

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me

You look at me and you weep
For the free blue sky
I look to the stars
As they flicker and float in your eyes
And under these wings of steel
The small town dies

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
