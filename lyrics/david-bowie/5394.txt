How you turn my world
You precious thing.
You starve and near exhaust me.


Everything I've done,
I've done for you.
I moved the stars for no one.

You've run so long.
You've run so far.
Your eyes can be so cruel,
Just as I can be so cruel,
Oh I do believe in you.
Yes I do.

Live without the sunlight.
Love without your heartbeat.
(Falsetto) I... I...
Can't.. live.. within.. you...
