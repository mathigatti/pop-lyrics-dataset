Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
Come and they go
Like breeze
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face


Girls
They come and they go
Like spirits
They vanish at dawn
My heart
Suspended in time
Like you
Vanish like tears in the rain

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away

Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away

We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel

Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
They come and they go
Like spirits
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away

Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away

We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel

Girls
