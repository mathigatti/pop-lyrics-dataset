I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty


In the street a man shouts out loud
A wallet drops
And money flies into the midday sun

With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground

Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire

With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground

Sure I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire

I don't want knowledge, I want certainty
I don't want knowledge, I want certainty

In a house a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs
What a morning

With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground

Sure I get a little bit afraid

With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound
With the sound of the ground

Sure I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire

Oh, I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Sometimes
Earthlings
(I don't want knowledge, I want certainty)
(I don't want knowledge, I want certainty)
