A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
And ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie


Jean Genie, lives on his back
The Jean Genie, loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie, let yourself go!

Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him
But just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand
Won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician
And sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair
For making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

Jean Genie, lives on his back
The Jean Genie, loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie, let yourself go!

He's so simple minded
He can't drive his module
He bites on the neon
And sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved

Jean Genie, lives on his back
The Jean Genie, loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie, let yourself go!
