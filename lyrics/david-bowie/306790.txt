Stone love, she kneels before the grave
A brave son who gave his life to save the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving


New love, a boy and girl are talking
New words that only they can share in
New words, a love so strong, it tears their hearts
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning

Love is careless in its choosing, sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving

Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love and how my God on high is
All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

Love is careless in its choosing, sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving

Lailai-la-la la-la-la-la-la-lai-lai
Lailai-la-la la-la-la-la-la-lai-lai
