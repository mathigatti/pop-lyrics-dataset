You can stay at home alone
You can stay at home alone
Don't even answer the phone
I will come when it's right
And I won't stay all night
For I see something bad
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
I see a hole in the ground
I see a hole in the ground
But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
But I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
There's a hole in the ground
There's a hole in the ground
But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
And I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
