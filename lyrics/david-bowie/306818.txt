I don't know why but I'm tired of my mind
Pain is over me, overloading
I don't know why but you're trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile, throw your head back
And cry


I don't believe but I'm trying to decide
Which game is best for me, which can I bear
You don't perceive so I'm leading you away
Home were you've never been, non-returning
So cry

Throw a rock upon the road and it breaks into pieces
Shake a branch upon the snow and the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain and I'll make all the papers

I don't know why but I'm tired of my life
