No more delight or crawling around
Whisper the word and hold my hand
Never forget those who refuse you
Never forget who you've been


And you will fight with demons
When we shall go to town
And we'll eat between the rich men
And we'll dream, if we don't go down

Follow the light, stay on the outside
The only way in is swollen with tears
Don't bring your things, just let me serve you
Only the fool turns around

Then you will fight with demons
When we shall go to town
And you will wear your best shoes
And we'll dance, if we don't go down
And we'll dance, if we don't go down
