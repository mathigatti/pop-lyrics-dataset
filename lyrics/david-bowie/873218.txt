I've been cryin' (boo-hoo)
'cause i'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned (to tears)
But tears won't wash away the fear


That you're never ever gonna return (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
To ease the fire that within me burns (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
It keeps me cryin', baby, for you
Keep me sighin', baby, for you

So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)

I've given up my friends just (for you)
My friends have gone and you have too
No more peace will i find (mmm, mmm)
Until you come back and be mine (mmm, mmm)

No matter what you do or say (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'm gonna love you anyway (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Keep on cryin', baby, for you
I'm gonna keep me sighin', baby, for you

So come on hurry
Come on and see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)

Sometimes up (up, mmm, mmm)
Sometimes down (down, mmm, mmm)
My life is uncertain (mmm, mmm)
With you not around (mmm, mmm)

From my arms you may be out of reach (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
But my heart says you're here to keep (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Keeps me cryin', baby, for you
Keep on, keep on cryin', baby, for you

So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)
You know i'm so lonely (come see about me)
I love you only (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)
Hurry, hurry (come see about me)
