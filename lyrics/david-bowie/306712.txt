I've got the village I love - dig everything
I walk along beside the garbagemen
And I dig everything - dig everything
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything - dig everything
Ain't had a job for a year or more
And I don't know a thing - dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig


I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square
And I dig everything - dig everything
I've sit just behind my window
Till my cigarettes were low
And dug everything - dig everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town
And I dig everything - dig everything
I'd see people in the street below
Who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything - dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig

I've got more friends than I had out for dinners
Some of them were losers
But the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room
And we dig everything
Dig

I've made myself at home - dig everything
I've made good friends which the time-check girl
On the end of the phone
All the movie shows - dig everything
I sunbathe for love - dig everything
Even when it's not too hot - dig everything
'Cause I dig everything - dig everything
