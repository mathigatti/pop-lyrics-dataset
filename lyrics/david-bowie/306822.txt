Ain't got room for charity
Skeletons man
Me, I'm crawling with no cash
chop it up
Me, I'm looking for hot flesh
chop it up


This skeleton's mine
Chop it up
Chop it up

Blood on video-video crime
Video crime
Needles and pins and video crime
Video crime
I've got dollars-I've got sense
Wonder where the Third World went

Aint got time for honeymoon
chop it up
Trash Time Bundy, Death Row Chic
chop it up
Haunt this street from half past ten
chop it up

Blood on video-video crime
Video crime
Needles and pins and video crime
Video crime
Late night cannibal-cripples decay
Just can't tear my eyes away

Ain't got no room for charity
this skeleton's mine
Ain't got room for Hollywood
chop it up
Me, I'm crawling with no cash
chop it up
Blood on video-video crime
Video crime
Needles and pins and video crime
Video crime
I've got dollars I've got sense
Wonder where the Third World went

Video crime
Chop it up
Video crime
Chop it up
Video crime
Chop it up
Video crime
Chop it up
Video crime
