Gather you all and listen here
I'll tell you a tale if you lend me an ear
I rode a horse through many a town
But the devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now I'm the devil's man, na na na
And now I sing a tail of woe
Through the bars of the county jail


I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The sheriff ran in and said I'm holding you, son

Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour mar I lied
Now I will not have a ride
Beside the window the scaffold was made
