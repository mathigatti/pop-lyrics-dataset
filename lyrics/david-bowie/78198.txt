When I believed in nothing I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place
I called her name
And though my days are slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought I'd die
She danced her little dance 'till it made me cry
She was shakin' like this honey doing that


When I needed soul revival I called your name
When I was falling to pieces I screamed in pain

Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance 'till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that

Never let me down She never let me down
Never let me down She never let me down

When all your faith is failing Call my name
When you've nothing coming Call my name

I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
I'll dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

Never let you down I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down I'll never let you down
