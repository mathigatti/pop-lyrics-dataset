You ask me what I like about the people here and there and around me
I want to live and people are the nicest kind of folk to live with
See the child with hair of blue, the one the boys are talking too
I can smell the spring in her mind
Friends of mine are red and green I see you don't know what I mean and I'm sad


Look at the man with the pretty balloons, he doesn't buy April's tooth of gold
Look at the man with the pretty balloons, he doesn't buy April's tooth of gold

The can we call a motor car it's 1905 but it's groovy
We call the place the house of lights there are no bulbs 'cause things like that cost money
I like trips to seaside towns for tea cups in the rain
The pavement is a table for five

Would you like to hold my hand and wander through our beautiful land?
I'll give you flowers

Look at my friend with unusual eyes
We're hung up on April's tooth of gold

Look at my friend with unusual eyes
We're hung up on April's tooth of gold

Look at my friend with unusual eyes
We're hung up on April's tooth of gold

Strolling along on peculiar street and marvel at April's tooth of gold

La la la la la la la la la
