The sewage,
In a west end city
In a west end city
Smells like daisies
In Stamford Hill
In Stamford Hill
Ain't it fucking curious some other cunts
Are trying to ditch the King
Of Stamford Hill
Of Stamford Hill


The sewage,
In a west end city
In a west end city
Smells like daisies
In Stamford Hill
In Stamford Hill
Ain't it fucking curious some other cunts
Are trying to ditch the King
Of Stamford Hill
Of Stamford Hill

Gonna build an army
March them to the marches
Marching up and down
Watch them flap their little wings
Someone's gonna lose his poxy face

Ain't it fucking curious some other cunts
Are trying to ditch the King
Of Stamford Hill
Of Stamford Hill
