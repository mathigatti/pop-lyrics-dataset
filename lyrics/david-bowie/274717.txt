Cruising around me, the flames burn my body

Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again and again?


You're a sorry little girl
You're a sorry little girl

Please hide
For the pain must feel like snow

You're a sorry little girl
Sorry, little girl

Please hide
From the kiss and the bite

Shame burns

Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in only does
The pain must feel like snow
I'm no longer your golden boy

Sorry, little girl
I'm sorry, little girl

The pain must feel like snow
There you go

Cover me, cover me
We flew on your wings, yeah
We were Duke and the Devil
And this one will never go down

We had such wishful beginnings
But we lived unbearable lives

I'm sorry, little girl
Sorry, little girl

So, so sorry, little girl

The pain must feel like snow
There you go

There you go
