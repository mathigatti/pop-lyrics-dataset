All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the waste-land
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise,
right between the ey..es


Seemed a good idea
to drop a bomb on the waste-land, yeah
Only one man could be seen,
and he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair,
and the red light flashed "beware"
Pilot felt quite big-time
as the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
when the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
and the smoke began to clear,
it was positively queer!

"Die" said the General,
"cobblers" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable,
and the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
ripped apart that sand
'Til the stench was just revolting!,
and the sky a green-ish tan
But the soldier said "Sir,
there's a crack in the world"
And the figures went "squash",
and the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!

When the smoke had blown away,
there was nothing left to view
Except a man, dear Lord!, he look like you
Floating high,
up in the sky...
