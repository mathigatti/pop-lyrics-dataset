Something's going on in society
(Dancing with the big boys)
You chew your fingers and stare at the floor
(Dancing with the big boys)
One wrong word and you're out of sync
Talking bout a hands on policy
(Big boys)
Death to the trees
(Dancing with the big boys)
They weren't bad, they weren't brave
Nothing is embarrassing
(Dancing with the big boys)
There are too many people, too much belief
(Dancing with the big boys)
Where there's trouble there's poetry
(Dancing with the big boys)
Your family is a football team
(Big boys)
This dot marks your location
(Dancing with the big boys)
Loneliness in a free society
(Dancing with the big boys)
(Big boys)
This can be embarrassing
(Big boys)
(Dancing with the big boys)
(Big boys)
(Big boys)
