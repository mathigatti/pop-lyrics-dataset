Shine shine shine


Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine

Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine

Bleed like a crazed dad
These are the craze

Easy come come goto go back
in the valley of the dead man walks
how they drank from the jazz

Astral kestrel, fed into the featherfall
Fed him on a pencil carving you will never get

Shine shine shine
Bleed like crazed Dad
These are the craze

Seek for a leather journey never stopped to think about
Hollywood King Kong domino on the side

Street light levitated down stop the blue for 5 dollar gonna
keep my domino on the side

Street light, looking right looking to the parlous parlours
Party on the dead put a net through his headache

Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Bleeeeed
Bleed like a crazed Dad
These are the craze

Living on a movie all the Shirley/Charley films on film
Come together, party footnote on the footstone

Shine shine shine
