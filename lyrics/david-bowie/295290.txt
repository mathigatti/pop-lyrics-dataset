I've been looking for a woman to save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with the feeling of losing once or twice
Who knows how could it be
Be tomorrow?


I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now

A woman with the feeling of losing once or twice
Who knows how could it be
Be tomorrow?

I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
