There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm trying not to lose control
But you're just pushin' for a fight
You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking for a break


Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away
What kind of love is he giving you
I'm-a-dizzy's what I'm trying to say
Too Dizzy-You can't have a lover
Too Dizzy-It's me and no other
I'm a bad loser-I'm-a-shakin' in anger
Too Dizzy-you can't have no lover

2nd time: Don't come any harder
Don't come any closer

You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm-a-ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itchin'-twitchin'-itchin' for a break

There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking for a break

Is it love or is it what...
