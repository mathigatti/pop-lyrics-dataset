Here's the town in which I live Petunia Green 
Here's the shop and here's the man who sold me laces for my
shoes 
There is Mr.Marcus. Boys they say he's mad 
'Here's the battle that they won' Silver Treetop School For Boys


Early days were good as gold 
An apple here an apple there 
And everywhere a 'yes sir', 'no sir' 
They made me roll the cricket pitch once a day 
I've never been so happy than at Silver Treetop School For Boys

The mowing machine was leaving small piles of grass
That when the ??? had risen to the pipe of Mr.Marcus 
The smell of teaching fell upon the cricket field 
Smiling, laughing, rolling about at Silver Treetop School For
Boys.

Hey there 
They call in the staff room 
They call in the canteen 
"Hey come and look at what I found"
"I found some boys and Masters sitting
On the cricket ground at Silver Treetop School For Boys"

The English master, Sir, he wores a purple mask
and the Head, was usually sad, was swinging from a tree 
Mr.Brown the Physics man is off his head 
And everyone just loves the grass at Silver Treetop School For
Boys
