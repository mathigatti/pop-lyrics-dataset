The ghost of Manhattoes
Shrieking as they fall
From AT&amp;T
Someone sees it all
Goodbye Mr. Ed
Andy's skull enshrined
In a shopping mall near Queens
Someone sees it all


Icarus takes his pratfall
Bruegel on his head
Goodbye Mr. Ed

Four and twenty black kids
Some of them are blind
Someone sees it all
Tolerance of violence
By the fellows with no heads
Goodbye Mr. Ed

Some things are so big
They make no sense
Histories so small
People are so dense
Someone sees it al
Goodbye Mr. Ed
Some things are so big
They make no sense
Histories so small
People are so dense
Someone sees it al
Goodbye Mr. Ed

Never mind the Pistols
They laid the Golem eggs
Others came to hatch them
Outside the pale
Someone sees it all
