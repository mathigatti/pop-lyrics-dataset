Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFO


I come to the glade and watch the saucer land
She glided through the mist in a daylight skirt
Booted her shoes like hooves in the dirt
Her clutch bag reflected the sun and steel
The 50's movie, so many squealed
There’s no direction home she pleads
She cornered me against the trees
I was home I thought, my life could start

She was (not like the other girls)
(I was) born under a star
(We were) born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO

My friends sit around at the end of town
With their heads in their hands in the cool twilight air
I can see my rise at the pitching saw
I’d rather be dead than fool around here anymore
She was all courage, geometric face
Electric skin, plastic and pace
Silver hair, trapezoid flesh
I was so in love with her lavender breasts

She was (not like the other girls)
(I was) born under a star
(We were) born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Like outer space

Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO
(She was) born in a UFO
