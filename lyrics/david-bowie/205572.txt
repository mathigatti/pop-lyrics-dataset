African nightmare, one-time Mormon
More men fall in, Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman, I went too far
Bent on a windfall, rent a Sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey, no, he wished me well


Seems like another day I could fly
Into the eye of God on high

His burning eye will see me through
(One of these days, one of these days)
(Gotta get a word through one of these days)

His burning eye will see me through
(One of these days, one of these days)
(Gotta get a word through one of these days)

Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare-strip, take-off, skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber, less than peace

Struggle with a child whose screaming-dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life, quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one left un-named

Seems like another day, I could fly
Into the eye of God on high

Seems like another day, I could fly
Into the eye of God on high

Over the bushland, over the trees
Wise like orangutan, that was me

His burning eye will see me through
(One of these days, one of these days)
(Gotta get a word through one of these days)

His burning eye will see me through
(One of these days, one of these days)
(Gotta get a word through one of these days)
