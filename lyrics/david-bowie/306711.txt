I can't read and I can't write down
I don't know a book from countdown
I don't care which shadow gets me
All I've got is someone's face


Money goes to money heaven
Bodies go to body hell
I just cough, catch the chase
Switch the channel watch the police car

I can't read shit anymore
I just sit back and ignore
Cause I just can't get it right, can't get it right
I can't read shit I can't read shit

Oh

When you see a famous smile
No matter where you run your mile
To be right in that photograph
Andy where's my fifteen minutes

I said
Yeah
I can't read shit anymore
I just can't read shit anymore
No matter I just can't get it right
I can't reach it
I can't reach it
No
No
Uh
Uh
