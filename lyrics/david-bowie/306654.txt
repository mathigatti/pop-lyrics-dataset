Hey hey is the tall sail 
on a beam lit put your hand
Make way for to java
Watching for bogies
Hey hey it's a dreaming 
I would burn you if you should die
Hey hey I would burn too 
If you should lie upon that bamboo pyre


I dream of Amlapura
Never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura 
Of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone

Hey hey golden roses around
A rajahç£- mouth
Hey hey all the dead children buried standing

A flying Dutchman, smoking gun and spice wind

I dream of Amlapura, never saw in
all my life a more shining jewel

I dream of Amlapura, of an ocean
or deram of a princess in stone

I dream of Amlapura 
Of the the princess in stone

Hey hey it's a talkshow

Hey hey

Hey hey
