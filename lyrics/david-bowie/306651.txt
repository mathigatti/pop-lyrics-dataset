Thaaa
Thaaa


Always in trouble
Never to blame
Must be a double
You are the same
Here it comes again

Doing the wrong thing
Forgetting your li..ines
Waiting for something better to shine
Take that same okay

After today, fortune man will find you
After today, they will find you working
After today, you'll find the ones you're after
After today, look out, after today

What kind of rescue?
What will you be?
Where can you take it, baby boy? For me
Break that heart for me

After today, the fortune fan will find you
After today, they will fly you away
After today, you'll find the one you're after
After today, look out, after today

After today, the fortune fan will find you
After today, they will fly you away
After today, you'll find the one you're after
After today, look out, after today

Today
After today
After toda-ay, hey
Look out, after today
Ah, yeah
Look, ah (laughter)
(spoken : I was gettin' in to that)
