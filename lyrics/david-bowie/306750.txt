Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people brand new people
They're something to see
Nightclubbing real nightclubbing
Or isn't it wild


Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dancers brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
When we're nightclubbing
Bright white clubbing
Or isn't it wild
