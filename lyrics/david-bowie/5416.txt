Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true


They got a message from the Action Man
I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following

The shreiking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick, but the planet is glowing

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again

I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light, but no smoking pistol

I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I've never done anything out of the blue

Want an axe to break the ice
Want to come down right now

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
