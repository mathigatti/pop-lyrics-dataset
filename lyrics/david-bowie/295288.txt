Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And boy, I really felt blue


Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars
The winding stream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream

I took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
Well I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
Pulled down my sun visor
Boy, I really felt blue

You jumped into your Gemini
I jumped into mine
We'll orbit the Moon
For just one time
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
Will you hold hands
With me under the moonlight

Took a trip in a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you

I took, I took a walk in space
Boy, I really felt blue
Well I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back
The stardust trail
Leading back to you

What did I do
What could I do
What did I do
Well, I thought about you
I thought about you

Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And thought about you
