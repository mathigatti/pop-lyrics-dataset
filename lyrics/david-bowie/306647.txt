To meet her once just to know it through and through
I know, I know
But it ain't finished till the fat lady sings
I know, I know


How can I help you?
You're just a wanna-be
I'm a believer
You're a sex receiver
And me with a big hurt
You know I had a big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
'Cause you're my roommate from hell

Got to take some blows on the stepping stones
Speak in extreme
It'll save you time
You were a saint abroa
But a devil at home
Come on here, woo-woo
And kiss it for me

To meet her once just to know it through and through
I know, I know I know
Even a glass eye in a duck's ass can see that
I know, I know

How can I help you?
A meet with a big hurt
You know I had
A great big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
And here come the indians oooo

Got to take some blows on the stepping stones
Speak in extreme
It'll save you time
You were a saint abroa
But a devil at home
Come on here, woo-woo
And kiss it for me

Kiss it for me, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Woo-woo, kiss it for me
Come on here, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Kiss it where it counts
Kiss it for me
Come on here, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
I know
I know
