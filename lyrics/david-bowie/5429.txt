(This is not America, sha-la-la-la-la)

A little piece of you
A little peace in me will die
(This is not a miracle)
For this is not America


Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare too long
(This is not America)
For this is not a miracle

There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

(For this is not America)
(Sha-la-la-la-la)
(Sha-la-la-la-la)
(Sha-la-la-la-la)

(This is not America)
No!
(This is not, sha-la-la-la-la)

Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to the ground
(This could be the biggest sky)
So bloody red, tomorrow's clouds

A little piece of you
A little piece in me will die
(This could be a miracle)
For this is not America

There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

(For this is not America)
(Sha-la-la-la-la)
(Sha-la-la-la-la)
(Sha-la-la-la-la)

(This is not America)
No!
(This is not, sha-la-la-la)

(This is not America)
No!
(This is not)

(This is not America)
No!
(This is not, sha-la-la-la)
