Frozen to the glass again
Out of our skins again
Cold I am, tonight I am
Tomorrow's really on my mind


Sure to think of, from now on
The things will move more slowly
But thin is thin and chances slim
And sometimes we all have those dreams

Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

In this skyline

The past it almost shimmers now
All we needed, all we wished for
But here I am and safe am I
Trusting in the lament sky

Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

In this skyline

Skyline
Skyline
Skyline

Are things getting better now?
Are things getting worse?
But I'm standing in the sunshine
And it lifts my heart and feeds my mind

Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

In this skyline

Skyline
Skyline
Skyline
Skyline
Skyline
Skyline
