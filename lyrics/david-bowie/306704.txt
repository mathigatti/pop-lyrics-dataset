I should never call her
Heartbreakers, never kill
But she's been New Zealand on another trip
Have you felt like Dixon
And Ray, and Ali


Hit me
Hit me baby
On the camera
Take me in
I'm going down
Hit me baby
You win
Your the very tough with a long past

Your a hammerhead
Sweet thing
Goldwyn drive
Keep it all stuck on here
She's all black or white
Don't tell her where I'm livin'

Hit me
Hit me baby
She got me ruined
She's a bore
She fell apart
Oh, oh, ooh
She's so fabulous
Just like Cher
It was life at the top
You would be I

She's a hammerhead
Sweet thing

She's a hammerhead
I mention her hammerhead
oh, oh, ooh

Hit me
Hit me baby

She's a hammerhead
Sweet thing

Hit me
Hit me baby
Drop my folly into the night
Enter the dragon
oh, oh, ooh

She's so fabulous
Just like Cher
It was life at the top
It would be I

She's a hammerhead
Sweet thing
She's a hammerhead
Mention her hammerhead
