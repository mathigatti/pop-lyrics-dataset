Nothing remains
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes


Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes

Everything has changed

For in truth
It's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed

For in truth
It's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed

(In your fear, seek only peace)
(In your fear, seek only love)
(In your fear, seek only peace)
(In your fear, seek only love)
(In your fear, in your fear)

In your fear
Of what we have become
Take to the fire
Now we must
Burn all that we are
Rise together
Through these clouds
As on wings

This is the trip
And this is the business we take
This is our number
All my trials
Lord, will be remembered

Everything has changed
