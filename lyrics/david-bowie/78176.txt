She had an horror of rooms
She was tired you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes
They were blue, but nobody home
She could've been a killer
If she didn't walk the way she do, and she do
She opened strange doors
That we'd never close again


She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

Scary monsters, and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love
And I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street
And she can't socialize
Well I love the little girl
And I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

Scary monsters, and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

Scary monsters, and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

Oh oh woh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh
