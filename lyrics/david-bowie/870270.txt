Well, the joint was rocking
Chorus
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'til the moon went down


Well it sounded so sweet
I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat
And had to dance
I started moving my feet
And clapping my hands

Yeah, we kept on rocking

Chorus

About twelve o'clock
When the place was packed
The front doors were locked
I said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back

But kept on rocking

Chorus

Yeah

About twelve o'clock
Around lock up time
Well, the doors were locked
Said the place was packed
When  the police knocked
Those doors flew back

But it kept on rocking

Chorus

Yeah, it kept on rocking

Chorus
