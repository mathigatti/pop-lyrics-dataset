Well I, well I left my wife and child
(Louie, go back home)
Yeah, my conscience is about to drive me wild, yeah
(Louie, go back home)
A little voice inside my head goes on and on
(Louie, go back home)
It says "Louie, Louie, Louie
You better come back home"


Well I, well I thought "I make it by myself", yeah
(Louie, go back home)
Oh, but my baby, she's got my heart a-upon the shelve
(Louie, go back home)
Well I, well I can still hear her moaning

They're crying "Louie, Louie, Louie
You better go back home"

Oh yeah, you better go back home
