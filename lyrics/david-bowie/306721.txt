I saw him by the dj
The way he danced was cool
They said I stood no chance
They called me little fool
Well here I am before you
And all your friends can see
You roasting like a turkey
It's just this flame in me


And no one can burn like me

I am a laser 
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

I dreamed how much I'd lay on you
Sitting by your side
Driving in my Dusenburgh
Going for a ride
I'm going to turn my beam on
If only for an hour
You know I switch the heat on
When you feel my golden shower

And no one can burn like me

I am a laser 
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

I know what the boys call me
They think I'm Black Barbarella
But only one beam do I have
And that's this heartbeat of mine

I am a laser 
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong
