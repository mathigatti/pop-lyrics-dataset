The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
You threw me the pieces
I started the fire
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away hey-hey

Look out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No miracle jive - no conversation

Then nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
On thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away

One thing nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
On thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away

The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away

Look out on a dream world
Windows and wifes
No bedroom to run too
No woman that I 
no conversation

Hot love is the dearest
No money can buy
She burnt like a spitfire
One shot put her away

One shot put her away hey hey

One shot put her away 

Ah ha ha

Ah ha haaaa
