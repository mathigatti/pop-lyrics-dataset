Telling lies

Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time
Me I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress


Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies (oh ah visionary oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like something's gonna happen this year)
Telling lies (oh ah visionary oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like something's gonna happen this year)

Telling lies

Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You'll come to me with tears and blame
I'm your future
I am tomorrow
I am the end

Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies (oh ah visionary oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like something's gonna happen this year)
Telling lies (oh ah visionary oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like something's gonna happen this year)

Telling lies
Telling lies

Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh
Feels like something's gonna happen this year

Oh ah telling lies
Feels like something's gonna happen this year
Oh ah telling lies
Feels like something's gonna happen this year
Oh ah telling lies
Oh ah
Oh ah telling lies
Feels like something's gonna happen this year
