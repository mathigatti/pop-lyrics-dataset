Then we saw Mishima’s dog
Trapped between the rocks
Blocking the waterfall
The songs of dust
The world would end
The night was always falling
The peacock in the snow


And I tell myself
I don’t know who I am
And I tell myself
I don’t know who I am

My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

I can only love you
By hating him more
That’s not the truth
It’s too big a word
He believed
That love is theft
Love and whores
The theft of love

And I tell myself
I don’t know who I am
And I tell myself
I don’t know who I am

My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

But I am a seer
I am a liar
I am a seer
But I am a liar

My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
