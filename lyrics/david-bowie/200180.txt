Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't talk of last years capers
Give me steel, give me steel
Give me pulsars unreal


He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin
Then we can really begin

Please saviour, saviour show us
Hear me, I'm graphically yours

Someone to claim us
Someone to follow
Someone to shame us
Some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us
Someone like you
We want you Big Brother
Big Brother

I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone
And you've been everywhere
Lord I think you'd overdose
If you knew what's going down

Someone to claim us
Someone to follow
Someone to shame us
Some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us
Someone like you
We want you Big Brother
Big Brother
