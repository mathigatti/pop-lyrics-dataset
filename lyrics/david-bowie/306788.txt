With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
You acted funny trying to spend my money
You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow
Sorrow


You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ahhhh, oo, oooo

I tried to find her
'Cause I can't resist her (I tried to find her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, ho-ho

With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair

Hu hu hu 
Hu hu hu yeah
Hu hu hu 
Hu hu hu yeah
Hu hu hu
