Columbine my frail design
I see you see me standing on my own
Is it you that I'm walking through
Should I retrace my point of view
I'm left in clouded dreams of finding who
Not Columbine
Just incase you're my disguise
I found yourself to my surprise
I'm on the ground
And it's Harlequin who fix me up
Who catches you
Who wanishes me
From finding who
