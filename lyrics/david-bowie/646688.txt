Test, testing, testing
This, hmmm, Grace is my name 
And and I was...um...
It was that phot... a fading photograph of 
A patch, a patchwork quilt. 
And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs 
So I'm thinking very, too, bit too fast like a brain patch
And ah they won't let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop...popular musics 
And aftershocks. (Ahhh-choo)
See I've been watching a television of um... in the homelands
That's the new homelands and um that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid
