As soon as you're born, they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big, you feel nothing at all


A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy, you can't follow their rules

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

When they've tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years
Ah, then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

Dope, wit, religion, and sex, and T.V.
And you think you're so clever, and classless, and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

There's room at the top, they are telling you still
But first you must smile as you learn how to kill
But if you want to be like the folks on the hill

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me
If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me

Just follow me
