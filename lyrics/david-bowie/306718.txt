I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train going to be right by her side
Ooh oh ah Kitty just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no


I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back

I tried to phone her but the cable was broke by a storm
Now I won't see her till tomorrow when night meets the dawn
Ooh oh ah Kitty just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back

I'll buy her anything
A big fat car a diamond ring
If she will be my girl
I want her back I need you girl

I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train going to be right by her side
Ooh oh ah Kitty just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
