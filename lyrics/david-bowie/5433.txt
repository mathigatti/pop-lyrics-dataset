You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey, babe, your hair's alright
Hey, babe, let's go out tonight


You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

Rebel, rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel, rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel, rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so

Don't 'ya?
Don't 'ya?

You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey, babe, your hair's alright
Hey, babe, let's stay out tonight

You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

Rebel, rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel, rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel, rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so

Don't 'ya?

Rebel, rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel, rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel, rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so

Don't 'ya?

You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes

And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess

(Rebel. rebel)

So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?

(Rebel, rebel)

So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi, cha, chi, cha

(Rebel, rebel)

Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress

(Rebel, rebel)

And your face is a mess
Oh, your face is a mess

(Rebel, rebel)

Oh, oh, so how could they know?
Ah, ah, how could they know?

(Rebel, rebel)
