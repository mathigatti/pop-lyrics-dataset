Hallo spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette, so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Don't you want to be free
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you, cover you
This chaos is killing me


Bye, bye, love
Bye, bye, love
Bye, bye, love
Bye, bye, love

This chaos is killing me

This chaos is killing me

Bye, bye, love
Bye, bye, love

Good time love
Sweet sweet love
