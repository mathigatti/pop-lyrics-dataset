I was walking through the counters
Of a national concern
And a cash machine was
Spitting by my shoulder


And I saw the multitude of faces
Honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged
And money roared
And a woman hot with worry
Slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear
In case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes
To keep her conscience blind

Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

Then she moved toward the exit
Clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her
As the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears
The cash machines were
Shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly
For her name
And a crowd of honest people
Rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling
Wooden floor

Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely god won't look the other way

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely god won't look the other way
