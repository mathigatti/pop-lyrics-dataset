Well, I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
You know I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
She'll break your heart one day
Then she'll laugh if she walks away
Yeah, I pity the fool


Well, look at the people
Guess you wonder what to do
They're just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me

Ah, look at the people
Bet you wonder what to do
Well, they're just standing watching you making a fool out of me

Yeah, I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
Ooh, I pity the fool
Well, I said I pity the fool
She'll break your heart one day
Then she'll laugh as you walk away
Well, I pity the fool

Well, look at the people
Guess you wonder what to do
They're just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me

Yeah, look at the people
Bet you wonder what to do
They're just standing
Watching you making a fool out of me

I pity the fool
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Oh, I pity the fool
