I know something is very wrong
The pulse returns for prodigal sons
With blackout hearts with flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes


I can't give everything
I can't give everything

Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent

I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away

I know something is very wrong
The pulse returns for prodigal sons
The blackout hearts with flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away

I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away
