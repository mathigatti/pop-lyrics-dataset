Trapped in the prison, in the prison of life
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in the love, the moon on the stage
In the reflektor age
Entre la nuit, la nuit heureux?
De vivres et de morts
If this is heaven, I don't know what is for
If I can't find you there, I don't care


I'll find, I'll find a way to enter
It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor
I'll find, I'll find the connector
It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor

The signals we send are deflected again
We're so connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was 19 and
Now we're starin' at the screen
Entre la nuit, la nuit heureux?
De vivres et de morts
If this is heaven, I need something more
Just a place to be alone, to be my home

I'll find, I'll find a way to enter
It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor
I'll find, I'll find the connector
It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor

It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor
It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor
It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor

Just a reflektor
Just a reflektor
Just a reflektor
Just a reflektor
Just a reflection of a reflection
Just a reflection of a reflection

See you on the other side
We all got things to hide
Just a reflection of a reflection of a reflection
See you on the other side
We all got things to hide

Our song it skips, a little evidence
Our love is plastic, no breaking to?
I want to break free, but will it break it
Don't, don't, don't, don't mess around

I'll find, I'll find a way to enter
It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor
I'll find, I'll find the connector
It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor

It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor
It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor
It's just a reflektor, just a reflektor

Thought you were bringing the ressurector
Turns out it's just a reflektor, just a reflektor
Thought you were bringing the ressurector
Turns out it's just a reflektor, just a reflektor
Thought you were bringing the ressurector
Turns out it's just a reflektor, just a reflektor

Just a reflektor
Just a reflektor
Just a reflektor
Just a reflektor
See you on the other side
Just a reflektor
See you on the other side
We all got things to hide
Just a reflektor
See you on the other side
