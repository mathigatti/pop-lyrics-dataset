See the great white scar
Over Battery Park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar
Oh, my nuclear baby
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
Let's face the music and dance


Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never say I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm betterthan you

All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go

See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the Bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in colour
First a horseback bomber
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on Dateline
Let's face the music and dance
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm betterthan you

All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
Oooh oo
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
