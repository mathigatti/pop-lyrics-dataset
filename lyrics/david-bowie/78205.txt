It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May-Day
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind
And only you
Rocket on thru the sky
It couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry


When the days were the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the biggy guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hangin' on the enemy
And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream
And only you
Race on to wonder where
It couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy

Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murders on the heels of love
Just the ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret
Baby these were the sounds
Baby these were the sounds
And only you
Whisper these things aren't true
It couldn't be done with dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
