La la la la la la, la la la la la la la

A winter's day
A bitter snowflake on my face
My summer girl
Takes little backward steps away


Jack Frost took her hand and left me
Jack Frost ain't so cool

Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold

And when she smiles
The ice forgets to melt away
Not like before
Her smile was warming yesterday
See the trees like silver candy
Feel my icy hand

Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold

See my eyes, my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's a memory of the summer day

Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold

La la la la la la
