5:15
I'm changing trains
This little town
Let me down
This foreign rain
Brings me down


5:15
Train overdue
Angels have gone
No ticket
I'm jumping tracks
I'm changing towns

We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore only you

5:15
All of my life
Angels have gone
I'm changing trains
Angels like them
Thin on the ground

All of my life
All legs and wings
Shrinks in the ice

5:15
Train overdue
Angels have gone

We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore only you

Cold station, oh, all of my life
Forever, I will adore you forever
