There is a happy land where only children live
They don't have the time
To learn the ways of you sir, Mr. Grownup
There's a special place
In the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
It's a secret place and
Adults aren't allowed there Mr. Grownup
Go away sir


Charlie Brown got's half a crown
He's gonna buy a kite
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox
And Tommy's learned to ride his bike
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns
He's so small we don't notice him
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us

Mother calls, but we don't hear
There's lots more things to do
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet
But we will be, very shortly

Sissy Steven plays with girls
Someone made him cry
Tony climbed a tree and fell
Trying hard to touch the sky
Tommy lit a fire one day
Nearly burned the field away
Tommy's mum found out
But he put the blame on me and Ray

There is a happy land where only children live
You've had your chance
And now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup
Go away sir
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup
