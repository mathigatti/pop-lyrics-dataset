Burning up each others' love, burning up our lives
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight
Future full and empty knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama
Miracle no more


(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)

Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high
Spins around my little room, miracle goodnight
Even flower all alone, pazanane capeche
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more

(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future, anywhere

I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight

(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal
I really don't want to know that
The less we know, the better we feel

Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high
Spinning around my little room, miracle

(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Moon tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
(Eyes tell me)
(News tell me) nobody dancing
(Nobody dancing) miracle
(Skin tell me) tonight
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) nobody dancing
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
