You remind me of the babe
(What babe?)
The babe with the power
(What power?)
The Power of voodoo
(Who do?)
You do
(Do what?)
Remind me of the babe


I saw my baby, crying hard as babes could cry
What could I do?
My baby's love had gone
And left my baby blue
Nobody knew!

What kind of magic spell 'd'you use?
Slime and snails
Or puppy dog tails?
Thunder or lightning
Then baby said
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Put that baby's spell on me
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby, make him free!

I saw my baby, trying hard as babes could try
What could I do?
My baby's fun had gone
And left my baby blue
Nobody knew

Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)

Put that baby's spell on me (ooh)

You remind me of the babe
What babe?
The babe with the power
(What power?)
The power of voodoo
(Who do?)
You do
(Do what?)
Remind me of the babe

Dance magic, dance, ooh ooh ooh
Dance magic, dance magic, ooh ooh ooh
Dance magic

What kind of magic spell 'd'you use?
Slime and snails
Or puppy dog tails
Thunder or lightning
Something frightening

Dance magic, dance
Dance magic, dance
Put that baby's spell on me
Jump magic, jump
Jump magic, jump
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby make him free
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
Jump magic, jump
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby
