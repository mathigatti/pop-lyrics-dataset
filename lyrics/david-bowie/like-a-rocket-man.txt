Little Wendy Cocaine
Stumbles up the hill to pain
Nothing stops the go-to girl
Nothing takes the place of taking aim


Little Wendy’s out there
Shaking hips and cuckoo eyes
Crazy drives that dizzy crowd
Moonlight strokes the highlights in her hair

She sells and moves and finds my hand
And pulls me down and close
So I can hardly stand
As I lay like dead for her
I’m fed into my head
I’m led, oh, I am Sam

I’m crawling from the window
Crawling down the wall
I'm happy screaming, yes, I am
I’m jumping on her daisy chain
I’m speeding through the dancehall
Like a rocket man

Now I wish today
That yesterday was just tomorrow
And I could squeeze her grabby hand
Knowing that I never paid her for a gram
She’s a drunken doxy off her trolly
Sent before her time into this poxy world

She’s not fit for anything but dealing it
While heaven sings, I have this girl

She's got me eating rice and beans
I have no shape, no color
I’m God’s lonely man

I don’t want to die
But I don’t want to live
I'm speeding like a rocket man

Like a rocket man
Like a rocket man
Like a rocket man
