She lit a cigarette
Both hands behind her back
Thought she was hungry
Lack of choice saw to that


Only you can try to see
What I'm really like
She said, only you can understand
The way I feel tonight

She blamed excesses
On the american dream
So seldom witnessed
Never seen

Imagination could make a man of you
Imagination could make me love you too
Imagination is all I want from you

She lost her virtue
Before she could write
I lost mine too
On my very first night with you

You'll have to guide me
These impossible schemes
You make me steal
Unstealable things

She blamed excesses
On the american dream
So seldom witnessed
Never seen

Imagination could make a man of you
Imagination could make me love you too
Imagination is all I want from you

And she blamed excesses
On the american dream
So seldom witnessed
Never seen

Imagination could make a man of you
Imagination could make me love you too
Imagination is all I want from you

Imagination, imagination
Imagination, imagination

Imagination, imagination
Imagination, imagination
Imagination, imagination
Imagination, imagination
