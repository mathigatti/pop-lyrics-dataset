Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson 
Heart's filthy lesson


There's always the diamond friendly
Sitting in the Laugh Hotel
The heart's filthy lesson
With her hundred miles to hell

Oh, Ramona, if there was only something between us
If there was only something between us
Other than our clothes
Something in our skies
Something in our skies
Something in our blood
Something in our skies

Paddy
Paddy, who's been wearing Miranda's clothes?

It's the heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
It's the heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Falls upon dead years

Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
And these cerulean skies

Something in our skies
Something in our skies
Something in our blood
Something in our skies

Paddy, Paddy?
Paddy will you carry me, I think I've lost my way
I'm already five years older I'm already in my grave

I'm already
I'm already
I'm already
Will you carry me?
Oh Paddy, I think I've lost my way

Paddy
What a fantastic death abyss
Paddy
What a fantastic death abyss
It's the hearts filthy lesson
Tell the others
It's the hearts filthy lesson
What a fantastic death abyss
Tell the others
It's the hearts filthy lesson
Paddy
What a fantastic death abyss
It's the hearts filthy lesson
