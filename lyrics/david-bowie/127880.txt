Please don't tear this world asunder
Please take back
This fear we're under
I demand a better future


Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you
Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain and all the sorrow

I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you

Give my children sunny smile
Give them moon and cloudless sky
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you

When we talk, we talk to you
When we walk, we walk to you
From factory to field
How many tears must fall
Down there below
Nothing is moving

I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop needing you
I might just stop loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future

I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future

I demand a better future
I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
