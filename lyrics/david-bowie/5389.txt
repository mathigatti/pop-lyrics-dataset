There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes, a kind of pale jewel
Open and closed within your eyes
I'll place the sky within your eyes


There's such a fooled heart
Beating so fast in search of new dreams
A love that will last within your heart
I'll place the moon within your heart

As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill has gone
Wasn't too much fun at all
But I'll be there for you
As the world falls down

Falling
(As the world)
Falling down
Falling in love

I'll paint your mornings of gold
I'll spin your Valentine evenings
Though we're strangers till now
We're choosing the path between the stars
I'll leave my love between the stars

As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill has gone
Wasn't too much fun at all
But I'll be there for you
As the world falls down

Falling
(As the world)
Falling down
Falling

As the world falls down
Falling, falling, falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down

Falling, falling, falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down

Falling, falling, falling

Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense to fall
Falling
As the world falls down

Falling, falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down

Falling in love
Falling in love
