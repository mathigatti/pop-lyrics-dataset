The words I have to say
May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do


Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No-one can offer you more
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen?

You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
