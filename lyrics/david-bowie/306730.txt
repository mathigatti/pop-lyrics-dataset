When comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire


They say

They say
He has no brain
They say
He has no mood
They say
He was born again
They say
look at him climb

They say: Jump
They say: Jump

They say
He has two gods
They say
He has no fear
They say
He has no eyes
They say
He has no mouth

They say hey that's really something
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say 'Jump'

They say: Jump

Watch out
Watch out

They say hey that's really something
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd

They say: Jump

Got to believe somebody
