Better take care
I think I better go, I better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history


Better take care
I breathe so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
He looks me in the eye says
He's got his mind on countdown
3-2-1
Forever

I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living
On till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
And my head hangs low
'Cause it's all over now

And there's never gonna be enough money
And there's never gonna be enough drugs
And I'm never ever gonna get old
There's never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
And I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
And I'm never ever gonna get low
And I'm never ever gonna get old

Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world
Because of you
Again and again
And I'm awake in an age of light living it
Because of you

Better take care
I'm looking at the future solid as a rock
Because of you
Again and again
Wanna be here and I wanna be there
Living just like you, living just like me
Forever

Putting on my gloves
And bury my bones in the marshland
Forever
Think about my soul but I don't need a thing
Just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air

And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never gonna let you die
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get

I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
And I'm never ever gonna get
Never ever gonna get old
