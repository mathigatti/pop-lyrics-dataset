Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust Him at once which is something these days


Lucy can't dance to the noise, but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance to the noise, but she knows what the noise can do

Did the world just explode?
Don't recognize anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb

Lucy can't dance to the noise, but she knows what the noise can do
Oh oh oh
Lucy can't dance to the noise, but she knows what the noise can do

Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy
In this sexual noise, vicious chords offer joy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
But I can't dance
Lucy can't dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

Lucy can't dance

Lucy can't dance

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl?

Lucy can't dance to the noise, but she knows what the noise can do

So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song

Lucy can't dance to the noise, but she knows what the noise can do

Of the show of the fine reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Lucy can't dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Can do
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Lucy can't dance
Lucy can't dance
