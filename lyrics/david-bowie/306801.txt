Do you hear what I hear?
Do you see what I see?
Colin, I want you to use your imagination
You wake up one morning and you ask yourself


Why am I so exciting?
What makes me dramatic?
You're trying to say something about yourself
The dazzling crime of wisdom

You fall for reality
You're bruised and bewildered
Then you learn to fall in love with yourself
That's motivation

You raise yourself high
Presenting your soul
You step from the shadows
You hear the command
An image to dream
You tremble permission
Tomorrow's rewards bloody skies of today
You'll step out of time
Into life's every dream
A life of such powerful meaning

Now you has class
Now you has splash
Now you has mass motivation

Here's an image I can recommend
Here's a product you will die for
Here's a nightmare that will never end
Get you fired upp burning go oh oh

You know you got something
You know you got style
We don't take much just a little bit
That's motivation

Welcome to the world of your dreams, Colin
Where you can be what you want
Commit horrible sins
And get away with it

Lust
Gluttony
Pride
Anger
Sloth
Avarice
And jealousy

You know you got something
You know you got the style
We don't take much, but a little bit
That's motivation

No more false illusion
Goodbye to confusion
Stand out from the madding crowd
Motivation is symphony

Symphony in style (that's motivation)
It's brilliant, original (that's motivation)
Stimulating, encouragement (that's motivation)
As precious from home (that's motivation)
So what (motivation)
Say what (motivation)
New (moti)
So (moti)
