Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy


Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy

Time, in Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time

The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think
Oh God, I'm still alive

We should be on by now
We should be on by now

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

You, are not a victim
You, just scream with boredom
You, are not evicting time

Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind
But love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I have to give was the guilt for dreaming

We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Yeah, time!
