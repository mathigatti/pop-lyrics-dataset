Silver leaves are spinning 'round
Take my hand as we go down
And down and down
Looking for water


And I lost God in a New York minute
Don't know about you
But my heart's not in it
(Looking, looking, looking)
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
(Looking looking looking)

I can't breathe the air
Can't raise the fight
'Cause all we've got left
Is a beat in the night
And I'm
Looking for water
Looking for water
Looking for water
Looking looking

Take my hand as we go down and down
Leave it all behind
Nothing will be found
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking, looking)

I'm looking for water
Looking everywhere
Looking for water
Looking here and there
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking, looking)

I can't live in this cage
I can't eat this candy
To the ends of the earth
To this pain in my head
The look in your eyes
That never means never
The dawns early light
Baby dumb is forever

(Looking, looking)
(Looking, looking)

Looking for water
(Looking, looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking, looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking, looking)

I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking, looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking, looking)
I'm looking for water
