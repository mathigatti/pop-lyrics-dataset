When people call us revolutionary
They're just tryin' to see
All that we choose


When all we want is everybody free
The universe would be one brotherhood

It isn't wrong to be prepared to fight
Together to unite if we believe
In giving everything our heart and soul
Until we reach the goal we should achieve

It shouldn't matter if we're brown or white
Yellow or black as night to anyone
We're all born equal with the self same rights
Sharing the same daylight under the sun

If loving freedom makes me quality
Of opportunity is where revolutionary
Constantly, fervently, firmly
