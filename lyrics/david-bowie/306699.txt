Monday morning feels so bad (Friday's gone)
Everybody seems to nag me
Coming Tuesday I feel better (ter ter ter ter ter ter now)
Even my old man looks good (bah-oo)
Wednesday just don't go (bah-oo)
Thursday goes too slow (bah-oo)
I've got Friday on my mind


(See my baby soon) Gonna have fun in the city (see my love in
June)
(Gee, my baby's good) and be with my girl she's so pretty (all I
want to do)
(I'm not crazy) She looks fine tonight (zoom zoom zoom zoom
zoom zoom zoom) She is out of sight to me (so divine)
(Tonight) I spend my bread
(Tonight) I lose my head
(Tonight) I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind

Do the five day drag once more (Monday blues)
Know of nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar man, thief)
Hey I'll change that scene one day (bah-oo)
Today I might be mad (bah-oo)
Tomorrow I'll be glad (bah-oo)
'Cos I'll have Friday on my mind

(See my baby soon) Gonna have fun in the city (see my love in
June)
(Gee, my baby's good) and be with my girl she's so pretty (all I
want to do)
(I'm not crazy) She looks fine tonight (zoom zoom zoom zoom
zoom zoom zoom) She is out of sight to me (so divine)
(Tonight) I spend my bread
(Tonight) I lose my head
(Tonight) I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind

(See my baby soon) Gonna have fun in the city (real life loving
you)
(Gee, my baby's cool) Be with my girl, she's so pretty (all I
want to do)
(oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh) Gonna have fun, gonna have fun in the city
(zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom)
(oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh) a-be with my girl-a, be with my girl she's so
pretty
(zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom)
(See my baby soon) Gonna have fun, gonna have fun in the city (real life loving you)
(Gee, my baby's cool) a-be with my girl-a, be with my girl she's so pretty (all I want to do)
