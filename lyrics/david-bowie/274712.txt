Wah, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo

He looked a lot like Che Guevara
Drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion
Such a humble man
The only survivor
Of the National People's Gang


Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
I wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

He laughed at accidental sirens
That broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers
Were all that were left alive

Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

Putting on some clothes, I made my way to school
And found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favourite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars
I made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table
A gun and me alone
I ran to the window
Looked for a plane, or two

Panic in Detroit
He left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust"
I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit

Ow
