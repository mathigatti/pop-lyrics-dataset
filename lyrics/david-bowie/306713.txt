Dear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free


I can walk down the street
there's no one there 
the pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
my eyes can't see 
but my mind wants to cry out loud

I can walk down the street
there's no one there
the pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
my eyes can't see
but my mind wants to cry out loud
My mind wants to cry out loud

I feel free

Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
