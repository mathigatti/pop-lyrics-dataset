He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City


There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise?
As I walk down the aisle

And I'm gone gone gone
(Gone gone gone spinning slack through reality)
Now I'm older than movies
(Deadens my brain falling up through the years)
Let me dance away
(Till I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
Now I'm wiser than dreams
(Losing breath from the water when I'm gone gone gone)
Let me fly, fly, fly
(Spinning slack through reality)
While I'm touching tomorrow
(Deadens my brain falling up through the years)
And I know who's there
(Till I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
(Losing breath from the water when I'm gone gone gone)
When silhouettes fall
(Spinning slack through reality)

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through a crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

Three old men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child
On a rain slicked street

And I'm gone gone gone
(Gone gone gone spinning slack through reality)
Now I'm older than movies
(Deadens my brain falling up through the years)
Let me dance away
(Till I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
Now I'm wiser than dreams
(Losing breath from the water when I'm gone gone gone)
Let me fly, fly, fly
(Spinning slack through reality)
While I'm touching tomorrow
(Deadens my brain falling up through the years)
And I know who's there
(Till I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
(Losing breath from the water when I'm gone gone gone)
When silhouettes fall
(Spinning slack through reality)

And I'm gone
(Gone gone gone spinning slack through reality)
(Deadens my brain falling up through the years)
(Till I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
(Losing breath from the water when I'm gone gone gone)
(Deadens my brain falling up through the years)
(Till I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
(Losing breath from the water when I'm gone gone gone)
(Spinning slack through reality)

And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through the crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking

And I'm gone gone gone
(Gone gone gone spinning slack through reality)
(Deadens my brain falling up through the years)
Let me dance away
(Till I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
(Losing breath from the water when I'm gone gone gone)
And I'm gone, gone, gone
(Spinning slack through reality)
(Deadens my brain falling up through the years)
(Till I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
Let me dance, dance, dance
(Losing breath from the water when I'm gone gone gone)
(Spinning slack through reality)

And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, through the crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
