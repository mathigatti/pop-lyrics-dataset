Everybody young and old
Learns how to rock 'n roll
Listen to something new
Everybody sure can do


Footstompin', footstompin', footstompin', footstompin'
(footstompin', footstompin', footstompin')
Footstompin' all of the time

Even just the other day
Taught it to my sister May
Red haired Mr Blue sure can do that stomping too

Footstompin', footstompin', footstompin', footstompin'
(footstompin', footstompin', footstompin')
Footstompin' all of the time

Hey turn

Wish I could shimmy like my sister Kate
Well she can shimmy like a jelly on a plate
All the girls are I can't do it
I can do it yeah ha
Oooh

Everybody in the neighbourhood
Knows I can shimmy, shimmy good
I won't be an angel so I ought to be
East going west, I go the west

Meet me at the dance hall
We're going to have a ball
Show cure all you want
Forlorn
Reborn

Footstompin', footstompin', footstompin', footstompin'
(footstompin', footstompin', footstompin')
Footstompin' all of the time
