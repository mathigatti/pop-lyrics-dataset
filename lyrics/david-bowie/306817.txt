Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds


It's difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a Job
When you know the moneys from day to day

All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days of our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes

Cold winter bleeds on the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time

It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life

All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days of our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes

It's difficult you see
It's difficult you see

All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
