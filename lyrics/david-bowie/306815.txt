These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for love


Dreaming alone and i feel this someone

Someone

Listens to me

Listens to me

Angel for love

These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for love

Heaven is smiling down, heaven's girl in a wedding gown

I never gonna be so good
Just like a good brochure
I'm gonna change my way
Angel for love

Of all the saints alive
Don't I feel like a saint alive
She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high
I smiling

I believe in the magic
Angel for love

In the magic
Angel for love

I believe in magic
Angel for love

In the magic
Angel for love
