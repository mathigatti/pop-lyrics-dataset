Fingertip sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your
eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent
where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor he's clogged and
clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns


Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man

Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face you've seen
before
Karma Man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been I only live now and I don't
know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
