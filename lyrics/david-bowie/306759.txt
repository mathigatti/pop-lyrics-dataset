People from bad homes
Don't have the time
To look things over
Make up their minds


People from good homes
Dn't have the minds
To care for bad homes
Don't have the time

Home is the main line
Can't take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game

Stand on your own line
Stand high above
These people of caution
Trouble to love

Me I got no home
Just main street and wine
No one to hussle no one to jive
Me and my prospects just having a ball
Having the best time but nothing at all

Home is the main line
Can't take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game

Stand on your own line
Stand high above
These people of caution
Trouble to love

Home is the main line
Can't take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game

Stand on your own line
Stand high above
These people of caution
Trouble to love
