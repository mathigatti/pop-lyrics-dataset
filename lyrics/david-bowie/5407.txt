People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace


And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay

And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, his song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise
And he sang all night, all night long

Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name

Oh that was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright and the song went on forever
He was awful nice
Really quite paradise
He sang all night long
