For the priceless man
Who suffers gloom
So slow
Eyes were stolen
For her
A sleeping sky
Takes the moon
So slow
I would slide away


Further out to sea
Further out to sea
So she

She saw me smile
Feeling like I’d never been
She saw me smile
Feeling like I’d never been
In love
Feeling like I’d never been
The only one and all alone

The only one and all alone
