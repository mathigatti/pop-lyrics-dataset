Julie
Oh
And I know


Like a mirror, Sunday morning
When the dark clouds hung above
I saw you kneeling 'neath a garden
I saw the grim and stood above

What kind of meaning in a gun shot
It doesn't matter what they say
I never felt I aimed at no one
And who's gonna take the gun away

Julie 
Pretend for me
That I'm someone in your life

Julie
I'm yours till the end
All the days and memories

I'm not a man of single reason
It's in every single man
This beat of jealous retribution
And every spurned heart makes its plan

Well, I know that you really loved him
And I know that if there's a God above
Through million times we'll remember
How the trail slips away

Julie
Pretend for me
Even only for a while

Julie
My soul is on the line
All the days and memories

Julie
Remember me
All the days of your life

Julie
I'm lost over you
Passion always ends this way
End this way
