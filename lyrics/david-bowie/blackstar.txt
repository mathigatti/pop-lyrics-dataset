In the villa of Ormen
In the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle
In the centre of it all
In the centre of it all
Your eyes


On the day of execution
On the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile
At the centre of it all
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
Your eyes

In the villa of Ormen
In the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle
In the centre of it all
In the centre of it all
Your eyes

Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place
And bravely cried

(I’m a blackstar)
(I’m a blackstar)

How many times does an angel fall?
How many people lie instead of talking tall?
He trod on sacred ground
He cried loud into the crowd

(I’m a blackstar)
(I’m a blackstar)
(I’m not a gangster)

I can’t answer why
(I’m a blackstar)
Just go with me
(I’m not a filmstar)
I’m-a take you home
(I’m a blackstar)
Take your passport and shoes
(I’m not a popstar)
And your sedatives, boo
(I’m a blackstar)
You’re a flash in the pan
(I’m not a marvel star)
I’m the great, I am
(I’m a blackstar)

I’m a blackstar, way up, on money, I’ve got game
I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams
Diamonds in my eyes

(I’m a blackstar)
(I’m a blackstar)

Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place
And bravely cried

(I’m a blackstar)
(I’m a star's star)
(I’m a blackstar)

I can’t answer why
(I’m not a gangster)
But I can tell you how
(I’m not a film star)
We were born upside-down
(I’m a star's star)
Born the wrong way ‘round
(I’m not a white star)
(I’m a blackstar)
(I’m not a gangster)
(I’m a blackstar)
(I’m a blackstar)
(I’m not a pornstar)
(I’m not a wandering star)
(I’m a blackstar)
(I’m a blackstar)

In the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle
At the centre of it all
Your eyes

On the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
Your eyes
