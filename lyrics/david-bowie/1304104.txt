Arnold Layne 
Had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine


On the wall hung 
A tall mirror
Distorted view 
See through baby blue
He dug it
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same 
Takes two to know
Two to know 
Two to know 
Two to know
Why can't you see?

Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne

Now he's caught 
A nasty sort 
Of person
They gave him time
Doors bang 
Chain gang 
He hates it

Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same 
Takes do it now
Do it now 
Do it now 
Do it now 
Why can't you see?

Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Don't do it again
