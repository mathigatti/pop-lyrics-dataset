Are you okay? You've been shot in the head
"And I'm holding your brains," the old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky, see nothing at all


The stars look so special and the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting beyond the yoga-zone
Turn to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly, it's nothing at all

I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes

I praise to you

I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes

I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes

Nothing ever goes

Nothing
