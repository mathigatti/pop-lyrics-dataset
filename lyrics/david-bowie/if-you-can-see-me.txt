If you can see me, I can see you

I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife
And meet me across the river


Just shoots and ladders and this is the kiss
American anna fantasticalsation
From nowhere to nothing
And I go way back

Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the lights the beacons above the hill
The stars to the West, the South, the North
And to the East

Now you could say I've got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
A love of violence a dread of sighs
If you can see me, I can see you
If you can see me, I can see you

I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God
Swear to destroy the beasts stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife
And meet me across the river

I will take your lands
And all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers
Prison of dark of ashes
I will slaughter your kind
Who descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed a lord of theft
I'll burn all your books
And the problems they make
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me
