In mornings shes so regal that the valley sighs
In the chilly sea that killed her real slows
Now were swimming luck by the river doll by our sides
Fill the cup with these sleepy souls


Semicargo
Its clear that some things never take
Semicargo
Please, heal these tears
Semicargo

She will feel like at tea, make me laugh all along
With such feats like sex only brought upon
Oh lady, oh baby, maybe Ill live my lies alone
Jesus, up here, hear me, i, up up up up oh ah

Semicargo
Its clear that some things never
Semicargo
Please, heal these tears
Semicargo

Semicargo
Semicargo
Semicargo
Semicargo

We steal these tears
Semicargo
Its clear that some things never take
Semicargo
Its clear that somethings never
Semicargo
Please heal these tears
Ah how
Semicargo
Ah how
Some things never
Semicargo
Ah how
Never never
