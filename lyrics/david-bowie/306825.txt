White boys falling on the fires of night
(I wish you'd tell)
(I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revelation comes in the strangest way
(I wish you'd tell)
(I wish you'd tell)


I'd rather be inside you

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you

You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect

Mama can I kiss you daddy can I tell
(we wish you well)
Innocence passed me by
Wanna be screwing when the nightmare comes
(I wish you well)
Wanna come quick and die

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you

You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect

All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
(shoes, shoes, little white shoes)
Where have all the flowers gone
All the little fragile champion boys
(toys, toys, little black toys)
Dripping on the end of a gun 

Even if you disagree

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you

You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect

You show respect

Shoe shoe little white shoe
Wish you well
Wish you well

Even if you disagree
Even if you disagree

Toy toy little black toy
Wish you well
Wish you well

Even if you disagree

Shoe shoe little white shoe
Wish you well
