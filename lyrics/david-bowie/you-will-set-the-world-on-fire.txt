Midnight in the Village
Seeger lights the candles
From Bitter End to Gaslight
Baez leaves the stage
Ochs takes notes
When the black girl and guitar
Burn together hot in rage
You’ve got what it takes


You say too much

You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene, babe
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire

Kennedy would kill
For the lines that you’ve written
Van Ronk says to Bobby
She’s the next real thing
Crouched in the half light
Screaming like a banshee
You’re in the boat, babe
We’re in the water

You say too much

You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene, babe
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire
