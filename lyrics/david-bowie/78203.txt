Eddie boy lit like paraffin
Spending two weeks in a crack house
Burns on his brain like Chernobyl


Dean was seen with a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone for pray for till I met you

Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune
I can make you happy every day of your life
Making my love like a shining star
Takin' my love just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul
Like ice 'cos love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice
I've touched down with vermin
Cowardice, lice and I say

Nobody cares what you do
Please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune

But you'll never find a
Bet you'll never find a better man
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far

Peter met Frank formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky
Sinn-Fein, Hitler cashdown

No hope heroes
Cover the page with debts in hell
And fingers in blood

Poor little bodies all covered
In scabs threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave

Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune
Well, I could make you happy
Every goddamn single day of your life

Making my love like a shining star
Like a shining star
Baby, that's what you are
Like a shining star

Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love, just a touch too far
