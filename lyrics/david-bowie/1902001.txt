Your turn to drive
Thick as a line, out of your mind.
(You need the time)
You're sweet and you're tired, watching the line.
(Watching the line)
You're making my songs, you're making my heart.
(Your turn to drive)
It's all in the songs, it's all in your mind
(Your turn to drive)
Drive (turn tonight)
So (turn tonight)
You gotta (turn to...)
(You gotta turn tonight)
(Turn tonight)
(Turn tonight)


(Your turn to drive)
You're making my songs, you're making my heart.
(Your turn to drive)
Thick as a line, out of your mind.
(Your turn to drive)
Drive (turn tonight)
So (turn tonight)
You gotta (turn to...)
(You gotta turn tonight)
(Turn tonight)
(Turn tonight)
