Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley
Ride on for mile after miley


I'm the bravest driver, sit by my side
I'll drive you so wild if you sit by my side
See how far we travel, take ov' the wheel,
She'll drive us to hell if you take ov' the wheel
Whoa oh oh whoa, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Toot beep-beep, beep-beep
Toot beep-beep, beep-beep

Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley
Ride on for mile after miley

Like to take a ride, that Riley of mine
She's shakey on her legs that Riley of mine
I'm the bravest driver, sit by my side
I'll drive you so wild if you sit by my side
Whoa oh oh whoa, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Toot beep-beep, beep-beep
Toot beep-beep, beep-beep
Toot beep-beep, beep-beep
Toot beep-beep, beep-beep
Toot beep-beep, beep-beep
Toot beep-beep, beep-beep

Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley
Ride on for mile after miley
Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley
Ride on for mile after miley
Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley
Ride on for mile after miley
