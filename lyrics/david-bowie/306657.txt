And I say to myself
I've got it wrong, wrong, wrong
She is a play-girl
She the wrong wrong girl for me
And I say to myself
You're a fool, fool, fool
She doesn't love you
She doesn't need you, this I know


She's got a trail of men that she takes
Wherever she goes
She hasn't the strength to love
Any single man for a length of time

(And I say to myself)
Ooh, I don't stand a chance
(And I say to myself)
It's a long long romance
(And I say to myself)
Well, she's out to slay
(And I say to myself)
Well, she's got it made
(And I say to myself)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
(And I say to myself)
Oh yeah

And I say to myself that she
Shouldn't love anybody else
In the world but me
And I say to myself
Forget her now, now, now
She don't want you
She don't love you anymore
And I say to myself you're a fool, fool, fool
She's don't love you
She don't need you, this I know

And I turn around and look at myself
You'll never get her, you're a fool
Say after me I'm a fool- I'm a fool

(And I say to myself)
I can't get what I want
(And I say to myself)
And it makes me sad
(And I say to myself)
I can't get what I want
(And I say to myself)
And it makes me mad
(And I say to myself)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
(And I say to myself)
Oh yeah

And I say to myself that she
Shouldn't love anybody else
In the world but me
Yeah, yeah

(And I say to myself)
Oh, I feel so sad
(And I say to myself)
She's making me mad
(And I say to myself)
And I say to myself
(And I say to myself)
That I love her
(And I say to myself)
And I say to myself that I need her
(And I say to myself)
Oh, I need her
And I say to myself I'm a fool
