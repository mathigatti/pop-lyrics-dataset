(As heard on the Deram Antholgy 1997)
Whilst flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl I'd spy
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed
I wish to sing the chicken song
Ching-A-Ling song is fine
I'd give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine


Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, 
Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, 
Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling
Doo dah doo doo dah dah, Doo dah dah dah dah dah dah dah

While stepping through a heaven's eye
Two lover souls we spied
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry
We love to play our love-strong hearts
No better do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na
Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, 
Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, 
Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na
Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, 
Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling
