Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And "The Spiders from Mars"
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band


Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
Came on so loaded man
Well hung and snow white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nass
With God given ass
He took it all too far but
Boy, could he play guitar!

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Ziggy played guitar
