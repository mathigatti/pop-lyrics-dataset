This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me


I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay, that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too

Heartwrecker, heartwrecker, make me delight
Right is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay, that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time

'Cause you can never really tell when somebody
When somebody wants so much to stay
That's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too
