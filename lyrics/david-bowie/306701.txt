Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day


Cause I'm on my way to rest my head
And I've lost the mind that I used to have
And I don't have a dime to spare

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day

So go tell the man that collects the dues
That you saw a guy without any shoes
Who would do the job if he was built that way

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day, no
I can't pass this time of day

Cause I'm on my way to rest my head
And I've lost the mind that I used to have
I don't have a dime to spare

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day

So go tell the man that collects the dues
That you saw a guy without any shoes
Who would do the job if he was built that way

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day, no
I can't pass this time of day
