Oh show me the way to the next whisky bar
oh don't ask why, oh don't ask why
For we must find the next whisky bar
or if we don't find the next whisky bar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you
I tell you
I tell you we must die


Oh moon of Alabama it's time to say good bye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whisky or you know why

Oh moon of Alabama it's time to say good bye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whisky or you know why

Oh show me the way to the next little dollar
oh don't ask why, oh don't ask why
For we must find the next little dollar
or if we don't find the next little dollar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you
I tell you
I tell you we must die

Oh moon of Alabama it's time to say good bye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have little dollar or you know why

Oh moon of Alabama it's time to say good bye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have little dollar or you know why

Oh show me the way to the next little girl
oh don't ask why, oh don't ask why
For we must find the next little girl
or if we don't find the next little girl
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you
I tell you
I tell you we must die

Oh moon of Alabama it's time to say good bye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have little girl or you know why

Oh moon of Alabama it's time to say auf wiedersehen
We've lost our good old mama
And must have little girl or you know why
you know why
