No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection


Life can't be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cause it hurts like hell

But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene
A crystal moon
Ah

It's only forever
Not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground

Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
Heard about a place to stay
I, I'm underground
Nothing ever hurts again
Heard about a place to stay
Daddy, get me out of here
Where nothing ever hurts again
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
I, I'm underground
Sister, sister, please take me down
I, I'm underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here

No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection

Down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene
A crystal moon
Ah

It's only
It's only forever
It's not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground

Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
Heard about a place to stay
Nothing never hurts again
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
I'm, I'm underground
Sister, sister, please take me down
I'm, I'm underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out
Wanna live underground, wanna live underground
Wanna live underground, wanna live underground
Wanna live underground, wanna live underground
Wanna live underground, wanna live underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
I'm, I'm underground
Sister, sister please take me down
I'm, I'm underground
I, I'm underground
I, I'm underground
Daddy, daddy, get me
Daddy, daddy, get me
Wanna live underground
Sister, sister, take me down
