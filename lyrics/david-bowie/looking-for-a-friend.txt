Gather 'round all you people
Watch me while you can
Been trawling too long, I've been losing out strong
For the strength of another man


I've been hasty, wasty standing on the backstep
Waiting for the phone to ring
But this semi-acoustic love affair
Is driving me to the brink

I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
you don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for, looking for a friend

God help all you ladies
May the devil take all you men
You're far too busy having babies
To help yourselves to a friend

You're lazy, crazy hung upon the insane
Waiting for the phone to ring
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible] the wall

I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
you don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for, looking for a friend, looking

I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
you don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for, looking for a friend

I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
you don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for, looking for a friend
