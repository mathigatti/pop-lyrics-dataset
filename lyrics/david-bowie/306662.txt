Now that he has no sense of destination
Now hes running for the love of speed
When the child goes bad it's no cause for celebration
Like Jimmy Dean he don't talk back to me

Failures as fathers, Mothers to chaos
No baby no baby no baby no
Hello humans can you feel me thinking
I asume you're seeing everything i'm thinking
Hello humans nothing starts tomorrow
I'm the baby now
Baby Universe, Baby Universe Baby Universal

A speck of dust has settled in my eyes
It doesen't matter i've seen everything anyway

Failures as fathers, Mothers to chaos
No baby no baby no baby no
Hello humans can you feel me thinking
I asume you're seeing everything i'm thinking
Hello humans nothing starts tomorrow
I'm the baby now
