Psychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy - don't stay away
They're so war-torn and resigned
She can't talk any more
What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?


It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you and it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

He punishes hard - was loving her such a crime
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive

It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you and it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

A million dreams , million scars
A million
A million dreams, a million dreams
A million, a million
A million, a million
