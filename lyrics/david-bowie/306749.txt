New angels of promise (do do do do)
We despair
We are the dead dreams (oh ho ho ho)
We take the blame
Take us to the edge of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the fabulous lovers
I'm a blind man and she's my eyes


Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, its always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, it's always time

New angels of promise
(Do do do do) we despise
(Do do do do) don't fall apart now
(Ah ho ho ho) we are the silent ones
Take us to the edge of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the tabular lovers
We listen to the storm

Suspicious nights
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, its always time
Suspicious minds
You didnt feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, it's always time

New angels of promise, we despair
We are the dead dreams (ah ho ho ho)
We take the blame
Take us to the edge of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the fabulous lovers
I am a blind man and she is my eyes

Suspicious mind
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, it's always time
Supicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, it's always time
Supicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, it's always time
It's always time
It's always time
