You knew just everything
But nothing at all
Now the luminous dark
Feels like pain again
You could feel my breath
You opened my eyes
For I could not see
When I met you


When I met you (your feelings again)
I could not speak (you're drowning in pain)
You opened my mouth (you're walking in mist)
You opened my heart (you're living again)
My spirit rose (she tore you down)
The marks and stains (it was all the same)
Could not exist (you were afraid)
When I met you

Now it's all the same (now it's all the same)
It's all the same (it's all the same)
The Sun is gone (the Sun is gone)
It's all the same (it's all the same)
But when I met you (but when I met you)
When I met you (when I met you)
When I met you (when I met you)
When I met you (when I met you)

When I met you
You were afraid (when I met you)
She stole your heart (when I met you)
You don't understand (when I met you)
You should be ashamed (when I met you)
You should have known (I was the walking dead)
She tore you down (I was kicked in the head)
She tore you down

The edge had become
The centre of my world
The seams of my life
The streams of debris
Neither wounds of a friend
Nor the kiss of a foe
The peck of a blackened eye
An eye for the crowd

When I met you
I could not speak
I met you
Then I met you

My spirit rose (your feelings again)
My kind of truth (you're drowning in pain)
Could not exist (you are afraid)
When I met you

Now it's all the same (now it's all the same)
It's all the same (it's all the same)
The Sun is gone (the Sun is gone)
It's all the same (it's all the same)

But when I met you (but when I met you)
When I met you (when I met you)
When I met you (when I met you)
When I met you (when I met you)

When I met you (you were afraid)
When I met you (she stole your heart)
I was the walking dead (she tore you down)
I was kicked in the head (she tore you down)

It was such a time (when I met you)
It was such a time (when I met you)
I was crushed inside (when I met you)
I was torn inside

When I met you (when I met you)
When I met you (when I met you)
I was too insane (I was too insane)
Could not trust a thing (could not trust a thing)

I was off my head (I was off my head)
I was filled with truth (I was filled with truth)
It was not God's truth (it was not God's truth)
Before I met you (before I met you)
