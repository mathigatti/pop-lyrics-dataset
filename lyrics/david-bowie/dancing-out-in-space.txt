Cutting through the water
Hands upon the ghost
To the city of solid iron
To the kingdom of the ghost
Send your friend away now
Let him sail back home tonight


Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space

No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space

Silent as Georges Rodenbach
Mist and silhouette
Girl, you move like water
You’ve got stars upon your head
You’ve got my name and number
You've got to take the floor

Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space

No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space

Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
