Time is tight love always, get's in the way
I'm sorry
Didn't mean to hurt you but i always do
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm sorry you know I am


Well my eyes are pinned and the money's spent
Well I'm sorry
You know I'm sorry
I wouldent do for me what i would for you
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry

I guess I've thrown it away
I thrown it away
Didn't mean to do it that way
Sorry
Time is so tight and i mean it if i say
I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
