Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me


All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you

Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go I see your name
I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go it's just the same

And I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes I'm glad I've got nobody

Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
And I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me

All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you

Well I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go I see your name
Well I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go it's just the same

And I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
