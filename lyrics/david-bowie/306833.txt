(Hey, it ain't over)
Me, I hope that I'm crazy
I feel you driving and rolling the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Ohh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired
Somebody lied, but I say it's hip
To be alive


Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(that's all ya gotta do)
(ooh, it ain't over)

Me, I'm fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires

Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(that's all ya gotta do)
(ohh, it ain't over)

Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(thats all ya gotta do, ohh)
All you've got to do is win 
(it ain't over)
When your smile is spreading thin
(seek and believe in you)
Since you're trying not to lose
(it ain't over, no, no)
Since I'm not supposed to grin
(that's all ya gotta do)
All you've got to do is win
(it ain't over, no,,, ohh)
(seek and believe in you)
All you've got to do is win
(it ain't over, no, no)
Wo-ohh, all you've got
Is all you've got
(it ain't over)
It ain't over...
