My name is Mr. Touchshriek 
Of Touchshriek with mail over and fantasy 
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and empty females 


I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop 
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg 
A reject from the world wide Internet 

He's a broken man 
I'm also a broken man 

It would be nice to have company 
We could have great conversations 
Looking through windows for demons 
And watching the young advance in all electric 

Some of the houses around here still have inhabitants in them 
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not 
I don't get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing 
If I had another broken name 
Oh, I dream of something like that
