Today, today is the 1st of May
Everything around us
Everything a lie
Your heart’s beating fast
As we race through the dark
Past the really good people
Who do what they’re told


What will be my name in the USA?
Hold my hand and I’ll take you there
Who will I become in the USA?
Hold my hand and I’ll take you there

Sophie and Lev are running away
These are the days
The days of gloom
Lev can’t smile and Sophie can’t sing
A mile to the future
Where tomorrow is king

What will be my name in the USA?
Hold my hand and I’ll take you there
Who will I become in the USA?
Hold my hand and I’ll take you there

I don’t need to know
Know where you are
Only that you are
Safe in this world
Then I’ll be content
To get on with my life
Eat, drink and sleep
Look up at the stars

What will be my name in the USA?
Hold my hand and I’ll take you there
Who will I become in the USA?
Hold my hand and I’ll take you there

What will be my name in the USA?
Hold my hand and I’ll take you there
Who will I become in the USA?
Hold my hand and I’ll take you there
