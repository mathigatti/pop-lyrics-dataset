Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong?
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design


He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time

He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me

She's quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure, not a she
When lovers chose each other, now the perks are due
Another memo to screw

She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me

Can you wipe your nose, my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph?
Can you sleep alone at night
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbor jim?
He's come to turn you in

Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, didn't hear it from me
