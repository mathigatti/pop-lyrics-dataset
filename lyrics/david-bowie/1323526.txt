Come, they told me
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
A newborn king to see
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
To lay before the king
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, a pum pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
So to honor him
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
When we come


Little baby
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
I am a poor boy, too
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
I have no gift to bring
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
That's fit
To give a king
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Shall I play for you
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
On my drum

Yoi da adash
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
The ass
And lamb kept time
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
I played my drum for him
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
I played my best for him
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Then he smiled at me
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Me and my drum
