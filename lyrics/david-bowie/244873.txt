Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released, but your custody calls
And I wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you


So bye bye love
Yeah, bye bye love
Hallo spaceboy
This chaos is killing me
Hallo spaceboy
(Spaceboy, spaceboy, spaceboy
Hallo)
(Moondust will cover me)
Ground to Major, bye bye Tom
This chaos is killing me
Dead the circuit, countdown's wrong
This chaos is killing me
So sleepy now
Do you wanna be free?
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
So bye bye love
Yeah, bye bye love
Hallo spaceboy
(Spaceboy, spaceboy, spaceboy, hallo)
Hallo spaceboy
You're sleepy now
This chaos is killing me
This chaos is killing me
So
Bye bye love
Yeah
Bye bye love
Do you wanna be free?
Yes, I wanna be free
Hallo spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
So bye bye love
Yeah, bye bye love
Hallo spaceboy
