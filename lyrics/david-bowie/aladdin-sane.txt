Watching him dash away, swinging an old bouquet - dead roses
Sake and strange divine Uh-hu-hu-uh-hu-hu you'll make it
Passionate bright young things, takes him away to war - don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
Uh-hu-hu-uh-hu-hu - you'll make it


Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who'll love Aladdin Sane

Motor sensational, Paris or maybe hell - (I'm waiting)
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane - you'll make it

Oooh Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Oooh Who'll love Aladdin Sane

We'll love Aladdin Sane
Love Aladdin Sane

Oooh Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Oooh Who'll love Aladdin Sane

We'll love Aladdin Sane
We'll love Aladdin Sane

Oooh Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Oooh Who'll love Aladdin Sane

We'll love Aladdin Sane
Who'll love Aladdin Sane
