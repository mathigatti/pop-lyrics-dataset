Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well you ain't so big, you just tall, that's all


Got me workin', boss man
Workin round the clock
I wanna a little drink a water
But you won't let me stop

Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well you ain't so big, you just tall that's all.
