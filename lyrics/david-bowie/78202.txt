Up until one century ago there lived
In the Zi Duang province of an eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured it's prey it would drape the skeletons over it's web
In weeks creating a macabre
Shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers
Like floors of a building


At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent care
Were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew through this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries

The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically for their mother
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies
Would survive somehow on their own
Oh, the Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like a human's
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries

Don't you hear this wasted cry?
Life is over you
(Mummy, come back 'cause the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in heaven
Is there anyone in hell?
(Mummy, come back 'cause it's dark now)
Take care, take care
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)

Somewhere she glows divine
Somewhere she wakes alone
But you, you've promised
In your loving eye

God, It's dark now!

Gone, gone the water's all gone
Mummy, come back
'Cause the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, the fire can drive you savage and afraid
Spitting off the dawn, come along before the animals awake
Gone, gone the water's all gone
Mummy, come back 'cause it's dark now
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left
If your Mamma don't love you then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy, come back 'cause the water's all gone

Gone, gone the water's all gone
Mummy, come back 'cause the water's all gone
