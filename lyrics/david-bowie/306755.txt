Now. Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow


It happens today
The damage today
They fall on today
They beat on the outside
And I'll stand by you

Now. Not tomorrow
It's happening now
Not tomorrow

It's happening now
The crazed in the hot-zone
The mental and divas hands
The fisting of life
Till The music outside
Till The music outside

It happens outside
The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside

It's happening, now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow

It's happening now
I want you now
I want you today
I need you now

The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside

The music is outside
Outside
Outside Outside
