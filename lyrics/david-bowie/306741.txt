And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter


She gave them life,
She gave them all
They drained her very soul dry...dry

Hey hey hey bitter girl
We're out to sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
It's easy
Don't be so bitter
Oh oh oh crazy girl
You gave too much and you got nothing
Too many problems and not one thing
In return
Left high and dry
Door

And as the sun rise stream
Flickers on
She finds lavender
