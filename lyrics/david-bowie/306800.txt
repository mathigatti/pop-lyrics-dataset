Baby, you can own two hearts
Baby, don't try to tear me apart
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise


Baby, you can't fool around
Baby, can't turn me upside down
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise

It's just a matter of time before you call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
It's just a matter of time, call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone

Baby, you've got me used
Baby, Can't you be like you?
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise
