Baby I dream between the blade and the tongue
Of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall
Skin on skin but there's heaven in


Heaven's in here
Heaven's in her
Among the twilight and star
Like a rocket to mars
Heaven in here

The first and the last are telling it all
Telling you loud but selling it small
I'm taking a swing at this shadow of mine
Crucifix hangs an' my heart's in my mouth
But it's here

Heaven's in here
Heaven's in her
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to mars
Heaven's in here

Feeling it wanting
mm mm m
Heaven in

Heaven lies between your marbled thighs
The rustle of your falling gown
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls
We stumble and twirl there's heaven in here
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall
There's flesh on flesh but there's heaven in
Heaven's in here

Heaven's in here
Heaven's in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to mars
Heaven's in here

You'll dance to my tongue 
We'll dance on the sun
We're the twilight and stars
And there's heaven in here
