I'm just a rock star stabbing away
I'll take the, I'll take the lead
For another day
A modern scholar
Just let me know if I sing too much


When you're head over heels
And the magic is there but
Impossible, impossible, impossible
And when the police
Take me away
Impossible, impossible
It wasn't you
It was Mothers' Day

Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica
Babe

Protect you from the voices
Protect from the visions
Protect you from the silence for another day

These modern people
They sure know how to live
When you're head over heels
And the magic is gone it's
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Then we shall swim in that
Covered up pool

Impossible, impossible
By the white trees dressed
In purple tuelle

Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica
Babe

I hold myself
Like a god
Like a god
Babe

I'm just a pop star chopping away
I'll take the the
I leave the sins for another day
A little puny
Just let me know
If I talk too much

When you're head over heels
And the magic is there but
Impossible, impossible, impossible
Then we should swim in that
Covered up pool
Impossible, impossible
By the white trees dressed
In purple tuelle

Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica
Babe
