This is Andy Warhal and it's take one
Let's go to take one


It's-it's Warhol actually

What did I say?

Hal, it's Hol as in holes
Well, Andy Warhol
Andy Warhol
Like holes

Andy Warhol, take one

Ah, you ready?

Yeah

Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are

Put a peep-hole in my brain
Two new pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wa-ha-ha-hall
Andy Warhol, silver screen
Can't tell them apart at all-ha-ha-ha-hall

Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise

Mmm, mmm, mmm

When he wakes up on the sea
He's sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wa-ha-ha-hall
Andy Warhol, silver screen
Can't tell them apart at all-ha-ha-ha-hall

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wa-ha-ha-hall
Andy Warhol, silver screen
Can't tell them apart at all-ha-ha-ha-hall
