Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to
You won't be the first or last


It must strain you to look down
So far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me
In his house could do for you
I'm the Cream
Of the great utopia dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen

I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm
About twelve times a day

So now, you could spend the morning
Walking with me, quite amazed
As I'm unwashed
And Somewhat Slightly Dazed

I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my head's full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now, you could spend the morning
Talking with me, quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad
And somewhat slightly dazed

Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching

So now, you should spend
The mornings lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange
Unwashed and happily slightly dazed
