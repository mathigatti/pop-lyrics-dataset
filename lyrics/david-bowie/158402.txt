(Yassassin) I'm not a moody guy
(Yassassin) I walk without a sound
(Yassassin) Just a working man, no judge of men
(Yassassin) But such a life I've never known


We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

(Yassassin) I'm not a moody guy
(Yassassin) I walk without a sound
(Yassassin) Just a working man, no judge of men
(Yassassin) But such a life I've never known

(Look at this) No second glances
(Look at this) No value of love
(Look at this) Just sun and steel
(Look at this) Then look at us

If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause I've got a love
And she's afeared
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

(Yassassin) I'm not a moody guy
(Yassassin) I walk without a sound
(Yassassin) Just a working man, no judge of men
(Yassassin) But such a life I've never known

Yassassin, Yassassin, Yassassin
