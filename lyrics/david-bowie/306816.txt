Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot


Happy little feet that dance all day
Lonely little heart with lots to say
Stepping footprints on your mind
Offering thoughts of Columbine

Bang the drum and blow the bugle call
Pierrot takes the stage to play for all
For here's a life his fortune rules
Forsaken by his Columbine

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot

To tap his feet to greet dear Harlequin
The hearts of folks so keenly hard to win
A patchwork frame of tears and wine
The nectar for cruel Columbine

The part of three and leaves the stage forlorn
Puppets cold, their faces sad and drawn
Relive each trial of rise and fall
The love which lacks between us all

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
