Way back in time
Someone said try some
I tried some
Now buy some, I bought some
Oh oh oh
After a while
When I had tried them, denied them
I opened my eyes and I saw you


Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
'Till I called on your love
And your love came to me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

Through my life
I've seen grey sky, met big fry
Seen them die to get high
Ohhh
And when it seemed that
I would only be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you

Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
'Till I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

Won't you try some
Baby, won't you buy some
Won't you try some
Baby, won't you buy some
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
