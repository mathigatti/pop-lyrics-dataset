Hope little girl
Come blow me away
I don't care much
I win anyway
Just a dog


I'm God damn rich
An exploding man
When I talk in the night
There's oil on my hands
What a dog

Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon

Devil in a market place
Devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog

There's always a moron
Someone to hate
A corporate tie
A wig and a date
Just a dog

These blackest of years
That have no sound
No shape, no depth
No underground
What a dog

Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon

A devil in a market place
A devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
