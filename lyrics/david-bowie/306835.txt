Hoo
Beauty shrieks "Beast in booties"
Coming home so lay the table
Look at you calling shots
Call you over under out


I was under, backwards, forwards
Holding hands in the dark
Kissing some, kissing cousins
Kissing this in cover
Kissing cousins, kissing that

Over under out
Over under out

You can't talk
You can't see me drowning
You can't talk
I don't see you swimming
You can't talk
You want go your way
You can't talk
I know you don't love me

Look at this heart's a poppin'
Guess it's over
Crazy action mine's a breakin'
Guess it's over

(Here we go)

You can't talk
You can't see me drowning
You can't talk
I don't see you swimming
You can't talk
You want go your way
You can't talk
I know you don't love me

Ha ha ha ah

Ah here we go 

Beauty shrieks 'Beast in booties'
Coming home so lay the table
Ah look at you calling shots
Call you over under out

You can't talk
You can't see me drowning
You can't talk
I don't see you swimming
You can't talk
You want go your way
You can't talk
I know you don't love me

You can't talk
You can't see me drowning
You can't talk
I don't see you swimming
You can't talk
You want go your way
You can't talk
I know you don't love me

You can't talk
You can't talk
I know you don't love me
You can't talk
You can't talk
