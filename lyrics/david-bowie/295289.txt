Walking in the snowy street
Let me understand
Drifting down a silent path
Stumbling over land


Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave

Do you sleep in quietude
Do you walk in peace
Do you laugh out loud at me
No one else is free

Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave

I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footsteps in the sand

I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are

Open up your heart to me
I would be your slave
I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footsteps in the sand

I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave
