In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster
Who was sleeping by a tree


And I looked and frowned
And the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked: Why not?
And I replied: I don't know
So we asked a simple black bird
Who was happy as can be

Well he laughed insane and quipped
Kahlil Gibran
So I cried for all the others
Till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

So I said: So long and I waved Bye-bye
And I smashed my soul
And traded my mind

Got laid by a young bordello
I was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation
Swept back home in drag

And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said: You'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back!)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said: Do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said: Do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back!)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply

And I was seething
Breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed

Waiting for you
