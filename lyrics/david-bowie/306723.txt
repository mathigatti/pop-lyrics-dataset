Was she never there
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho


All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing come to me
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life

Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Oh ho
Oh ho

Was she never here
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life

Was she ever
Was she ever here
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life away

Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life, away (oh ho)
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life, away (oh ho)
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life, away (oh ho)
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life, away (oh ho)
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
