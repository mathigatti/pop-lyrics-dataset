It's only forever
Not long at all
The lost and lonely


No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection, nah nah
No love injection, nah nah
Life can be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cos it hurts like hell (echo hurts like hell)

But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene
A crystal moon, ah, ah

It's only forever
It's not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground
