If there is something
That I might find
Look around corners
Try to find peace of mind, I say
"Where would you go
If you were me?
Trying to keep a straight course is not easy"


Somebody special
Looking at me
Same kind of reaction
Wanted to crie with me
Lived here and there
It's too easy to say
But the service just a game a game-ame-ame-ame

I would do anything for you
I would come all day
I would swim all the oceans blue hu
I would walk a thousand miles
Reveal my secrets
More than enough for me to share
I will put roses around the door
Sit in the garden
Growing potatoes by the score

Shake your head girl, with your ponytail
Takes me right back [when you were young]
Throw your precious gifts into the air
Watch them fall down [when you were young]

Your love - feel you put them on the ground
It use to fall apart [when you were young]

Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The hills were higher [when you were young]

Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The trees were taller then [when you were young]

Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The grass was greener [when you were young]

Your love could feel you with devotion
