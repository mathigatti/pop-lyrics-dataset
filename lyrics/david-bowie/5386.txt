Time takes a cigarette
Puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger
Then another finger
Then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling
It lingers, then you forget
You're a rock 'n' roll suicide


You're too old to lose it
Too young to choose it
And the clock waits
so patiently on your song
You walk past a caf√©
But you don't eat
When you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no
You're a rock 'n' roll suicide

Chev brakes are snarling
As you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead
So you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
They're so natural
Religiously unkind

Oh no, love! You're not alone!
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care

Oh no, love! You're not alone!
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share
I'll help you with the pain

You're not alone!

Just turn on with me and you're not alone!
Let's turn on and be not alone!
Gimme your hands!
'Cause you're wonderful!
Gimme your hands!
'Cause you're wonderful!
Oh, gimme your hands!
