I was Ramona A Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artist
In the tunnel
But I remarring a midilife crisis
And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've put my heart's in
And I paint the pretty colours Enghlish
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who this warfriend is like
