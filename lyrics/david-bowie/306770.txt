Right on Mother you've really blow my mind
I never thought we'd hit it off until today
Right on Mother you know the way I feel
Now you know I'm living with my girl and it's real


I never thought you dig it so sure you hit the roof
And now you telling me you understand

That I'm a man
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Right on Mother you know the way I feel
Now you know I'm living with my girl and it's real

Never thought you dig it so sure you hit the roof
And now you telling me you understand

That I'm a man
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Goodnight you born I'll see you in the morning
Me and morrow got a good thing on
Cos she thinks is grand

That I'm a man
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Right on Mother you know the way I feel
Now you know I'm living with my girl and it's real

Ba ba ba ba
