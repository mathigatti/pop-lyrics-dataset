Here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Oh, yeah (here comes the night)


I can see right out my window
Walking down the street
My girl with another guy
His arms around her
Like it used to be with me
Oh, it makes me want to die

Yeah, here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, (here comes the night)
Here comes the night
Yeah, (here comes the night)

There they go
Funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me
Why can't I accept the fact she's chosen him
And simply let them be?

Here it comes
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Yeah, (here comes the night)

Oh, she's with him
They're turning down the lights
Now, he's holding her
The way I used to do
I can see her closing her eyes
And telling him lies
Exactly like she told me too

Oh, here it comes
Here comes the night
Oh, he here comes the night
Yeah, (here comes the night)
Here, here it comes the
Here, here it comes the

Here comes the night, yeah
Lonely, lonely night
Lonely, lonely night
Oh, ho here comes the night
