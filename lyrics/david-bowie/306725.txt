The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I watched them sink before your gaze
Se√±orita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love
Like a little soldier catching butterflies


(Chorus)
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend
I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done, oh, I'm so much in love
Like the ragged boy who races with the wind

(Chorus)

In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Oh yeah, all day, all the way

Ooh
