Hold me tight
Keep me cool
Going mad
Don't know what to do
Do I need a friend?
Well, I need one now


All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

All I've done
I've done for me
All you gave
You gave for free
I gave nothing in return
And there's little left of me

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

In red-eyed pain
I'm knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles
Pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding
Through my head and heart
I pray you'll soothe my sorry soul

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
