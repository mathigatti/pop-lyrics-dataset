This ain't Rock N' Roll
This is genocide!


As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump
And your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest, you was
Todd Browning's freak, you was

Crawling down the alley
On your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for, it's plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers
And they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will
Mannequins with kill appeal

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl
They call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl
They call them the Diamond Dogs

Now Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke
So he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh, Tarzie, go man, go

Meets his little hussy
With his ghost-town approach
Her face is sans feature
But she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent
Something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed
Diamond Dogs are sable-ized

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl
They call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl
They call them the Diamond Dogs

Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs

In the year of the scavenger
The season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk
Scurry to the ditch
Just another future song
Lonely little kitsch
Thereâ€™s gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl
They call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl
They call them the Diamond Dogs

Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs

Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule, OK

Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
