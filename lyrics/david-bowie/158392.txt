Ah (2x)

Doo, doo, doo, do-doh (2x)

Don't you wonder sometimes?
Bout sound and vision.


Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the color of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue.

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue.

I will sit right down,
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing,
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude, over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes?
Bout sound and vision.
