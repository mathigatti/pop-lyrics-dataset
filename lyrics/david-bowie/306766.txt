So far this love is delightful
The face of seduction was you
But I listened for each and every footstep
In this Real Cool World


Questioning saintlike and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Starry-eyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen color me doubtful
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

You came from nowhere
You came from nowhere
You held me you shook me
Hey

It's a Cool World
It's a Cool World

It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Mmmm
