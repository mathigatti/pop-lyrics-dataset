Here shall we live
In this terrible town
Where the price for our eyes
Shall squeeze them tight like a fist


And the walls shall have eyes
And the doors shall have ears
But we'll dance in the dark
And they'll play with our lives

Like a slow burn
Leading us on and on
(On and on, on and on)
Like a slow burn
Turning us round, and round, and round
(Round and round, round and round)

But who are we
So small in times such as these?
Slow burn
Slow burn

These are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights
These are the darkest to fall 

But who knows?
Echoes in tenement halls
Who knows?
Though the years snare them all

Like a slow burn
Leading us on, and on, and on
(On and on, on and on)
Like a slow burn
Turning us round, and round, and upside down
(Round and round, round and round)

There's fear overhead
There's fear all around
Slow burn
Slow burn

Like a slow burn
Leading us on, and on, and on
(On and on, on and on)
Like a slow burn
Turning us round, and round, and round
(Round and round, round and round)

And here are we
At the center of it all
Slow burn
Slow burn

Slow burn
