In my life I've never stopped to worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to see
Wondering if I'd done wrong (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu)
Will this depression last for long


Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

Once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu)
Please let me have happy days

Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu)
And Mummy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu)
Get your feet back on the ground

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
