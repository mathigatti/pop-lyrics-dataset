Well I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries
It's all in vain
The voice of doom
Was shining in my room
I just need one day
Somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day


Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay

Well the river's so muddy
But it may come clear
And I know too well
What's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night
I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay

Sun keeps beating down on me
Wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me
Hoping I'm gonna die

I won't be breaking no rocks
I said: I won't be breaking no rocks

(I won't be breaking no rocks) oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks) oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
When the kingdom comes
