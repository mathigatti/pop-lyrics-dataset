You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with them now for they won't see you no more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while, while you look for a whore


Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while, and they won't see you again
Like that gypsy caravan forever on the run
You stay for a while, then you pick up and go

That's how you show your love for me
That's how you show your love for me

You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you call, you leave a little sorrow
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you call, you leave a little sorrow

You're like that big, big star, he's tore the town apart
Givin' everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, then you leave without a trace

That's 'xactly like that star, he tore the town apart
Leave everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, leave without a trace

That's how you show your love for me
That's how you show your love for me

Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you call, you leave a little sorrow
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you stay, you leave a little sorrow

Oooh-huh Oh-ho

Each time I call, you leave a little sorrow
