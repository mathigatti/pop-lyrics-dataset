Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design


He thinks he's well screened
From the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They cooly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time

He's a dodo, no, no
Didn't hear it from me
He's a dodo, no, no
Didn't hear it from me

She's quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other
Now the perk's are due
Another memo to screw

She's a dodo, no, no
Didn't hear it from me
She's a dodo, no, no
Didn't hear it from me

Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them stlotting in your file a photograph
Can you sleep alone at night
Wake to find the scorching light
Of neighbour Jim
He's come to turn you in

Another dodo, no no,
Didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no,
Didn't hear it from me
Another do, do
