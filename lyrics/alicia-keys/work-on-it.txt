Work on it, work on it
Work on it, baby


Oh baby, some may think that we moved too fast
But I know you and you know me
Baby, that's what makes it last
Darling, so many lies were spread about us
Oh, that's the heartache, that's the heartache
That makes us build all the trust

I know some people like to say
That the easiest way is to fake it
We gonna make it if we try
Gotta promise not to abuse it
If you use it, don't lose it or break it
'Cause we gonna make it
You and I

When they see us coming they'll say
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When they see us coming they'll say
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Some days are hard
There ain't no easy way
No matter how we try
Nobody is perfect
But if we just love each other through it all
that makes it worth it

I know some people try to say that
The easiest way is to fake it
We gonna make it if we try
Gotta promise not to abuse it
If you use it, don't lose it or break it
We gonna make it
You and I

When they hear us coming they'll say
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When they hear us coming they'll say
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

When they feel us coming they'll say
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When they feel us coming they'll say
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Oh, we gonna work on it, baby
Me and you, we gonna work on it, baby
