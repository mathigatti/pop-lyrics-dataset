Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts


Every night I cry
Every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Yet you won't let me go

Every little hurt counts
Every little hurt counts
You say you're coming home
Yet you never phone
Leave me all alone
My love is strong for you
I'd do wrong for you
I can't take this loneliness you've give me
I can't go on giving my life away

Come back to me
Darling you'll see
I can give you all the things you wanted before
If you will stay with me

Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts

To you I'm a toy and you're the boy
Who gets to say when I should play
Yet you hurt me, desert me

Come back to me
Darling you'll see
I can give you everything that you wanted before
If you will stay with me

Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts

Every night I cry
Every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Ooh you treat me so cold
Don't you know every little bit hurts me baby
