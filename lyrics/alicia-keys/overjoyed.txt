Over time
I've been building my castle of love
Just for two
Though you never knew you were my reason


I''ve gone much too far
For you now to say
That I've got to throw
My castle away

Over dreams
I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming

The sand man has come
From too far away
For you to say come
Back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed
Over love
Over me

Over hearts
I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find
I have found what I've
searched to discover

I come much too far
For me now to find
The love that I sought
Can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed
Over love
Over me

And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed
Over love
Over you

Over you
