Here I lay all alone
Tossing turning
Longing for some of your
Tender love
Im waiting for the right
moment to come
So I can thank you for
All the tender love you've given to me


Tender love
Love so tender
Pulling me close to you
Baby I surrender

Candles they light the dark
Now I see how
Lovely the feelings are
All the tender love you've given to me

I want you more and more
Can't resist you
Move then I feel your touch
Tender love
Jabbing me straight from the heart
Lonely mirror
Please let me be a part
Of the tender love you've given to me

Tender love
Love so tender
Pulling me close to you
Baby I surrender (x2)
