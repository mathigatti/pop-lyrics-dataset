And I said get on your feet and live
Nothing but strength and blessings I bring
And this one for all my queens and kings
We are royalty, yup, they know dem ting
I feel like the world really needs some change
This can't be right, whole ting feel so strange
Right now, all that we need is love
Some empathy, yes, the season's up

[Alicia Keys]
They said I'll never make it
The dreams I'm chasing
I'm all alone
I am destined for greatness
Time to embrace it
Breaking the mold

Now they gonna see us
When you start out, they gon' give you love
But you find out what you're really worth
Then you go hard and you deal it rough
They gonna try and take it all away
Can't nobody take it all away
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Hurt, and you love
And you hurt and you’ve had enough

They said I'll never make it
The dreams I'm chasing
I'm all alone
I am destined for greatness
Time to embrace it
Breaking the mold
