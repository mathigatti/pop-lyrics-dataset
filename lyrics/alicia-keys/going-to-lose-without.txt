Going to lose without by alicia keys
I'm up against the beautiful me
In my mirror
When i still have my mind cazy
In my mirror
Cause i feel 's like my free game
Without it i can't exist
Or just halflife


But the world is spinnin'
Can't you kiss some widing?
So tell me, what's happen when i'm stoped?

Please tell me am i so very bad?
I'm losin' my mind
Losin' my voice
Cause the time hungry
It eat my wings
How can i do without their?
I'm just going to lose

Today my last breathe away
In my mirror
But somewhere i will deny my life
In my mirror
Tell me beautiful me, why can't i fly?
I'm not a winner
Just losin' girl
Without it i can't exist
Or just half life

But the world is spinnin'
Can't you kiss some widing?
So tell me, what's happen when i'm stoped?

Please tell me am i so very bad?
I'm losin' my mind
Losin' my voice
Cause the time hungry
It eat my wings
How can i do without their?
I'm just going to lose
