(feat. Nas &amp; Rakim) 

[Nas] (Alicia Keys) 
Nasty, yeah, yeah (New York, New York) 
Hey yo black it's time again, yeah, yeah 
(New York, New York) 
Come here, yeah, yeah 
(New York, New York) 
Hey yo black it's time 


(*"yeah, yeah, hey yo black it's time" - continues throughout song*) 

[Nas] 
If you knew my streets 
You would know all everybody talk about is who got beef 
Who snitchin, who told police 
Who came home, who still gone, who restin in peace 
Now they killin over music money, not drugs, rap replaced it 
Cause thugs with no brains got no patience 
New jacks I pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin 
Musician and flatten composition 
A pain, I'm like Saddam Hussein 
Still alive lookin at his dead children's burnt remains 
I burnt the game, learnt you lames a new lesson 
Your crew's soft man, ya'll need some new weapons 
The P's breathe Warriorz and skullies and Timmies 
Around mixed, spics, niggaz and giddies 
From my ghetto kings in deep thought we don't blink 
But don't think we wastin our time 
It's a New York State of Mind 

[Chorus #1 - Alicia Keys] 
New York, New York, New York 
New York City, whoa oh 
New York, New York, New York 
New York City, baby 

[Alicia Keys] 
It's like a jungle, out here 
So much struggle, out here 
And my dream's still unphased 
Greed still the cousin of death 
Always feels like always somethin farther time 
In the Streets of New York 
(New York state of mind, New York State of mind) 

[Alicia Keys] 
All I see is street homes 
And who it's holdin, our people 
Only comforts the brain 
It's like I'm going insane 
The revolution has to start, don't waste no time 
In the Streets of New York 
(New York state of mind, New York state of mind) 
C'mon 

[Chorus #2 - Alicia Keys] 
New York, New York, New York, New York oh 
State of mind (New York City) 
New York, New York, New York, New York oh 
State of crime (New York City) 
New York, New York, New York, New York oh 
Big dreams (New York City) 
New York, New York, New York, New York oh 
Big schemes 

[Alicia Keys] 
Oh, break the game 
Just ain't the same 
Baby loves and girls with no shame 
Can't get away (get away), epidemic plague 
Every hood in every state 
Don't have no reasons cause relieve is hard to find 

[Break - Alicia Keys] 
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind) - 4X 
(*"New York state of mind" is also repeated in background*) 

[Rakim] 
I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin 
A lot of footsteps to follow, I've been steppin 
Mind stressin tryin to find a record crime shreddin 
Time precious, I ain't have rest since nine eleven 
I live fast, hustle like today is my last 
I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave. 
Crack bein raw, gats squeezin off 
Manhattan squeezin off, from cats who tease with war 
The eve of the Apocalypse, evil keep movin politics 
Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis 
The opposite of Liza Minelli and Frank Sinatra 
Alicia Keys, Nas and Ra the gangsta's opera 
So New York City walk with me, talk gritty 
It's up to us New York it's our city 
Here the man come with the anthem, hands up 
It's time the thrill is back New York, let's stand up 

[Chorus] 

[Rakim - talking behind Chorus] 
Oh yeah, crucial Keys 
Your God Rakim Allah 
New York City, Nasty Nas 
A. Keys, yeah, c'mon
