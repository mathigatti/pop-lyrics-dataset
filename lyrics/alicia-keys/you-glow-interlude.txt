I heard this lil girl in PS257 yelled out one day to the teacher
And said: That shit is whack
And she stood up in the classroom and walked up from the back
And stood in front of the classroom where her history was attacked and said


You are not niggers
As a matter of fact you are not really even black
I'll prove it to you
I'll put every last one of y'all in a row
Put some Vasoline and baby oil in your face and look in the mirror
Look my beloved, you glow
