Old pirates 
Yes, they rob I
Sold I 
To the merchant ships
Minutes 
After they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand 
Was made strong
By the hand 
Of the almighty
We forward 
In this generation
Triumphantly
All I ever had 
Is songs of freedom


Won't you help to sing 
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had 
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Emancipate yourselves 
From mental slavery
None but ourselves 
can free our minds
Have no fear 
For atomic energy
Cause none of them 
Can stop the time
How long shall 
They kill our prophets
While we stand 
Aside and look
Some say 
It's just a part of it
We've got 
To fullfill the book 

Won't you help to sing 
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had 
Redemption songs
Redemption songs 
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves 
From mental slavery
None but oursekves 
Can free our minds
Have no fear 
For atomic energy
Cause none of them 
Can stop the time

How long shall 
They kill our prophets
While we stand 
Aside and look
Yes some say 
It's just a part of it
We've got 
To fullfill the book

Won't you help to sing 
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had 
Redemption songs
All I ever had 
Redemption songs
These songs of freedom 
Songs of freedom

We've got to stand up
To get up
And be strong
We've got to pray
We've got to pray
For the healing
So we can start 
All over again
