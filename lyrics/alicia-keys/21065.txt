Hmmm
Bye bye
How do you love someone
That hurts you oh so bad
With intentions good
Was all he ever had


But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Givin him all that I could
Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Giving up what seems your lifetime
What went wrong with something once so good?

How do you find the words to say
To say goodbye
(Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye
(Find the words to say goodbye)

I know now I was naive
Never knew where this would lead
And I'm not tryin' to take away
From the good man that he is

But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Givin him all that I could
Was there something wrong that we did
Cause others infiltrated
What went wrong with something once so good?

Is this the end
Are you sure
How should you know when you've never been here before
It's so hard to just let go
When this is the one and only love I've ever known
