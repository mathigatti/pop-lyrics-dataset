Well people don't see what I see
Even when they're right there standing next to me
And all of my friends think I'm crazy for loving you
What they don't know, there's nothing else I can do


And it's too bad, cause love is blind
Is too bad, is too bad
It's too bad cause love is blind
Is too bad, is so bad
It's too bad cause love is blind
It's too bad, it don't matter baby
It's too bad cause love is blind
Is too bad, is so sad

See people don't know what I know
They say I'm losing my mind, I know I'm losing control
All of my friends think I'm crazy but I don't care
I'm over the edge, no turning back for longing you I swear

And it's too bad, cause love is blind
Is too bad, is too bad
It's too bad cause love is blind
Is too bad, is so bad
It's too bad cause love is blind
It's too bad, it don't matter baby
It's too bad cause love is blind
Is too bad, is so sad
It's too bad cause love is blind

Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh (oh oh uh oh)
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh (oh oh uh oh)
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh (oh oh uh oh)
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh (oh oh uh oh)

And it's too bad, cause love is blind
Is too bad, is too bad
It's too bad cause love is blind
Is too bad, is so bad
It's too bad cause love is blind
It's too bad, it don't matter baby
It's too bad cause love is blind
Is too bad, is so sad
It's too bad cause love is blind

Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh...
