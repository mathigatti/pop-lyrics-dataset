You're used to the sound of a heart that's breaking
I know it don't fase you anymore
You're the king of the game that you're playing
I know you played it 100 times before


You fill your bedroom up with trophies
Then you get a kick outta closing the door
Got all the words to keep 'em hoping
I know you've said them 100 times before

But then there's me, a fox for your gun
Then there's me, just love me for fun
Baby, there's me no use in pretending
Oh, there's me, 101

I might as well stand stand in front of a bullet
Close my eyes and kick the chair to the floor
It's like a speeding train is coming
I know you've crashed it 100 times before

So then there's me, a fox for your gun
Darling, there's me, just love me for fun
Oh, there's me no, no use in pretending
Oh, there's me, 101

Everybody says I gotta be crazy
That I deserve everything that I get
But I got a feeling that makes me wanna ignore
All that you've done 100 times before

'Cause then there's me, could I be the one?
And, baby, there's me to make you undone
Ooh, darling, there's me no use, no use, no use in pretending
Oh, there's me, 101

Me, 101
So I gotta be, I gotta be
I gotta be 101
Maybe it's time, maybe it's me
Maybe I could be, let me pretend
I gotta be, I'mma be 101
Yeah, baby
