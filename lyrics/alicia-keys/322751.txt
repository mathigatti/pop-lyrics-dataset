Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted I bought them for you
Graceless lady you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands
Wild horses, couldn't drag me away
Wild wild horses couldn't drag me away


I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or off stage lines
Make me feel bitter or treat you unkind, baby
Wild horses, couldn't drag me away
Wild horses, couldn't drag me away, yeah

I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie, oh
I have my freedom but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears had been cried
Let's do some living before we die

Wild horses, couldn't drag me away
Wild horses, couldn't drag me away
Wild horses, we'll ride them someday, yeah

Wild horses, wild horses...
