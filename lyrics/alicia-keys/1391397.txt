If you think the sky is fallin
Your commin undone
All pieces crumble
You're on the run


All the wrong you've taken
All the rules your breakin
Doncha know the silent truth is
It comes back to you

Doncha know the sky is blue
Cant you see the sun is breaking through
Have a little faith in you
Doncha know the sky is blue

Everytime you walk out that door
Cursing the sky
Feeling like youve been cheated
Ripped from inside

Doncha know the sky is blue
Cant u see the sky is breaking through
Have a little faith in you
Doncha know the sky is blue

Come on..

nanananana...


Doncha know the sky is blue
Doncha know the sky is blue

Have a, have a little faith in you
Doncha know the sky is blue
Doncha know the sky is blue

Hey!

Doncha know the sky is blue

Come on

The sky is blue
Said the sky the sky
Im telling you the sky is blue
Believe it
Woo who
Doncha know the sky sky sky sky

Hey hey..
