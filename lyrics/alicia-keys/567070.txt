When gone is the fame
When gone is the name
And you're left with yourslf

I look in the mirror
To search your face
To remember who you are
Who you ever were

When gone is the shine
Is gone the whole
Of your future and pride?

I look all around
To search for a friend
That no longer stands
Till the bitter end

When gone is the glory
When gone is the sun
When gone is the game
Then what have you won?

Headache and pain
Of what could have been
Only you know the truth,
Of what is within

Chorus:4
When gone is the praise
When gone is the fun
Is gone, the worth,
Of what you've become?

Verse:4
When i am alone
At the end of this story
How does it feel,
When gone is the glory?
