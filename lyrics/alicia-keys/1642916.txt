Sometimes I feel
Like I don't belong anywhere
It's gonna take so long
For me to get to somewhere


Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted
But I can't explain cause I'm so guarded
But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there

Can you send an angel?
Can you send an angel?
To guide me

Sometimes I feel
Like a door with no key
And all the answers are locked away in me
But they're so hard to find
Especially when I'm feeling lost and so blind

But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there

Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Cause I don't wanna feel
Like a dove with no wings
And I don't wanna know
What a heart of stone would ring

But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there

Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Please send me an angel
Can you send me an angel?
To guide me
To guide me home
Cause I'm feeling so lonely in this creepy world
