You’re the engine that makes all things go
And you’re always in disguise, my hero
I see your light in the dark
Smile in my face when we all know it’s hard
There’s no way to ever pay you back
Bless your heart, know I love you for that
Honest and selfless
I don’t know if this helps it, but


Good job, you’re doin' a good job, a good job
You’re doin' a good job
Don’t get too down
The world needs you now
Know that you matter, matter, matter, yeah
You’re doin' a good job, a good job
You’re doin' a good job
Don’t get too down
The world needs you now
Know that you matter, matter, matter, yeah

Six in the morning
And soon as you walk through that door
Everyone needs you again
The world’s out of order
It’s not as sound when you’re not around
All day on your feet, hard
Keep that energy, I know
When it feel like the end of the road
You don’t let go
You just press forward

You’re the engine that makes all things go
And you’re always in disguise, my hero
I see your light in the dark
Smile in my face when we all know it’s hard
There’s no way to ever pay you back
Bless your heart, know I love you for that
Honest and selfless
I don’t know if this helps it, but (good job)

Good job, you’re doin' a good job, a good job (good job)
You’re doin' a good job
Don’t get too down
The world needs you now
Know that you matter, matter, matter, yeah
(Yeah, that's a good job)
You’re doin' a good job, a good job (good job)
You’re doin' a good job
Don’t get too down
The world needs you now
Know that you matter, matter, matter, yeah

The mothers, the fathers, the teachers that reach us
Strangers to friends that show up in the end
From the bottom to the top, the listeners that hear us
This is for you, you make me fearless

You’re doin' a good job, a good job (oh)
You’re doin' a good job
Don’t get too down
The world needs you now
Know that you matter, matter, matter, yeah
