Beautiful garden, where have you gone?
My self delusions are leaving me in the storm
Taking for granted all the goodness that I've found
Somewhere I lost all, the control came crashing down


And I pray for forgiveness, look for the answer
Cause it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother, call to the captain
Can't you see this state that I'm in
No one would notice, nobody noticed
Cause it's me where it begins

Beautiful morning, please don't wake me from my sleep
Cause I need some comfort, to regain my sanity
And I don't wanna feel this crazy
I don't wanna feel this heartache
Shattered into million pieces
I'm so broken hearted
No where left to run
No where left to go
So I hope

I pray for forgiveness, look for the answer
Cause it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother, call to the captain
Can't you see, this state that I'm in
And no one would notice, nobody noticed
That it's me, where it begins
And I pray for forgiveness within

I swear that everyday I feel like my mind is haunting me
I think of every little stupid mistake that has been made
This time I don't have the strength to gather myself
I'm falling to pieces

And I pray for forgiveness, look for the answer
Cause it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother, call to the captain
Can't you see this state that I'm in
I pray for forgiveness
Looking for justice
Searching for answers
Call to my mother
Pray for forgiveness, breaking the silence

Nobody knows it, nobody noticed
That's it me where it begins
