Shame on us, on your sons and your daughters
Dig all your gold and we poisoned all your waters
Every piece of our soul is for sale
Now they bought us
Think we know it all
Then look where it got us


Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
You're crying to the wind

Trying to play God
People fucking with genetics
All that you have given and we only disrespected
The rate that weâ€™re going premature Armageddon
That's what gonna happen if we let it

Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
You're crying to the wind

Is there any savin' us
We've become so dangerous
Is there any change in us
Even for the sake of love
How you gonna kill your mama
When only mama is gonna love you to the grave

Killing our selves
Falling down with the sickness
Money is the king
It's a dirty bloody business
There will be no trial
But the child will always witness
If we are in love with hell
Why the hell would heaven visit

Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
You're crying to the wind

When mama gets the belt you gon' wish you didn't do it
Had your chance for redemption
But you fucking blew it
Now the weather is changing it and the hurricane is moving
Right in your direction
What direction are you choosing

Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
Forgive us for your pain

Is there any savin' us
We've become so dangerous
Is there any change in us
Even for the sake of love
How you gonna kill your mama
When only mama is gonna love you to the grave

How you gonna kill your mama
How you gonna kill your mama
