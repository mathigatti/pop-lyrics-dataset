Drop it
Yeah, yeah
Come in for a minute,
Welcome back
It's just me and you in this room right now
There's so many things that are on my mind
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Sometimes it's hard to say
So I take all I've got
And so I take all I have
And I put it into this
I put it right here in my diary
Can u feel it?
Uh, uh, uh
Take this journey with me
