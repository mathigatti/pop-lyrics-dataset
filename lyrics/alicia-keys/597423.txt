Every night I sit and wait,
For the stars to fall from the sky, 
and all the time i`m asking why oh why. 
I guess i`m a dreamer thats all I ever do, 
I sit here and dream of you,
Dreaming hides the truth of hurt and pain,
And all I do is dream over and over again.
It wouldn`t be so hard if the stars would fall to me,
Maybe I could catch them then I`d finally see,
See why you left why you went a way,
Maybe I could change the hurt I feel today.
I guess i`m a dreamer thats all I ever do,
I sit here and dream of you,
dreaming hides the truth of the hurt and pain,
and all I do is dream over and over again
