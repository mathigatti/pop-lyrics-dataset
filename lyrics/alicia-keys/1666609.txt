Only with you... ooh

We got the perfect chemistry,
Don't we Babe.
It's like we're on the permanent getaway,
And that ain't no one around.
Where you are like,
The perfect melody that's in my mind,
And my heart belongs to you.


A lover take you for granted, (I never, no...)
But I'll always be here, (I'll always be here...)
Of all the people on this planet, (Only you can take me there...)

Only when I'm with you,
My life just gets better.
Only with you,
My love is forever.
Only when I'm with you,
Each moment I'll treasure.
Only when I'm with you, with you, with you...

It's hard to find the words to say,
Cause boy you mean that much to me.
I'm the flower and you're the sun &amp; brain.
You're the candle on the flame,
You light me brighter than the day,
I will never be the same again...
