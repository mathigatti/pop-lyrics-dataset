Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell u all that comes to me
If u have something to say
U should say it right now


You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it

It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wondering maybe

Could I make you my baby
If we do the un-thinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready

I know you said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when it`s meant to be"
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something about it
We should do it right now

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it

It's become something that's impossible to ignore
It`s what we make it
I was wondering maybe

Could I make you my baby
If we do the un-thinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready

Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

I was wondering maybe

Could I make you my baby
If we do the un-thinkable will it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
