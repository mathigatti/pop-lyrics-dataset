C'mon say .. uh yeaah
C'mon say .. uh yeaah
3, 4


Just one more step
C'mon baby ... yeah
cause we're all almost there

No matter how hard
The task may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges
Will turn us around
Cause what we're searchin' for
Will soon be found

Cause we're almost there
Just one more step
Just one more step
Don't give up
we're all almost there

Look at the lonely lovers
That didn't make it
Life's long hard climb
They just couldn't take it
Don't let it happen to me and you
Hold on together, darlin'
We'll make it through

Darlin', keep on reachin' out for me
Keep on reachin, do it for me
Do it for me, do it baby

Cause we're almost there
just one more step
Don't you dare, give up give up
Cause we're almost there

We're so close
I can taste it
A life so sweet
Can't afford to waste it
If you feel your hand
Slippin' from mine?
Just hold on tighter now, darlin'
Keep on tryin'

Baby, do it for me, do it do it baby
Just one more step
Don't give up
Just one more step
Baby baby, don't give up
Keep on, keep on
Just one more step
Cause we're almost there

[Instrumental]

Juste one more step
Cause we're almost there
We've come to far
To turn around

Ooh!!

Keep on reachin'
For higher ground
We've had our ups and we've had our downs
Let nothin' in the world darlin'
Turn us around

Cause we're almost there
We're almost there
We're almost there

Everything we're lookin' for
We're almost there
Keep on reachin' out for me

Cause we're almost there darlin'
We're almost there
We're almost there darlin'
We're almost there
We're almost there

Ah we're almost there
