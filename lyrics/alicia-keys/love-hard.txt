Scrolling through my phone looking for that name
I just wanna talk to you
I could be alone if you went away
'cause i'm so into you
It's kinda sickening how i'm tripping baby
The truth about it is you drive me crazy
I tried to block it so you wouldn't phase me
But now my head's gone, so


Sometimes it hurts me to say
I love hard,
We're connected in so many ways
So i love hard
Watch me fall, fall, fall, ohh
Watch me fall, fall, fall, ohh

Once i confess my love there's nothing i can do
It's out of my hands
Sometimes i regret ever meeting you
Help me understand
How i keep round and round in circles baby
Don't wanna mess around and hurt you baby
Used to be in denial baby
Now the picture is clear oh

Sometimes it hurts me to say
I love hard,
We're connected in so many ways
So i love hard
Watch me fall, fall, fall, ohh
Watch me fall, fall, fall, ohh

I can meet you on a monday
Call you on a tuesday
Kick it on a wednesday
Make sure that you know me
Kiss you on a thursday
'cause we're past the first date
Friday imma be lovin you
