Have you ever felt so strong
That it made you feel weak
Long days, long nights
And you just can't sleep


Have you ever been so sure
That it gave you cold feet
Got you floating on air
You can feel your heartbeat

I never known this feeling, ever
Now I hope it stays and lasts forever

I am riding high
I don't wanna come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
If I can touch the sky
I risk the fall
Just to know how it feels to fly

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah

Have you ever felt so lost
But didn't know until you were found
Looking everywhere
But you finally see now

In the room full of people
Feel like no one is around
Get your head in the clouds
And your feet are off the ground

Say I never knew this feeling, ever
Now I hope it stays and last forever

I am riding high
I don't want to come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
If I can touch the sky
I risk the fall
Just to know how it feels to fly

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We get to go

(Higher)
Higher
(Higher)
Higher
Higher

I imagine
I don't want to come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
If I can touch the sky
I risk the fall
Just to know how it feels to fly

I imagine
I don't want to come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
If I can touch the sky
I risk the fall
Just to know how it feels to fly

(Yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah
