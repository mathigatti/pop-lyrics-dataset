Love is like the sea, leaves you on your knees
Then it pulls you in
Then it takes you, takes you over, over
Love is like the sea, leaves you on your knees
First your floating high
Then takes you, takes you under, under


When it's cold, cold under water
In the night time
But I dove, dove to the bottom
To see what I'd find

That's when I saw a light
A glowing paradise
Thought I stay a while
It's been calling me underwater
Everything that I ever dream

Taking my breath away
Current got a hold on me
Sweeping me away
Wish I can stay
Takes me to the top
It's the cycle that never stops

Love is like the sea, leaves you on your knees
Then it pulls you in
Then it takes you, takes you over, over
Love is like the sea, leaves you on your knees
First your floating high
Then takes you, takes you under, under

(Takes you, takes you over)
(Takes you, takes you under)
(Takes you, takes you over) over
(Takes you, takes you under)

Say I've been told, told
You only find it once in a lifetime
So you better hold, hold on
Stronger than ever
Like it's the last time

So when you see the night
Like a ship in the night
You will found a place
You been looking for
Like a distant shore
Don't you ever look back again

Here is something you should know
Still see you are still in control
Cherish everyday
Cause never know
It can take away
The very thing you love the most

Love is like the sea, leaves you on your knees
Then it pulls you in
Then it takes you, takes you over, over
Love is like the sea, leaves you on your knees
First your floating high
Then takes you, takes you under, under

(takes you, takes you over) oh
(takes you, takes you under)
(takes you, takes you over) so far
(takes you, takes you under) this love like the sea

(takes you, takes you over) oh
(takes you, takes you under) can you feel the pull
(takes you, takes you over) it's calling you
(takes you, takes you under)

Love is like the sea, leaves you on your knees
Then it pulls you in
Then it takes you, takes you over, over
Love is like the sea, leaves you on your knees
First your floating high
Then takes you, takes you under, under
