When it rains it pours, life can be so lonely,
But the faith of the storm, makes the way less heavy,
This life can seem so unfair but who cares,
If I can rise up then I will get there


Cause I'm lookin for a place to call my own,
Lookin for a house to make a home,
Lookin for a seat upon a throne,
Lookin for a place to call my own

Hey, hey

The hardest place to go
Is where I've never gone before,
It takes a brave, brave soul,
But it makes you much stronger.

Now I feel so alive and there's no more cry,
I chose to rise up and there's no deny

That I finally found a place to call my own,
I finally found a house to make a home,
I finally took a seat upon a throne,
And now I have a place to call my own

So many people they try to make you,
Make you believe that,
You're nothing without them, no
Don't you believe it,
Not for a minute
You gotta show love,
This is the way

Now I have a place, to call my own
Now I have a house to make a home,
Now I have a seat upon a throne,
'Cause now I have a place to call my own.

Hey, hey
I didn't worry... About a thing..

Hey, hey
I'll never worry about a thing
Come on...
