I keep on fallin' in and out of love with you
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Loving you darling
Makes me so confuse


I keep on fallin' in and out of love with you
I never loved someone the way that I loved you

Oh, Oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain, yea yea
'Cause when I think
I'm taking more than one fool
And I start fallin' back in love with you

I keep on fallin' in and out of love with you
I never loved someone the way that I loved you

Ah, ah, ah, ah
I'm fallin'
Ah, ah,ah,ah
I'm fallin'
Fall, fall, fall, fall

I keep on fallin' in and out of love with you
I never loved someone the way that I loved you

What?
