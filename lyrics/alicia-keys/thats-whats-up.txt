You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good he's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about him
I love him so much, with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body, I love him so much
Because he's done so much for me


Ladies and gentleman
Allow me my testimony
I'm so blessed, I'm so blessed
Stow your blessings upon me

And it feels so good, it feels so good
So good to be free
Oh, keep your presence
Oh, keep your presence on me

Let all your inhibitions
Leave the way
Can nobody leave me
Can nobody leave me like you

And I, I
I want to thank you, Lord
For all the love, yeah
Time after time you're lifting me up
Lord knows, you never let me down

Now that's what's up
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
That's what's up
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
