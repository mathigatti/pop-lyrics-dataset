Is it my turn to wish you was lying here?
I tend to dream when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
Or even imagine your emotions
Tell myself anything


Is it my turn to take you by your hands?
Tell you I love you when youre not here with me
Is it my turn to totally understand?
But you wont get all my love
And not do a damn thing

Hard to give away
Every feeling that I feel
Hard to sacrifice
Oh whatever baby, whatever baby
Hard to take apart
All that I am
Theres not anything that I would not do
Cause inside id die without you
Inside id die without you
Yeah,  baby

Oh I apologize
For all the things ive done
Now I'm under water and I'm drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry
Isnt it amazing how some things completely turn around
Take every little piece of my heart
Take every little piece of my soul
Take every little piece of my mind
Cause if youre gone
Inside id die without you
Cause inside id die without you
Yea baby
Id die without you
Cant you see that I would die without you

Hard to give away
Every feeling that I feel
Hard to sacrifice
Oh whatever baby, whatever baby
Hard to take apart
All that I am
Theres not anything that I would not do
Cause inside id die without you
Id die without you

Oh you know that I would
Die without you
Die without you
Baby, said I would die without you
Die without you
Id die without you
Die without you
