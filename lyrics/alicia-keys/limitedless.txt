Murder, murder
I took the red pill
My heart it goes boom
Every time that we feel
And if he be Jack
Then I guess me be Jill
Fell into his arms
Got me head over the hills


I'm saying woaah
Feel it up and down
And in my soul
If I used to be broken
Now I’m whole
Ohhh no
I'm at his mercy, mercy, mercy ‘cause I

I can’t count
No amount
There's no limits, no, no
To the ways I can love you babe

Take me over
I can’t get over
There’s no limits, no, no
To the ways I can love you babe

One, two, three
To infinity yeah
Two, three, four
It’s ubiquitous
Four, five, six
To a limitedless love

If there's another one
He's not in this world, love
Can be no other one
There is only you
Oh and if one and one
Only leaves us two, love
Then I’m cool being your girl
We can stop the whole world for us

I'm saying
Woah
Feel it up and down
And in your soul
I'll forever be here
At his mercy, mercy, mercy
Loving him for
Eternity, eternity, eternity
‘Cause I

I can’t count
No amount
There's no limits, no, no
To the ways I can love you babe

Take me over
I can’t get over
There’s no limits, no, no
To the ways I can love you babe

One, two, three
To infinity yeah
Two, three, four
It’s ubiquitous
Four, five, six
To a limitedless love
Ahhhhh’s
Ohhh Aaaaah’s
Ahhhhh’s

One, two, three
To infinity yeah
Two, three, four
This is my decree
Four, five, six
To a limitedless love
Limited, limited, limited
Limitedless love
