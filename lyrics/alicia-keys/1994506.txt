You're a no good heart breaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
And I don't know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
That you ain't no good
But oh, but they don't know
And I'd leave you if I could


I guess I'm uptight
And I'm stuck like glue
'Cause I ain't never
I ain't never, I ain't never, no, no loved a man
The way that I
I love you

Some time ago I thought
You had run out of fools
But I was so wrong couse
You got one that you'll never lose
The way you treat me is a shame
How could you hurt me so bad
Baby, you know that I'm the best thing
That you ever had

So Kiss me once again
Don'cha never, never say that we're through
Cause I ain't never
Never, Never, Never no, no, loved a man
The way that I
I love you

I can't sleep at night
And I can't eat a bite
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got, your hooks, in me

Oohh
Yeah! Yeah!
I ain't never loved a man
I ain't never loved a man, baby
Ain't never had a man that hurt me so bad

No
So here is what I'm gonna do
Gonna hold on
Cause I ain't never
Said I never never loved a man
The way that I
I love you
