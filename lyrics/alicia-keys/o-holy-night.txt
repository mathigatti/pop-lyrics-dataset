O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining.
It was the night of our dear Saviour's birth.


Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

Fall on your knees!
Oh hear the angel voices!
Oh night divine!
Oh night when Christ was born!
Oh night divine!
Oh night!
Oh night divine!
When Christ was born

O Holy Night!
