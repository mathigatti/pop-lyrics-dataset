Another ringer with the slick trigger finger for Her Majesty
Another one with the golden tongue poisoning your fantasy
Another bill from a killer turned a thriller to a tragedy


Yeah
A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Or someone that you think that you can trust
It's just another way to die

Another tricky little gun giving solace to the one that'll never see the sun shine
Another inch of your life sacrificed for your brother in the nick of time
Another dirty money heaven sent honey turning on a dime

Well,
A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Or someone that you think that you can trust
It's just another way to die

It's just another
Hey!
It's just another
You're nothing to me, die
It's just another
Shoot'em , bang, bang!

Another girl with her finger on the world singing to you what you wanna hear
Another gun thrown down in surrendered took away your fear
Hey, another man there, he stands right behind you looking in the mirror

A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Or someone that you think that you can trust
It's just another way to die

It's just another
It's just another
It's just another way
Shoot'em up, bang, bang!
Hey! Hey!
It's just another
Yeah! Yeah!

It's just another
It's just another
It's just another
It's just another day
Bang, bang, bang, bang
