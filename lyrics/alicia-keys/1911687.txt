Ooh, New York
Ooh, New York


Grew up in a town
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirenes all around and the streets are mean

If I can make it here, I could make it anywere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down on Broadway

Even if ain't all it seems
I got a pocket full of dreams

Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York

On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard
Such a merlting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God

Hail a gipsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight
With a hunger for more then an empty fridge

I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocket full of dreams

Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say: Yeh, yeh; yeh, yeh

New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear Ã¯t for New York
