I Know You
Don't Know What
I'm Going Through
Standing Here
Looking At You


Let Me Tell Ya That It
Hurts So Bad
It Makes Me Feel So Sad
Oh It Hurts So Bad
To See You Again
Like Needles And Pins

People Say
You're Making Out Okay
He's In Love
Don't Get In There Way

Let Me Tell Ya That It
Hurts So Bad
It Makes Me Feel So Sad
You're Gonna Hurt So Bad
If You Walk Away

Why Can't You Stay
And Let Me
Make It Up To You
I'll Do Anything
You Want Me To

You Loved Me Before
Come Love Again
I Can't Let You Go
Back To Her
Please Don't Go
Please Don't Goooooo

It Makes Me Feel So Sad
It's Gonna Hurt So Bad
If You Walk Away

Please Don't Go
Please Don't Goooooo
Ohhh Ohhh

Don't Make It Hurt So Bad
It's Gonna Hurt So Bad
To See You Again
