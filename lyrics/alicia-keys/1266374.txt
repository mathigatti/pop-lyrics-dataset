One of these days I'm gonna wake up
Skies gonna be blue
One of these days I'm gonna wake up
To a sun shining through
One of these days this song is gonna be true
And the world, the world
Is gonna be brand new


One of these days I'm gonna wake up
And im gonna feel fine
One of these days I'm gonna wake up
And my dreams are gonna be mine
One of these days this song is gonna be true
And the world, the world
Is gonna be brand new

It's gonna sound like music
Oh sweet music
And everybody's gonna want
To sing along
It's gonna sound like music
Oh sweet music
And everybody in the world
is gonna sing this song

They gonna say la,la-la,la-la,la,la
la-la,la-la,la,la
la-la,la-la,la,la

One of these days I'm gonna wake up
And I'm gonna be free
One of these days I'm gonna wake up
Break this chance oh gimmie... [?]
One of these days this song is gonna be true
And the world is gonna be brand new

It's gonna sound like music
Oh sweet music
And everybody's gonna want
To sing along
It's gonna sound like music
Oh sweet music
And everybody in the world
is gonna sing my song, my song, my song

They gonna say la,la-la,la-la,la,la
la-la,la-la,la,la
la-la,la-la,la,la [x2]

One of these days, one of these days, I know I know... one of these days
And the world, the world
Is gonna be brand new...
