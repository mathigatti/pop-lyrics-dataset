Yeah, uh

Blood in my eye, hand on my heart
Feet on the ground, head to the sky
Cause trouble ain't no friend of mine
Ain't no giving it up, no more wasting time


If you had 28 thousand days
Who would you love? Where would you go?
What would you celebrate?
I'm telling you that life's too short
To just throw it away
So have the time of your life, so have the time of your life
Hey, ey, ey
Hey, ey, ey
Hey, ey, ey

Back from hell with my angel wings
Ain't no fear in my voice
Cause I'm making a choice
The devil ain't no friend of me
And that clock on the wall is telling me
That there's just

There's only 28 thousand days
Who would you love? Where would you go?
What would you celebrate?
I'm telling you that life's too short
To just throw it away
So have the time of your life, so have the time of your life
Hey, ey, ey
Hey, ey, ey
Hey, ey, ey
Hey, ey, ey
Hey, ey, ey

There's only 28 thousand days
Who would you love? Where would you go?
What would you celebrate?
I'm telling you that life's too short
To just throw it away
So have the time of your life, so have the time of your life
Hey, ey, ey
Hey, ey, ey
Hey, ey, ey
Hey, ey, ey
Hey, ey, ey
