Boy I said it once before
But baby I'm just making sure
I know that there is nothing more than you
So they can take it all away
I don't need it anyway
I just want another day with you


Some people just don't know what they have
But boy I'm so glad I got you
Some people say they search all their life
But boy it's so nice I found you

Some people want it all
I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
It means nothing nothing
If I ain't got you

Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you, you you you, you you you

So people looking forward to
The things they can't afford to do
All I'm looking forward to is you
You could never sacrifice
Boy you know I'm really fine
I would even give my life for you

Some people just don't know what they have
But boy I'm so glad I got you
Some people say they search all their life
But boy it's so nice I found you

Some people want it all
I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
It means nothing nothing
If I ain't got you

Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you, you you you, you you you

Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you, you you you, you you you

[SPOKEN:]
Uh, yeah
That's how I feel
I wanna say more but
The last record I did with Kanye
Talked your ear off so
All I wanna say is

Baby, baby
Nothing in this whole wide world
Don't mean a thing
I ain't got you with me

Some people want it all
I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
It means nothing nothing
If I ain't got you

Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you
Ooh, you you you, you you you, you you yo
