I keep on
fallin'
in and out of love wit' you
sometimes i love you
sometimes im blue
sometimes i glow inside
other times you make me cry
tell me what am i to do
im so confused


tell me who, tell me what, tell me where
tell me when, tell me how
tell me who, tell me what, tell me where
tell me when, tell me why

i'm fallin
with you
i never
love someone like you

oh oh
i never
felt this way
tell me why i feel this way
how do you
give me such
pleasure and pain
and when i think i've taken more
than any fool can endour
that is when i start to fall for you once more
