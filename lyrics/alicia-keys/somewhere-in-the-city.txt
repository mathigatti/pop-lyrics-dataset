Just the other day, I was looking at the window
And I was thinking somewhere in the city
Just like mine


Somewhere in the city like mine
Sky is falling
Somewhere in the city like mine
Father's calling
Seas are rising, see yours crying
Dreams may wash away
But we surviving, mothers trying
Help us see our ways!

So you gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
When everybody loves someone there's nothing to fear
So you gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
Everybody knows that love
Is the reason we're here!

Say it one more time
Somewhere on an island like mine
World is shaking
Somewhere on an island like mine
Hearts are breaking
Seas are rising, birds are diving
Dreams may wash away
But we surviving, mothers trying
Help us see our ways!

So you gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
When everybody loves someone there's nothing to fear
So you gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
Everybody knows that love
Is the reason we're here!

I know, I know, I know
It feels like some things will never change
Oh lord, come on, come on, come on
Don't get down, just start to be the change
That you want in the world!

So you gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
When everybody loves someone there's nothing to fear
So you gotta love somebody
So you gotta love somebody
Everybody knows that love
Is the reason we're here!
Ooh ooh
Everybody knows that love!
Ooh ooh ah ah aah!
