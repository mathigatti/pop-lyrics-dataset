Life is cheap, bittersweet
But it taste good to me


Take my turn, crash and burn
That's how it's supposed to be

So don't rain on my parade
Life's too short to waste one day

I'm gonna risk it all, the freedom to fall
Yes it sure looks good to me

Time passed by and leaves you behind
Take it naturslly

Heaven knows (OH) There's so much more
More than what we see

So don't rain on my parade
Life's too short to waste one day

I'm gonna risk it all, the freedom to fall
Yes it sure looks good to me

(HEY) Sure looks good to me

Ooh, ooh, oooo, ooohh
Yea, yea, yeaaaa

Ooh, ooh, oooo, ooohh
Yea, yea, yeaaaa

Deep in my mind Im secure we can buy
I wanna see the light before I die or I lie in an empty space,

The darkness comes and I've been telling my soul
And me and myself we turn around, we're getting old,

But the lightning crashing, foolish emotions
From the bruises and the beauty in this moment that we're feeling,

And I feel like I'm seeing the world inside of me
But I can tell you that I know, it's getting easier to breathe,

There's a cold in the morning, endless equation
Of who've we've become, it's a complex situation

So live, love, life give love
Live, love, life, give love
Live, love, life, give love
It's who are we anyway

So don't rain on my parade
Life's too short to waste one day

I'm gonna risk it all, the freedom to fall
Yes it sure looks good to me

(HEY) It sure looks good to me
(I'm telling you) Sure looks good to me

(YEA) Sure looks good to me...
