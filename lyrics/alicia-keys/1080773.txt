Love
Love will come find you
Just to remind you
Of who you are


Oh love
It will forsake you
Threaten to break you
Take what you got

Everybody laughs
Everybody cries
Sure it can hurt you, baby
But give it a little try
See, that's the thing about love

Friends
Sometimes will blind you
Sneak up behind you
Can't give enough

They lie
It would embrace you
Totally amaze you
So you don't give up

Everybody laughs
Everybody cries
Ooh it can hurt you, baby
But give it a little try
See, that's the thing about love

Oooh tell me that I'm not the only one
Who's going through it all
Oooh sometimes I feel that I'm the only
One who's going through it all

But it's time, oh it's time
For me to shine
So it's 'bout time, oh it's time
For me to shine

It's 'bout time, it's 'bout time
For me to shine
It's 'bout time, it's 'bout time
For me to shine

Everybody laughs
Everybody cries
Sure it can hurt you baby
But give it a little try

See, that's the thing about love
That's the thing about love
That's the thing about
That's the thing about love
