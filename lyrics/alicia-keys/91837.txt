It would be 
It would be 
It would be, so simple 


What it is ain't what it was 
What should it be, when it comes to you and 
How it seems ain't how it is 
There's been a change, when it comes to me 
and 

Oh baby you, 
Oh baby me, 
Oh maybe we, 
Can try another day another way 

All in my mind, 
I'm wonderin' why, 
We cannot find, 
What was left at the beginning 
If I could 

Meet you again 
Kiss you again 
Miss you again 
(It would be, it would be so simple) 

Cause I would 
Love you again 
Hold you again 
Need you again 
(It would be, it would be... 
could it be,could it be so simple) 

Now it's hardly simple 
It's just simply hard 
When it comes to you and 
I find myself not being myself 
Just to avoid 
All this confrontation with 

Oh baby you, 
Oh baby me, 
Oh maybe we, 
Can put this armor down and settle down 

Oh it's off track 
That is a fact 
Can we get it back 
Get it back to the beginning 
If I could 

Meet you again 
Kiss you again 
Miss you again 
(It would be, it would be so simple) 

Cause I would 
Love you again 
Hold you again 
Need you again 
(It would be, it would be... 
could it be, could it be so simple) 

Don't you know that it would be 
Don't you know that it would be 
Don't you know that it would be 

It would be 
It would be 
It it would be 
It would be 

Meet you again 
Kiss you again 
Miss you again 
(It would be, it would be so simple) 

Cause I would 
Love you again 
Hold you again 
Need you again 
(It would be, it would be... 
could it be, it would be so simple) 

la,la,la,la,la,la,la
