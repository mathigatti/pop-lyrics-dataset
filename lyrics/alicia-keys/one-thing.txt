What, where am i?

What's life like on a train
Nobody there knows your name
As your decision changed
Do you wish that i came ?
I thought youd pick me up from work
I waited for your truck for half hour
I know you said you were gonna
But i never thought youd leave


This one thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I'll take one thing over everything
I'll take that thing over anybody

Square face and puppy eyes
Foul mouth they never lied
Your old man lived in the sky left you a house with a yard
But you went away, a different try, find a place that's your size
Too good to finish life here with me

And i couldn't get you to say
Why you wouldn't let me come
What should be simple just ain't
And it shouldn't hurt like it does

This one thing is made for us
Won't stay with us, it ain't saving us
But i'll take one thing over everything
I'll take that thing over anybody

Baby hold it off clear
I need a complement, just a touch from a friend
I need a gentle world
I need your company i'll keep

One thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody

Anything

Take one thing
