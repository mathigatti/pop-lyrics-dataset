Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm looking for some people who's looking for peace
Maybe together we could make the war seas
Now we can send mankind to the moon
And we can reach to the bottom of the sea
That's why it's really gone and that hurts me
That we can only end wars and bring peace
And we can no chain away people act
And we can no chain the way people think
So you could sit back chill out and relax
Socialization will soon be extinct
That's why I am


I'm calling on, I'm calling on the whole wide world
On the home I go
Come on people, would you help me?
Let's scream and shout, let's scream and shout cause we want peace
And we won't be, who said at least

I dedicate this song to the common people
Caught in the middle of this common evil
I wish the world was the letter man's ...
Time is about looking at the man in the mirror
Fear is the devil's police there
And they go down side with him so he cares
Cause nobody was speaking, that's why I am

I'm calling on, I'm calling on the whole wide world
On the home I go
Come on people, would you help me?
Let's scream and shout, let's scream and shout cause we want peace, cause we want peace

Rwanda, never again, and after Rwanda, what's happening?
Not far from the ...
Who's gonna shout for the people living in the ...?

The war going that, the war going by
The war is ... down ...
Nobody care about the poor and the needy
To be exactly ... to the rich and the greedy
For every year ... I am...

One more time, we got no more time
We gotta figure out a way to make it all combine
Like Jericho the work ...
...Voices out of city surround
You know what is wrong I'ma put your voice to work
We gonna shut down heaven and earth
That's why I am

I'm calling on, I'm calling on the whole wide world
On the home I go
Come on people, would you help me?
Let's scream and shout, let's scream and shout cause we want peace, and we want piece
And we won't be, who said at least

Come on, everybody come on, stand up, stand up, stand up
You want peace and I want peace, stand up
You want peace and I want peace, stand up
Come on, everybody come on, stand up, stand up, stand up

I'm calling on, I'm calling on the whole wide world
On the home I go
Come on people, would you help me?
Let's scream and shout, let's scream and shout cause we want peace, and we want piece
And we won't be, who said at least

I want peace and you want peace, stand up
You want peace and I want peace, stand up
Come on, stand up, stand up, stand up,
We want peace, we want peace, we want peace, we want peace.
