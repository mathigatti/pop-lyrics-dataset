I'm, i'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
It's alright with me
'cause you make me feel so brand new
And i want to spend my life with you
Ain't the same since, baby, since we've been together
Ooh, loving you forever
Is what i need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue


Ooh, baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you wheather, wheather times are good or bad,
And i'm happy or sad
Wheather times are good or bad, and i'm happy or sad

Why somebody, why people want break up?
Oh, turn around and make up
I just can't see
You'd never do that to me (would you, baby?)
So being around you is all i see
Is what i want us to
Let's, we ought to stay together
Loving you wheather, wheather times are good or bad,
And i'm happy or sad

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you wheather, wheather times are good or bad,
Happy or sad
