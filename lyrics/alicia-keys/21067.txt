Your girlfriend

Alicia Keys
Uh huh
JD wha' wha'
Come on


Alicia:
Maybe silly for me to feel this way about you and her
Cuz I know she's been such a good friend
I know she has helped you through

Talkin late on the phone
Every night you've been callin'
Private moments alone
And your heart soon be fallin
And I know she's a friend
But I can't shake the feeling
That I could be losing your heart

I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

Ohohoohoh
You said thats she's one who helped you see
How deep your in love with me
And intentions were not to get in between
But I see possibilities

And you say that you feel
I'm the best thing in your life
And I know it's real I see it in your eyes
There's no reason for me, to even feel this way
I know you just enjoy her company

I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although (you say) she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

Ohohohoh
JD:
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
(x7)

Alicia:
It's enough to make a nigga go crazy

oh-oh-ho
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you
