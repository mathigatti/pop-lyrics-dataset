Yeah
Yeah, Imma up at Brooklyn
Now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro
But I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra
And since I made it here
I can make it anywhere
Yeah they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem
All of my dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway
Brought me back to that McDonalds
Took it to my stash spot
Five Sixty Stage street
Catch me in the kitchen like a simmons whipping pastry
Cruising down 8th street
Off white lexus
Driving so slow but BK is from Texas
Me I'm up at Bedsty
Home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on billboard
And I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sipping Malta
Sitting courtside Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga I be spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I most definitely from?

New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York

[Jay-Z]
I made you hot nigga
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit I made the yankee hat more famous than a yankee can
You should know I bleed Blue, but I ain't a crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walking with my click though
Welcome to the melting pot
Corners where we selling rocks
Afrika bambaataa shit
Home of the hip hop
Yellow cap, gypsy cap, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it aint fitted act like they forgot how to act
8 million stories out there and their naked
Cities is a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me I gotta plug a special and I got it made
If Jesus payin LeBron, I'm paying Dwayne Wade
3 dice Cee-lo
3 card Marley
Labor day parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king yo
I'm from the Empire State that's?

[Alicia Keys]

[Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding
Girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick
The side lines is blind with casualties
Who sipping life casually, then gradually become worse
Don't bite the apple Eve
Caught up in the in crowd
Now you're in style
And in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the cities filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip and now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city you're a Virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps better slip you a Ambien

[Alicia Keys]
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah
Come on, come on

In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York
