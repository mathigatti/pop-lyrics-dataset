These covers, may keep me warm at night
But they can't take your place, cause they never gonna hold me tight
And these pillows, may let me rest my head
But they cant say good night and tuck me in before I go to bed
Say now baby 'girl you're better off', that's what I'm telling myself
But I'm lying to myself cause I know I dont want nobody else


Cause these lips are missing you
Cause these lips aint kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms aint holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win

These candles light up my room at night
But they can't lid the room they way you did when you walked inside, oh baby
If these walls could sing about, everything they've witnessed
Oh it'd be a sad sad song, and it'll probably sound something like this

Say now baby girl 'you're better off', that's what I'm telling myself
But I'm lying to myself cause I know I dont want nobody else

Cause these lips are missing you
Cause these lips aint kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms aint holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win

Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over
When everything in this room reminds me of you
Everytime I think, I'm getting closer
Cause tears drown me out, once again I lose

Cause these lips are missing you
Cause these lips aint kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms aint holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win

Crying like oh oh oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
Crying like oh oh oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
