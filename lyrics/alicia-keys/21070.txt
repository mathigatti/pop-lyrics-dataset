I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right I guess I was wrong
Always thought you'd be by my side papa now you're gone


All I wanna know baby if what we had was good
How come you don't call me...
Anymore

Still like a fire on a rainy night
I still I like it better when your holding me tight
Everybody said...everybody said that we should never part
Tell me baby baby baby why...why you wanna go and break myheart

All I wanna know is baby if what we had was good
How come you don't call me...
Anymore

Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me papa
Ooh you got to try
Won't get down on my knees
Won't beg you please
Please

Won't you call me sometime papa
Why don't you call me back no more
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone
You know I don't like to be alone

How come you don't call me (I want you touchin me)
How come you don't call me
