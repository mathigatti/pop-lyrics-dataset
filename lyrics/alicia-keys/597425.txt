If this world were mine 
I would place at your feet 
All that i own 
You've been so good to me 
If this world were mine, oh 


I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees 
And with your love inside me 
That'll be all i need 
If this world were mine 
I'd be there to give you anything, oh

With wealth untold
