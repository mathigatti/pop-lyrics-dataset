Yes you are the one that broke my heart
But I don't want nobody else babe
I don't want nobody else baby but you


Yes you are the one who left these scars
But I don't want nobody else babe,
I don't want nobody else baby, but you

People say that I'm crazy bout you
They tell me I'll pay later
But I can't live without you
Mike told em it's human nature

Don't mind what they say about you
Baby don't sweat them haters
Broke my heart but you healed it too
To my every need you cater

Yes you are the one that broke my heart
But I don't want nobody else babe
I don't want nobody else baby but you

Yes you are the one who left these scars
But I don't want nobody else babe,
I don't want nobody else baby, but you
