[Jimmy Cozier]
Somethin' about the way you smiled at me just drove me wild
Wish I could know if your alone, don't wanna cramp you style
But I cannot deny the feel that I feel when I look straight intoyour eyes
Feel my heart beating fast for a challenge may arise


I wanna know if you feel the way I do (I do)
I wanna know if theres a chance for me and you (and you)
If theres no way, meet at the bar and you say can't (you can't)
Cuz I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be. I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr.Man,
Unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man, unfair

[Verse 2:]
[Alicia Keys]
Like they way you've given me attention through the nite
Maybe I've had too much remy my man's right by my side
Everytime I catch you watchin' me I feel somethin' down myspine
I play the game, it's just for fun and only for tonight

I wanna know what makes you feel the way you do (you do)
I think you hopin' theres a chance for me and you (and you)
Should I meet you at the bar and say we can't? (we can't)
If theres no way meet at the bar and you say can't (you can't)
Cuz I don't wanna be. I don't wanna be. I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr.Man,
Unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man,unfair to Mr.Man

[Bridge:]
[Alicia]
I know all you wanna know is answers
[Jimmy]
Cuz you could gimme what I need
[Alicia]
We both know that we're attracted
Should we let our desires lead?

I wanna know if you feel the way I do (I do)
I wanna know if theres a chance for me and you (and you)
If theres no way, meet at the bar and say you can't (you can't)
Cuz I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be. I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr.Man,
Unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man, unfair

I wanna know what makes you feel the way you do (you do)
I think you hopin' theres a chance for me and you (and you)
Should I meet you at the bar and say you can't? (we can't)
If theres no way meet at the bar and youn say can't (you can't)
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr.Man,
Unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man,unfair to Mr.Man
