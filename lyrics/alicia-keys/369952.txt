Alicia Keys - Stolen Moments

Remembering the days when our love began
Thinkin of a million ways 
to escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and i
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights


Dream about you 
i keep dreaming about you
when im dreaming about with you
im dreaming about what you would say

chorus
let me take you to another place
where nothing ever seems to matter
its just you and me
we can take flight like a thief in the night
stolen moments with you (o0ohhh o0o0oh)

Verse 2
Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)
I was just a girl and you a young man
how could age define
something so divine (so divine)
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind

Dream about you 
I keep dreaming about you
when im dreaming about with you
im dreaming about what you would say

chorus

piano breakdown

Dream about you 
i keep dreaming about you
when im dreamin and waiting for the day
when noone and nothing else takes up our time
finally you're only mine

each and everyday
i dont walk with you right by my side
but instead we have to hide
sneak around and lie 
just to spend time alone
This lovin is a crime 
i'd rather do the time
and leave the world behind

chorus

piano breakdown 2

Let's get away 
Let's get away
oooh ooh

we can get away 
we can get away
ohhh ohhh

Let's get away 
Let's get away
ohhh ohhh

we can get away 
we can get away
ohhh ohhh
