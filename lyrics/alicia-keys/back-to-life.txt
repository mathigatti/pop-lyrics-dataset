I'm just tryna hold onto to a dream...
(Out here lost and nothing's what it seems)
I'm just tryna find where I belong
This must be the dark before the dawn
When the place that you were born is not where you belong
Tell me baby, what stops you from wearing a crown?
I wanna be somebody, be somebody
And I wanna go somewhere, go somewhere...


Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, baby
Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, baby
Back to life, life, I been waiting for all of my life
Back to life, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmhmmhmm

Climb out from the bottom baby
No more looking back only straight up
Foot on the pedal baby, it's time to find what you're made of
Everybody wants to be adored
You don't have to settle for being enough

Back to life, back to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Back to life

I'm not made to be locked up
If a bird don't fly, then what were wings made for?
Oh, I'm not meant to be locked up
And if I don't try, then what was I made for?

Back to life, back to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Back to life

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

(Hey, hey, hey)
