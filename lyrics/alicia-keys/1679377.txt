Came across a picture of us today
Reminded me of how we used to play
And all of my kiss blew in the wind
Felt like those days would never end


Now the hardest thing to learn
You were never really gone away
I'll see you again
I'll see you again some day

When I climb the stairs
And I meet you there
'Cus love don't go nowhere
And you will see me
March up each step
Till I reach
Heaven's door

Can't wait to see your face
Save me a place
Your love can't be replaced
And you will see me
March up each step
Till I reach
Heaven's door
Heaven's door

Feel your warm hands against my face
Show me how you love me almost every day
Never to tired to fix up a meal
Never to tired just to make me feel better
These memories will live with me forever

Now the hardest thing to learn
You were never really gone away
I'll see you again
I'll see you again some day

When I climb the stairs
And I meet you there
'Cus love don't go nowhere
And you will see me
March up each step
Till I reach
Heaven's door

Can't wait to see your face
Save me a place
Your love will never be replaced
And you will see me
March up each step
Till I reach
Heaven's door

Say woah ooh
Woah ooh
Everybody say woah ooh
Woah ooh
Heaven's door

Say woah ooh
Woah ooh
Everybody say woah ooh
Woah ooh
Heaven's door
