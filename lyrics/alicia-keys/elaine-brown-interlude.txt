Can I do one more really quick?
So he said blow black mother, black mother
He always announce the title black mother
This is rap, this is hip hop, this is all that, from the street


How you from the street?
Black mother and I must confess
That I still breath but you are not yet complete
What could justify my prying?
Stop forgive my coward's hard for blame me [?] while we sleeping a deep-deep
And I be days and days and fight especially for my hair, black mother
I [?] you [?] rapes, heart aches, sweat, and tears
But I wear on siege night, dark and gloom, a rose I wear to honor you
And when I follow rose in hand
You will be free and amen for slave of [?] can't balance out the two damn flies
I'd rather be without the shame
A bullet lodged within my brain, black mother
