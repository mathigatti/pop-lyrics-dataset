I keep on falling
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Loving you darling
Makes me so confused


I keep on falling
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

Oh, oh , I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure?
And 'cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start falling back in love with you

I keep on falling
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

Oh baby
I, I, I, I'm falling
I, I, I, I'm falling
Fall

I keep on falling
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

I keep on falling
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

I keep on falling
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

What?
