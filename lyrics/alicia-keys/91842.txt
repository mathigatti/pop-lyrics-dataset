I don't wanna do this over and over 
He's a man so full of style and grace 
Any woman being impressed 
Takes a smile and paints it on your face 
Makes you feel like you've been blessed 
Promises things so special 
Seems to come right from a song 
Soon as you begin to feel secure 
Turn around and he is gone 
Packing his bags, gotta go, gotta go 
Packing his bags, gotta go 
He's a Samsonite Man 
Maybe he is just a rollin stone 
Wandering from here to there 
Searching for a place to call his home 
Wonder if he even cares 
So many years of heartache and pain 
That's all you seem to know him for 
Is it you, or is it he to blame? 
Whenever he walks out your door 
Packing his bags, gotta go, gotta go 
Packing his bags, gotta go 
He's a Samsonite Man 
Where you're always running to, away from me 
If the wind blows you in my direction 
You'd come through the rendezvous 
Forget about your good attention 
Leave me lonely and confused 
Mr.Samsonite pack a bag 
That is my suggestion 
From here on out you will be leaving 
My discretion yeah 
So I know the game baby 
And it will never be the same (no no no no no) 
cause now I got him 
Packing his bags, gotta go, gotta go 
Packing his bags, gotta go, gotta go 
Packing his bags, gotta go, gotta go (Now you gotta go) 
Packing his bags, gotta go (I can't take it no more) 
Packing his bags, gotta go, gotta go (What do I love him for) 
Packing his bags,gotta go 
He's a Samsonite Man 
Why don't you just go 
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, woah woah yeah yeah 
You can't hurt me no more baby 
You can't touch me 
You can't hurt me no more baby 
Gotta go, gotta go 


Pack your bag, pack it up 
Gotta go, hit the road Jack 
You ain't gotta go home, but you can get the hell outta here
