I want a sunday kind of love
A love to last past saturday night
And i'd like to know it's more than love at first sight
And i want a sunday kind of love
Oh yeah yeah


I want a a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody
Someone to care
And i'm on a lonely road that leads to no where
I need a sunday kind of love

I do my sunday dreaming, oh yeah
And all my sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day

Oh i'm hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms need someone
Someone to enfold
To keep me warm when mondays and tuesdays grow cold
Love for all my life to have and to hold
Oh and i want a sunday kind of love
Oh yeah yeah yeah

I don't want a monday, tuesday, or wednesday, or thursday, friday or saturday
Oh nothing but sunday oh yea
I want a sunday sunday
I want a sunday kind of love
Oh yeah
Sunday, sunday, sunday kind of love
