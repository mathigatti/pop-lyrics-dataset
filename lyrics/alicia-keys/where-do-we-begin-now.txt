What they're gonna do 'cause we're the same sex?
And weâ€™re spending all this time
This could be the love we ain't made yet
Even though it's on my mind
We ain't even had a conversation
But do you wanna testify?


How will I know this love is strong?
How would it tells when it goes wrong?

Where do we begin now?
Where do we begin now?
What will we tell our friends now?

I had a dream about you last night
Then it kinda blow my mind
All I really know is that it feels right
And I gotta live my life
We ain't even had a conversation
Let me be the first to testify

How will I know this love is strong?
How would it tells when it goes wrong?

Where do we begin now?
Where do we begin now?
What will we tell our friends now?

I'm gonna let you know, gonna let you know
I'm gonna let you know
I'm gonna let you know, gonna let you know
I'm gonna let you know
