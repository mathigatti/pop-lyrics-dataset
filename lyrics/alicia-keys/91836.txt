You used to be my closest alli 
In this cold, cold world of deception and lies 
We would defend and protect one another 
Now I can't tell if we're enemies or lovers 
So who's gonna rescue us from ourselves 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
Baby,(wake up) it's time for loving 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
My baby,(wake up)before it's too late 


Oh baby 
Where did we go wrong, baby 
Did this cold, cold world turn us into stone 
Well 
Now all I battle 
Is your ego and your pride 
It's ticking like a time bomb 
Ready to ignite 
Hurt me to fight 
So who's gonna rescue us from ourselves 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
Baby,(wake up) it's time for loving 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
My baby,(wake up) before it's too late 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
Baby,(wake up) it's time for loving 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
My baby,(wake up) before it's too late 

When the smoke clears 
What will be left for us but tears and pain 
Why must we argue over the same things 
Just to make up and go back again 
It's never too late 
Living to long 
Can't get it right when no one thinks they're wrong 
Gotta get out of bed 
And take a look at what's going on 

Oh when we gonna wake up (wake up) 
Baby,(wake up)it's time for loving 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
My baby,(wake up)before it's too late 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
Baby,(wake up) it's time for loving 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
My baby,(wake up) before it's too late 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
Baby,(wake up)it's time for loving 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
My Baby, before it's too late 

Oh baby (wake up) 
Oh darling (wake up) 
When we gonna wake up (wake up) 
When we gonna take a look and see (wake up) 
What's going on (wake up) 
Oh what's going on (wake up) 
Seems we're wasting so much time (wake up) 
And we're about to lose it all (wake up) 
Oh baby baby baby (wake up) 
Said I need you baby 
Oh I need my baby home (wake up) 
Bring my baby back to me (wake up) 
Oh baby baby baby (wake up) 
Oh oh (wake up)
