Let's talk about the situation
Bout how you came with information
That's negative in every which way
Just dissin my man and our relations
You say he's cheatin, want me to leave him
I've changed my mind I think I'll keep him
Listenin to you will leave me lonely
That's not what I'm tryin to be

Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go,
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no.
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no

How bout you explain what thats all about
Think you slick like I wouldn't know
But I got something for you

Mess around end up in a choke
Hoe
Girl I think it's time for you to
Go
Away from my man and me
If that's the way  it's gonna be

Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go,
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no.
Just crazy to let my man go,
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no

I love my man
He loves me more
He may not be the perfect man
But I don't plan to let him go for
Jane Doe

Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go,
And let some other Jane Doe

And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no.
