Come on, uh
You know


We gotta pray
We gotta pray

We gotta pray, pray for the world tonight (hmm, hmm)
We gotta save somebody, save somebody tonight (hmm, hmm)

Fire in the air
What the hell goin' on?
Sirens everywhere, singin' that street song
Violence everywhere, barely holdin' on

What the hell goin' on?
Do you know who you are?
Do you know who we are?

We, we're extraordinary people (eh, eh)
Livin' an ordinary life (eh, eh)
One extraordinary question (eh, eh)
Are we gonna run or fight?
So we gotta pray

Pray for the love tonight (hmm, hmm)
End of the day, pray for another try (hmm, hmm)

Smoke is in the sky
What the hell goin' on?
Bullets gonna fly, hot right from the gun
Tryin' not to cry, barely holdin' on

What the hell goin' on?
Do you know who you are?
Do you know who we are?

We, we're extraordinary people (eh, eh)
Livin' an ordinary life (eh, eh)
One extraordinary question (eh, eh)
Are we gonna live or die?

So we gotta pray (hmm, hmm)
We gotta pray (oh, oh)
We gotta pray (hmm, hmm)
We gotta pray (oh, oh)
We gotta pray
