Guess I'm caught up everyday
Tryin' to keep it all together
While the time just slips away
See I know nothing lasts forever


Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There'd be no limit to my sorrow
So all I can say

I wanna tell you something
Give you something
Show you in so many ways
Cuz it would all mean nothing
If I don't say something
Before it all goes away

Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour
Let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something
Show you something
Won't wait 'till it's too late

I can't wait, I can't wait
I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
I can't wait, I can't wait
I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
I won't wait 'till it's too late

Just a simple conversation (..sation)
Just a moment is all it takes (yeah, yeah)
I wanna be there just to listen (I wanna be here)
And I don't wanna hesitate (oh, no)

Imagine there was no tomorrow (imagine)
Imagine that I couldn't see your face (your face)
There'd be no limit to my sorrow (oh, no)
Cuz there is nothing that can fill this space

I don't wanna put it off for too long (too long)
I didn't say all that I had to say (say)
I wanna take the time to right the wrongs
Before we get to the play (oh)

I wanna tell you something
Give you something
Show you in so many ways
Cuz it would all mean nothing
If I don't say something
Before it all goes away

Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour
Let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something
Show you something
Won't wait 'till it's too late

Just lean on my shoulder
It's not over 'till it's over
Don't worry 'bout it
Cuz I'm gonna make sure
I'm gonna get stronger, yeah

I don't wanna wait until the storm
There's something wrong
And now you're gone
And I can't find ya

I wanna tell you something
Give you something
Show you in so many ways
Cuz it would all mean nothing
If I don't say something
Before it all goes away

Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour
Let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something
Show you something
Won't wait 'till it's too late

I wanna tell you something
Give you something
Show you in so many ways
Cuz it would all mean nothing
If I don't say something
Before it all goes away

Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour
Let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something
Show you something
Won't wait 'till it's too late

I can't wait, I can't wait
I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
(I won't wait 'till it's too late)
I can't wait, I can't wait
I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
(No, no, won't wait, no, no)
I can't wait, I can't wait
I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
(I won't late 'till it's too late)
I can't wait, I can't wait
I won't wait, I don't wanna wait

No, no, no, no, no
No, no
I can't wait, I won't wait
No, no...
