Uh come on, yes
(What y'all know about that?
shit's hard)


If I could breathe underwater
Every fish would walk on land
If I could fly in the sky baby
Then wings would be on me
If words could move mountains
If I could swim the ocean without drownin'
If there was pain without hurtin'
Then the impossible has been found

'Cause baby we can do more than we know, more than we know
And baby, baby, oh, there's more than we know, more than we know

Yeah, yeah, if I could moonwalk on the moon
I would glide to you baby
I'd go to war like a platoon
I'd be right there on the front lines
No broken promises in the Promise Land
Let's let freedom set us free again

'Cause baby we can do more than we know, more than we know
And baby, baby, oh, there's more than we know, more than we know

Uh, yeah, uh
See if we just stayed on the ground
Then we would never see the stars
And if you're too afraid to walk in faith
Then you will never know your heart
And if we just stayed on the corner
Then we would never see the world
'Cause baby there's no fate that you can't create

'Cause baby we can do more than we know, more than we know
And baby, baby, oh, there's more than we know, more than we know
Baby we can do more than we know, more than we know
(Yeah darlin')
'Cause baby, baby, oh, there's more than we know, more than we know

If we can believe baby
Do you believe it baby
Do you believe in me darlin'?
(More than we know)
Do you trust in me baby?
When I tell you we can do it
Let me show you we can do it

We can go
(More than we know)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(More than we know)
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, hey, hey, put 'em back up around
Hey, hey, hey
More than we know
'Cause baby we can do more than we know
