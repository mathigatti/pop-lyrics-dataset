Goodbye / Never Can Say Goodbye


[Goodbye]


but how do I let go when I've
loved him for so long and I've
givin him all that I could
maybe love is a hopeless crime
giving up what seems your lifetime
what went wrong with something once so good?

chorus:

how do you find the words to say
to say goodbye
(find the words to say…)
when your heart don't have the heart to say
to say goodbye…


[Never Can Say Goodbye]

Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, I
Never can say goodbye

Everywhere I think I had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
That pushes me right to the core
It says turn around you fool
You know you love her more and more


Tell me why
Is it so
I Can't let you go


Never can say goodbye boy, oh ohh
Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, uhhh…
Never can say goodbye boy, oh ohh
Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, I can't say goodbye
