I already know how to touch you, I already know
Because you gotta always add on
You can't bring, can't just do what was done

We elevate, by elevation

Like the gods is like, yeah
Yeah, yeah
(Wow I think that's a really dope perspective)
She was risen when I was telling her stuff, oh I can go on too
