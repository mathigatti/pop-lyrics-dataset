He broke my heart
And now it's raining, just don't rub it in
I'm at your door
I feel so crazy 'bout it


You'll say, "I told you so"
You saw it long ago
You knew he had to go
I finally came around
I'm back on solid ground
Can't let it get me down
Now

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright (it's alright)

It's alright (yeah)
It's alright (yeah)
It's alright
It's alright

Yes, I was burned
But I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I called it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

Sometimes some lies
Can take a minute to fully realize
His tears, your eyes
30 Seconds to apoligize

You give it one more chance
Just like the time before
But he already know
You'd give a hundred more

Until that night in bed
You wake up in a sweat
You're racing to the door
Can't take it anymore

I was burned
But I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I called it lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

A life perfect ain't perfect
If you don't know what the struggles for
Falling down ain't falling down
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called "the past" 'cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before
You oughta see me now

Yes, I was burned
But I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I called it lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

Said, yes, I was burned
But I called it a lesson learned
Said, mistake overturned
So I called it lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
