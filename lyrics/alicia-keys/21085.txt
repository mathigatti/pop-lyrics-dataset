Feels like the world is closin on me
Feels like my dreams will never come to me
I keep on slippin deeper into myself
And i'm scared, so scared


Chorus
If your troubled,
You just gotta let it go
If your worried, baby,
You just gotta let it go
All your hustlers aint' for nothin,
You just gotta take it slow
If you need me baby,
All you do is let it go

Why does it feel
That my mind is constantly tryin
To pull me down?
I can't seem to get away
Continuous mistakes I know i've made before
How long will i feel so out of place?
