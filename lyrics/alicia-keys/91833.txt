Ayo Mo Bee 
Drop it on me 
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah 
let's do it like this 
uh 


If I was you woman 
And you were my man 
You'd have no other woman 
You'd be weak as a lamb 
If you had the strenght 
To walk out my door 
My love would over rule my sense 
And I'd call you back for more 

If I was your woman 
(If I was your woman) 
If I was your woman 
(If I was your woman) 
And you were my man 

Yeah 
She tears you down Darling 
Says you're nothing at all 
But I'll pick you up Darling 
When she lets you fall, 'cause 
You're like a diamond 
But she treats you like glass 
Yet you beg her to love you 
But me you won't ask 

If I were your woman 
(If I was your woman) 
If I were your woman 
(If I was your woman) 
If I was your woman 
Here's what I'd do 
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you 

Yeah 
Life is so crazy 
And love is unkind 
Because she was first darling 
Will she hang on your mind 
You're a part of me 
But you don't even know it 
I'm what you need 
But I'm too afraid to show it 

If I were your woman 
(If I was your woman) 
If I were your woman 
(If I was your woman) 
If I was your woman 
Here's what I'd do 
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you 

If I were your woman 
Here's what I'd do 
I'd never, never, never stop loving you 

Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 

[Lloyd Banks:] 

If I were your woman 
And you were my man 
If I were your woman 
And you were my man 
If I were your woman 
Here's what I'd do 
I'd never, never, no, no, stop lovin' you 
If I were your woman
