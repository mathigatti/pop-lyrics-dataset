Who really cares? 
Who really cares? 
When I talk? 
What I feel? 
What I say? 
Nobody not really 


Who wants to take 
The time to understand 
I would like someone to hear me with some empathy 
But I can't findâ€¦ 
Nobody not really 

Maybe I'm invisible to the world 
Does anyone in the world even think of me? 
As more than just a hopeless cause 
Maybe the world is not my block 

My stoop 
My life 
My dreams 
My anything, anything 

Who wants to help? 
Mama, but she's so tired 
Papa, but you're not here 
I'm alone in a big empty space with 
Nobody not really
