[Intro]
Out in the streets, they call it murder!


[Verse 1]
Welcome to Jamrock, camp where the thugs dem camp at
Two pound ah weed inna van back
It inna your hand bag, your knapsack, it inna your back pack
The smell ah give your girlfriend contact
Some bwoy nuh know dis, dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals ah nuh Backtoo, the thugs dem will do whe dem got to
And won't think twice to shot yu
Don't make dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bare tuff tings come at you

When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block-off traffic
Then dem wheel and pop off and dem start clap it
With the pin file dung an it ah beat rapid
Police come inna jeep and dem cant stop it
Some say them ah playboy ah playboy rabbit
Funny man ah get dropped like a bad habit
So nuh bodah pose tuff if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone!

[Chorus]
Welcome to Jamrock, Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the streets, they call it murder!

[Verse 2]
Welcome to Jamdown, poor people ah dead at random
Political violence, can't done! Pure ghost and phantom, the youth
dem get blind by stardom
Now the Kings Of Kings ah call
Old man to Pickney, so wave unnuh hand if you with me
To see the sufferation sick me
Dem suit no fit me, to win election dem trick we 
Then dem don't do nuttin at all

C'mon let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And Most ah de youths them waste it
And when dem waste it, that's when dem take the guns replace it
Then dem don't stand a chance at all
And that's why ah nuff little youth have up some fat 'matic
With the extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And ah a bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who nah lock glocks, ah dem a lock rocket
They will full you up ah current like ah shock socket
Dem a run ah roadback which part the cops block it
And from now till a mornin nuh stop clock it
If dem run outta rounds ah bruck back ratchet

[Chorus]
Welcome to Jamrock (Southside, Northside)
Welcome to Jamrock (East Coast, West Coast, huh, yo)
Welcome to Jamrock (Cornwall, Middlesex and Surrey, Yah) Hey!
Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the streets, they call it murder!!!

[Outro]
Jamaica Jamaica! Jamaica Jamaica! Now!
Jamaica Jamaica! Yo! Jamaica Jamaica!
Welcome to Jamrock, Welcome to Jamrock
