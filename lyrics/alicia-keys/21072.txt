Right now I feel like a bird
Caged without a key
Everyone comes to stare at me
With so much joy and revelry


They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile I cry
They don't know what they're doin' to me
Keeping me from flyin'

That's why I say that
I know why the caged bird sings
Only joy comes from song
She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free
So she can
Fly, fly, fly
Spreadin her wings and her song
Let her
Fly, fly fly
For the whole world to see

She's like a caged bird
Fly, fly
Ooh shoulda let her fly
shoulda let her fly
Shoulda let her fly

Spread wings
Spread beauty
