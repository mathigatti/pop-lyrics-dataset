Let's go back in time
When seeing your ID on mine
Made me crazy
Ooh baby I'm saying


Let's go back there (go back there)
Let's take it there (take it there)
I'm talking 'bout
Back in time
When you wanted to know my every move
Tired to keep it smooth
Keepin' up with me
You drove me crazy oh baby

Let's go back there (go back there)
Let's take it there (take it there)

When you
Didn't know me
Didn't need me
Wanted to touch me
Couldn't leave me
I couldn't know how
Far it would go
I couldn't know if
This was for sure
We just could not
We just could not get enough of it baby , let's go

Chorus
Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That off the wall "won't stop till I get enough" kind of love
I need that love
So baby, let's go

Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That "I don't really care
We can have it anywhere"
Kind of love
That wreckless love

Let's go back in time
When our kiss was brand new
An adventure not perfected
A little hesitant

Let's go back there (go back there)
Let's take it there (take it there)

Take it back in time
When forever was a minute, and eternity was a second
I'm stressing that we have to go back there (go back there)
Let's take it there. (take it there)

When you
Didn't know me
Didn't need me
I wanted to touch me
Couldn't leave me
I couldn't know how
Far it would go
I couldn't know if
This was for sure
We just could not
We just could not get enough of it baby , let's go

Chorus
Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That off the wall "won't stop ti'l I get enough" kind of love
I need that love
So baby, let's go

Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That "I don't really care
We can have it anywhere"
Kind of love
That wreckless love

Ooh baby, let's go

Chorus
Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That off the wall "won't stop ti'l I get enough" kind of love
I need that love
So baby, let's go

Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That "I don't really care
We can have it anywhere"
Kind of love
That wreckless love
