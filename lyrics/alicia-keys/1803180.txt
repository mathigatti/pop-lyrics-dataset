EVE:
Hey yeah, in the mornings when I rise up
Go to the window and I smile with my eyes up
Staring at clouds like "Wow, Look at my luck!"
Every day I'm feeling better cause I know I got the best I can be proud of
We came for quit
Remember when I used to tell my girls like
Yo this dude
Think he's all yeah,
Think he's so fly
And hates how you try to talk to me
I'm like you're don't even dare a try
I was on my solo groove,
I ain't want none it,
I ain't need none it
Man, I'm good
Now I'm speechless,
Cause I fell for it
The poet in me died cause I fell for it

Chorus:
I'm just speechless, baby

I used to write all the poetry
But now you take my breath away,
