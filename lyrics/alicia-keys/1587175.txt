Tryna keep my feet on the ground
But my head is in the clouds
Love's so hard to find
But you know that it's on my mind


Got me in a days
I know I'm hung up to this place
But it's too good to deny
I close my eyes and I fly

Come to me, run to me
I'm dreaming that you come to me, baby

Even when I'm up all day
When I sleep at night
Baby, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Baby, I'm dreaming

Tryna keep my feet on the ground
But the feeling knocks me down
I feel so overwhelmed
I'm under your spell

Tryna keep coming, stay strong
But that don't last too long
But it's too good to deny
Oh, so I close my eyes and I fly

Come to me, run to me
I'm praying that you come to me, baby

Even when I'm up all day
When I sleep at night
Baby, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Baby, I'm dreaming
