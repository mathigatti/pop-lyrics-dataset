Ooh baby
There's somethin I gotta tell ya
Pain that you should know
What's on my mind
Ooh, baby
I'm feeling our situation
It's getting stronger
And we on it
I gotta take my time


See there's so much about you
That I want to explore
Phisical attraction
We just can't ignore it
But before we go too far
Across the line
Gotta really make sure
That I'm sure
Umm

Slow down, babe
Let's take our time
Slow down, babe
If you don't mind (baby, slow down)
Slow down, babe
Before we make this move
Slow down, babe (before we make this move)
Baby, slow down
(I think it's really too soon)

Ooh, baby
It's like I known you forever
My medulla oblongata
Is electrified
Ooh, baby
Whenever we're alone together
I'm bout to explode
And it feels so right
I gotta take my time

See there's so much about you
That I want to explore
Phisical attraction, we just
Can't ignore it
But before we go too far
Across the line
Gotta really make sure
That I'm sure
Oh

Slow down, babe
Let's take our time (slow down, baby)
Slow down babe (slow down, baby)
If you don't mind (baby, slow down)
Slow down babe
Before we make this move
Slow down, babe (before we make this move)
Baby, slow down
(Baby, it's really too soon
Soon, yeah)

See I know what is best
Cause I been here before
Gave myself to someone
For all the wrong reasons
But this time around
I don't wanna do that again
I just wanna make this the way
That I've dreamed of
So, baby, you got to

Slow down, babe
Let's take our time
Slow down, babe
If you don't mind (baby, slow down)
Slow down, babe
Before we make this move
Slow down, babe (before we make this move)
Baby, slow down
(I think it's really too soon)

Slow down
You got to slow down
You got to slow down
Baby slow down
You got to slow down
You got to slow down
You've got to slow down
