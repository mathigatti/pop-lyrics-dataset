When you're gone it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?


(Yeah)

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Am I addicted
When I need you here all the time?
And I'm not sure if this is healthy
Is it a sickness?
'Cuz I feel like I'm losing my mind

And I know that there's no medicine
Nothing I can take, no remedy
Baby please stay

(Ohohoohh)
When you're gone it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease (my disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

Oh oh oh baby, baby, baby
I get a fever
Just the thought of you leaving my side
Ohohhhh
And I'm not the same 'til you're back holding me
That's all I need

(Oh yeah)
When you're gone it feels like (when you're gone baby)
My whole worlds gone with you (gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease (my disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you

Woah woah
Here's what I'm going through when you're gone
Some serious symptoms of withdrawal
(Ohohoh)
So sick of turning in my bed
Waking up drenched in a cold sweat
(Ohohoh)
Lying here lonely for you
What am I supposed to do
When I'm stuck and I can't get enough of your lovvvee

Ohohoh woahhh Baby

When you're gone it feels like (when you're gone baby)
My whole world's gone with you (gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease (my disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?
