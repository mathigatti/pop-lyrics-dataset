I look into the mirror
And see a different girl
Hiding from herself with
Not a care in the world
Her smile pretends to fool


Those she chooses to please
If they could only see the tears she cries for help
See, I have been that girl
Didn’t know which way to turn
Then one day I turned to me

I told myself to wake up
It’s gonna be a brighter day
I just have to believe that

My dreams won’t have to wait
At times I’ve lost my mind
Had to look deep inside
And find a way to get over

Had to swallow my pride
I searched the world for and answer
But I’ve been searching too far
Because I’ve been here all alongchorus:
I’m here to make a statement
My place I’m here to claim it
Don’t tell me what my name is

I know
I’m gonna make it
I’ve come to far to lose it
Gotta stay focused
And find a better mefeels like forever
Trying to work it out

Sometimes you’re gonna fail
And you know
Sometime it will rain
But the sun will come

When you think it’s all said and done
You know you see the light
And everything is alright
You can do
Whatever you put your mind to
Cause you’re all that you need

Like I do just believe
You’re here to make a statement
You’re place you’re here to claim it
You know just what your name is
No go

You’re gonna make it
You’ve come to far to lose it
Gotta stay focused
And find a better me
