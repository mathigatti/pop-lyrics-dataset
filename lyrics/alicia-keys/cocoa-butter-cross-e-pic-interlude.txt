Cocoa butter
You're supposed to put cocoa butter on your whole body


[Man 2]
Listen I'm talking to remove something that you're insecure about
But listen man, are you insecure about anything on you? No
But there's women that's insecure about stretch mark

[Alicia]
You insecure about something, what you insecure about?
Now you gon' have to share

[Man 2]
My chipped tooth
I'm insecure about this bunion I got on my foot
Women are insecure about stretch marks, that's why they hide 'em
That's why they say stretch marks are your beauty scars
You just say, you wanna hit someone
Is you gonna hit, the joint you put me on one time was beautiful
Which joint I put you on?
Listen, but her stomach was a prune but I still kissed her

[Man 1]
Hold up, listen, listen
This is the thing
If you kissed her stomach and you cut your lip
