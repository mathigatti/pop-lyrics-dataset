Some call me a loser, some call me a cheater
Some say i'm a selfish untalented dreamer
'cause all's i try to do is keep my dream alive
But it's so hard to do when your working 9 to 5
I've never been one afraid to die but i'm afraid to leave behind
The precious life that grows through the sands of time
'cause now i've got two daughters and i know they need their father
To help them make it through all of the devious things that people do
'cause every moment counts from the good times to the bad
I don't have time to envy those that got things i've never had
'cause the one thing most important is the one we take for granted
And until your life is on that line i think it's the way god had planned it
To open up your eyes and make you realize
That to some life is money but what's money without life
'cause all's i need is the air that i breathe
And my friends and family to believe in me
As deep as the abyss where the waters run
As deep as the land of the rising sun
You know i'm down
And even when them odds are against us
It doesn't even matter nothing else matters
As deep as the abyss where the waters run
As deep as the land of the rising sun
You know i'm down
And even when them odds are against us
It doesn't even matter nothing else matters
We bleed the same blood, we cry the same tears
We have the same fears, we pass the same years
We see the same stars under the same skies
We pass the same time, we all live and die
'cause friends and family wash thicker than blood
And if ya' never felt love than i feel for you
'cause lives pass above us in 747's
Deceased dwell below us before they go to heaven
Everything in between will hassle me
Some stay connected while other keep dreaming
Looking for that meaning but the lost can't be found
Drop to your caps and pray now can ya' hear the sound?
Do ya' feel it? now do ya' feel it comin'?
Two triple zero the hunters are the hunted
Electrical currents conflict with the spirits
Ah do ya' hear it ah or do ya' feel it?
Deep like seven leagues life intrigues intelligence
Got no time for clutter, you're late if there's hesitance
Put your foot forward and there will be a helping hand
Take a step back and your stuck in the quick sand
Ingesting toxins keeps us locked in, a mental jail trap
'99 where's your family at
Oh, and i might fail oh, i might succeed
Whatever the outcome is just keep your faith in me
Just believe in me and i will be there
As deep as the abyss where the waters run
As deep as the land of the rising sun
You know i'm down
And even when them odds are against us
It doesn't even matter nothing else matters
As deep as the abyss where the waters run
As deep as the land of the rising sun
You know i'm down
And even when them odds are against us
It doesn't even matter nothing else matters
As deep as the abyss where the waters run
As deep as the land of the rising sun
You know i'm down
And even when them odds are against us
It doesn't even matter nothing else matters
Doesn't even matter nothing else matters
