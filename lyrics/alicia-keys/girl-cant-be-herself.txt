When a girl can't be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can't be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world


In the morning from the minute that I wake up
What if I don't want to put on all that make up?
Who says I must conceal what I'm made of?
Maybe all this Maybelline is covering my self-esteem

Whose job is it to straighten out my curves?
I'm so tired of that image, that's my word
What if today I don't feel like putting heels on?
Who are you to criticize when beauty's only in the eyes

Of the beholder, so behold her
Sing, sing, sing, why, oh, oh, oh, why, oh?

When a girl can't be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can't be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world

Uh, uh, I'm so secure with insecurities
Why is being unique such an impurity?
Why are the numbers on the scale like a God to me?
All of these indifferences are based on our appearances

We please to be appeased
The truest pleasure is the fact that we can breathe
Think it into existence, do it, then achieve
A fairy tale reality, beauty was with a beast

Uh, uh, uh, you're the image of my reflection
Ah, ah, ah, I'm the image of my reflection
Sing, sing, sing, why, oh, oh, oh, why, oh?

When a girl can't be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can't be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
