Let me tell you a little story

Grandma, used to say nothing before it was time
Used to say that the world would be mine
So I should just have faith
She showed me, all I need in this life is for free
Change is one thing that is guaranteed
So I should just keep pace


So I marched on like the soldier in the story
Long the way I met a guy named Glory
He went to my head
I said

Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you now more than ever
Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you, feeling you
I feel the power
I feel the power
I feel the power
I want the power

Strong will
Long the road met a girl named Doubt
Wrapped in my mind, couldn't get her out
No matter how I tried it
And somewhere she introduced me to a friend named Fear
Thought I would never get the hell out of here
I had to say goodbye

So I marched on like the soldier in the story
Long the way I met a guy named Glory
He went to my head
I said

Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you now more than ever
Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you, feeling you
I feel the power
I feel the power
I feel the power
I got the power
I feel the power

You wanna feel invincible?
If you wanna victorious
If you wanna feel this way
Let me hear you say

Power
Say power
Say power
Say power

I said

Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you now more than ever
Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you, feeling you

I said
Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you now more than ever
Oh baby, got to know you better
I'm feeling you, feeling you
