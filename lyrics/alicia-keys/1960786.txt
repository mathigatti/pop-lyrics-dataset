I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better


You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be allright

People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is
Everything's gonna be allright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel
For you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright

People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is
Everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel
For you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

I know, some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know, people will try
Try to divide something so real
So 'till the end of time
I'm telling you
That no one

No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

Oh oh oh
