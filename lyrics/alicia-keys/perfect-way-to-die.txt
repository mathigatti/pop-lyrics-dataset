Simple walk to the corner store
Mama never thought she would be gettin' a call from the coroner
Said her son's been gunned down, been gunned down
Can you come now?
Tears in her eyes? Can you calm down?
Please, ma'am, can you calm down?


But it rained fire in the city that day, they say
A river of blood in the streets
No love in the streets
And then came silence in the city that day, they say
Just another one gone
And they tell her move on

And she's stuck there, singing
Baby, don't you close your eyes
'Cause this could be our final time
And you know I'm horrible at saying goodbye
And I think of all you could have done
At least you'll stay forever young
I guess you picked the perfect way to die
Oh, I guess you picked the perfect way to die

New job, new city, new her
Bright-eyed, you would have been proud if you knew her
Flashing lights in the mirror, pull over, pull over
A couple nights in detention and it's over, a whole life's over

They came marching in the city that day, they say
Carryin' signs in the street
Cryin' eyes in the streets
But they heard nothing from the city that day, they say
Just another one gone
And the city moved on

We're stuck here singing
Baby, don't you close your eyes
'Cause this could be our final time
And you know I'm horrible at saying goodbye
I'll think of all you coulda done
At least you'll stay forever young
I guess you picked the perfect way to die
Oh, I guess you picked the perfect way to die

Another dream lost
Another king and queen lost
Another broken promise they refuse to make right
Oh, another night to live in fear
Oh, another night that you're not here
Another reason to get out there and fight

But I said: Baby, don't you close your eyes
'Cause this could be our final time
And you know I'm horrible at saying goodbye
But I'll think of all you coulda done
At least you'll stay forever young
I guess you picked the perfect way to die
Oh, I guess you picked the perfect way
