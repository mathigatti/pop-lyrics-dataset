If I was your woman 
And you were my man 
You'd have no other woman 
You'd be weak as a lamb 
If you had the strenght to walk out my door 
My love would over-rule my sense 
And I'd call you back for more 
If I was your woman 
If I was your woman 
And you were my man  


She tears you down darlin 
Says you're nothin at all
But I'll pick you up darlin 
When she lets you fall 
'Cause you're like a diamond 
But she treats you like glass, yes she does 
Yet you beg her to love you 
For me you won't ask 
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
If I was your woman

Life is so crazy 
And love is unkind
Because she was first darlin 
Will she hang on your mind? 
You're a part of me 
But you don't even know it 
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it
If I was your 
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
I got be, I got be
Your, your woman
If I was your woman
Here's what I'd do 
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
