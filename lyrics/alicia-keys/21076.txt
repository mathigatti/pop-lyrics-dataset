There will never come a day,
You will never hear me say,
That I want or need to be without you.


I wanna give my all.

Baby just hold me,
Simply control me,
Because your arms, they keep away the lonely.

When I look into your eyes,
Then I realize,
All I need is you in my life,
All I need is you in my life.

Cause I never felt this way about lovin',
No,
Never felt so good, baby
Never felt this way about lovin,
it feels so good.
