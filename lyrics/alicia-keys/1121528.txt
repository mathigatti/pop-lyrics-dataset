Na na na na noooo
No noooo noooo
Na na na na noooo
No noooo noooo


The sand loves when..the waves come
The sky can't wait...for the light of the sun
So how could you...look me in my eye
And not see what what i feel inside
Tell me how could youuuu... doubt the fact that I
I love you...
I love you

Don't you ever...be like that.
Don't you ever...never do that.
There will never be two things that go together better
Than you and me....

North needs south east needs west...
No needs yes yes yes
Up needs down life needs death...
No needs yes yes yes

I need you
I need you
I need you
You...I need you
No noooo noooo

So how could you...look me in my eye
And not see what what i feel inside
Tell me how could youuuu... doubt the fact that I
I love you...
I love you

Don't you ever...be like that.
Don't you ever...never do that.
There will never be two things...that go together better
Than you and me....

North needs south east needs west...
No needs yes yes yessss
Up needs down life needs death...
No needs yes yes yessss

I need you
Oh baby I need you
No noooo noooo
Everyday..I need you
Na na na na noooo
You...I need you
No noooo noooo
Hey hey Heyyyy
I need youuu
No noooo noooo
Hey hey heyyyyy
Like the desert needs the rain
Like joy needs pain
