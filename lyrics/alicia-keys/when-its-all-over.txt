And it feels so good
Don't you feel so good?
Talk to me


Hey, i never been this good, not ever, not ever
Never seen this part of me
I know that nothing last forever, however
Oh, i'm not worried about tomorrow
Cause tomorrow may not come
And where my heart take me i follow, you gotta follow

When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how i spent my life
At least i got to love you, when it's all over
When it's all said and done, when it's all over
At least i got to love you, at least i got to love you

Hey, ask when i wanna leave
A lifelong legacy, me loving you and you loving me
Oh, i'm not worried about tomorrow, tomorrow
All i know, all the time we have is borrowed, i feel no sorrow

When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how i spent my life
At least i got to love you, when it's all over
When it's all said and done, when it's all over
At least i got to love you, at least i got to love you

Everybody say hey hey hey hey...

If i do nothing else, oh
If i do nothing else, oh
At least i got to love you, oh yeah
At least i got to love you, tell 'em baby

If i do nothing else, oh
Don't gotta do nothing else, oh oh
At least i got to love you, hey
At least i got to love you

Everybody say hey hey hey hey...
Everybody say hey hey hey hey...
