I'm in my 7 deuce callis with the slap in the back
With the slap in the back, with the slap in the back
I got that black top Impala with the frames blue back
With the frames blue back, with the frames blue
I got that black top Impala with the frames blue back
Could you loan me a dollar, bitch I can't do that
Got a flight in an hour, got my bags all packed
Bring it in for the huddle of hundred and fifty racks, pow!
Want me to take it to the club and throw it on the ground
Instead I take it buy bindess make it double now
I'm back in biness, you pussy niggas in trouble now
What you gonna take the city, clearly you are from out of town
I'm in my scraper, catching paper on the turf
Stacking yaper like a laker, hit exactly where it hurts
Better put that shit in reverse, you might cross over the ledge
The king of the castle, swinging, screaming off with they heads
Round up in regal, your rathets mad cause they giving us action
Fuck em you keep em we mack em
Don't need them nigga, what's happening?
what is it, let's get it cracking
Millions and millions reacting
Focus no longer distracted
Put it down let's see you mash it


[Hook]
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
Stacking money to the ceiling getting paid all day, all day, all day
All day, all day, all day
If you ain't tryina get it, better get up out the way
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsty.com/xzibit-up-out-the-way-lyrics.html ]
Then you walk in the sleep and drag
Now the people's on fire, let the motherfucker burn
The... came in here when it was my turn
Everyone up in here spazzy, loud and hippy
Perking hella pissy, everybody tipsy, feeling heck trippy
My wrist real brisky, icey, bitch main niggas don't like me
Cause they wife on me to pipe shit
But only since 1990
Body, booming, I'll be, tycooning
Me and a few of my goonsing
Alcohol consuming
Wanna raise in the grip, well fin to sneak upon you
Try to hit you for a hit
Better pack an extra clip, cause niggas ain't playing
They really with the shit
All in, like rallying, I should... pimp styling
All I hear is money calling
Thous on thous on thous on thousands
Blacklands... real talk player, no...
All about my allowance,... sheesh
Capisci, I'm heavy all in these streets
You have see, front seats
No family man we fit

[Hook]
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
Stacking money to the ceiling getting paid all day, all day, all day
All day, all day, all day
If you ain't tryina get it, better get up out the way

Let's get whatever you drinking and drink it by the case
Then let me pound on your pussy and knock it out of place
I wanna hook and book you, have you some time to face
While we vacating the destination for motivation, hey
Separate hunneds from fifties, fold it up, bring it all with me
Call it an audible hit me, I'm open, never forget me
Down shift, punching, approaching the hunned and sixty
I'm crawling like... bouncing up round the city
Pity you feeling shitty, it's 25 to life for this pushing this spiker
Get anybody hit by a sniper
Live the rest of your life in a diaper
Chill the fuck out, or you can walk, keep walking
Or niggas will carry you out
This is the end of the drought
Homies is bouncing around me, too many zeros to count
I let these women surround me, jump out they clothes to come out
But then they never can found me, holding the holy amounts
Already showed you to rock,

[Hook]
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
Stacking money to the ceiling getting paid all day, all day, all day
All day, all day, all day
If you ain't tryina get it, better get up out the way.
