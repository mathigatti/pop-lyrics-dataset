Have you ever wanna fly?
Have you ever wanna run away?
Have you ever closed your eyes, seen a vision and it took you away
Wonder why in my dreams lookin up the sky is so blue
In the jungle I'm feelin so free where dreams do come true


So come on, let's fly away
Like zebras and airplanes
Runnin so free through the night
Fire through the sky away
Like zebras and airplanes

Have you ever wanna gallop through the wind where water meets the sand?
If you ever wanna feel like this then come take my hand
Through the paint on the canvass and it cover up your emotion
Now's the time, take a chance, make a wish, let your fantasy begin

So come on, let's fly away
Like zebras and airplanes
Runnin so free through the night
Fire through the sky away
Like zebras and airplanes

What do zebras and airplanes mean?
They say zebras running free through the night
Airplanes fly high through the sky
And that can be you and I

So come on, let's fly away
Like zebras and airplanes
Runnin so free through the night
Fire through the sky away
Like zebras and airplanes
