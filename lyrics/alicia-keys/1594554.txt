Some people they call me crazy
For falling in love with you
Well they can take me and lock me away, baby
Cause there's nothing those boss can't do


I'll be the rising moon after the set of sun
Just to let you know you'll always have someone
I'll be the clearest day when the rain is done
So you'll always know

To the shake of an earthquake, I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like the shiver to the storm we can risk it all
That's how strong my love is

I used to feel kinda lonely
Cause the world it can be so fake
And all the matter I'm telling you is you and me on late
And the fortunes from love we make

I'll be the water you need in a desert land
Just to let you know you'll always have my hand
I'll be the woman you need to feel a better man
So you'll always know

To the shake of an earthquake, I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like the shieve to the storm we can risk it all
That's how strong my love is

Oh, can't ever bring us down
Oh, cause we are heaven bound
Like the mountain stand
And star and moon above are here to stay
Oh, can't nothing get in the way

To the shake of an earthquake, I will never fall
(I will never fall)
That's how strong my love is
(That's how strong my love, my love is)
Like the shieve to the storm we can risk it all
(We can risk it all)
That's how strong my love is

Through the deepest waters I won't let you drown
That's how strong my love is
(oh, that's how strong my love is)
To the long in the sky I will never come down
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
