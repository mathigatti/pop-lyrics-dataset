They’re dashing and daring,
Courageous and caring,
Faithful and friendly,
With stories to share.
They march through the forest,
They sing out in chorus,
Marching along,


Gummi bears,
Bouncing here and there and everywhere.
High adventure that’s beyond compare,
They are the gummi bears.

Well, magic and mystery,
Are part of their history,
Along with the secret,
Of gummiberry juice.
Their legend is growing,
They take pride in knowing,
They’ll do what is right,
With whatever they do.

Gummi bears,
Bouncing here and there and everywhere.
High adventure that’s beyond compare,
They are the gummi bears.
They are the gummi bears!
