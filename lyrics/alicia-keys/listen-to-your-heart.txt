He says have no fear
Open up let me in
He says take a chance
Here's your song time to dance


What you gonna do when it comes for you, oh

Listen to your heart, oh
You gotta listen to your heart
Listen to your heart, oh
Why don't you listen to your heart

He says, here's your sky
Don't look down, we can fly
You say, you're a little bit scared
Just hold on, we're almost there

What you gonna do when it comes for you, oh

Listen to your heart, oh
You gotta listen to your heart
Listen to your heart, oh
Why don't you listen to your heart

You never know until you try
Why so scared when hearts don't lie
Turn off the world and close your eyes
Lose yourself and listen to your heart, oh

Why don't you listen to your heart
Listen to your heart, oh
Why don't you listen to your heart, hey

You know what to do when it comes for you, oh

You gotta listen baby
Gotta listen baby
Gotta listen baby
Gotta listen baby
gotta listen to it
Ah, can't you hear it?
Gotta listen baby, hmmn
