There’s a hole in my heart I’ve been hiding
I’ve been strong for so long that I’m blind
Is there a place I can go where the lonely river flows?
Where fear ends and faith begins


Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I’ve been praying but I’m paying for my sins
Won’t you give me a sign if I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in

Every step makes me think that I’m closer
But somehow I just haven’t arrived
When our hope disappears, please protect me from my fears
I need you right by my side

Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I’ve been praying but I’m paying for my sins
Won’t you give me a sign if I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in

Woah, woah, hallelujah
Woah, woah, hallelujah
All the places I’ve been
Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in

Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah

Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in
Woah, hallelujah, let me in
Woah, hallelujah, let me in
