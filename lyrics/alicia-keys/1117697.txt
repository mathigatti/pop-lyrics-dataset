I'm a black magic woman
I'm a black magic woman
I'm a black magic woman
Got you so blind you can't see
I'm a black magic woman
And I'm trying get a devil out of me


Don't turn your back on me baby
Don't turn your back on me baby
Yes don't turn your back on me baby
Stop messing 'round with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me baby
You just might pick up my magic sticks

I've got my spell on you baby
I've got my spell on you baby
I've got my spell on you baby
Ohh
See you need me so bad baby
You can't leave me alone

Yeah hey hey
