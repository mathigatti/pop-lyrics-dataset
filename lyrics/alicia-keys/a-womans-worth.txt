Ooooohhh uummmm
Tell you about a woman tonight
Tell you 'bout a woman uummmm


You can buy me diamonds and buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
A dozen roses cause I'm your girl
And you know I'm worth it (uh huh) I'm worth it
Dinners lit by candles under the sun
Run my bubble bath cause I'm the one
You want to love so tenderly
And you know I'm worth it (say what) I'm worth it

Wanna please wanna keep wanna treat your woman (her)
Right, right
Not just know but to show that you know she is worth your
Time, time
You will loose if you choose to refuse to put her
First, first
She will find a man who know her
Worths
Ooooohhh

To all my real woman throw yo hands up
All my real man wave yo hands
So if you feel me then clap your hands
If your worth it, worth it

To all my real woman throw yo hands up
All my real man wave yo hands
All my people who understands
Represent yo woman, yo woman, yo woman
Yo woman, yo woman's worth

If you treat me fairely I'll give you my goods
Show you all the things no one else would
Treat you like a real woman should
Cause I know you're worth it (say what) you're worth it
If you never play cause I thought you love
I promise you can't get enough
I'll hold you down when it gets rough
Cause I know you're worth it (say what) you're worth it

He walks the mile but he smile otherwhile be
True, true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for
You, you
If you choose to loose you refuse to put her
First, first
She will find a man who know her
Worths
