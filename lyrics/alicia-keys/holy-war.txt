If war is holy and sex is obscene
Then we got it twisted in this lucid dream
Baptized in boundaries, schooled in sin
Divided by difference, sexuality and skin


So we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked in
We can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked

Maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
Maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war

What if sex was holy and war was obscene
And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
Living for love, unafraid of the end
Forgiveness is the only real revenge

So we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, yourself open
We can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, yourself open

Maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
Maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war

What if love is holy and hate is obscene
We should give life to this beautiful dream
Cause peace and love ain't so far
If we nurse our wounds before they scar
Nurse our wounds before they scar
