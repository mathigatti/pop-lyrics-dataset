[Alicia]
Hey baby how you doing tonight
I wanna let you know
I wanna tell you just how I feel
I wanna love you baby
And it's going so right
I wanna burn a candle
Turn the darkness to the light

With the fire we make
It's getting hotter and hotter
Like a moth to a flame
I can't stay away
From the fire we make
It's getting higher and higher
Like the night to the day
I can't stay away
No no no
stay away

[Maxwell]
Hi baby, won't you tell me the truth
You wanna be the one
You can't stay away
Oh, hey darling
Don't you make no excuse
We can chase this on
And burn the hole inside you

With the fire we make
It's getting hotter and hotter
Like a moth to a flame
I can't stay away
From the fire we make
It's getting higher and higher
Like the night to the day
I can't stay, I can't stay away

[Alicia and Maxwell]
This invisible bullet and it takes us to the stars
It's getting higher and higher
It's the fire we make, (it's the fire we make)
Getting sweeter and sweeter
Like a night to a day
(About to make up this flame)
I can't stay away, say is, no no (yeah)
No no no, No no no, Can't stay away (Can't stay)
No no no (Oh you can't)
No no no (Baby baby baby)

I just wanna stay with you
I can't be done
I just can't stay away
I wanna make some much fire with you baby
I wanna go, gonna go to you darling, ah
