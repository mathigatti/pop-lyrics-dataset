[Verse I:]

If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength
To walk out my door
My love would over rule my sense
And I'd call you back for more


[Chorus:]

If I was your woman
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
And you were my man, yeah

[Verse II:]

She tears you down darlin
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up darlin
When she lets you fall cause
You're like a diamond
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me you won't ask

[Chorus:]

If I were your woman
If I was your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never no no
Stop loving you, yeah

[Verse III:]

Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she was first darlin'
Will she hang on your mind?
You're part of me
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it

[Chorus:]

If I were your woman
If I was your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never no no
Stop loving you, yeah
If I was your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, never
Stop loving you, yeah

[Bridge:]

If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
If I were your woman
