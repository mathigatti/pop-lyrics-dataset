(Missy Elliot)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Misdemeanor on the flow, pretty boy here I come
Pumps in the bunk make you wanna hurt something
I can take your man I don't have to sex em
Hang em out the window call me Micheal Jackson (hehehee!)
I'm a pain in your rectum, I am that bitch y'all slept on
Heavy hitter, rhyme spitter, call me Re-Run
Hey hey hey, I'm what's happ'nin
Now to get my drink (that's right!)
Shake ya ass till it stink (that's right!)
Mr. Mos' on the beat (that's right!)
Put it down for the streets (that's right!)
c'mon
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Come on pass the dutch!

(CHORUS)
