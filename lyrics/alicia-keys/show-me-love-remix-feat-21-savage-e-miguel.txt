When you walk in the house, show me love (21)
It ain't even gotta be Valentine's Day
I'ma still leave some roses by the tub (on God)
Gone through so much in the street
I just wanna go home to a meal and a hug (straight up)
The opps wanna kill me, you wanna argue
I sleep in the trap and just thug (I swear)
But I'd rather you show me some love (21)
I'd rather you show me it's real (real)
I'd rather you tell me your feelings
Than act like I'm trippin' and high on a pill (on God)
Don't say that you're crazy in love with me
'Cause being crazy could lead you to kill (fo' sure)
And money ain't nothing, there's people who happy in love
And behind on they bill (21)
And they haven't paid they mortgage in years (on God)
Let me help you fight your fears
Can't turn my back
When my grandma died, man, you helped me wipe my tears (21)
Cold-hearted when I opened up
Man, your love, was that a bear? (Too late)
By the time you realized, it was PTSD
You ain't even cared (damn, you ain't even care)
