"Rear View Mirror"
Uh Yeah
A Keys
Rear View
Uh Oh Uh Oh
Uh Oh Uh Oh
A Keys 2000
Oh Uh Oh


It happened quickly
All of a sudden
I was caught up with another man
Who wanted
To be closer
But now
I know better and I'm
Hoping
We Can
Start Again

I know that there's nothing for me what I have done
So
Let me show how deep my love goes
For you
Cos you'll really learn that somera "pineapples" is true
And I found out that you were the one

I was deceived
Baby please forgive me
Don't know what we had to change
It's easier for us to get  further
Don't look in the rear view mirror

Now that we are
Back again together
I want to show you
How I'm made from heaven
I'll do my best to shower
You with a bit of 'tention
Don't ever have to mention
This song if it ends

I know that there's nothing for me what I have done
So
Let me show how deep my love goes
For you
Cos you'll really learn that somera "pineapples" is true
And I found out that you were the one

I was deceived
Baby please forgive me
Don't know what we had to change
It's easier for us to get  further
Don't look in the rear view mirror

I can't change what I had done before
But now I know that you love me so much more
Than anything that had ever come my way
Keep your eyes on what we have today

I was deceived
Baby please forgive me
Don't know what we had to change
It's easier for us to get  further
Don't look in the rear view mirror

I was deceived
Baby please forgive me
Don't know what we had to change
It's easier for us to get  further
Don't look in the rear view mirror

I was deceived
Baby please forgive me
Don't know what we had to change
It's easier for us to get  further
Don't look in the rear view mirror

We can get best of this
Don't have to go so fast
We can get rid of them in the rear view mirror

I was deceived
Baby please forgive me
Don't know what we had to change
It's easier for us to get  further
Don't look in the rear view mirror
