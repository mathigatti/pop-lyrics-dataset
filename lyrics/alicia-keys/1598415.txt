In the morning when you wake
When I wanna face today and all your heartache
Thinking how much can you take
Please don't ever loose a faith and don't fall under


In a world that seems to get colder &amp; colder
Don't you worry cuz
My love will only get stronger &amp; stronger

[Chorus]
Cuz I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all
Through it all

Don't think about the past, don't worry bout the future
Just live in the moment
Long as there's another day here will be another way
A chance to make it through

In a world that seems to get colder &amp; colder
Don't you worry cuz
My love will only get stronger &amp; stronger

[Chorus]
Cuz I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all

When you're down and out
Loosing dignity
Don't let go of me (hold on)
Surely there's is a brighter day right in front of me (hold on)
If you really looked inside
You would finally realise
You don't have to cry (no more)
All you have to do is see
That you can beleive in me
And I will never leave

Cuz I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all
