Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even in the bottom of the sea
I can still hear inside my head
Telling me, touch me, feel me
And all the time you were telling me lies


So tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold onto the times that we had
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart
Well you can try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, own me, nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown, you make my body feel heaven-bound
Why don't you hold me, need me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me

Looking in the sky I can see your face
And i knew right where I'd fit in
Take me, make me
You know that I'll always be in love with you
Right til the end

So tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold onto the times that we had
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could have told you right from the start
It's bout fall apart
So rather than hold onto a broken dream
Or just hold onto love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold onto the times that we had
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
