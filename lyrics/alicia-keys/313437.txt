We could fight like Ike and Tina
Or give back like Bill and Camille
Be rich like Oprah and Steadman
Or instead struggle like Flow and James Evans
'Cause he ain't no different from you
And she ain't no different from me
So we got to live our dreams
Like the people on TV

We gotta stay tuned
'Cause there's more to see (Unbreakable)
Through the technical difficulties (Unbreakable)
We might have to take a break
But you'll know we'll be back next week
I'm singing this love is unbreakable
Oh yeah yeah...

Clap your hands everybody
Lets do it like this, come on!

All in the family like the Jacksons (like the Jacksons)
And have enough kids to make a band like Joe and Catherine, yeah

And he ain't no different from you
So we got to live our dreams
Like the people on TV

We gotta stay tuned
'Cause there's more to see (Unbreakable)
