Broken Promises 
My Heart you stole 
Lies you told 
Got the best of me,
Digging in my heart of gold (Hey) 
Used to look at you and see the possibilities (yeah) 
I see you for who you are 
Boy you've dissapointed me 

I thought you gave me love 
Was never near enough 
Soon enough time revealed 
The weight of what is real 

Know all I need to know (Can I know it) 
Boy see you gotta go (I gott) 
What have you given me (Hey) 
But lies (lies) lies (Hey) 

Go ahead, go home and get up, outta here 
Go ahead baby 
You knew... you was wrong 
you knew... all along 
must be crazy 
If you think 
I'm fall.. for this anymore 

Everybody say noo noo noo noo 
Everybody say noo noo noo noo noo noo noo 

Used to believe in every word you said 
Clouds my head (hey) 
Leavin' me here to drown 
Hopes and dreams 
Therefore dead 
You point your finger tryna justify 
Your mistakes (you can not justify) 
Oh changes gon be made 
so you best be on your way 

I thought you gave me love 
Was never near enough 
Soon enough time revealed 
The weight of what is real 

Know all I need to know (yeah) 
Boy see you gotta go (yeah) 
What have you given me (Hey) 
But lies (lies) lies (Hey) 

Go ahead, go home and get up, outta here 
Go ahead baby 
You knew you was wrong 
you knew all along 
must be crazy 
If you think 
I'm fall, for this anymore 

Everybody say nooo noo noo noo 
Everybody say nooo noo noo noo noo noo noo 

No need to apologize 
Don't try to make it right 
I know, I shoulda known better 
When you took hold, I was sold 
Using fear to control 
Now it unfolds 
Lemme tell you right now what I'm gonna do 
Made up my mind this time and I'm through with you 
Nothing you can say or can do can make me change my mind 
so just 

Go ahead, go home and get up, outta here (ohhh yeah) 
Go ahead baby (ohh yeah) 
You knew you was wrong (oh yeah) 
you knew all along 
must be crazy (ohh yeah) 
If you think 
I'm fall, for this anymore (oh yeah) 

Everybody say noo noo noo noo (ohhh yeah) 
Everybody say noo noo noo noo noo noo noo (oh yeah yeah yeah)
