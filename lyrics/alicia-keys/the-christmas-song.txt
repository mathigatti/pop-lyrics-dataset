You know you can't help but
But feel good when you hear this song
Yeah, uh


Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yule tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes on the glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mothers child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from 1 to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways

Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you
You, you, you, you, yeah
Ah yeah
If I ain't got you with me, baby
Yeah, I need you, need you this Christmas
Well, well, I need you
