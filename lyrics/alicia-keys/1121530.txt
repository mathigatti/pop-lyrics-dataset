We're at the crossroads, my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
Oh, I know I'm gonna miss you either way
It's such a lonely road


Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears
Oh

When I cry your name
Am I calling in vain?
Oh, and am I waiting only to drown in pain?
Oh, Don't you do it
No, said don't you leave me this way

I don't know
If I can lift my head and face another day
Oh, it's such a lonely road

Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears

Usually not the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
Who could this be? Staring at me
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
Way too far gone, to find my way home

Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears
Uh...
