Here I am
And I been thinking about you lately
Hold my hand
Cause I been missing you like crazy


[Bridge]
Don't wanna go all night,
Every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh (Do it Right)
Do me Right
Come and hold me tight, we dont need to fight
Wanna spend my life with you, every night
Cause baby..

[Chorus]
This bed
Is too lonely without you (Baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you
Please be beside me
These king size sheets
Need more than just a queen
in between 'em
This bed
Is too lonely without you

So why dont we
Go inside where we can be together
You, me, morning, any day
Wanna be with you forever

[Bridge]
Don't wanna go all night,
Every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh (Do it Right)
Do me Right
Come and hold me tight, we dont need to fight
Wanna spend my life with you, every night
Oh baby..

[Chorus]
This bed
Is too lonely without you (Baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you
Please be beside me
These king size sheets
Need more than just a queen
in between 'em
This bed
Is too lonely without you

[Talking]
You know when it starts to get late
And its time to go to sleep, I
I dont know what to do
Cause i dont wanna hold my pillow
I wanna hold you

[Bridge]
Don't wanna go all night,
Every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh (Do it Right)
Do me Right
Come and hold me tight, we dont need to fight
Wanna spend my life with you, every night
Oh baby..

[Chorus]
This bed
Is too lonely without you (Baby..baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you (I
Please be beside me
These king size sheets
Need more than just a queen
in between 'em
This bed
Is too lonely without you (Too lonely)
