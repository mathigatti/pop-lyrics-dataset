(Jimmy Cozier)
Something about the way you smiled at me just drove me wild
Wish I could know if your alone, don't wanna crap your style
But I cannot deny the feel that I feel when I look straight through your eyes
Feel my heart beating fast for her challenge may you try


I wanna know if you feel the way I do (I do)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you (and you)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and you say you can't (You can't)
Cuz I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be. I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr. Man, Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr. Man, unfair

(Alicia Keys)
Like the way you've given me attention through the night
Maybe I've had too much Remy, my man's right by my side
Every time I catch you watchin' me, feel somethin' down my spine
I play the game; it's just for fun and only for tonight

I wanna know what makes you feel the way you do (You do)
I think you're hopin' there's a chance for me and you (and you)
Should I meet you at the bar and say we can't? (We can't)
Cuz I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man, unfair toMr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man

(Alicia)
I know all you wanna know is answers
(Jimmy)
Cuz you could give me what I need
You could give me everything I need
(Alicia &amp; Jimmy)
We both know that we're attracted
Should we let our desires lead?

I wanna know if you feel the way I do (I do)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you (and you)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't (youcan't)
Cuz I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr.Man, Unfair to Mr.Man, unfair toMr.Man, unfair

I wanna know if you feel the way I do (I do)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you (and you)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't (youcan't)
Cuz I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man

I wanna know if you feel the way I do (I do)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you (and you)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't (youcan't)
Cuz I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
