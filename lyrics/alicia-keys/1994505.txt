When you walk through a storm
Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of a storm is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark


Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Tho' your dreams
Be tossed and blown
Walk on
Walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

(Alicia's version)
I'm talking about
You and me, me and you
We got to stay together
No no
I won't let you
I won't leave you out there
In the cold
Oh no no
You will never never never walk alone
