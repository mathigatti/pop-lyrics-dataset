War is over
If you want it
War is over
Now


So this is christmas
And what have you done
Another year over
And new one just begun
And so this is christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear one
The older and the young
A very merry christmas
And a happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
And so this is christmas (war is over...)
For weak and for strong (...if you want it)
The rich and the poor one
The world is so wrong
And so happy christmas
For black and for white
For the yellow and red one
Let's stop all the fight
A very merry christmas
And a happy new year
Lets hope it's a good one
Without any fear
And so this is christmas
And what have we done
Another year over
And new one just begun...
And so happy christmas
We hope you have fun
The near and the dear one
The older and the young
A very merry christmas
And a happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
War is over
If you want it
War is over
Now
