Lately when I look into your eyes
You're the only one I need in my life
Baby I just don't know how to describe
How lovely you make me feel inside


You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies

This seemed like the likely thing
From the start you told me I would be your queen
But never had I imagined such a feeling
joy is what you bring
I want to give you everything

You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control these butterflies
You and I
Are destiny
I know now
You were made for me

Ohhh oooo
I can't control it
It's driving me
Taking over me and I want….

You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies

You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control, I can't control it
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies

You give me something I just can't deny
Something that is so real
I just can't control the way I feel
Oh no oh no oh no oh no
You give me something that I just can't deny
Something that is so real
I just can't control the way I feel
Ohh I never felt like this…
