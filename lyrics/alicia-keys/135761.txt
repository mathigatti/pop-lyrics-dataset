Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial


Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, Yeah

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Soy solo para ti
Y nada me hace feliz
Si no estas tu baby
Si faltas tu baby
No quiero mas variedad
Si ya, no se de nadie mas
El mundo es un vacio
Si me faltas tu tu tu

Soy solo para ti
Y nada me hace feliz
Si no estas tu baby
Si faltas tu baby
No quiero mas variedad
Si ya, no se de nadie mas
Y el mundo es un vacio
Si me faltas tu
Yeah

If I ain't got you with me baby
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby
