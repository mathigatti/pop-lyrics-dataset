Theres no escape from the spell you have laid
deep in my heart in my mind
foolish am i if i was to try
to ever leave you behind


Chorus:
i wanna rock wit u
(come give me all your love)
no matter what we do
(i wanna rock wit u)
with you and only you
(i wanna rock wit u)
i wanna rock wit u
(rock wit u babe)

ill stay and walk this life with you
no matter what we may go through
dead broke no job, no house, no ride
im gonna stay right by your side
mm-hmm

Chorus:
i wanna rock wit u
(come give me all your love)
no matter what we do
(i wanna rock wit u)
with you and only you
(with you and only you)
i wanna rock wit u
(rock wit u baby, baby)

don't question where
your headed to my love
dont be afraid
just believe in love

Chorus:
i wanna rock wit u
no matter what we do
with you and only you
i wanna rock wit u

i wanna rock wit u
(rock wit u babe)
no matter what we do
(i wanna rock wit u babe)
with you and only you
(wanna rock wit u babe)
i wanna rock wit u
(wanna rock wit u babe)
