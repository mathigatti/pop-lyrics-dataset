To me it seems like Christmas is lost
'Cuz it's not about celebrating anymore
It's just about giving to receive
And the illest thing to me about the little drummer boy
Or the little drummer girl in my case, I mean
Is that all that Shorty had was her drum, that's it
And through her drum, she gave Jesus her soul
There ain't no amount of riches that could ever amount to that
You know what I'm sayin'?


Ba dee ah, ba dee ah
Come on, they told me
A new born king to see
Our finest gifts we bring to lay before the king
So here we come

Oh, ra pum pum pum pum
Baby Jesus, I am a poor girl too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a king
Shall I play for you on my drum?

Mary nodded
The excellent kept time
I played my drum for Him
I played my best for Him
Then he smiled at me, me and my drum
Me and my drum

Rum pum pum pum
Pa rum pum pum pum
Pa rum pum pum pum (oh yeah)
Pa rum pum pum pum (oh)
Pa rum pum pum pum
Pa rum pum pum pum (come on they told me)
Pa rum pum pum pum (a new born king to see)
Pa rum pum pum pum (can I play my drum for him)
Pa rum pum pum pum
