She wakes up early in the morning just to do hair ,’cause it’s a new her
She just wanna live her life, tryin’ to find her freedom
Been looking for her freedom
She may not see the light ,but she wants it ,she wants it
As she stares herself in the mirror


Brand new me, brand new
Something new over due
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram

She from the block now she rollin
She got her own and she rollin
She on her own and she’s rollin
She’s a brand new girl and she’s rollin

They try hard not to care about her own mess , they got their own mess
But none of this is for you, ’cause this is her life , permit her to apologize
She found a brand new me as she stares herself in the mirror

Brand new me, brand new
Something new over due
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram

She from the block now she rollin
She got her own and she rollin
She on her own and she’s rollin
She’s a brand new girl and she’s rollin

In my sleep I see a pagan reaching for me
You took a long road to get here, it took a brave girl for trying
She’s just like you and me ’cause she wants it, she wants it
As she stares herself in the mirror,

Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Brand new me, brand new
Something new over due
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram
Tadadii tadiram

She from the block now she rollin
She got her own and she rollin
She on her own and she’s rollin
She’s a brand new girl and she’s rollin

She’s brand new girl and she’s rollin
She’s brand new girl and she’s rollin
