If I gave you forever
Would you take care of me?
Would you take me for granted?
Unaware?


Those wonderful things that you do
They got me feelin'
In love wit chu
In love wit chu
That loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
Loving you is easy
Comes so naturally

I would give you laughter
Oh, And so much more than that
Oh, yes, I would
Anything you're after
I would climb the highest mountain
To bring it back
You'd better believe

Those wonderful things that you do
They got me feelin'
In love with you
In love with you
And loving you is easy
Comes so naturally
Loving you is easy
Comes so naturally

I will stay by your side
Whether I'm wrong
Whether I'm right
Oh, it's incredible
With you I intend to spend the rest of my life
Yeah hey yeah

Loving you is easy
Comes so, comes so naturally
Loving you is easy
Comes so, so...
It comes so naturally

Loving you is easy
Sooo easy
Loving you is easy
It's easy
It comes so naturally

Loving you is easy
Yeahhhh…
Loving you is easy
It comes so naturally

Loving you is easy…
