Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you're feeling
No one but me and you


I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away
Ooooh, baby, if there's anything that you fear [anything]
Call 489-4608 and I'll be here

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

Yeah
Hum, hum...
Yeah
You know why...

Only we know what is talked about, baby boy
I don't know how you can be drivin' me so crazy, boy
Baby, when you're in town why don't you come around, boy
I'll be the loyalty you need, you can trust me, boy
Oh...

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

Everybody say
Whoa (whoa)
Let me hear you say
Whoa (whoa)
Everybody say
Whoa (whoa)
Now sing it
Whoa (whoa)

Let me hear you say
I won't tell (I wont tell)
I won't tell (I wont tell)
I won't tell (I wont tell)
Your secrets, your secrets
Break it down, oh...

Secrets...
Secrets...
