Said I'd be gone by five
But it's sun rise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Me re-playing memories in my head


(Look at you, look at you)
Look what you made me do
How do you, how do you fake 'em with every move?
Who are you? Who are you? You look so familiar
I know you, I know you, baby, I know the truth

We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

We used to talk 'til midnight
All those days that you stayed at my house
We were just passing the time
When we were young and we ain't had no vows

Now, now, now maybe later on, I'll text you and maybe you'll reply
We both know we had no patience together day and night
Getting high on our supply, yeah, we ain't satisfied
I could love you all occasions

We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

Messed up too, messed up too
Just like you, just like you!
Messed up too, messed up too
Just like you, just like you!

We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me

(You must be messed up too)
