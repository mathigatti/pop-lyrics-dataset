Verse 1:
Like a damsel in distress
I'm stressin' you
My castle became a dungeon,
Coz I'm longin' for you (longin' for you babe)
Feelin' strong for you
Your my knight in shining armour
See your face in a silver moon
Oh, over the lagoon


Chorus:
And it feels like, dragon days
And the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot
Dragon days
I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
(and the days drag on and on)

Desperate for you baby
Do you know what that means?
(It means I feel like)
I feel like an addict must feel
When he fiends...
In an act of desperation
I get lost in my dreams
(Coz like a)
Lady in waiting, I'm waitin' for ya
(Like a) Like a kiss in time over alligator waters
(Waiting for my) claim to paradise to come and
To take me away
From these... (tick tock)

Chorus:
Dragon days
And the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot
Dragon days
I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
(and the days drag on and on)

Don't you wanna play?

Hook:
D-R-A-G-O-N days
Got me D-R-A-G-G-I-N
Coz I want you babe
And I need you baby

Chorus:
Dragon days
And the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot
(I need a lot, I need you so bad)
Dragon days
I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
(and the days drag on and on)

[Repeat chorus till end]
