Never felt this far from home
Never left a love so strong
Now the world is stuck on pause, yeah
Cause without you emotions go!
And i hope this don't sound wrong,
But the day seems twice long
And the pain just don't feel night, no
If it's mine alone

And maybe you sit at the window waiting
Maybe the days just repeat then rewind
Maybe the truth is the walls are caving in
You, say it, say it's so!
Say it, say it's so!
Say it, say it's so!

Now i walk through endless nights
That the street lights pass the time
And even though you're call don't come no way,

I still pray you're by the phone
And i know this don't sound right no
But i hope you hurt like i
Then i know you sympathize yea,
Your my peace of mind

And maybe you sit at the window waiting
Maybe the day just repeat then rewind
Maybe the truth is the walls are caving in
Say it, say it's so!
Say it, say it's so!
Say it, say it's so!
Say it, say it's so!
Say it, say it's so!

Oh baby, when you look at the ceiling, yeah, yeha
On your back before dreaming
Will i be last on your mind?
Oh baby, when i look at the ceiling, yeah
On my back after dreaming
You're the first thing on my mind!
Say what, say what, say what!
Uhuu!
Say what?
Say it, say it's so!
