Oh oh my goodness
I didn't know I was here
Do you know my name? (Can't go wrong when you try)
Always got to try
No matter how long that shit take
Yeah, yeah
Uh
Whatever stops you from dreamin'
Whatever trys to stop you from livin'
Flip it


Welcome home
Cause right now what I got to do is
I gotta amp myself up as well as you
So yea, so what it took me like
Maybe 2 years and shit
But I fell in prepared
You know what I'm sayin
And I'm feelin' a little more ready for the world
And less lost
As I once was

So come on
What u waitin' on?
Feel me, feel me, feel me
What, uh, yeah
What, uh, yeah
What?
