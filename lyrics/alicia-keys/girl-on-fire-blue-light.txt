She's just a girl, and she's
Hot like a flame, she's on fire
On fire, baby, on fire
Oh oh, yeah


Feels the catastrophe
She lives in a world that's on fire
On fire, baby, on fire
Oh oh, ooh

Oooh, she's got her feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oooh, she's got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
I'm a girl and I'm on fire

Like a match to a flame
Like a match to a flame
She's a match to a flame
I'm a flame

She looks like a girl, but she
She's really just a flame
You can try but you'll never
You'll never forget her
On fire
On fire, baby, on fire
Oh oh, yeah

She's so bright, she'll burn your eyes
Better look the other way
She's on the top of the world
Hottest of the hottest
On fire
On fire, baby, on fire
Oh oh

Oooh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oooh, we got our head in the clouds
And we're not backing down

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
I'm a girl and I'm on fire

Like a match to a flame
She's a girl and a flame
I'm a match to a flame
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
I'm a girl and I'm on fire

Yeah, yeah

Said, I'm a girl and I'm on fire
Like a match to a flame
I'm a girl and I'm on fire
Like a match to a flame
You know I am
You know what you see
Just like a match to a flame
