Weren't you the one who said, that you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space, and give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me
But still you said your love was gone, and that I had to leave


Now you're, talking 'bout a family
Now you're, saying I complete your dreams (Oh)
Now you're, sayin I'm your everything

You confusing me
What you saying to me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me.

'Cause... what goes around, comes around.
What goes up, must come down.
Now who's cryin, desirin to come back to me
What goes around, comes around.
What goes up, must come down.
Now who's cryin, desirin to come back

I remember when
I was sittin home alone
Waitin for you
Til 3 o'clock in the morn

And when you came home, you'd always have some sorry excuse.
Half explaining to me, like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I wanted just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me, you never come thru

Now you, wanna be up under me (eyyy)
Now you, have so much to say to me (heyy)
Now you, wanna make time for me
Whatcha doin to me.
You're confusin me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me.

'Cause... what goes around, comes around.
What goes up, must come down.
Now who's cryin, desirin to come back to me
What goes around, comes around.
What goes up, must come down.
Now who's cryin, desirin to come back

I remember when
I was sittin home alone
Waitin for you
Til 3 o'clock in the morn

Night after night
Knowing something goin on
Wasn't long before I be gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy, believe me.
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceived me.
And never do what you're supposed to do
No need to approach me fool, cuz I'm over you

'Cause... what goes around, comes around.
What goes up, must come down.
Now who's cryin, desirin to come back to me
What goes around, comes around.
What goes up, must come down.
Gotta stop trying, to come back to me

What goes around, comes around.
What goes up, must come down.
It's called Karma baby.
And it goes around.
What goes around, comes around,
What goes up, must comes down,
Now who's cryin, desirin to come back to me
