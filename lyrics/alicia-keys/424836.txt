You know...You know you may think, that, that you know you got
me under 
wraps...locks and keys...and that without you I just...I'm
gonna be lost...But I 
got something else for you 


Baby I used to sit home, waiting on your call 
I used to have your picture hanging on my wall 
Used to think you were right, but you was wrong 
I used to miss you, now I'm glad that you're gone 

Baby, I don't care if you don't wanna call me no morrrrre 
Baby I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more 

Cause I'm the Juiciest baaaby girl around 
And I got 999 men knockin down my door 
Cause I'm the Juiciest Baby Girl Around (baby girl baby girl) 
And I don't care if you don't call no more 

We used to light a fire on a rainy night 
I used to like it when you'd come and hold me tight 
I used to believe we would never part 
But now I've had a change of heart 

Baby I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more 
Baby I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more 

Cause I'm the Juiciest baby girl around (baby girl baby girl) 
And I got 999 men knockin down my door (cause they gotta have
sweet knocks) 
Cause I'm the Juiciest Baby Girl Around (baby ) 
And I don't care if you don't call no more 

Cause I'm the Juiciest baby girl around (Juicy) 
And I got 999 men knockin down my door 
Cause I'm the Juiciest Baby Girl Around ( and all my peoples
that's juicy I want you to say yeah) 
And I don't care if you don't call no more 

Cause I'm the Juiciest baby girl around 
And I got 999 men knockin down my door 
Cause I'm the Juiciest Baby Girl Around 
And I don't care if you don't call no more 

Baby I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more 
Baby I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more
