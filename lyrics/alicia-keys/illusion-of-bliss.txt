You know, right now I miss someone that I love
Or fell in love with
I don't wanna cry or nothing but
I'mma just get straight to the story
I'm a 29 year old addict


What would you know?
What would you do?
If you had no control over what you pursue?
Talk yourself, tell yourself, baby
"I'm better than this"
All that I'm fighting
I'm the one to resist

So I persist
Like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss
An illusion of bliss
So I persist
Like a bottomless kiss
An iIllusion of bliss
An iIllusion of bliss

Hey, living in prison of blood and flesh
An easy way out is this high, I confess
So watcha lookin' at
What do you wanna see
You can't save me, baby
I don't wanna it no way

So I persist
Like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss
An illusion of bliss
So I persist
Like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss

Is it my life?
Ain't no easy road
I don't know which way to go
Won't somebody see me when I can't see myself
Won't somebody listen before I need help
I'm sick of being judged
I'm sing of being sick
Sick of being high, sick of being low
Sick of all the lies putting on the show
So I persist

So I persist
Like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss
An illusion of bliss

I don't wanna be a fallen angel
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm gone, gone
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm lost, lost

I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm gone, gone
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm lost, lost
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
