Marble in a foyer
I've been lovin' on you all day
Would've stayed if you told me to stay
As you can see, I stayed anyway


I'm just not like these other girls, I swear
I just have to love you
I just wanna need you if that's okay
And you're just not like these other men out here, no, no
You just wanna hold me, and that's okay

Can I be a woman for you, baby
In a time when it's not allowed?
How am I supposed to pretend
That I don't want you the way I do? (Oh, yeah)

'Cause every time you're around me
I feel virgin all over again
And every time you're all around me
How can I renege? Boy, I just need your hand

Is it okay that I'm not independent?
Is it okay that I
Is it okay that I show weakness?
Is it okay that I
Is it okay that I can't wait to see you?
Is it okay that I
Is it okay to love a man right now?

If you understand
Then show me your hands (ooh, ooh)
Show me your hands
Boy, if you understand
Somebody raise a man (ooh, ooh)
Raise a man

I've never been treated a way I didn't wanna be treated
It's hard to explain, I know it's hard to believe
I want what's comin' to me
Perfection, protection, please love
With me all night long, oh
Makin' love to our favorite song
Your love teaches me how to love
So deep, baby, it's so sweet
Can't wait to pass you down
To the face that resembles you and me

Is it okay that I'm not independent?
Is it okay that I
Is it okay that I show weakness?
Is it okay that I
Is it okay that I can't wait to see you?
Is it okay that I
Is it okay to love a man right now?

If you understand
Then show me your hands (ooh, ooh)
Show me your hands
Boy, if you understand
Somebody raise a man (ooh, ooh)
Raise a man

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

Every day and every night I pray for one accord
I adore you even more
And every minute that passes me by
We can't afford for us to be ignored
Say we need each other more than we know, oh, oh

Somebody made a man
To show me how to raise a man (ooh, ooh)
Raise a man
You can't be a man
If we don't raise a man (ooh, ooh)
Raise a man

If you want a man
Then you gotta raise a man (ooh, ooh)
Raise a man
If you understand
Then show me your hands (ooh, ooh)
Show me your hands
