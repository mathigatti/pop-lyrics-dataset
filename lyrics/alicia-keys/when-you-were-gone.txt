Hey, my friend
How have you been?
You have been gone for so long
You look good, I knew you would
I've thought about you often


[Chorus]
When you were gone, oh, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think I would be waiting for you, the way that I have been?
When you were gone, were you wondering?
How was I doing?
Was I fine?
Know you were always on my mind
When you were gone, when you were gone
Did you think of me?

Now you're back
Putting on this act, that I was always in your heart

Wish I didn't need you (wish I)
Wish I could believe ya' (wish I)
I wish I didn't want to know

When you were gone, oh, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think I would be waiting for you, the way that I have been?
When you were gone, were you wondering?
How was I doing?
Was I fine?
Know you were always on my mind
When you were gone, when you were gone
Did you think of me?

I was better than
Better when I was without you in my life
Now it's colder than
Colder than a frozen picture I left behind, in my mind
I was fine, but now you're here and I'm not doing so well

When you were gone, oh, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think I would be waiting for you, the way that I have been?
When you were gone, were you wondering?
How was I doing?
Was I fine?
Know you were always on my mind
When you were gone, when you were gone
Did you think of me?

Did you think of me?
Did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think of me?
When you were gone, did you think of me?
Did you?
