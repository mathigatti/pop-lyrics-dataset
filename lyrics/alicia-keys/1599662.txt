First scene opened with the vision of a woman
In a chair up in a bedroom
What's she doing there, she is thinkin of a man
And the man just could be you
Write him in a script on a business trip
Out of town far but he wishes he was near
Does she really wnat him, gotta have him
Burning desire all she wanna say is 'listen my dear'


Gotta tell ya
I can't wait to see you, see I need my lover man
Don't you worry bout it, baby, I don't need no other man
We could be the dream that we always dreamed darling
Let's turn up the heat until the water boils over
I can't wait to see you, see I need my lover man

Second scene it opens with a woman at the desk
Of a job looking at a timepiece
Cause there is a flight coming in the night
Carrying the man that she's dying to see
He's getting attacked in the second knack
By a lady that's been missing him bad
She's all in the scene
Gotta have him, really need him
He's the kind of lover she never had

Gotta tell ya
I can't wait to see you, see I need my lover man
Don't you worry bout it, baby, I don't need no other man
We could be the dream that we always dreamed darling
Let's turn up the heat until the water boils over
I can't wait to see you, see I need my lover man
