[Intro]
It don’t take much strength to pull a trigger
But try to get up every morning day after day and work for a living
Let’s see ‘em try that
Then we’ll see who’s the real tough guy
The working man is a tough guy


[Hook - Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is gettin’ ready, everybody’s ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Dr Dre - Verse 1]
I woke up this morning thinking ’bout the old me
When I was feeling like, miller light and OE
But now I ride on some conscious shit
I’m getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments
Only one I can have a problem with is myself
It’s probably why my only competition is myself
From today to the morning
The Doctor just rock to the same drum
The pass to ? forgot where I came from
I got the club rockin’, uh
I got your girl jockin, uh
Me and Fif’ still in this bitch
We going the distance with you party people come’on

[Hook - Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Aye it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is gettin’ ready, everybody’s ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[50 Cent]
Now you can get your knees on the Church floor break it better
Or push the door on the liquor store, see where it get ya
But me I got to be on top
I said me I get to be on top
I got the street on lock
I’m on automatic pilot
Aint nobody stopping me
Growing up in poverty aint filled my heart with larceny
Ride out on high, I dump to get ‘em offa me
I’m a leader, natural born boss of me
They from Bel Air, I’m from the bottom
Soon as I spot ‘em I get to drop ‘em
I got ‘em I cut my piece and I dot ‘em
It’s dinner time when the 9 come out
It’s off the chain off, offa the brain move
Bang, off with ya brain

[Hook - Alicia Keys]

[Bridge]
Clocks on the wall
It’s now or never at all
I’m gonna give it my all, oh-oooh
Whether I rise or fall, oh-oooh

[50 Cent]
True story I said I’d get rich or die trying
I did it, good luck sucker, tryna stop my shine
Nothing matters but the music
Music my first love
We paper chasin’, I’m always coming in first cuz
I’m built for it, see I’m better under pressure
I react like a maniac when I’m coming to get ya
I got to win, Em’ watch and Dre watch and my son watching
Dad losing aint an option
I’m sharp I’m on point
The ink from my ballpoint
Throwing out my pain
I’m back on my A-game
I’m focused, for me this is just another victory
Except that I’m stronger than an ox now mentally
