Right there, in the middle of a conversation
Wasnt any special you said, it was just there
Right then, i didnt have to time to even overthink
I looked you, and all of the sudden, i was all in
Its like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
They were dancing taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very clear


That’s when i knew i fell in love
That’s when i knew you were the one
That’s when i knew you stole my heart my away from me
That’s when i knew that i was sunk
That was the moment that i knew i was in love
That’s when i knew
That’s when i knew
That’s when i knew

That day, i didnt know we were going where the night would end
I didnt know there was something brewing and if it was i didnt know how much i care
That touch, when you barely held hand i was overcome
With feelings i dont understand
Not in a million years i didnt think that we'd be here

Its like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
They were dancing taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very very very very clear

That’s when i knew i fell in love
That’s when i knew you were the one
That’s when i knew you stole my heart my away from me
That’s when i knew that i was sunk
That was the moment that i knew i was in love
That’s when i knew
That’s when i knew
That’s when i knew
Dont you know it eh
That’s when i knew
That’s when i knew
That’s when i knew baby

You know need to know
You know what you feel
And theres no denying, and nothing's for real
Theres nothing to do, just what it is
Gotta surrender

That’s when i knew i fell in love
That’s when i knew you were the one
That’s when i knew you stole my heart my away from me
That’s when i knew that i was sunk
That was the moment that i knew i fell in love
That’s when i knew with that minute
That’s when i knew it was that beautiful
Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it
That’s when i knew it baby
That’s when i knew
That’s when i knew we fell in love
