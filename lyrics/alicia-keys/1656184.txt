Now homie I say I run it run it, cuz I'm in control
Hypnotic, Henessey, a couple shots of patrom
I have you feeling height, I get you high as a kite
Party pops, shorty says you comin with me tonight
I ain't selling da linen
I ain't snapping and popping, either I'm bobbing my head
Or I'm just standing there watching
I'm a hustler, I hustle
You can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga'd you front you gon' get it, ok, now maybe I'm civic
Cause I want you to trip it, yea, I be on that shit
You should see what I'm stunting, I flash the stones they be wanting
Push the whips see me rolling, you can tell that I'm hauling
I'm just doing my thing, you know the units the game
I got my grind, me shady with me, you front you gon have to get me
Off your ass, I pay the lawsuit and laugh (Ha-ha)
It's not a big deal, it's nothing but some cash
(I Run New York)

Verse 2 (50 Cent)
I bought two all fours, stunt till I drive
'Em off the showroom floor, not the used car lot
You buy a bottle, I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras
When I get into it, I get into it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it
I make it rain, till the sun come out
A nigga playin, we make the guns come out
Now, my question is who they gon' blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again?
Shit shift now, the game done changed
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain
I guess I made the kids want slang
And N.W.A. made the West Coast bang
I'm gettin money man, I really don't care
Let me see you put your ass in the air,I Run New York
