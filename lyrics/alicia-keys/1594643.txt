Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you while it comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now


You give me a feeling that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
Its become something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

I was wondering if maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready

I know you once said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something about it
We should do it right now
Bay, uh

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
It's become something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready

Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away
I can't say I came compare
I'm suspended it the air
Won't you come be in the sky and then

I was wondering if maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
