When the wind is blowin in your face
Sometimes in life you don't see straight
(Wait to and He will show)
When your head is in a certain place
Nobody round to make you safe
(Stand strong and you will grow)


Ooh, wait til you see my smile
Ooh, wait til they see your smile

Don't they love to see you down
Kick you while you're on the ground
(Don't let emotions show)
People always speculate
Don't let them get in your way
(See they say things they don't know)

Ooh, wait til you see my smile
Ooh, wait til they see your smile

Hey, so you do it better now
Everybody comes around
But you don't really need them
Cause you're stronger, and you're better
And you're ready for whatever, saying

Ooh, wait til you see my smile
Ooh, wait til they see your smile (2x)
