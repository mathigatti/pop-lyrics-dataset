There we go ladies and gentlemen
Past all of the technical difficulties that we have .. for experience
I will let you into my laboratory filled with many things
Writing .. such as my typewriter in the corner
Let me show you to the window so you can see what I see


Desperate am I too
Tell you how I feel for you
No sunshine when you are gone
peaceful sleep I have none
How can I make it better
I'm under so much pressure
But I know it won't last
I know that this will pass

You are my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
Thinking in my head
You're my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
Capture what I'm saying

I don't want to fuss and fight
I want to make it right
Can't you see there's work to do
I am trying to write to you
How can I make it better
I'm under so much pressure
Problem is (problem is)
I'll give you space to get over this

You are my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
Thinking in my head
You're my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
You capture what I'm saying

Torture for a woman is to live in loneliness
So please don't leave me lonely...

You are my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
Thinking in my head
You're my typewriter
I write to you what I am thinking
You capture what I'm saying
