Hang on to the world 
as it spins around 
just don't let the spin get you down 
things are moving so fast 
hold on tight and you will last 
keep your selfrespect, 
your manly pride 
get yourself in gear 
keep your stride 
never mind your fears 
brighter days will soon be here 
Take it from me 
someday we'll all be free. Yeah 
Keep on walking tall, 
hold your head up high. 
lay your dreams right up to the sky 
sing your greatest song 
and you keep growing, growing on 
Take it from me someday we'll all be free. 
Just wait and see someday we'll all be free. 
Take it from me someday we'll all be free. It won't be long.
