Money
Some people so poor all that they got is money
Oh, and diamonds
Some peole waste their lives counting their thousands
I don't care what they're offering
How much gold they bring


They can't afford what we got,
Not even the king
They can't afford what we got,
Not even the king

Oh castles, some people so lonely, what good is a castle
Surrounded by people, but ain't got a friend
That's not on the payroll

Oh,
I don't care what they bring,
They can have everything

They can't afford what we got,
Not even the king
They can't afford what we got,
Not even the king

All the king's horses and all the king's men
Came charging to get what we got
They offered the crown and they offered the throne
But I already got all that I want

All the king's horses and all the king's men
They came marching through
They offer the world just to have what we got
But I found the world in you
I found a world in you

So darling listen,
Your arms around me worth more than a kingdom
Yeah, believe that
That trust that we feel, the kings never felt that
Yeah this is the song we sing
We don't need anything

They can't afford this
This is priceless
They can't afford what we've got
Not even the king
They can't afford what we got,
Not even the king
