Hi little girl, it's me
Don't you know who I am?
I met you last summer when
When I came up to stay with my grand
I'm the guy-uy-uy who
Left you with tears in his eyes
You didn't answer my letters
So I figured it was just lie


Your hair's getting longer and your shorts
Mmm they sure fit you fine
I'll bet you went out
Every night during ol' school time
But this ti-i-ime I'm not gonna count on you
I'll see you this summer
And forget you when I go back to school

Girl Don't tell me you'll write-ite-ite
Girl don't tell me you'll write-ite-ite
Girl don't tell me you'll write me again this time
