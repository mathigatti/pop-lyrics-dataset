Night time is delight time
It's starlight time
And it's the right time for me


Night time is delight time
It's starlight time
And it's the right time for me

'Cause the sun shines a little too bright
My eyes can't take that light
Will you be waitin' there
In the cool of the twilight air
That's where we'll be because

Night time is delight time
It's starlight time
And it's the right time for me

Night time is delight time
It's starlight time
And it's the right time for me

Night time is delight time
It's starlight time
And it's the right time for me

Night time is delight time
It's starlight time
And it's the right time for me

Downtown where the sun beats strong
Eight hours is a little too long
When I see that sun goin' down
I drive to the edge of town
Wait for awhile because

Night time is delight time
It's starlight time
And it's the right time for me

Night time is delight time
It's starlight time
And it's the right time for me

Night time is delight time
It's starlight time
And it's the right time for me

Night time
Light time
Right time
Right time

So there it goes
Sun's sinkin' down
It's gettin' dark

Colors are fading fast
Night covers the sun
And leaves no mark

The neighborhood
Everyone has gone back inside
It's understood
Won't you sit down right by my side

Night time
Light time
Light time
Right time for me

Night time (night time) is delight time (light time)
It's starlight time (light time)
And it's the right time for me (right time for me)

Night time (night time) is delight time (light time)
It's starlight time (light time)
And it's the right time for me (right time for me)

Night time (night time) is delight time (light time)
It's starlight time (light time)
And it's the right time for me (right time for me)

Night time (night time) is delight time (light time)
It's starlight time (light time)
And it's the right time for me (right time for me)

Night time
Light time
Light time
Right time for me
