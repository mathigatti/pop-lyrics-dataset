Some some some of your love (won't you give me some)
Some of your love
Some some some of your love (dip de doody doo ah ah)


You gotta see my favorite little acrobat
She really got her every little move down pat
She's got my vote for number one in the class
I couldn't help but try to make a forward pass

Some some some of your love (won't you give me some)
Some of your love
Some some some of your love (dip de doody doo ah ah)

There's nothin' like a-romancin' in the stands
Walking down the hallways a-holdin' hands
Punchin' up our juke box favorite band
Cuddlin' up in summer moonlight in the sand

Kiss me, baby
Hold me tight tonight

Some some some of your love
A gimme some some some of your love now
Some some some of your love
A gimme some some some of your love now
Some some some of your love
Wontcha gimme some some some of your love
Some some some of your love
Some of your lovin'
Some some some of your love
Woncha gimme some of your love
Some some some of your love
Some of your lovin'
Some some some of your love
Woncha gimme some of your love
Some some some of your love
Some of your lovin'
Some some some of your love
Woncha gimme some some of your love
Some some some of your love
Some of your lovin'
