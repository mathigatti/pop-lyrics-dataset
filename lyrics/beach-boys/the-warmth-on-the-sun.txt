What good is the dawn
That grows into day
The sunset at night
Or living this way
For I have the warmth of the sun
Within me at night
The love of my life
She left me one day
I cried when she said
I don't feel the same way
Still I have the warmth of the sun
Within me tonight
I'll dreams of her arms
And though they're not real Just like she's still there
The way that I feel
I loved like the warmth of the sun
It won't ever die
