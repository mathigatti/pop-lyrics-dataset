Let the wind blow
 Let the grass grow
 But don't let her go
 
 Don't take her out of my life
 Don't take her out of my life
 
 Let the moon glow
 (Let the moon glow)
 (On the fallen snow)
 On the fallen snow
 (Let the moon glow)
 (On the fallen snow)
 
 But I just got to know
 (Let me please know oh oh oh)
 Know she'll be a part of my life
 Know she'll be a part of my life
 Forever
 
 Let the bees make honey
 Let the poor find money
 Take away their sorrows
 Give them sunshine tomorrow
 
 But don't take her out of my life
 Don't take her out of my life
 What would I do without her tell me now
 
 Let the bird sing
 With the coming spring
 Let the church bells ring
 Let the rain fall
 Let the grass grow
 Let the moon glow
 On the fallen snow
 
 But don't take her out of my life
 Please keep her a part of my life
