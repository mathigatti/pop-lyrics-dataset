Do you want to dance and hold my hand
Tell me baby I'm your lover man
Oh baby do you want to dance?


Do you want to dance under the moonlight
Hold me baby all through the night
Oh baby

Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance?

Do you want to dance under the moonlight
Kiss me baby all through the night
Oh baby
Do you want to dance?

Do you want to dance under the moonlight
Squeeze me, squeeze me baby all through the night
Oh baby

Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you

Do you, do you, do you

Do you, do you, do you

Do you, do you, do you

Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
