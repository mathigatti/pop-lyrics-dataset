Teenage gamblers
Sitting in a Rambler
Listening to the radio
And then standing in the grandstand
Following the gameplan
Watching life's plays unfold
You fell in love with a pretty cheerleader
I even married one
And we once rode a cab out in Salt Lake City
Coming up with Fun Fun Fun
(Fun fun fun)


They say that Brian is back
Well I've known him for oh so long
They say Brian is back
Well, I never knew that he was gone
Still they say: Brian is back
I know he's had his ups and downs
Well they say: Brian is back
But in my heart he's always been around

I still remember
His sounding sweet and tender
Singing Danny Boy on Grandma's lap
And those harmony highs
Could bring tears to my eyes
I guess I'm just a sentimental sap
Good Vibrations caused such a sensation
Not to mention old Pet Sounds
And we travelled the world
As the banners unfurled
I guess you'd have to say we got around
(We got around we got around)

They say that Brian is back
Well I've known him for oh so long
They say Brian is back
Well, I never knew that he was gone
Still they say: Brian is back
I know he's had his ups and downs
Well they say: Brian is back
But in my heart he's always been around

They say that Brian is back
Brian Is back
They say that Brian is back
Well I've known him for oh so long
They say Brian is back
Well, I never knew that he was gone
Still they say: Brian is back
I know he's had his ups and downs
Well they say: Brian is back
But in my heart he's always been around

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
