It's been such a long day so you better hurry home
Lit all my incense and I wish you were home
Only five minutes and you walk through my door


Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life full

Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life

Stay here on the weekend and unplug the phone
(Alright then)
No calls from Korthoff, Parks, or Grillo
I only hope that you come here alone

Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life full

Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life

Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life
