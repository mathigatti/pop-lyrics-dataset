Well, it's been building up inside of me
For oh, I don't know how long.
I don't know why, but I keep thinkin'
Something's bound to go wrong,


But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
And she says,
"Don't worry baby.
Everything will turn out alright.
Don't worry baby."

I guess I should have kept my mouth shut
When I start to brag about my car,
But I can't back down now
Because I pushed the other guys too far.

She makes me come alive
And makes me want to drive
And she says,
"Don't worry baby.
Everything will turn out alright.
Don't worry baby."

She told me, "Baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you, baby,
Nothing could go wrong with you.

Oh, what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says,
"Don't worry baby.
Everything will turn out alright.
Don't worry baby.
Everything will turn out alright.
Don't worry baby."
