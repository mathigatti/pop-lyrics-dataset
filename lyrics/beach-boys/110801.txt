What do the planets mean? And have you ever seen
 Sunrise in the morn? It shined when you were born.
 Saturn has rings all around it
 I searched the sky and I found it
 
 Solar system
 Brings us wisdom
 
 Then there's the Milky Way, that's where the angels play
 You've seen the lover's moon, looks good in the month of June
 Neptune is god of the sea-ea-ea
 Pluto is too far to see-ee-ee
 
 Solar system
 Brings us wisdom
 
 The constellations are stars that form animals
 Leo and Capricorn, too
 Star bright, star light
 Make this wish come true tonight
 
 If Mars had life on it I might find my wife on it
 Venus the goddess of love can thank all the stars above
 Mercury's close to the sun
 You'll see it when day is done
 
 Solar system
 Brings us wisdom
 Solar system
 Brings us wisdom
 Solar
