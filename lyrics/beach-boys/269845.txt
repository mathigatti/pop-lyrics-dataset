This car of mine
A-win I got (bought) her now she wasn't new
Old and broke down
This car of mine
There's been a lot of races we been through
No slow poke now


I never want to part with her you see
This little car means a heck of a lot to me

(This car of mine, oooooo)
I remember the day
A-when I chose her over all those old broken junkers
Thought I could tell
Underneath a coat of rust she was gold
No clunker

Just couldn't wait to take her home with me
And fix her up just as new as she could be
(This car of mine, this car of mine, this car of mine, this car of mine,
Oooooo)
Ain't no amount of gold any mine
Would be enough to take away this car of mine
(This car of mine, dit til lee hup hup)
This car of mine
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
Oh his car of mine
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
SheÂ´s so so fine now
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
This car, this car so fine now
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
Mmm she's so fine...
