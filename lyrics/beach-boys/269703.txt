Get yourself in that cool cool water

Cool cool cool cool water water

In an ocean or in a glass
Cool water is such a gas

Coolin' so coolin' coolin' me

Ooooooooooooaaaaaaaaooooaaaaaaa

From the mountains on down to the sea
Cool water keeps on coolin' me
When the nights are too hot to keep cool
I keep on dreamin' 'bout a swimmin' pool

When I'm just too hot to move
Cool cool water is such a groove
In a shady spot when I'm layin' down
Only thing movin' are the ants on the ground

When I'm thirsty and I reach for a glass
Cool water tastes like such a gas
From the mountains on down to the sea
Cool cool water keeps on coolin' me
Cool cool water keeps on coolin' me
Get yourself in that cool cool water now
Cool cool water keeps on coolin' me
Cool cool water keeps on coolin' me
