Go like this... 
 All right, knock it off 
 Cindy, Oh Cindy 
 Bye Mom 
 
 One-two, a one-two-three 
 
 I joined the Navy to see the world 
 But nowhere could I find 
 A girl as sweet as Cindy 
 The girl I left behind 
 I've searched the wide world over 
 Can't get her out of my mind 
 
 Cindy, oh Cindy 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 Cindy don't let me down 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 Write me a letter, dear 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 And I'll be homeward bound 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 
 I see her face in every wave 
 Her lips kiss every breeze 
 Her loving arms reach out to me 
 Through calm and stormy sea 
 At night I face the lonely day 
 Caressed by memories 
 
 Cindy, oh Cindy 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 Cindy don't let me down 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 Write me a letter, dear 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 And I'll be homeward bound 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 
 I know my Cindy's waiting for me 
 As I walk the decks alone 
 Her loving arms reach out to me 
 Soon I'll be heading home 
 Then my sailing days will be over 
 No more will I roam 
 
 Cindy, oh Cindy 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 Cindy don't let me down 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 Write me a letter, dear 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 And I'll be homeward bound 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy) 
 (C-Cindy, C-Cindy)
