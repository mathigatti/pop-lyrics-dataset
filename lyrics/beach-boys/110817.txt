Run run runnin' all the rides are runnin'
 Run run runnin' all the rides are runnin'
 
 Last night I took a walk in the dark
 A steamin' place called Palisades Park
 Turned around to see what I could see
 That's where the girls are
 
 I took a ride on a shoopby shoo
 The girl I sat beside was awful cool
 And when we start I gave that girl a hug
 My heart was flyin'
 Up like a rocket ship
 Down like a roller coaster
 Left like a loopdy loop
 And around like a merry go round
 
 We ate and ate at a hot dog stand
 We danced around to a rockin' band
 And we we quit I gave that girl a hug
 In the tunnel of love
 
 You never know how great a kiss can be
 Until you stop at the bottom of a ferris wheel
 In the tunnel of love down at Palisades Park
 
 Run run runnin' all the rides are runnin'
 
 Yeah
 Oh my God
 Those coconuts are bad in the ass damn (???)
 
 We ate and ??? at a hot dog stand
 We danced around to a rockin' band
 And we we quit I gave that girl a hug
 In the tunnel of love
 
 You never know how great a kiss can be
 Until you stop at the bottom of a ferris wheel
 In the tunnel of love down at Palisades Park
 
 Run run runnin' all the rides are runnin'
 Down at Palisades Park
 Run run runnin' all the rides are runnin'
 Down at Palisades Park
 Run run runnin' all the rides are runnin'
 Down at Palisades Park
