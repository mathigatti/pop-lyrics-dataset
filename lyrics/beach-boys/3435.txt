Little surfer, little one
Made my heart come all undone.
Do you love me?
Do you surfer girl?
My little surfer girl.


I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar.
Do you love me?
Do you surfer girl?

We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow.
In my woody, I would take you
Everywhere I go.

So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true.
Do you love me?
Do you surfer girl?
My little surfer girl.
Little one.
Little one.
