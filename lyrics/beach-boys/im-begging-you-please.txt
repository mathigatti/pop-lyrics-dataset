Baby, oh baby, you've taken something away from me
Baby, oh baby, somehow you've gone astray from me


You stop giving me what I wanted for so long
Without you baby, life's not so easy and something is wrong

Say you miss the way we used to be
Say you'll make it happen somehow
Say you'll take a chance on love again
Without ending up with a broken heart again
I mean it this time
I'm begging you with all my heart

I'm begging you, please
Please
Please, my darling!

I'm begging you, please
Please
Please, my darling!

I'm begging you, please
