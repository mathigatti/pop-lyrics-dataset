Ah ah ah ah oo ooo ooo oo ahh
The girls on the beach
On the beach you'll find them there
In the sun and salty air
The girls on the beach
Are all within reach
If you know what to do
How we love to lie around
Girls with tans of golden brown
The girls on the beach
Are all within reach
And one waits there for you
(Girls on the beach)
The sun in her hair
The warmth of the air
On a summer day
As the sun dips out of sight
Couples on the beach at night
The girls on the beach
Are all within reach
And with the boys tonight
(Girls on the beach)
Girls on the beach, girls on the beach
Girls on the beach, girls on the beach
