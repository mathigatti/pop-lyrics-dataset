After it's all been said
The music spinning in our head
Can't forget the feeling of
The magic of that summer in love


Uh, I wanna take you there
Do you wanna turn back the pages
Memories and photographs
The world has changed
And yet the game is still the same

Isn't it time we danced the night away
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things
we used to do

Remember those nights we spent
just you and I
Little did we know
how the time would fly
Isn't it time, oh, oh
Isn't it time, oh, oh

The good times never have to end
And now's the time to let them happen again
And We can have ourselves a blast
The good times they, aren't only in the past

Isn't it time we danced the night away
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things
we used to do

Remember those nights we spent
just you and I
Little did we know
how the time would fly
Isn't it time, oh, oh
Isn't it time, oh, oh

And as the sun goes down
we raise our glass to kindness
To all the good times we shared
Isn't it time we get ready and then
Isn't it time we go steady again?

Isn't it time we danced the night away
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things
we used to do

Remember those nights we spent
just you and I
Little did we know
how the time would fly
Isn't it time, oh, oh
Isn't it time, oh, oh
