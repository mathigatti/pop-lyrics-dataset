Summer's gone
Summer's gone away
Gona away
With yesterday


Old friends have gone
They've gone their separate ways
Our dreams hold on
For those who still have more to say

Summer's gone
Gone like yesterday
The night's grow cold
It's time to go
I'm thinking maybe I'll just stay

Another summer gone

Summer's gone
It's finally sinking in
One day begins
Another ends
I live them all and back again

Summer's gone
I'm gonna sit and watch the waves
We laugh, we cry
We live then die
And dream about our yesterday
