The trouble you had
It wasn't so bad
It's only life and what you're livin' for


Sit down right here
I'll send away your tears
Well we don't have to talk about it much more

Good things turn bad but it's over now
So don't look sad 'cause you're older now
Lots of people miss Deirdre

You're back again
You still have all your friends
And they used to ask me why'd you go away Deirdre

Oo hoo hooo

What could I say
That you ran away
Don't you think it's time that you stayed right near me

These nights, pretty nights, that were meant to be
With you and me
It's the way that we
Always had our love, Deirdre

I love your red hair

Deirdre
Do do do do do do
Dear dear dear Deirdre
I'm glad you're home again
Oo ooo ooo

Ooo hoooo
Oooo hoooo
Baby 1 2 3 and you're back with me

Ooo hooo

Tomorrow at ten
I'll wake you and then
We'll take a bath and then I'll laugh again with Deirdre

You may not live with me every day
All that I care is that we find a way
To stay together with Deirdre

Deirdre
Do do do do do do
Dear dear dear Deirdre

Ooo do do do do do do
Ooo do do do do do do
