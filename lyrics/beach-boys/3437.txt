Surfin' is the only life
The only way for me
Now surf... Surf... With me


I got up this morning
Turned on my radio
I was checking out the surfin' scene
To see if I would go

And when the DJ tells me
That the surfing is fine
That's when I know my baby and I
Will have a good time

We're going surfin'
Surfin'... Surfin'
Surfin'... Surfin'
Surfin'... Surfin'
Surfin'
Surfin' is the only life
The only way for me
Now Surf... Surf... With me

From the early morning
To the middle of the night
Anytime the surf is up
The time is right

And when the surf is down
To take it's place
We'll do the surfer stomp
It's the lastest dance craze

We're going surfin'
Surfin'... Surfin'
Surfin'... Surfin'
Surfin'... Surfin'
Surfin'
Surfin is the only life
The only way for me
Now Surf... Surf... With me

Now the dawn is breaking
And we really gotta go
But we'll be back here very soon
That you better know

Yeah my surfin' knots are rising
And my board is losing wax
But that won't stop me baby
Cause you know I'm coming back

We're going surfin'
Surfin'... Surfin'
Surfin'... Surfin'
Surfin'... Surfin'
Surfin'
Surfin' is the only life
The only way for me
Now come on pretty baby
And surf with me

Yeah... Oooh
