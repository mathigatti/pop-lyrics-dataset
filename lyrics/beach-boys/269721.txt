I think of goin' south for the winter
It's getting mighty cold
I watch the fire glow
The moon shining 'cross the snow
Maybe Florida or Mexico
Is where I oughta go


Somewhere where everything is green
Oo the change of scene
Might do a me good
When the swallows go
When they leave Capistrano
Fly away so gracefully
Maybe that's for me

Snowdrifts blowing up against my door
Going clear up to the roof
I could be lying on some sun-washed shore
Truth is, don't know what I'm waiting for

Think I'm goin' south for the winter
It's getting mighty cold
I watch the fire glow
The moon shinin' 'cross the snow
Maybe Florida or Mexico
Is where I oughta go

South of the border
Think I'm goin' south
Get my life in order
Think I'm goin' south
For the winter
It's gettin' mighty cold
