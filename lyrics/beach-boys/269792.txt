Before we met there must have been some others
Like storybook and fairy tale lovers
But in my life there's never been another
So perfect lover


Oh ho darlin'
Now that I've found you
It's like a missing piece of puzzle has appeared
And now my darlin'
My love surrounds you
And since you came into my life my love
Perfection's never ever been so near

To love and to be loved is so inspiring
And that's why every lover's so desiring
Of the love they're seeking never retiring
Always aspiring

Love like just like moonlight glowing
Our love keeps growing

Oh ho darlin'
Now that I've found you
It's like a missing piece of puzzle has appeared
And now my darlin'
My love surrounds you
And since you came into my life my love
Perfection's never ever been so near

Lying here with you in the night
Underneath the heavenly skies
Baby what a beautiful sight
Darlin' now hold me, hold me tight

Oh ho darlin'
Now that I've found you
It's like a missing piece of puzzle has appeared
And now my darlin'
My love surrounds you
And since you came into my life my love
Perfection's never ever been so near

Oh darlin' (God only knows)
Now that I've found you (how I love you ee oo)
It's like a missing piece of puzzle has appeared
And now my darlin' (God only knows)
My love surrounds you 
And since you came into my life my love
Perfection's never ever been so near

Darlin (God only knows)
Found you (how I love you ee ooo)
Darlin (God only knows)
Found you (how I love you ee ooo)
