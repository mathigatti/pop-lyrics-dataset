Let's take your car and do amusement parks USA
At Palisades in Salisbury Parks the rolly coasters are flyin
At Euclid Beach on the flying turns I'll bet you can't keep her smilin'
Buy your girl a cotton candy while you're down on the ground
Then take her on the twirl-a-way and spin her around
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day


The parachutes at Riverview Park will shake us up all day
And Disneyland and P.O.P. is worth a trip to L.A.
Watchin' girls in the air can really get you bad
And I'll bet the laughin' lady makes you laugh like mad
Let's pick up our friends and do amusement parks USA

[Spoken, supposedly by Beach Boys session drummer Hal Blaine] Hurry, 
hurry, hurry folks step right up to the Beach Boy circus. The best little 
show in town. Hurry, hurry, hurry, it's only a dime folks, one thin dime, 
just one tenth of a dollar. Come on in and see Stella the snake dancer 
(Is it real?) She walks, she talks, she wiggles on her belly like a 
snake. (She looks like afake to me) (Let's go see her) (It costs too 
much) Hurry, hurry, hurry folks, come on and see Stella. She shimmies, 
she shakes. . . .

You'll crash and burn in the bumper cars at Jersey's steel pier
You'll crack 'em up when you stand in front of all the crazy mirrors
At first you'll be a chicken at the jackhammer ride
But you'll do it with a girl sittin' right by your side
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day
