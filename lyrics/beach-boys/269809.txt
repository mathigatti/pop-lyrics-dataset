When I desire company
I leave my footprints on the sand by a reckless sea
Hoping you'd come to me
And we'll explore what might have been
And leave the shore and give this tired old world a spin
When my ship will come in
Sun up we'll sail away the day that my ship comes in
Fast as the highest mast can take us to you
Any old where but here 
Look at this paradise for two
Sky in a sea that's twice as blue
It all waits for  me and you when my ship comes in


You go and get the telephone
Give it a real good yank and thank God we're all alone
In a tropical zone
While we surround the carribe
At every port a third world orders new (epizene?)
From that aqua marine

We'll tell our kind and gentle friends
This is time to make amends
We'll send them a card that ends "till your ship comes in"
Sail away sail away
Just sail away
When my ship will come in
Sail away sail away 
Just sail away 
When my ship will come in

Oh island in the sun
What I don't know won't hurt me none
When all's said and done
When my ship will come in
At (perfect?) coast in harmony
We'll raise a toast to what's still left of my memory
When will my ship come in

We'll sail away sail away 
Just sail away
When my ship will come in
We'll sail away sail away
Just sail away
