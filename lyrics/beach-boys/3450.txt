After 6 hours of school
I had enough for the day
I hit the radio dial
And turn it up all the way


I gotta dance
Right on the spot
The beats really hot
Dance
Dance
Dance, yeah!

When I feel put down I try to shake it off quick
With my chick by my side
The radio doesn't quit

At the weekend dance
We like to show up last
I play it cool when it's slow
And jump it up when it's fast
