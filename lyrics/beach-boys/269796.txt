I thought about a summer day
And how the time just floats away
Pretty things like incense and flowers
I wanna make them part of


Our sweet love
Could last forever
(Our sweet love)
Our sweet love
Could last forever

I thought about a winter night
And how I'd like to hold you tight
Candlelight the warmth of a fire
We could make them part of

Our sweet love
Honey it's heaven
(Our sweet love)
Our sweet love
Could last forever

Sweet love sweet love

Like a child with his new toy
My heart is filled with joy for

Our sweet love
Honey it's heaven
(Our sweet love)
Our sweet love

Lord knows I love her so
I feel it down inside my soul
A precious love like this can flower
There's nothing in this world like

Our sweet love
Should last forever
(Our sweet love)
Our sweet love
Could last forever
Our sweet love
Could last forever
Our sweet love
Could last forever
(Our sweet love)
Oh
