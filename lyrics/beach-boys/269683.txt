Birds fly up
And down spinnin' round
Flyin' all around
From my window
A little brown sparraw came
Flutterin' down


Le moineau est venu
Se poser ma fenjtre

He came to my window

And as I watched him
I found myself reelin' and turnin' around
And the faster I ran
I ran out of breath and I fell to the ground
(Poof)

Ahhhhhhhhhhhh

He came to my window
He came to my window
He came to my window

From their eyes
The people must look like miniature toys

Do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away
