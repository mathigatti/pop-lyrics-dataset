When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa
I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine


Well with naugahyde bucket seats in front and back
(Check my custom machine)

When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa
I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine

With stereophonic speaker set with vibrasonic sound
(Check my custom machine)
Magnesium spokes, it stands an inch off the ground

When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa
I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine
