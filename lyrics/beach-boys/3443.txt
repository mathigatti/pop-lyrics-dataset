All the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray
i've been for a walk, on a winter's day
i'd be safe and warm, if i was in L.A
California, California Dreaming, on such a winter's day


stopped in to a church, i passed along the way
well i got down on my knees, and i pretend to pray
you know the preacher likes the cold
he knows i'm gonna stay
California, California Dreamin, on such a winters day

all the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray
i've been for a walk, on a winter's day, yeah
i'd be safe and warm, if i was in L.A
California, California Dreamin, on such a winter's day
