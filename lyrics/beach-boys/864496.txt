A child of winter
A child of the snow
I'm making a snowball
That someone will throw
I'm making a snowman
With charcoal for the eyes
A scarf draped in red
And a derby on his head


Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer are pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

The evening of Christmas
Presents have been passed
The wood in the fireplace
Is glowing its last
I'm closing my eyes now
In my bed I'm snuggling
Outside my window
The carolers sing

Christmas comes and the snow covers all
Trees are decorated with tinsel and lights
Mama's in the kitchen making cookies and bread
The children are hungry, they're waiting to be fed

A child of Christmas
A child of snow
A wonderful feeling
Underneath the mistletoe
And may your Christmas
Last all year
With laughter of children
Peace and cheer

A child of Christmas
A child of snow
A wonderful feeling
Underneath the mistletoe
Merry Christmas to you
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
