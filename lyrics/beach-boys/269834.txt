With a smile she brings me light
She can make my whole world bright
She brings out the sun at night
She's my sunshine

Life would be full (???)
Sailing on the sea
In a boat
Just a (???) knee
And propose
That she'll be my only one

She can make you feel so fine
Like to love her all the time
It's the reason I'm a-pleasin' my sunshine

Some-a-day I'm
Gonna marry her
Some-a-way I'm
Gonna carry her
To a place where we can play in the sun

Like a full moon shinin' bright
She'll light up the darkest night
Will she squeeze me
How she'll please me
Sunshine

Some-a-day I'm
Gonna marry her
Some-a-way I'm
Gonna carry her
To a place where we can play in the sun

Never felt a kiss so sweet
Never could I ever meet
Someone even half as sweet as my
Sunshine

Some-a-day I'm
Gonna marry her
Some-a-way I'm
Gonna carry her
To a place where we can play in the sun

Dum dum dum be dum be do
Dum dum dum be dum be do
