There's so many dreams to dream of
Why not dream about my true love
And even though I can't be with her
I still have my fantasy
Fantasy world


There's so many risks to take
And if I lose my heart will break
I think I might take a chance on love again
Oh on love again
Love again

I wonder
Why has it taken so long
I wonder
If you know where you belong
Your face up in the sky
Where angels fly
In heaven's eye
Where planets are spinning around

There's so many songs to sing
I'm thankful for the love they bring
Don't let old scars keep us apart
We're gonna mend our broken hearts
Starting tonight

I wonder
If you know where you belong
I wonder
Why has it taken so long
To get you in my arms
To feel my love that is so strong
Where planets are spinning around
Planets are spinning around
