Little bird up in a tree
Looked down and sang a song to me
Of how it began


Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

The trout in the shiny brook
Gave the worm another look
And told me not to worry
About my life

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Tree in my own backyard
Stands all alone
Bears fruit for me
And it tastes so good

Where's my pretty bird
He must have flown away
If I keep singing
He'll come back someday

Dawn, bird's still gone
Guess I'll go mow the lawn

What a day, what a day
Oooo, what a beautiful day this is

Ooooooooo

Little bird up in a tree
Looked down a sang a song to me

The trout in a shiny brook
Gave the worm another look
And told me not to worry about my life

Little bird looked down
And sang a song to me
Little bird looked down
And sang a songto me
Little bird looked down
And sang a song to me
