Talk to me
Talk to me
Ooo I love the things you say


Talk to me
Talk to me
In your own
Sweet gentle way

Let me hear
Tell me dear
Tell me oooo
You love me so

Talk to me
Talk to me
Tell me what
I want to know

The many ways
You speak of love
I've heard before
But it sounds so good
Everytime
Please say the one part
I love once more

Comes from Tallahassee
She's got a high flyin' chasiss
Makin' looks a little sassy
But to me she's real classy
Yeah my Tallahassee Lassie
Down in FLA

Talk to me
Talk to me
Hold me close
Whisper low
Talk to me
Baby can't you see
Oh darlin I
I love you so
