Here in Sothern California there is a weather condition known as the 
Santa Ana Winds.


Fire wind oh desert wind
She was born in a desert breeze
And wind her way
Through Canyon Way
From the desert to the silvery sea

In every direction
See the perfection
And see the San Gabriel Mountain scene

Santa Ana winds keep blowin' across my eyes
Santa Ana winds keep blowin' across my eyes

Fill my sails
Oh desert wind
And hold the waves high for me

Then I will come
And test my skill
Where the Santa Ana winds blow free

In waves of elation
My part of creation
Becoming one with the boundless sea

Santa Ana winds keep blowin' across my eyes
Santa Ana winds keep blowin' across my eyes

I am the wind
Oh desert wind
On my pilgrimage to the sea

I will prevail
I will not fail
To bring life into humanity

My song is creation
(???)the nation
Whispering the wisdom and its purity

Santa Ana winds keep blowin' across my eyes
Santa Ana winds keep blowin' across my eyes
Santa Ana winds keep blowin' across my eyes
Santa Ana winds keep blowin' across my eyes
Santa Ana winds...
