Let it shine oh let it shine
Let it shine oh let it shine
Let it shine oh let it shine
Let it shine oh let it shine


Shadows fall
The ocean calls to me
The night is still
She's where I wanna be
The stars all send
Their silver light to me
Forever shine
On me eternally

I couldn't think of anything
That gives me more than what you bring
The color of an endless dream
Let it shine
Let it shine
Whoaah-oh

There comes a burning fire
It fills me with desire
And all my troubles disappear
Feels like it's goin' through me
Whatever you do to me
Your words are magic to my ears
Whoaah-oh
Let it shine

A flame that grows
And burns so deep in me
Somebody cries
For all the world to see
Another time
There will be ectasy
Another place
You will be next to me

Of all the lives that I've been through
I never really thought it was true
That all I ever needed was you
Let it shine
Let it shine

Let it shine oh let it shine
Let it shine oh let it shine
Let it shine oh let it shine
Let it shine oh let it shine

There comes a burning fire
It fills me with desire
And all my troubles disappear
Feels like it's goin' through me
Whatever you do to me
Your words are magic to my ears
Whoaah-oh
Let it shine

There comes a burning fire
It fills me with desire
And all my troubles disappear
Feels like it's goin' through me
Whatever you do to me
Your words are magic to my ears
Whoaah-oh
