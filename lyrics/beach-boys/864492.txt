I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinkin' about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me


I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
