On my own again, left alone
To remember when
Her love filled my life
Made my life alive her love
Love around me


How can I cope without the love
That I had
(all around me, love surrounds me)
Surround me
The love that I lost was more than
I could hope to find
(love surround me, all around me)
Around me
Did I have love or did love have me
Oo love around me
But there's no
There's no love of my own

Mmm mmmmm mmmmmmmmm
Mm

I gave up our love
But it won't disappear
Oo love around me
Desire
Seems as though
Everywhere I go
Oo love around me
Put your arms around me
Huggin' and a-kissin'
Making the love I've been missin'
All around me
But there's no 
There's no love of my own

Love around me love surround me
No love of my own
Love around me love surround me
No love of my own
Love surround me love around me
No love of my own
Love surround me love around me
Put your love around me
