I've spent my whole life drifting
Towards an elusive sun
I would have wandered forever
If your breeze hadn't come
And you just could be my anchor
You are my northern star
That navigates me home


Don't need to search no more exotic islands
No that I found you're right where I belong
Never been so much at home as I am
Loving you is right where I belong

In my mind we're together
Even when I'm alone
My heart leaves you never
Never will our love grow old
My destination forever
You are my shining star that navigates me home

Don't need to search no more exotic islands
Now that I found you're right where I belong
Never been as much at home as I am
Loving you is right where I belong

Don't need to search no more exotic islands
Now that I found you're right where I belong
Never been as much at home as I am
Loving you is right where I belong
