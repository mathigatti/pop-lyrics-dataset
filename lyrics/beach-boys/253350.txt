Drive your car down to the sea
All the while you build a scheme
Take her hand and walk on with her
Make it real your Summer dream


Smell the warm and salty air
See a wave reflect a beam
Stop and find a pretty shell for her
Make it real your Summer dream

See another couple over there
To them an ordinary day
Soon you wonder the time has gone
The sun has almost slipped away

Now it's gone and your alone
In her eyes you see a gleam
Time has come for you to show your love
Make it real your Summer dream

Make it real your Summer dream
Make it real your Summer dream
