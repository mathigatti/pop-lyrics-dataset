You know it makes you nervous
When you wait for you boy
You wait nine months for a bundle of joy
There's a baby
Yes, there's a baby about to be born


And someday I'll put my son on my knee
And his little eyes will be looking at me
Then I'll tell him
When a man needs a woman
They make things like you, my son

When a man needs a woman
They make things like you, my son

A man needs a woman
Like a woman needs a man
When the two get together, oh oh oh
Pretty soon we'll be a family of three
Then it's not gonna be just you and me
We'll share all the goodies
With the one we bring in the world

When a man needs a woman
They make things like you, my son
