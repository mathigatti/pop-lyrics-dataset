I just looked to see the sun outside
It's shining so bright
A sun the clouds can't hide
Do you remember the time that you hear me say


I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh

No more

The juke box daddies been blowin' my mind
I ain't goin' nowhere I got lots of time
I'm fat as a cow oh how'd I ever get this way

I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh

No more

In the morning people are so happy
And that's the time when I'm a mister bussinessman
Later on I really get to goin' yeah
I get my motor runnin'
I get my legs to movin'

It's just no good unless two can play
Ah ha haaaa

I was layin' on my back
Relaxin' in the night
I played my radio
It was out of sight
Joe South was singing
"Games People Play"

And I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh

Yeah-e-eah
Ah ha ha ha haaa
