Orange crate art was a place to start
Orange crate art was a world apart
Home for two with view of Sonoma
Where there's aroma and heart
Memories of her orange crate art


Orange crate table and a rockin' chair
Barnyard gate waiting some repair
Trust in fate and sweet inspiration
You could go bust to replace
Just what is here by the case

Hear the lonesome locomotion roar
Hobo hop on if you dare
And it rolls where grapes of wrath are stored
Stops on a bracero's prayer

On the dawn of a vintage cruise
Calms the wine of this rendezvous
Room for two in view of Sonoma
Back when Ramona had heart
Memories of her orange crate art

Room for two in view of Sonoma
