The night has come
Cuddle up to me
Keep warm
Mmm close to me


In dreams
We'll dream
Making love to wake
To find
Mmm we're still one

Your love
Your love
Your love
Your love for me
Is so 
Warm and good to me
Growing every day
Honey 
Honey
I'm in love

Ooooo

I know a man
Who's so in love
Mm mm

The night
