Dow dow
Ooooooo oooo oooo
Dow dow
Ooooo
Ahhhhh ahhhhh
Ooo


We're always first to hit the lot
And wave to the man in blue now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run de)
It's still so early in the morning
The grass is all covered with dew now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run)

She's turning on the radio dial
We can sit a listen for awhile

She looks so great in the morning
She doesn't even have to try now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run de)
ItÕs not my metal flake paint that
The guys are digging when they pass by now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run)

Outside it could storm
But we'll still keep warm

All the kids are splitting to their lockers
But weÕre still making out in the car now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run de)
Just one long kiss and we'll be gone
'Cause two minutes all there are now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run)

Here comes the news
There's no time to lose

Ooooooo woooo oooo
Dow dow
Ooooooo oooo oooo
Dow dow
Ooooo
Ahhhhh ahhhhh

Ooo ooo

Ooooooo woooo oooo
Dow dow
Ooooooo oooo oooo
Dow dow
Ooooo
Ahhhhh ahhhhh
