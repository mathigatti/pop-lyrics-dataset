He used to ride the sidewalks in a landlocked town
A solitary surfer still he got around
He had his favorite spots now
Where the best rides could be found


With posters on his wall from "Surfer" magazine
His room looked like a shrine to the surfin' scene
Go to Hawaii out of high school was his big time college dream
(That's where the girls are)

Did you ever wonder what happened to surfer Joe
He up and took a trawler down to Mexico
With a pretty senorita we both used to know

You can see him catch a wave in the mornin' light
And sometimes you can find him on his board at night
A silouette on water as the sun dips outta sight

He's still surfin'
(Still surfin')
He's still surfin'
(Still surfin')

You'll catch  him on a wave on his way to class
Then be back there after school on his daylight glass
He's still surfin'
(Still surfin')
He's still surfin'
(Still surfin')

Surfers always love them summer days
With a board in the water rollin' with the waves
He's still surfin'

He's always been a surfer since the early days
Spendin' the summer searchin' for that perfect wave
He and his surfin' senorita never seem to age

He doesn't do a whole lot with his law degree
They thought about a major oceanography
But he does a lot of thinkin' 'bout how to save the sea
(That's where the waves are)

Things up north were gettin' kinda out of hand
So he got a break to see the ride on the sand
With his little mama seated in a surfer's never never land

You can see him catch a wave in the mornin' light
And sometimes you can find him on his board at night
A silouette on water as the sun dips outta sight

He's still surfin'
(Still surfin')
He's still surfin'
(Still surfin')

You'll catch  him on a wave on his way to class
Then be back there after school on his daylight glass

He's still surfin'
(Still surfin')
He's still surfin'
(Still surfin')

Surfers always love them summer days
With a board in the water rollin' with the waves
He's still surfin'

In the mornin light he still surfin'
On his board at night he's still surfin'
In the summer days he's still surfin'
Rollin' with the waves he's still surfin'
