The lonely sea
The lonely sea
It never stops
For you or me
It moves along
From day to day


That's why my love (oooo-oooo-oooo)
That's why my love (oooo-oooo-oooo)
You'll never stay (oooo-oooo-oooo)
You'll never stay (oooo-oooo-oooo)

(Ooooooo)
This pain in my heart (ooooooooo)
These tears in my eyes (ooooooooo)
Please tell the truth (ooooooooo)
You're like the lonely sea (sea)
Sea (sea)
The lonely sea (sea)

(Lonely sea lonely sea)
(Lonely sea lonely sea)
Lonely sea

(Lonely sea lonely sea)
(Lonely sea lonely sea)
Lonely sea

(Lonely sea lonely sea)
(Lonely sea lonely sea)
Lonely sea
