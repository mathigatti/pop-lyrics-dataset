This town goes down at sunset
When the hills start turning red
The streets roll up at eight o'clock
Everybody goes off to bed
Everybody goes off to bed


There's someone callin' someone names
You can hear a screen door slam
A car goes skatin' down the road
Everybody gets out of bed
Everybody gets out of bed

You took the key to my heart's door
And you set off on your own
I shook it off as a passing phase
Everybody must come back home
Everybody must come back home

This town gets up at daybreak
When the hills start turnin' blue
A whistle blows a rooster crows
Everybody's got things to do
Everybody's got things to do
