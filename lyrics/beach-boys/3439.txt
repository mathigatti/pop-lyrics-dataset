If every word I said
Could make you laugh
I'd talk forever
I asked the sky just what we had
It showed forever
(Together, my love)
If the song I sing to you
Could fill your heart with joy
I'd sing forever
(Together my love)


Forever, forever
I've been so happy loving you

(Together, my love)
Let the love I have for you live in your heart
And be forever
(Together, my love)

Forever, forever
I've been so happy loving you

If every word I said could make you laugh
I'd talk forever

Forever, forever
I've been so happy loving you
