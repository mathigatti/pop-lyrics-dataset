One, one, two, three

Do you wanna go
Straight to Hawaii
(Hawaii) Hawaii (Hawaii)
Straight to Hawaii (Hawaii, Hawaii)
Oh do (Honolulu, Waikiki) you wanna come along with me
(Do you wanna come along with me)


I heard about all the pretty girls
With their grass skirts down to their knees
All my life I wanted to see
The island called Hawaii

Go to Hawaii
(Hawaii) Hawaii (Hawaii)
Straight to Hawaii (Hawaii, Hawaii)
Oh do (Honolulu, Waikiki) you wanna come along with me
(Do you wanna come along with me)

Now I don't know what town you're from
But don't tell me that they got bigger waves
Cause everyone that goes
Comes back with nothing but raves

That's in Hawaii
(Hawaii) Hawaii (Hawaii)
That's in Hawaii (Hawaii, Hawaii)
Oh do (Honolulu, Waikiki) you wanna come along with me
(Do you wanna come along with me)

And pretty soon this Winter
They'll hold the surfing championship of the year
Surfer guys and girls
Will be coming from far and near

Go to Hawaii
(Hawaii) Hawaii (Hawaii)
Straight to Hawaii (Hawaii, Hawaii)
Oh do (Honolulu, Waikiki) you wanna come along with me
(Do you wanna come along with me)

And you now (Honolulu, Waikiki)
You wanna live Hanah Lee
(Do you wanna come along with me)
Ooo ooo ooo (Honolulu, Waikiki)
Ooo ooo ooo (Do you wanna come along with me)
Ooo ooo ooo (Honolulu, Waikiki)
Ooo ooo ooo (Do you wanna come along with me)
Ooo ooooo (Honolulu, Waikiki)

Yeah

Thank you
