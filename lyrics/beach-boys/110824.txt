(Hey yeah Marcella)
 (Hey yeah Marcella)
 She's a bright girl
 (Hey yeah Marcella)
 Hey hey
 (Hey yeah Marcella)
 
 Mystic maiden's more than soft and sexy
 She can mess my mind with the stuff that she knows
 Her new found beauty goes beyond her covering
 And sets a flame in her soul
 
 One arm over my shoulder
 Sandals dance at my feet
 Eyes that'll knock you right over
 Ooo Marcella's so sweet
 
 (Hey yeah Marcella)
 (Hey yeah Marcella)
 She's a bright girl bom bom bom bom bom
 (Hey yeah Marcella)
 Hey hey
 (Hey yeah Marcella)
 
 Brave new woman standing proud and dazzling
 Grips the goal that eluded her soul
 Direction bringing her to now's tomorrow
 And my love for her still grows
 
 One arm over my shoulder
 Sandals dance at my feet
 Eyes that'll knock you right over
 Ooo Marcella's so sweet
 
 (Hey yeah Marcella)
 (Hey yeah Marcella)
 She's a bright girl
 (Hey yeah Marcella)
 Hey hey
 (Hey yeah Marcella)
 
 One arm over my shoulder
 Sandals dance at my feet
 Eyes that knock you right over
 Ooo Marcella's so sweet
 
 One arm over my shoulder
 Sandals dance at my feet
 Eyes that knock you right over
 Ooo Marcella's so sweet
 
 When she puts one arm over my shoulder
 Sandals dance at my feet
 Eyes that knock you right over
 Ooo Marcella's so sweet
 
 When she puts one arm over my shoulder
 Sandals dance at my feet
 Eyes that knock you right over
 Ooo Marcella's so sweet
 
 When she puts one arm over my shoulder
 Sandals dance at my feet
 Eyes that knock you right over
 Ooo Marcella's so sweet
