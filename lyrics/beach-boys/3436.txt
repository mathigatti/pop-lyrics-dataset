It's the liitle old lady from Pasadena

It's the liitle old lady from Pasadena
(Go, granny, go, granny, go, granny, go)
Got a pretty little flower bed of white gardenias
(Go, granny, go, granny, go, granny, go)
But parked in her rickety old garage
Is a brand new shiny red Super-Stock Dodge


And everybody's saying there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

It's the liitle old lady from Pasadena

You can see her on the street just gettin' her kicks now
(Go, granny, go, granny, go, granny, go)
With her four speed stick and her four-twenty-six now
(Go, granny, go, granny, go, granny, go)
She's gonna get a ticket now sooner or later
'Cause she can't keep her foot off the accelerator

And everybody's saying there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

And everybody's saying there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

It's the liitle old lady from Pasadena

If you see her on the street don't try to choose her
(Go, granny, go, granny, go, granny, go)
You may have a goer but you'll never lose her
(Go, granny, go, granny, go, granny, go)
The guys come to race her from miles around
But she'll give them a length then she'll shut 'em down

And everybody's saying there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

It's the liitle old lady from Pasadena

Go, granny, go, granny, go, granny, go
Granny, go
Go, granny, go, granny, go, granny, go
Granny, go
Go, granny, go, granny, go, granny, go
Granny, go
Go, granny, go, granny, go, granny, go
Granny, go
