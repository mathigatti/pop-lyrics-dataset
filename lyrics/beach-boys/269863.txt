I need a breeze blowing softly
To keep my wind vane from standing
I need a whole lot of sunshine
To keep my sundial advancing
I need some soil 'fore my grass will grow
I need some spark to make my candle glow


Relief I cried
Ain't no shuck 'n' jive
I need a mess of help to stand alone

I need a spark by a fire
To stop the cold of my winter
I need a burst of your raindrops
To keep a flow in my river
I need a call for my phone will ring
I need your song for my voice will sing

Please realize
I'm not half alive
Without a mess of help to stand alone

(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)

(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)

I need the warmth of your smile
To heat my frostbitten sorrow
I need your hand on my shoulder
To lead todays to tomorrows
I need your strength to lock me to the track
I need your trust to bust the things I lack

Belief I cried
Ain't no shuck  'n' jive
I need a mess of help to stand alone

(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)

(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
