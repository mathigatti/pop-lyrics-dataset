We've been friends now for so many years 
We've been together through the good times and the tears 
Turned each other on to the good things that life has to give 


We drift apart for a little bit of a spell 
One night I get a call and I know that you're well 
And days I was down you would help me get out of my hole 

Ohhhhhhhh 

Let's be friends 
Let's be friends 
Let's be friends 

You told me when my girl was untrue 
I loaned you money when the funds weren't too cool 
I talked your folks out of making you cut off your hair 

We've been friends now for so many years 
We've been together through the good times and the tears 
Dim dipple ee dim dipple ay dim dipple oo dim dee aye oh
