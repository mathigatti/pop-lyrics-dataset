Over the city in an airplane
 I can see everything below
 The houses they look so tiny
 The cars look like dots
 We've only got fifteen minutes to go
 
 The clouds in the sky caress my mind so tenderly
 The sun shines down on the great big beautiful scene
 
 The sound of the engine fills my ears up
 I'm hopin' this rainy weather clears up
 My lover is waiting at the airport
 Soon she'll be kissing me hello
 
 The woman sitting next to me tells me 'bout her guy
 And I tell her all about you and I
 
 Airplane, airplane
 Carry me back to her side
 Airplane, airplane
 I need God as my guide
 Down, down on the ground
 Can't wait to see her face
 
 (a-1, a-2, a-1, 2, 3)
 I can't wait (can't wait)
 To see (her face)
 I can't wait (can't wait)
 To see (her face)
 I can't wait (can't wait)
 To see (her face)
 I can't wait (can't wait)
 To see (her face)
 I can't wait (can't wait)
 To see (her face)
 I can't wait (can't wait)
 To see (her face)
 I can't wait (can't wait)
 To see (her face)
 I can't wait (can't wait)
 To see (her face)
 I can't wait (can't wait)
 To see (her face)
