He sat up in his open window
 Looking quietly down at the path
 A firefly flew in his room and flew right out again
 
 Down jumped the prince
 And he went again to find his radio
 
 (Magic transistor radio)
 (Glowing magic transistor radio)
 (Glowing magic transistor radio)
 As he made his way he could hear something once again
 (Glowing magic transistor radio)
 There was that transistor up on the same tree
 
 Then from inside of it came a strange voice
