When I watched you walk with him
Tears filled my eyes
And when I heard you talk with him
I couldn't stand his lies
And now before he tries it
I hope you realize it girl


(Let him run wild)
(He don't care baby)
Let him run
(Let him run wild)
(He'll find out baby)
Let him run
(Let him run run run run wild baby)

(Guess you know I waited for you girl)
He'll do the same to other girls
That he did to you
Then one day he'll run in to one
That's gonna hurt him too
So before he makes you over
I'm gonna take you over

(Let him run wild)
(He don't care baby)
Let him run
(Let him run wild)
(He'll find out baby)
Let him run
(Let him run run run run wild baby)

(Guess you know I waited for you girl)
All the dreams you shared with him
You might as well forget
I know you need a truer love
And that's what you'll get
And now that you don't need him
Well he can have his freedom

(Let him run wild)
(He don't care baby)
Let him run
(Let him run wild)
(He'll find out baby)
Let him run
(Let him run run run run wild baby)
Let him run
(Let him run run run run wild baby)
Let him run
(Let him run run run run wild baby)
Let him run
