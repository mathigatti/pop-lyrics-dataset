Last night I went out disco dancing
Saw a foxy girl out on the floor
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need


She came to my table, we both ordered something to drink (something to drink)
Before you know it, what do you think
The music started playin'

Oo the music got us so excited
And we had to get up on our feet
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need

The place was near closing, I offered to take her home (take her home)
But she was with someone and left me alone
But I still remember

Oo I know I never will forget her
And I hope I get to see her again.

She's got rhythm, she's got something I need (never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need (never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need (never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need (never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need (never will forget her)
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Never will forget her
