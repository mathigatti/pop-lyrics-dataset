Won't you come here and lie lady Lynda with me
We can lie in the green canyon meadows
And we'll hear the birds sing in the spring
Don't you know if you;ll stay lady Lynda with me
We can talk about love everafter
When you lie lady Lynda with me


Lynda, won't you say that we can be near
Cannot deny there've been hard times
Darlin', evolution is drawing us near
Look in my eyes whoa

Lynda, won't you say that I am your man
Don't look surprised, it's all in his plan
But darlin', evolution is drawing us near
Lie lady lie

Oooh lady won't you lie lady

Now won't you stay lady Lynda with me
We can talk about love everafter
When you lie lady Lynda with me

Ohh lady won't you lie lady
Won't you ooh lady won't you stay lady with me
When you lie lady Lynda

Come along with me
Ohh lady won't you lie lady
Won't you lie with me
Darlin' you know you make my heart sing
Won't you come along and sing a song
Sing the sound of love
Ohh lady won't you lie lady
Won't you lie with me 
Darlin your love is like the coming spring
Won't you come along and sing a song
Sing the song my love
Ohh lady won't you lie lady
Won't you lie with me Darlin your love is like the coming spring
Won't you come along and sing a song
Sing the song my love
Ohh lady won't you lie lady
Won't you lie with me 
Darlin your love is like the coming spring
Won't you come along and sing a song
Sing the song my love
Ooh lady won't you lie lady won't you marry me
