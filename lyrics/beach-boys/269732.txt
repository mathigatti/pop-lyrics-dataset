Hold on dear Brother
Hold on dear Brother
Hold on dear Brother
Oh Brother
Ooooo


Tried to close my eyes
To all around me
Oh no you just can't escape
If I lose one friend
Will I still have you

Won't you please
Hold on dear Brother
Hold on dear Brother
Hold on dear Brother
Oh Brother
Ooooo

What can I love that isn't you
But you never understand inside of me
Till you realize a look
You never get more than you took

Won't you please
Hold on dear Brother
Hold on dear Brother
Hold on dear Brother
Oh Brother
Brother

In your heart you know it love
A simple feeling that you shout
I want your love
You touch my hand
I need your love
To carry me home

In your heart you know it love
A simple feeling that you shout
I want your love
You touch my
I need your love
To carry me home

Hold on dear Brother
