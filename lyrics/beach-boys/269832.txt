Way back when well our master plan
Was havin' fun fun fun as America's band
Well we came out rockin' with Rhonda and Barbara Ann
Singin' of surf and sand


Now when we look back over all the fun we had
If our lifestyle's over now it sure is sad
We gotta get back to livin' without a care
Give me sunshine water and an ozone layer

Paradise is a state of mind
Where Mother Nature nurtures and man is kind
We need a change now wouldn't it be nice
If we could bring back summer

Get us back our summer
Summer in paradise
(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)

They chop down the forests
And in their haste leave a trail of destruction
And toxic waste is leavin' no one safe
In their home or their habitat
Can't let it go like that

Too much consumption and too much greed
When you consider all the people
That are livin' in need
Interdependence in this world is a natural fact
And we're all under attack

It's the eve of destruction or so they say
But mankind doesn't have to go that way
If we all get together we can make things right
And we can bring back summer

Get us back our summer
Summer in paradise
(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise

Surfers recycle now don't you know
Like evryone from California to Kokomo
We're gonna keep on rockin'
And raisin' world consciousness
We gotta fix this mess

Looked in the future and what I saw
Was a world in harmony with natural law
There's trouble now but it will be alright if we can

Bring back summer
Get us back our summer
Summer in paradise

Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise

Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise

(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise

(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise
