Darlin', you can count on me
 Til the sun dries up the sea
 ([...])
 Until then, I'll always be
 Devoted to you
 
 I'll be yours through endless time
 I'll adore your charms sublime
 Guess by now you know that I'm
 Devoted to you
 
 I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie
 I'll never be untrue
 I'll never give you reason to cry
 I'd be unhappy if you were blue
 
 Through the years, my love will grow
 Like a river, it will flow
 It can't die because I'm so
 Devoted to you
 
 I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie
 I'll never be untrue
 I'll never give you reason to cry
 I'd be unhappy if you were blue
 
 Through the years, my love will grow
 Like a river, it will flow
 It can't die because I'm so
 Devoted to you
 
 Ba ba ba ba ba
 Ba ba ba ba ba ba bom
 
 (That was beautiful.)
 (Great.)
 (Yay!)
 (*Clapping*)
 (That was great.)
 (Hey, Brian, I [...])
