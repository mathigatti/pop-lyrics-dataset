I'm so lonely
Really, really so lonely
I wish that you'd com comfort me whoa
I'm so brokenhearted
Since we've been parted


I've wished since you went away
That you'd soon be back to stay
I'm so lonely for your love tonight

Since you left, it's been this way
Every night and every day
When will it,
When will it ever change whoa

I've wished since you went away
That you'd soon be back to stay
I'm so lonely for your love tonight
