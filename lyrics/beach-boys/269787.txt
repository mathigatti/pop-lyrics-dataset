Now that I have lost my Diane
There's no plan as to where to go
It was hard to lose my Diane
Now I just miss her so


Everything is old and nothing is new
All I ever do is think of you
Memories haunt me night and day

(Ahhhhhhhhhhh)

Do you think of me, my Diane
Or have you forgotten me?
Did you think that you were chained down
And now that you are free

Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might
Shadows hanging over my head
I love you Diane I miss you Diane

Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might

Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might

Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might

Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might
