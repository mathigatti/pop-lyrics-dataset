Rio Grande Rio Grande
I'd swim you but I can't
Late at night flickering fire
Keeps me warm and safe from harm
Little man, understands
The Indian's upperhand
Never stray, always travel in groups of ten

Cherokee trail (trail)
Cherokee trail (trail)
I'm ridin' you all alone
Cherokee trail (trail)
Cherokee trail (trail)
I can't find my way back home

Oh the great big river
Rolls on and on
Oh the great big river
Makes my heart beat strong
Yeah the great big river
Rolls on and on
And the great big river
Makes my heart beat strong
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on

Ahhh-ahhhhh-ahhhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhhhh
Ahhh-ahhhhh-ahhhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhhhh
Big big big sky
Ahhh-ahhhhh-ahhhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhhhh
Big big big sky
[Undertands the Indian's]
Ahhh-ahhhhh-ahhhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhhhh

Ahhh-ahhhhh-ahhhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhhhh

Night bloomin' jasmine
It comes a-creepin' through my window
Night bloomin' jasmine
While I'm a-sleepin' near my window

It comes a-creepin' through my window
Night bloomin' jasmine
While I'm a-sleepin' near my window
