You got me calling at all hours of the night
I don't think it's right
But still I do it


You got me thinking your existence is my life
It's time to see the light
I think I'll leave it

Maybe, I don't know
I tried to take it slow
But I don't know
Maybe, I don't know
But if you say it's so
We can make it go
Maybe, I don't know

Whatever made me think that we could make it good?
Did you think we ever would?
No need in lyin'
No, no, no
I need your guarantee so I can be assured
Do you ever think you could?
No more depriving
Na-a-na-na-na

Maybe, I don't know
I tried to take it slow
But I don't know
Maybe, I don't know
But if you say it's so
We can make it go
Maybe, I don't know

Maybe, I don't know
I tried to take it slow
But I don't know
Maybe, I don't know
But if you say it's so
We can make it go
Maybe, I don't know
