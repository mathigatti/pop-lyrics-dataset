This is so far from China
The star light like to blind ya
A lover's way of saying come home soon
Put it in a letter
Let each star there remind ya
It's time for love to find ya
A palm tree in the moon


When a comet comes out to fall
Why on earth do we feel so small
Must be heaven that we hear call
And in this natural planet
I feel like catching your hand
Out under our palm tree and moon

I put it in a letter
How could I love you better
And dropped it in a bottle in the sea
Put it in a letter
I don't know where it went so
I sent to Sacramento
Said you were meant for me

What a time to be talking small
But a crime not to talk at all
When it's heaven that we hear call
There ain't a cloud in the sky
No allowin' for why
Out under our palm tree and moon

hoo do you
Hoo do you
Put it in a letter
Put it in a letter
You were meant for me

What a time to be talking small
But a crime not to talk at all
When it's heaven that we hear call
And for us two silhouettes
It's just as good as it gets
Out under our palm tree and moon
