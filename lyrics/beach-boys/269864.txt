You're kinda small
And your such a doll
I'm glad you're mine
You're so good to me
How come you are


You take my hand 
And you understand
When I get in a bad mood
You're so good to me
And I love it, love it

You're my baby, oh yeah
Don't mean maybe, oh yeah

I know your eyes 
Are not on 'ther guys
When we're apart
You're so true to me
How come you are

And every night
You hold me so tight
When I kiss you goodbye
You're so good to me
And I love it, love it

You're my baby, oh yeah
Don't mean maybe, oh yeah

You're my baby, oh yeah
Don't mean maybe, oh yeah

You're my baby, oh yeah
Don't mean maybe, oh yeah
