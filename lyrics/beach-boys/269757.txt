The flame of love we had has finally died
Can't take this emptiness it left inside
It's over now


And though I played the role I lost my soul
It's still within your heart
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me

The noise outside my window carries on
Like distant bugles love is very gone
It's over now

It took a part of me, the heart of me
To watch it fade away
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me

Heaven
Heaven is far away
Angels no longer play

I need to take this fear and force it down
And just pretend that you are not around
It's over now

I'll put a Frank Sinatra album on
And cry my blues away
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me
