There's a story told of a very gentle boy
 And the girl who wore his ring
 Through the wintery snow
 The world they knew was one
 For their hearts were full of spring
 
 As the days grew old
 And the nights passed into time
 And the weeks and years took wind
 Gentle boy, tender girl
 Their love remained still young
 For their hearts were full of spring
 
 Then one day they died
 And their graves were side by side
 On a hill where robins sing
 And they say violets
 Grow there the whole year round
 For their hearts were full of spring
