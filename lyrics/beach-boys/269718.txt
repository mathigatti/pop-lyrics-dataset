I wake up in the mornin' just to work all through the day
That sun can get so hot that you can sweat your strength away
And ooooohhhhhhhh come the night time


Gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind o' woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I gotta find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl

But I still get up in the mornin'
Though it's so hard all day long
If it weren't for the love of a woman
I don't think I'd continue on
And oooohhhhh come the night time

Gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind o' woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I gotta find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl

I'm gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind of woman

Hungry
Hungry for my kind o' woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I gotta find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl
