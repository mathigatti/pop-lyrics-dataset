Noble (ain't joshin')
Surfer (ain't joshin')
He's the number one man (he's movin')


The surfers call him "Noble"
And that's just what he is
He's dedicated to the mighty sea

Surfin' night and day
Never twice in one spot
He's somethin' you and I would like to be

Surfer (ain't joshin')
He's the number one man (he's movin')

He's not afraid of body whop
From ten feet or more
He never backs away from a swell

Hurachis on his feet
Bushy hair on his head
And where he's going he'd never tell

A surfin' Cassanova
With his customized board
A Woody and his dirty white jeans

He takes his choice of honeys
Up and down the coast
The finest surfer yet to make the scene
