There's a moon in the sky somewhere I know
Waiting for all the love to burn below
If you fall and it happens all to soon
Blame it all on the surfer moon


'Neath the hill 'hind the cloud one dreamy night
Rising up throwing down its golden light
If your heart hears this melancholy tune
Then you'll know it's the surfer moon

Brings the tide in
Takes it all away
Helps us ride in
Brings us waves each day
I say

Other moons have brought light and love before
Promising to remain for evermore
But they all disappeared with each new tune
They make way for the surfer moon

Moon
Moon
Moon
Moon
