The other night, they were playing our song
Hadn't heard it for, oh, so long
Took me back, darlin', to that time in my car
When you cried all night, cause we'd gone too far


Can I ever getcha back
Getcha back, baby
Gonna getcha back, getcha back
Getcha back, getcha back, baby
Gonna getcha back, getcha back
Can I ever getcha back

I'm getting tired laying around here at night
Thinkin' 'bout some other guy holding you tight
He may have money and a brand new car
May even treat you like a movie star
And no matter what he ever do for you
He can never love you like I can do
So if I leave her and you leave him

Can we ever get it back again
Getcha back, getcha back, baby
Gonna getcha back, getcha back
Getcha back, getcha back, baby
Gonna getcha back, getcha back
Can I ever getcha back

Bow bow bow oop

Bow bow bow oop

(Getcha back) I'll leave her
(Getcha back) and you leave him
(Getcha back) can we make it
(Getcha back) get it back again

(Getcha back) I'll leave her
(Getcha back) and you leave him
(Getcha back) can we make it
(Getcha back) get it back again

(Getcha back) I'll leave her
(Getcha back) and you leave him
