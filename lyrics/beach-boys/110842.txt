(What?)
 (Get out of here!)
 
 (Oh, man!)
 (Oh, rock out!)
 
 Standin' on a mountain lookin' down on a city
 The way I feel is a doggone pity
 Teardrops fallin' down the mountainside
 Many times I've been here, many times I've cried
 We used to be so happy when we were in love
 High on a mountain of love
 
 Night after night I'm a-standin' here alone
 Weepin' out my heart (*laugh*) till the cold grey dawn
 Prayin' that you're lonely and you'll come here too
 Hopin' just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
 (Oh yeah!)
 Trying hard to find you somewhere up above
 High on a mountain of love
 
 The mountain of love, the mountain of love
 You should be ashamed
 You used to be a mountain of love
 But you just changed your name
 
 Way down below there's a half a million people
 Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
 Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers
 Wedding bells are ringin' and they should've been ours
 That's why I'm so handy, my dream is gone above
 High on a mountain of love
 
 ([...])
 (Keep playin' it like it is!)

 High on a mountain of love
 
 The mountain of love, the mountain of love
 You should be ashamed
 You used to be a mountain of love
 But you just changed your name
 
 Way down below there's a half a million people
 Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
 Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers
 Wedding bells are ringin' and they should've been ours
 That's why I'm so lonely, my dream is gone above
 High on a mountain of love
 High on a mountain of love
 High on a mountain of love
 High on a mountain of love
 
 (What, honey?)
 High on a mountain of love.
 (Hahahaha.)
 Ooh baby...
 (That's good.)
 ...one more time. Oooh baby. Oooooo.
 (That's a good voice.)
