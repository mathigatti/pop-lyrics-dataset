The boat rides we would take
The moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our favorite songs
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long


The Midway and the fun
The Cupie dolls we won
The bell I rung to prove that I was strong
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

The early morning hike
The rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack

We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back
The leaves began to fade
Like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long
