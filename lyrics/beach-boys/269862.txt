Why don'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
Why don'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)


Little girl, wontcha come out tonight?
They're playin' our song
Little girl, wontcha come out tonight?
Please don't keep me long

I've been anticipatin', seeing you all day long
And all the while I'm waitin'
I find myself a-singing this little song

Little girl, wontcha come out tonight?
They're playin' our song
Little girl, wontcha come out tonight?
Please don't keep me long

Soon as the music start playin'
I start to thinkin' of you
That's when you'll hear me sayin'
Pretty please, baby, here's what I ask of you

Little girl, wontcha come out tonight?
They're playin' our song
Little girl, wontcha come out tonight?
Please don't keep me long

Late at night when I'm sleepin'
I get to dreamin' of you
That's when I find myself schemin'
Of ways that I can spend all my nights with you

Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)

Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)

Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)

Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)

Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
Why don'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)

Why don'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
Why don'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
