Keep an eye on Summer this year
Keep an eye on Summer
Keep an eye on


We said goodbye last September
Your words I still can hear
Keep an eye on Summer this ahh haaa ahhhh (Summer)
(Keep an eye on)
Those things I say in my letters
YouÕll find them most sincere
Keep an eye on Summer this year-ear-ear

Soon weÕll be graduating
And weÕll be so far apart
And though you could be dating
IÕm waiting and waiting

And as we look at the future
Though it be through a tear
Keep an eye on Summer this (year)ahh haaa ahhhh
(Keep an eye on Summer)
(Keep an eye on)
Ahhh haaaa ahhhh
(Keep an eye on Summer)
(Keep an eye on)
Ahhh haaaa ahhhh
(Keep an eye on Summer)
(Keep an eye on)
Ahhh haaaa ahhhh
