(All right.)
Here I stand...
(There you go.)
...head in hand...
(Denny!)
...Hide your tears...
(Let him sing it.)
(Oh!)
(He knows it better than I do.)


Ooom pom pom

(King Arthur!)

Here I stand, head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
(Shhhhhhhhh!)
(This is great!)

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

(Go!)
Hey! (*Laughter*) You've got to hide your love away
Hey! (*Laughter*) You've got to hide your love away
(Hey hey.)

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hear them, see them
In the state I'm in
(Be quiet.)

How could she say to me
"Love will find a way"
Gather round, all you clowns
Let me hear you say

(Hey!)
(*Laughter*)
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

Do do doooo do-do-do
Doo bum bum do do
Do do dooo do
Dooo do-do-do
Do do do-do do do doooooo

(Wow, that was good.)
(Wow, that's great!)
(That was really good.)
Hey! Somebody hid my teeth away
(Just call that number...)
Hey! Somebody hid my teeth away
(Everly Brothers.)
(Hey!)
(What's the best Everly Brothers song? Besides, ah...)
(Go.)
("Bird Dog.")
(Who's gonna fool with it?)
(You're gonna fool with it. You and me.)
(You shouldn't fool with an Everly Brothers song--you should do it right.)
(Just like we fooled with "Wake Up Little Susie.")
(No, ah, "Devoted To You.")
("Devoted To You." Well, Carl, do you know the guitar part?)
(Yeah.)
(You must know the guitar part.)
(Here, I've got it right here.)
(He's gotta go check the [...] now.)
(*Lots of chatter and laughter*)
(That's it!)
(How are you gonna sing a slow song like that one if nobody will shut up?)
(Hey, be quiet will ya?)
(Just die your hair bright red.)
(Hey, shh, just be quiet and let us sing it.)
(Just shut up for a little while because Brian and I are gonna sing it.)
(If you don't know it, then shut up and go home!)
(Yes! *Laugh*)
