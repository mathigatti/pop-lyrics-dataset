I found my thrill
 On Blueberry hill
 On Blueberry hill
 When I found you
 
 The moon stood still (moon stood still)
 On Blueberry hill (Blueberry hill)
 It lingered until (lingered until)
 My dream true (true)
 
 Though we're apart (we are apart)
 I think of you still (think of you still)
 For you were my friend (you were my friend)
 On Blueberry hill
 
 The wind in the willow played
 Love's sweet melody
 But all those vows you made
 Were never to be
 
 Though we're apart (we are apart)
 I think of you still (think of you still)
 For you were my friend (you were my friend)
 On Blueberry hill
 
 I found my thrill (found my thrill)
 On Blueberry hill (Blueberry hill)
 On Blueberry hill (Blueberry hill)
 When I found you (you)
 
 The moon stood still (moon stood still)
 On Blueberry hill (Blueberry hill)
 It lingered until (lingered until)
