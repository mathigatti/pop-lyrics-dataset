We look like we know what we're doing
When they ask us to play
Only takes two or three minutes
To warm up and give it our best
And beat all the rest
The girls in the stands and all of our fans


We're for our team yeah
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one

We run out onto the court
We're playing our favorite sport
We don't care about the big guys
We're taking them down to our size
And we get a rise
From the girls in the stands and all of our fans

Yeah

We're for our team yeah
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one

Give it our best
And beat all the rest
For the girls in the stands and all of our fans

We're for our team yeah
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one

You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one

You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one

You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one
