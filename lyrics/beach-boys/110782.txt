Check out the chick with the new dress on
(Wearin' a shift and it looks real fine)
The call it a shift and it comes on strong
(Wearin' a shift and it looks real fine)
When she's got it on
well she can't do no wrong
(Wearin' a shift
wearin' a shift)


You may think a dress can't do very much
(Wearin' a shift really turns me on)
With the slit up the side
you can't resist that touch
(Wearin' a shift really turns me on)
It's tighter than a moo-moo and it's just too much
(Wearin' a shift
wearin' a shift)

(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Can't go wrong now) (go wrong now)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Turns me on now) (turns me on now)

Get your girl a shift and she'll look real fine
(Wearin' a shift and it's just too much)
It fits like a glove and drives you outta your mind
(Wearin' a shift and it's just too much)
She'll ball it with her shift on and we'll have a good time
(Wearin' a shift
wearin' a shift)

(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
