I love to pick you up
 'Cause you're still a baby to me
 Cribs and cradles and bottles and toys
 Are part of the joys they bring
 
 I wanna wash your face
 And change your clothes and button your shoes
 Walk you around and wrestle with you
 Then I'm gonna make you sing
 
 In the mornin' I could wake you up
 Feed you breakfast from a little cup
 
 I want to pick you up
 Rock you back and forth and make you smile
 I want to hold you close for a while
 
 I wanna tickle your feet
 Drop you in your little tub
 Wash your body and shampoo your hair
 Be careful not to sting your eyes
 
 When it's night I'll put you in your bed
 And I'll bend and kiss ya on your head
 
 I want to pick you up
 Rock you back and forth and make you smile
 I want to hold you close for a while
 
 Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt butt
 She's going to sleep be quiet
 Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt
 She's going to sleep
 Little baby go to sleep
