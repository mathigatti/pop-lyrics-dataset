Sherry, she needs me
And there's nothing I can do
Sherry, she needs me
And I think I need her, too


Sherry, if you start cryin'
It'll break my heart
So before we both start cryin'
I'll just walk away

Sherry baby, I just can't stand it
It didn't work out the way we planned it
Sherry baby, I just can't stand it
Sherry baby
Sherry baby, it's time we said goodbye

Sherry, believe me
It's so hard to say we're through
Please keep your cool dear
And I'll still be friends with you

Sherry, don't hate her guts
Just 'cause she took me away
And maybe you'll wanna make friends
With her someday

Sherry baby, I just can't stand it
It didn't work out the way we planned it
Sherry baby, I just can't stand it
Sherry baby
Sherry baby, it's time we said goodbye

Oh oh ho ho oh
Oh ho ho ho oh
Oh ho ho ho yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
