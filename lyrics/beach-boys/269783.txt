Tonight I'll drive home all alone
And maybe later we'll talk on the phone
But it takes a little more to get me through
If we can't get together here's what we'll do
Hold on


And meet me in my dreams tonight
Baby close your eyes and hold on tight
Sleep in my arms until the mornin' light
Meet me in my dreams tonight

I've been waitin' all day
Now I won't let nothin' stand in my way
'Cause I just can't wait to see your face
At the usual time and the usual place
Hold on

And meet me in my dreams tonight
Baby close your eyes and hold on tight
Sleep in my arms until the mornin' light
Meet me in my dreams tonight

Oh lullabye (bye) baby (bye)
Goodnight (bye) baby (bye)
Oh lullabye (bye) baby (bye)
Goodnight (bye) baby (bye)
La-hullabye (bye) baby (bye)
Goodnight (bye) baby (bye)

Gotta get together gotta really try
There's a wonderland waitin' for you an I
Hold on hold on

Meet me in my dreams tonight
Baby close your eyes and hold on tight
Sleep in my arms until the mornin' light
Meet me in my dreams tonight

Meet me in my dreams tonight
Baby close your eyes and hold on tight
Sleep in my arms until the mornin' light
Meet me in my dreams tonight

Meet me in my dreams tonight
Baby close your eyes and hold on tight
Sleep in my arms until the mornin' light
Meet me in my dreams tonight

Meet me in my dreams tonight
Baby close your eyes and hold on tight
Sleep in my arms until the mornin' light
