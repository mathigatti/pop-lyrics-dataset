Winds of change blow 'round my door
Is this the year I've been waiting for?
Worlds in motion endlessly
Cosmic ocean flows into my heart


Part of me would like to be (would like to be)
A shining lighthouse for all to see (for all to see)
When the dark night hides the sun
Shine a light for everyone to see
Isn't that the way it should be?

I am no stranger to a world of change
There are always situations to rearrange
But there's something special 'bout this quiet dawn
It seems to sing a song to everyone
It's dawning on and on and on

Of change are here at last (are here at last)
The clouds have lifted, the storm has passed (the storm has passed)
Nights we've known are on the run
And there's a bright and shining sun
For everyone to see
Winds of change

(Won't last forever)
(Won't last forever)
(Won't last forever
