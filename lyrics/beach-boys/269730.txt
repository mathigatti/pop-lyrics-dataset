Hey, little tomboy, sit here on my lap
I got things that I gotta tell you
No more skateboards, put away your baseball mitt.
Your rough livin' days are through


You could find places to go
You could see that boys love you so
They're doin' it all over the world

Hey, little, hey, little, hey, little tomboy
Time to turn into a girl
Hey, little, hey, little, hey, little tomboy
They're doin' it all over the world

Hey, little tomboy, I've had my eyes on you
Thinkin' what a girl you could be
Mmm, I smell perfume, let's try some cut-off jeans
Look at all the changes I see

I'm gonna teach you to kiss
You're gonna feel just like this
They're doin' it all over the world

Hey, little, hey, little, hey, little tomboy
Time to turn into a girl
Hey, little, hey, little, hey, little tomboy
They're doin' it all over the world

(Hey, little, hey, little, hey, little tomboy)
I'm gonna make you a girl
(Hey, little, hey, little, hey, little tomboy)
You'd make a beautiful girl
(Hey, little, hey, little, hey, little tomboy)
They're doing it all over the world
