Aruba, Jamaica, oh I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go
Jamaica off the Florida keys


There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go to get away from it all

Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, oh I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go

Oh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where you wanna go
Way down to Kokomo

To Martinique, that Monserrat Mystique

We'll put out to sea
And we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy a little bit of gravity

Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, oh I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go

Oh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo

Port Au Prince I wanna catch a glimpse

Everybody knows
A little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go
And get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, oh I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go

Oh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, oh I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go

Oh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
