We knew it must have been late
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
We had no time to wait
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
I went to light the fireplace
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
I planned it all this way
and
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)


I snuggled close to her
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
Her heart began to purr
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
I held my breath inside
and then
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
I put my arms around her
(Tick-tock)

Cuckoo
cuckoo (go away silly bird)
Cuckoo
cuckoo (go away silly bird)
Cuckoo
cuckoo (go away silly bird)
Cuckoo

I put that birdie away
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
His cuckoo was gone to stay
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
We both apologized for why
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
Forgave that doggone cuckoo

I went back to her side
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
I had to swallow my pride
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
The fire had almost died away
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
We just got situated
(Tick-tock)

Cuckoo
cuckoo (go away silly bird)
Cuckoo
cuckoo (go away silly bird)
Cuckoo
cuckoo (go away silly bird)
Cuckoo
cuckoo

I took that clock apart
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
I broke the cuckoo's heart
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
He'll never bother us again
(Tick-tock
tick-tock)
We just forgot about him
(Tick-tock)

Cuckoo
cuckoo (go away silly bird)
Cuckoo
cuckoo (go away silly bird)
Cuckoo
cuckoo (go away silly bird)
Cuckoo
