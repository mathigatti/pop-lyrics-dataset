I've been cruisin' round the town now with the guys for quite a while
We been thinkin' 'bout starting up a club that shows some class and style
And we'll get the finest cars


We got a Deuce Coupe, a Stingray, a rail job and an XKE
(We'll start a car club)
We'll be the fastest at the drags, man, we'll really cut some low ETs
(We'll start a car club)
And wipe out the other clubs

We'll set a meet, and get a sponsor, and collect some dues
And you can bet that we'll have our jackets on wherever we cruise

We'll get the roughest and the toughest initiation we can find
(We'll start a car club)
And if you want to try to get in we'll really put you through the grind
(We'll start a car club)
This club's the very best

We'll set a meet, and get a sponsor, and collect some dues
And you can bet that we'll have our jackets on wherever we cruise

We'll get the roughest and the toughest initiation we can find
(We'll start a car club)
And if you want to try to get in we'll really send you through the grind
(We'll start a car club)
This club's the very best

Start a club, a car club
(Start a car club)
Start a club, a car club
(Start a car club)
Start a club, a car club
(Start a car club)
Start a club, a car club
(Start a car club)
