There's a world where
I can go and
Tell my secrets to
In my room.
In my room.


In this world I
Lock out all my
Worries and my fears
In my room.
In my room.

Do my dreaming and my scheming.
Lie awake and pray.
Do my crying and my sighing.
Laugh at yesterday.

Now, it's dark and
I'm alone, but
I won't be afraid
In my room.
In my room.
