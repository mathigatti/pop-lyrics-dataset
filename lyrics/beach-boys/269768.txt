To get t'you baby I went through the wringer
Ain't gonna let you slip through my fingers
Going to school isn't my fondest desire
But sittin' in class you set my soul on fire
God please let us go on this way


All day long I practiced what to say
I think about this game that I like to play
When I leave you I'm so depressed
'Cause you're my only happiness
God please let us go on this way

Seems we have extra-sensory perception
You can send me thoughts I'd have no objection
Now we can fly high in the sky
We'll live forever, we'll never die

God please let us go on this way
(God please let us go on)
God please let us go on this way
(God please let us go on)

God please let us go on this way
(God please let us go on)
God don't let her slip through my fingers
(God please let us go on)

God please let us go on this way
