If every word I said
Could make you laugh
I'd talk forever (together my love)
I ask the sky just what we had
Mmm it shone forever
(Together my love my my my my my my my my my my my my my)
If the song I sing to you
Could fill your heart with joy
I'd sing forever (together my love my my my my)
Forever
Forever
I've been so happy loving you


Do do do do do do do do do together my love

Let the love I have for you
Live in your heart
And beat forever (together my love)
Forever
Forever
I've been so happy loving you

Baby just let me sing it my baby
I wanna be singin' my baby
Baby baby baby my baby
I wanna be singin'
I wanna be singin' my baby
Oh oh oh oh
My my my my my my

So I'm goin' away
Mmm but not forever
Na na na na
I gotta love you anyway

Forever
