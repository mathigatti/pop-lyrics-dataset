I'm gonna be round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table


If you brought a big brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot

I'm gonna eat my, my vegetables
Im gunna love my, my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table

Oh oh taba vega vegel

I tried to kick the ball but my tenny flew right off
I'm red as a beet 'cause I'm so embarassed

Mommy and Daddy says
Sleep a lot eat a lot brush em like crazy
Run a lot do a lot never be lazy
Sleep a lot eat a lot brush em like crazy
Run a lot do a lot never be lazy

Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh yeah

Oh badumday oh dum do dum de dooby do

I throw away my candy bar and I ate the wrapper
And when they told me what I did I burst into laughter

I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in
Your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vege-table
