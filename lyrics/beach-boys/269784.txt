I wonder why nothin' ever seems to go my way
But every time I see you
I get that same old feelin'
And my blues just melt away, melt away


The world's not waiting just for me
The world don't care what I can be
I feel just like an island
Until I see you smilin'
And my blues just melt away, melt away

I won't let you see me suffer
Whoa not me
I won't let you hear me cryin'
Whoa not me
I won't let you see me sighin'
Whoa not me
Whoa oh oh

Sometimes I close up to the world
You know I close up to you girl
But when I hear you talking
I feel my heart unlocking
And my blues just melt away, melt away

Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
(Dit) dit dit dit
(Dit) dit dit dit
(Dit) dit dit dit
(Dit) dit dit dit

And my blues just melt away, melt away

(Melt away) melt away [melt away] (melt away)
Melt away [melt away] (melt away)
Melt away [melt away] (melt away)
Melt away [melt away] (melt away)
Melt away [melt away] (melt away)
Melt away [melt away] (melt away)
