I looked at you baby
And what did I see
I saw love in your eyes
Made me feel so warm inside
Now look at me baby
And what do you see
You see love in my eyes
Gleaming just for you
And now we know it's
Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll get alone together
Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people
The pine-scented air
Smells so good in the snow
In our toboggan we'll go
Screaming down the mountainside
The touch of your cheeks
When they're rosy and cold
Feels so cozy to hold
Just to take you close
And make you warm and
Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll get alone together
Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people
Lyin' down on our backs
Lookin' at the sky
Looking down through the valley so
Deep and wide
Aren't you glad we finally got away
Glad we finally got away
Aren't you glad we finally got away
Now I looked around baby
And what do I see
I see love in your eyes
And I'm so glad that we
Finally had some
Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll get alone together
Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people
