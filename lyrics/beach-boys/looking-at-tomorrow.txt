I've been laying on my back
Like a freight train off a track
Trying to find a job to fit my trade
With the morning sun come 'round
Well I'll be covering plenty of ground
And I don't need nobody to pay my aid
Mmmm pay my aid


Now Bess and me were feeling bad
And all the good jobs they were had
I had to take to sweeping up some floors
Well I don't mind that so much
Or the changing of my luck
But you know I could be doing so much more

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip

Well I'll be coming home tonight
Everything will be all right
And we'll be looking at tomorrow
