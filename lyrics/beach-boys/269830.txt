Sumahama
There's a lover's leap in old Japan
Where the lovers walk along the sand
Hand in hand at Sumahama
Sumahama
Born a lovely oriental daughter
Never ever having met her father
Asks some questions of her mother


Tell me tell me mama
Will you ever go again to Sumahama
Perhaps you'll find love there
Somewhere between the Earth the sky and water
There at Sumahama

Sumahama
In the autumn as the leaves are falling
One can almost hear the lovers calling
From the sea at Sumahama

Sumahama
Years have past and tears have long since dried
But no amount of time could hope to hide
A love so strong from Sumahama

Tell me tell me mama
Will you go with me back to Sumahama
Perhaps you'll find him there
Somewhere between the Earth the sky and water
There at Sumahama

Sumahama
Soko wa koi suru hitotachi ga      (It's where the lovers)
Te ni te o totte aruita            (Walked hand in hand)
Kireino shiroi hama                (Beautiful white beach)

Itsu itsu, mama, Sumahama ni (When, when, mama,)
Itsu mata iku no                   (When will you ever go)
(again to Sumahama)
Sugita ai o sagashi ni iku         (Go searching for the)
(Passed love)
Umi no kanata, Sumahama            (A long way off sea,)
(Sumahama)

Sumahama
There's a lover's leap in old Japan
Where the lovers walk along the sand
Hand and hand at Sumahama
Sumahama

Sumahama, aki ni ki no haga chiru yo ni
(Sumahama, like in autumn leaves are falling)
Sabishiku kanashii koi no uta
(Lonely sad love song)
Sumahama no umi kara
(From the sea at Sumahama)
