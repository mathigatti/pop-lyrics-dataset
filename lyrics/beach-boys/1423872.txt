I bought a pretty cool wagon and we call it a woody
Surf city, here we come
You know, it's not very cherry, it's an oldie but a goody
Surf city, here we come
Well, it ain't got a backseat or a rear window
But it still gets me where I wanna go


Yeah we're goin' surf city, 'cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' surf city, gonna have some fun
You know we're goin' surf city, 'cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' surf city, gonna have some fun, now

They say they never roll the scoops,
Because there's always something goin'
Surf city, here we come
You know, they're either out surfin' or they got a party growin'
Surf city, here we come
Well it's two swingin' honey for every guy
And all you gotta do is just wink your eye

Yeah we're goin' surf city, gonna have some fun
You know we're goin' surf city, 'cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' surf city, gonna have some fun
You know we're goin' surf city, 'cause it's two to one, now

And if my woody breaks down, I'll get somewhere as a surfer
Surf city, here we come
I'll strap my board to my back and hitch a ride in my wet-suit
Surf city, here we come
And when I get to surf city, I'll be shootin' the curl
Checkin' out the parties for the surfer girls

Yeah we're goin' surf city, 'cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' surf city, gonna have some fun
You know we're goin' surf city, 'cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' surf city, gonna have some fun, now
