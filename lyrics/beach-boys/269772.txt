Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Oo-oo


Well a way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
There's a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year working out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)

Just a little bob sleighed we call it old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas man just watch her peel

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer
He don't miss no-one

And haulin' through the snow at a frightenin' speed
With a half a dozen deer with the a-rudy to lead
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
Oo oo oo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year, oo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year, oo
