Started off the day with a thought
That took me far away
I think I found a place
Where I know I could be forever
It's down in San Miguel
Could be in Mexico
Where you don't need no dough
And now I'm gonna go


Lookin' for the ladies of love

I know where I'm going
Going straight ahead
Down into San Miguel
Over the top
We cross the boarder now
Heading into San Miguel

That's where I'm gonna go
Hope you will be coming too
You can kick off your shoes
C'mon it's time to go

Lookin' for the ladies of love

Ow ow

It's down in San Miguel
Could be in Mexico
Where you don't need no dough
And now I'm gonna go

Lookin' for the ladies of love
