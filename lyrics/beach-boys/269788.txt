Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ooooo
Woh no no no no no no oooo


I had a love in every town
I swore that I would sooner die than ever settle down
Me and my hobo heart
Me and my hobo heart

Now look and see what love has done
My feet are rooted to the ground
Just when I wanna turn around and run
Me and my hobo heart
Me and my hobo heart

I look down the lonesome highway
A lover in every town
And I swore that I would far sooner die than
Settle down again
Then I asked myself a question
What places could I go to
What road could I take, what trip could I make
That wouldn't lead back, that wouldn't lead back
To
You

Ahhhhh
Me and my hobo heart

And now my travelin' days are through
And ridin' horses in the sand
Or walkin' with you hand in hand will do
Me and my hobo heart
Me and my hobo heart

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Whoa no no no no no no
