Born of the age
Flagged hopes
Censored rage
The black clad box
Bombs bursting in air
Bleed white red and blue
Cried dawn's early light
For the hope


Oh where has it gone
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July

Lie by the sword
Black times
False reward
The greetings of doom
So proudly they hail
Lost fortune of free
The stripes and bright stars 
Promise lost

Oh where has it gone
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July

Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July
