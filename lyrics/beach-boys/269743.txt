I'm bugged at my ol' man
Cause he's making me stay in my room
(Darn my dad)


I came in a little late
And my ol' man he just blew his mind
(Blew it bad)

Why did he sell my surfboard?
He cut off my hair last night in my sleep

I wish I could see outside
But he tacked up boards on my window
(Gosh it's dark)

I can't hit the surf, can't drag
Can't do a dog-goned thing
(Wish I could)

I tried to call up my chick
But he jerked my phone right out of the wall

They gave me some breadcrumbs
And a little glass of water
And they're out there eating steak
(Smells so good)

I ripped up my wardrobe
And I'm growing a beard
Oh when will they let me come out

I'd listen to my radio
But he took it and he's using it in his own room
(Now it's gone)

I wish I could do some homework
But I got suspended from school
(Blew my cool)

I'm bugged at my ol' man
And he doesn't even know where it's at
