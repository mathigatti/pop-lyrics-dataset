Come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 So come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 So come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 So come on 
 
 Hey baby come on 
 Come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 So come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 Baby come on 
 
 Now get yourself in gear 
 Oh baby come on 
 Still cruisin' after all of these years 
 Hey girl let's go for a spin 
 Hop in my hot rod and do it again 
 
 You've got a greenhouse effect on me 
 I know a secret spot 
 Paradise by the sea 
 We'll find a place to park 
 That's kinda cool after dark 
 
 We'll take a trip on up to the lake 
 Down by the river 
 Where we can make out 
 On the island 
 
 Wake up on the cape 
 Punch up yor favorite staion 
 Toss in your favorite tape 
 When we go cruisin' 
 Well everything is all right 
 
 Come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 Baby when we go cruisin' now 
 
 Baby put your top down 
 Parade around down town 
 People trying to cool down 
 Party all summer long 
 
 Come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 So come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 Baby come on 
 
 Now get yourself in gear 
 Baby baby come on 
 Still cruisin' after all of these years 
 
 Everybody got a favorite spot 
 Where they like to come a lot 
 
 When we go cruisin' Well everything is all right 
 
 Come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 Baby when we go crusin' now 
 
 People dancin' in the sand 
 Rockin' to a reggae band 
 Lovers walkin' hand in hand 
 Party all summer long 
 
 Come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 So come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 Baby come on 
 
 Now get yourself in gear 
 Baby baby come on 
 Still cruisin' after all of these years 
 
 Come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 So come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 Baby come on 
 
 Now get yourself in gear 
 Baby baby come on 
 Still cruisin' after all of these years 
 
 Come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 So come on let's cruise ya got nothin' to lose 
 Baby come on 
 
 Now get yourself in gear 
 Baby baby come on 
 Still cruisin' after all of these years
