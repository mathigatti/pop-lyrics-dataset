I... I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air


CHORUS:

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(oom bop bop good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations
(oom bop bop excitations)
Good,good,good,good vibrations
(oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations
(oom bop bop excitations)
Good good good good vibrations
(oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations
(oom bop bop excitations)

Close my eyes
She's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

CHORUS

(aah my,my what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(ah my,my what a sensation)
(ah my,my what elations)
(ah my,my what)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations
A happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations
A happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations
A happenin'

Aaaah
Good,good,good,good vibrations
(oom bop bop)
(Im pickin up good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations
(oom bop bop)
(excitations)
Good,good,good,good vibrations
(oom bop bop)
She's na na...
