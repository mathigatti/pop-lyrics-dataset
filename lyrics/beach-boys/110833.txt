Cease to resist, come on say you love me
 Give up your world, come on and be with me
 I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see
 
 Come on come on, ooo I love you pretty girl
 My life is yours, and you can have my world
 I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see
 
 Never had a lesson I ever learned
 I know I could never learn not to love you
 Come in now closer
 Come in closer closer closer ahhhh
 
 Submission is a gift given to another
 Love and understanding is for one another
 I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see
 
 Never had a lesson I ever learned
 I know I could never learn not to love you
 Come in now closer
 Come in closer come in closer ahhhh
 
 Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhhhhh
 Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhhhhh
