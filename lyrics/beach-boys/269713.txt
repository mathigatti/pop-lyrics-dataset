Ocean lovers who like to harmonize
They're all cousins friends and brothers
And they make their Mamas cry
They're record-making heart-breaking
Just West Coast boys
What I know it's a beginning of an endless harmony


Striped shirt freedom
Brave new worlds
Go out on the road
Where there's mid-sixties screaming
And that nighttime holiday scheming
While a lifestyle turns to gold
Music's growing
And vibrations showing
What's it all mean?
I know it means there's an endless harmony

And we sang God bless America
It's a land where we tour
She takes great care of us
And people love for where we sing
We sing: Doot doo doot, doot doo doot, doot doo doo doo
