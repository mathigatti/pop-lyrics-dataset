She believes in God
And karma too
Paranormal powers
You know some people do
Got Scorpio risin'
Uh huh
Tell you what's in your stars


She was down in Rio
Turn the heads of state
Got 'em into makin'
This planet a better place
On Copacabana
Uh huh
Oh yeah she radiate better go meditate

Everytime I touch my baby
Strange things happen

Everytime I touch my baby
Strange things happen to me

Oh ohhh ohhhh

Everytime I touch my baby

Met a pshycic reader
With a crystal ball
Had a vision
Said we could have it all
I caught her gazin'
Uh huh
At our destiny cosmically

Everytime I touch my baby
Strange things happen
Oh ohhh ohhhh
Oh oh strange things happen
Everytime I touch my baby
Strange things happen to me

Strange things happen
Oh ohhh ohhhh
Oh oh strange things happen
Everytime I touch my baby
Strange things happen to me
