I love to see you oh my love
 I want to feel you near
 My need is deep inside
 Well I've been rolling on, 
 I've been holding on, 
 I'd like you to know
 That it's been a long, long time
 
 Sometimes it's hard to make it through the day
 Sometimes it's hard to find my way
 Sometimes it's hard to notice the changing days
 When your friends have all gone
 Leaving this town for another one
 
 The night is coming round
 I can feel the weight of coming down,
 So afraid to lose this dream
 I want you to understand that I'm trying to do the best I can
 It's so easy to lose my way
 
 Lay your head where you may find some peace 
 I've been searching for my happiness
 Don't you want to wake up and take my love,
 I'd be happy if you'd let me know
 Should I stay or go
 Let me know
 
 Woke from a dream to see reflections all around me, 
 of new realities, 
 heavenly angels won't you guide me 
 please help me to decide the path most 
 meant for me.
