We know they're right when they say we're not ready
But all we care is how we feel right now
We'll go ahead just the same
Prepare to take the blame
We'll run away and get married anyhow
They warned us that we can't live on love forever
But we just tell them we'll get by somehow
Our problems will be greater
We'll worry 'bout them later
We'll run away and get married anyhow
If other kids went through it
Then I know we can do it
If our love is that much stronger
It will last that much longer
It wasn't too long ago when our folks were
Were going through the same thing we are now
But one thing they're forgetting
A thing they're not regretting
They ran away and got married anyhow
(Ran away and got married)
Anyhow
(Ran away and got married)
They ran away and got married anyhow
