I'm doing this and I'm doing that
And I'm a-walking the floor
I drink a little of this and eat a little that
And poke my head out the door


I get thinking I'm wasting the night away
I wouldn't mind if I could get with you right away
Oh honey don't know how long it's been
But this feeling's building up inside again

I wash the dishes and I rinsed up the sink
Like a busy bee
I make up a song as I'm a-working along
No one's watching me

I wish that you were here to help me dry
When's the last time you baked me a pie
You had a way of making it come alive
It's not too late for you to take a drive

(Baah ba ba ba baah ba ba)
(Baah ba ba ba baah ba ba)

It's not too late
I'd love just once to see you
I'd love just once to see you
I'd love just once to see you
In the nude
