Fun is in, it's no sin
It's that time again
To shed your load, hit the road
On the run again


Summer skies in our eyes
And a warmer sun
It's one for all, all for one
All for, all out fun

Gotta go to it (yeah)
Gotta go through it (yeah)
Gotta get with it

Lookin' good down the hood
Of a funky ride
On your way to the tide
Just to tan your hide

In the shade lemonade
In the sun ocean spray
To get your face in the race
Or lay back's no disgrace

Gotta go to it (yeah)
Gotta go through it (yeah)
Gotta get with it

It's OK to get out there 
And, have some fun
By yourself maybe or else
With the special one

Good or bad, glad or sad
It's all gonna pass
So it's OK let's all play
And enjoy while it lasts

Gotta go to it (yeah)
Gotta go through it (yeah)
Gotta get with it

Find a ride
Find a ride
Find a ride 
Find a ride

In the sun, sun, summertime
In the sun, sun, summertime
