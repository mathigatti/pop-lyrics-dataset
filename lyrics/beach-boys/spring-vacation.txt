Driving around living the dream
I'm cruisin' the town, diggin' the scene
I'm not gonna stress, not gonna worry
Doing our best, no need to hurry


Lookin' ahead with antecipation
Making each day a new celebration
Seems like it could go on forever
Long as we can all stay together

We use to get around
Get up and hit up
All the hot spots in town

Spring vacation
Good vibrations
Summer weather
We're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny
Hey what's it to ya
Halleluiah

As for the past, it's all behind us
Happier now, look where life finds us
Singing our songs is enough reason
Harmony boys is what we believe in

Some said it wouldn't last
All we can say is we're still having a blast

Spring vacation
Good vibrations
Summer weather
We're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny
Hey what's it to ya
Halleluiah

Every night's a special occasion

Spring vacation
Good vibrations
Summer weather
We're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny
Hey what's it to ya
Halleluiah

Spring vacation...
