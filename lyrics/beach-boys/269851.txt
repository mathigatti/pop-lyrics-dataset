I walk the line
I walk the line everyday for you
I keep on workin'
I keep on workin' everyday for you
If I don't get my way this time I'll die
And that's no lie


Walk, walk, walk, I keep on walkin' the line
Run, run, run, I'm runnin' outta my mind
I need your love I need your love tonight
Gimmee, gimmee, gimmee, gimmee lovin' tonight
I need your lovin'
(Lovin')
Lovin'
(Lovin')
Lovin' lovin'
Wah wa-wa wah wah wah

I keep on pushin'
I keep on pushin' so hard for you
I keep on tryin'
I keep on tryin' my best for you
I know we'll keep on searchin' until that day
Till we find a way

Walk, walk, walk, I keep on walkin' the line
Run, run, run, I'm runnin' outta my mind
I need your love I need your love tonight
Gimmee, gimmee, gimmee, gimmee lovin' tonight
I need your lovin'
(Lovin')
Lovin'
(Lovin')
Lovin' lovin'
Wah wa-wa wah wah wah

Walk, walk, walk, I keep on walkin' the line
Run, run, run, I'm runnin' outta my mind (hey hey)
I need your love I need your love tonight
Gimmee, gimmee, gimmee, gimmee lovin' tonight
I need your lovin'
Walk, walk, walk, I keep on walkin' the line
(Lovin')
(Walkin' the line)
Run, run, run, I'm runnin' outta my mind (hey hey)
I need your love I need your love tonight
Gimmee, gimmee, gimmee, gimmee lovin' tonight
I need your lovin'
