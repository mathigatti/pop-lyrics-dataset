Where the sea breeze
Sways the palm trees
Paradise awaits
And so does she


Reliving love
That was like a romance
From a page in history

It was the last place
That he stopped at
On the way back to his boat

She was dancing
Met his glancing
Like they say
It was all she wrote

You know I want to
But I can't stay (bye bye)
Girl you know I'm gonna sail away (sail away)
When the wind comes up
And when the sun goes down
I'll say goodbye to this old island town

Out on the water where the full moon shines
You and Lahaina always on my mind

They left the dance floor
So they could spend more
Precious time near the water side

It wasn't wrong
And it wasn't right
They were two ships
Passing in the night

You know I want to
But I can't stay (bye bye)
Girl you know I'm gonna sail away (sail away)
When the wind comes up
And when the sun goes down
I'll say goodbye to this old island town

I think about you when the full moon shines
Lahaina always on my mind

You know I want to
But I can't stay (bye bye)
Girl you know I'm gonna sail away (sail away)
When the wind comes up
And when the sun goes down
I'll say goodbye to this old island town
I think about you when the full moon shines
Lahaina always on my mind

You know I want to
But I can't stay (bye bye)
Girl you know I'm gonna sail away (sail away)
When the wind comes up
And when the sun goes down
I'll say "goodbye" to this old island town

I think about you when the full moon shines
Lahaina always on my mind
