I'm gonna make her mine
Bom bom bom ba ba bom bom bom bom


I went to Trinidad I didn't
Know just what I had 'til I
Found her

She wears a pretty smile
That compliments her shapely
Style and I found her

Island girl she's oh so pretty
Island girl I like her plenty
Island girl I'm gonna make her mine

Island girl she makes me happy
Island girl she kinda sassy
Island girl I'm gonna make her mine

Everybody's got an island fantasy
For me it's like a Caribbean odyssey
All the people live and love there by the sea
Near the sparkling water 'neath the coco-palm tree

Island girl she make me happy
Island girl she kinda sassy
Island girl won't you show me the way

She's fine so fine all mine
She's so good to me
And I know (i know) our love (or love) so free (so free)
That it was meant to be

Island girl she make me happy
Island girl she kinda sassy
Island girl won't you show me the way

She's a real beauty from the Caribbean
Long dark hair flowin' in the breeze
She's the kinda beauty makes you come alive and
We can live together for eternity

Every now and then I get this silly grin
When I'm there in her company
She says I'm crazy that I'm also very lazy
I know she loves me

Island girl she make me happy
Island girl she kinda sassy
Island girl won't you show me the way
Island girl won't you show me the way
Island girl won't you show me the way
