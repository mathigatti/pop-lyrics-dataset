Five long days and I'm tired of working
I'm going to see my boss today
In fifteen minutes I'll be on the train
'Cause I just got my pay


Now I could take and sock away my dough
And make me six percent a year
But it's not much fun to wait around for that
When I can spend it while it's here

Let's get dressed up
And see a movie

I like spending my money
And I like having a good time
Good times sure make me happy
And I'm so happy 
'Cause I just got my pay

Monday morning I'm up and at it
Those last two days were good for my soul
It's time to do my working thing
I'm late so I got to roll

My take home comes to 'bout ninety-five
And my boss is giving me some praise
If it weren't for me the place would fall apart
I think I'll hit him up for a raise

Let's get undressed
And climb in bed too

I like spending my money
And I like having a good time
Good times sure make me happy
And I'm so happy 
'Cause I just got my pay
