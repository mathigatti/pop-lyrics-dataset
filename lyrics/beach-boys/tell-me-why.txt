Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me


Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sittin' on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't, I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

(Hey!)

Well I'm begging on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
If there's anything I can do
'Cos I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you
Ohhhhhh!

(Is that all? I thought there [...].)
(There was.)
(You did very well.)
(Brian...)
("Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow?")
(Right.)
(Papa papa papa.)
(Where's an E?)
(I forget [...]. Brian, you [...] before?)
(Ah, Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow.)
(Is there an E there?)
(Ah, Papa...)
(Ten more minutes, Brian.)
(Papa. Mama. Ah, ah. Is that it?)
