Yes you are
 Listen
 I'm in the driveway
 Hey what are you talking about?
 I saw you on the lawn
 Hey you
 Hey what?
 Will you will you get off my front lawn with your car?
 Ahh shut up
 What are you doin'?
 Hey he can't talk to him like that
 Yeah what's goin' on?
 I'm gonna call the police
 Hey listen
 What are you talking about?
 I saw the whole thing and you're innocent
 You keep out of it
 Come on guys let's take off
 What are you talking about?
 Ah why don't you go arrest me from here?
 
 Whew it's time for me to meditate
 
 What time is it?
 How long has it been?
 Bubbles and ripples floatin' through my mind
 I must have drifted away
 
 Since I sat down
 Where have I been?
 The mantra my mantra must have took me away
 It must have took me away
 
 Maharishi gave it to me
 And I wonder if it set me free
 And it did
 And he'll tell you "sometimes it goes real fast and other times it goes 
 real slow
 Any way you do it it's bound to work I know"
 
 One two three four
 
 Transcendental meditation should be part of your time
 It's simple it's easy as making this rhyme
 Transcendental meditation really works for me good
 More much more than I thought it would
