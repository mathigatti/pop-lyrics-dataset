We're together again (oh darlin')
We're together again (oh darlin')
Out of all the times you made me cry
Out of all the times you made me sigh
Still we're together again (we're together again)
We're together again (we're together again)


I didn't want ever want you to go
Darlin' I cant help but let the whole world know
That we're together again (we're together again)
We're together, together again

I didn't mean to ever leave you alone
I didn't mean to ever do you wrong
Now that you're back where you belong
I'm gonna love you all night long

We're together again (oh darlin')
We're together again (we're together again)
We're together again (we're together again)
We're together again (we're together again)
We're together again (we're together again)

Darlin'
We're together again
We're together again
We're together again
We're together again
