I wish you'd listen when I tell you now
Baby let your hair grow long
(Baby let your hair grow long)
It's not too late to have another date
Baby let your hair grow long
(Baby let your hair grow long)
In my mind I can see
Just the way you used to be
Don't want girls who don't care about nothin'
And throw their lives away


There's somethin' missin' with you darlin' now
Baby let your hair grow long
(Baby let your hair grow long)
It hurts inside to see you suffer now
Baby let your hair grow long
(Baby let your hair grow long)
There's no way I can help you
You gotta do it all by yourself now
Don't want girls who don't care about nothin'
And throw their lives away
Throw them away

There's gotta be somthin' you're livin' for
You've got to try a little more
I've been waitin' to see that change in you
You can do it just the way you used to do
Whoa-ohh ohh

I wish you'd listen when I tell you now
Baby let your hair grow long
(Baby let your hair grow long)
There's somthin' missin' with you darlin' now
Baby let your hair grow long
(Baby let your hair grow long)
In my mind I can see just the way you used to be
Don't want girls who don't care about nothin'
And throw their lives away

There's somethin' missin' with you darlin' now
Baby let your hair grow long
(Baby let your hair grow long)
It hurts inside to see you suffer now
Baby let your hair grow long
(Baby let your hair grow long)
I wish you'd listen when I tell you now
Baby let your hair grow long
(Baby let your hair grow long)
There's somthin' missin' with you darlin' now
Baby let your hair grow long
(Baby let your hair grow long)
