It looks like rain and it's been comin' on for hours
It looks like rain  I hear the rumble of thunder showers
Pretty soon the rain will play its sweet refrain
While we listen from inside
And until it stops, we'll hear the drips and drops
From beside the fireside


So let it rain 
(pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Yeah and we'll be happy when it stops 
(pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (goin' drip drop drip drop)
'Cause when it rains
(pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (goin' drip drop drip drop)
The ways of love rise in my heart 
(pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (goin' drip drop drip drop)
We won't be sad when there is a storm (ooooo)
And we can be glad (ooooo)
'Cause we can keep warm, yeah, yeah

Listen to the rain
Pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter, pitter patter, pitter patter (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter oooo

A rain swept plain
Soon after springtime rains blow over
Will sprout new grain
And miles of fresh green fields of clover
Winter and its cold soon will lose its hold
With the changes spring will bring

Sun comes pourin' down warmin' up the ground
Bringin' new life with the spring

So let it rain 
(pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Yeah and we'll be happy when it stops 
(pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (goin' drip drop drip drop)
'Cause when it rains 
(pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (goin' drip drop drip drop)
The ways of love rise in my heart 
(pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (goin' drip drop drip drop)
And like the risin' tides love is growin' stronger (ooooo)
Let's ride out the storm just a little bit longer yeah (ooooo)

Listen to the rain
Pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter, pitter patter, pitter patter (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter oooo

Listen to the rain
Pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter, pitter patter, pitter patter (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter oooo

Listen to the rain
Pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter, pitter patter, pitter patter (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter oooo

Listen to the rain
Pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter, pitter patter, pitter patter (goin' drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter oooo
