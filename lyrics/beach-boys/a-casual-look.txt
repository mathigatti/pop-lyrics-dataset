A casual look
A little wink
Can reveal
Just what you think
So don't be shy
Don't even cry
For I am your guy
I am your guy


A soldier boy
When he proposed (baby please)
She said no  (oh, come on, baby)
His face just froze
You know she loved him
But was so young
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one

Oh darling can't you see
That I'm goin' overseas
For two three four years
Don't know how long it will be
So hear hear my plea
And come marry marry me
Before it's too late

And so with a smile
We walked down the aisle
She in her wedding dress
A vision of happiness
And just to think
All it took
Was a casual look
