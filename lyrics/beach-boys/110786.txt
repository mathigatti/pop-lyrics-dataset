We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Round Nassau town we did roam
Drinkin' all night
Got in a fight
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home


So, hoist up the John B sails
See how the mainsail sets
Called for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home! Yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so break up
I wanna go home

The first mate he got drunk
Broke in the captain's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why don't you leave me alone? Yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so break up
I wanna go home!

So, hoist up the John B. sails (hoist up the John B)
See how the mainsail sets (see how the mainsail)
Called for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home!

Let me go home (why don't you let me go home?)
Hoist up the John B sails (hoist up the John B)
I feel so broke up
I wanna go home (let me go home, hoist up the John B)

The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home? Yeah, yeah
This is the worst trip I've ever been on

So, hoist up the John B. sails (hoist up the John B)
See how the mainsail sets (see how the mainsail)
Called for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
