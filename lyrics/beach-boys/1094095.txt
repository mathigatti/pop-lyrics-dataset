Well I'm a long tall Texan

Well I was walkin' down the street 
With my shinin' badge 
My spurs jinglin' down at my feet 
I seen a man a comin' 
Comin' with a gun 
And I just can't be beat 

Well I'm a long tall Texan 
I enforce justice for the law 
(He rides from Texas to enforce the law)

Hurrah hurrah are you the law? 
(He rides from Texas to enforce the law)
