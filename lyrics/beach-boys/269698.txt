Run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run


Well my steady little doll is a real-live beauty
And everybody knows she's a car crazy cutie
She's hip to everything man from customs to rails
And axel grease imbedded 'neath her fingernails

Wo yeah  (Run a-run a doo run run)
Wo oh oh oh (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
Oh oh oh now cutie (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Wo run a-run a doo run run)

A power shift in second and a-ridin' the clutch
My car crazy cutie, man, she's just too much
I take her to the drags, man, and everyone flips
For her big blue eyes and her candy apple  lips

Wo yeah  (Run a-run a doo run run)
Wo oh oh oh oh (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
Oh oh oh now cutie (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Wo run a-run a doo run run)

Yeah oh
Car crazy cutie
Car crazy cutie
Car crazy cutie
Car crazy cutie

Well I guess you might say she's the rodder's dream gal
Always there to help, man, when you need a pal
But when I talk of lovin' man, some kisses and hugs
Says she's like to take 'em better clean and gap the plugs

Wo yeah  (Run a-run a doo run run)
Wo oh oh oh (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
Oh oh oh now cutie (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Wo run a-run a doo run run)

Run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run
Wo oh oh oh (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
Wo yeah  (Run a-run a doo run run)
Wo oh oh oh (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
Oh oh oh now cutie (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Wo run a-run a doo run run) [Doo doo doo]
Wo yeah  (Run a-run a doo run run)
Wo oh oh oh (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
Oh oh oh now cutie (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Wo run a-run a doo run run)
