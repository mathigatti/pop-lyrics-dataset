Get a breath of that country air
Breathe the beauty of it everywhere
Get a look at that clear blue sky


Come on
Get a breath of that country air
Breathe the beauty of it everywhere
Mother Nature she fills my eyes

Get a breath of that country air
Breathe the beauty of it everywhere
Rise up early the day won't let you sleep

Ahahh-haaaa
Ahahh-haaaa
Ahahh-haaaa
