Put on the skillet
Slip on the lid
Mammy's gonna make us some shortenin' bread
And that ain't all
Our mammy's gonna do
She's gonna cook us some coffee, too

I slipped in the kitchen
Raised up the lid
I stole me a mess o' that shortenin' bread
I walked up to a pretty girl and I said
Baby how'd you like some shortenin' bread

They caught me with the skillet
They caught me with the lid
They caught me with the girl eatin' shortenin' bread
Six months for the skillet
Six months for the lid
Now I'm doin' time for eatin' shortenin' bread
