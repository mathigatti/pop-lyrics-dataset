Male ego walking down the street
Sees something looking hot and sweet
Hey, baby would you like to meet me tonight?


Male ego is a worldwide game
We love the ladies more than wealth and fame
Lots of girls running through my brain tonight

Male ego is played by all
Chasing ladies and having a ball
Hey girl, I'm gonna give you a call tonight

Don't know why we love to chase those tasty ladies
Betcha boys we'll be doing it in our eighties

Male ego's like a game of chance
The gamble starts with just a glance
You're off and running with a new romance tonight

Male ego won't ever quit
It seems to me from where I sit
We oughta do our bit to capture it tonight

You look nice
What's your name?
You smell nice
What's your name?
I like you
What's your name?
I like you
What's your name?
You look nice
What's your name
