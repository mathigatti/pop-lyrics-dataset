It's that time of year again
That Christmas time feelin' is here again
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh


I see snow flurries comin' down
Paint a pretty party scene all over town
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh

Lots of mistletoe hangin' everywhere
Plenty of free gifts and so don't despair
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh

She's so pretty but I'm so young
When I'm sixteen I'm gonna have some fun
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh

All the little children of this great big world
Are waitin' for the season's biggest thrill
I wonder if I'll ever be able to get to sleep again
'Cause the Christmas time thrill is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh

Been tossin' and a-turnin' all through the night
I'll be wide awake until broad daylight
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas Eve is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh

Old Saint Nick'll be stoppin' in
To see the lady of the house again
I wonder if he'll ever go and try to kiss Mommy on the cheek again
'Cause the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh
