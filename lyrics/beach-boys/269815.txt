School days
Dear old Golden Rule days


Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teachin' the Golden Rule
American History and Practical Math
Studyin' hard and hopin' to pass
And workin' your fingers right down the bone
The guy behind you won't leave you alone

Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunchroom ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open your books
The teacher don't know how mean she looks

Ha ha ha ha ha
Are you ready?

Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Throw down your books get out of your seat
And down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in

Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear somethin' that's really hot
With the one you love you're makin' romance
And all day long you've been wantin' to dance
Feelin' the music from head to toe
And round and round and round you go

Hail hail rock and roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock and roll
The beat of the drums loud and bold
Rock rock rock and roll
The feelin' is there, body and soul
