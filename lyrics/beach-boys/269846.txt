The tired day is gone
The hotel lights are on
There's stillness in the night, the city's sleeping.


As you lie there in your bed
A tune stays in your head
This sleepy lullaby comes softly creepin'.

Since I can't be there tonight
To hold and squeeze you tight
Oh baby...

This song wants to sleep with you
This song wants to sleep with you
This song's gonna sleep with you tonight

The melody comes near
And whispers in your ear
Through the misty nights some distant train goes reelin'.

If I could be anywhere
I'd wish that I was there
And if you should hear 'I love you' that's me singin'.

This song's a little blue
'Cause songs get lonely too
Whoa baby...

This song wants to sleep with you
This song wants to sleep with you
This song's gonna sleep with you tonight

Soft serenade, gives you soul sweet dreams
Pull down the shade, nothing's wrong
(can't you feel it, can't you feel it)
Guardian angels watch, over you at night
That's really me, and my song, and my soul

The telephone wires hiss
To bring someone a kiss
This melancholy tune is softly fadin'.

Sweet dreams keep coming on
Deep into the dawn
Oh baby...

This song wants to sleep with you
This song wants to sleep with you
This song's gonna sleep with you tonight

This sleepy lullaby comes softly creepin'
This melancholy tune is softly fadin'
Oh, whoa oh...

(This song's gonna sleep with you, this song's gonna sleep with you)
