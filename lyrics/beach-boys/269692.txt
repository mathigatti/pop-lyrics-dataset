Thirty seconds after he was in bed
He fell back to sleep

The next morning
He had forgotten all about
What had happened the night before

But when night time came once again
His thoughts somehow found their way back
To remembering the fascinating episode of the night before

He he turned out his bedroom light
And sat in his favorite chair
Thoughts danced in his head for a while
"Suppose I went to check and see if my transistor is still down there" he 
said "I wonder what would happen"
