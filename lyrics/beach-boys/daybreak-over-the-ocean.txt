Bring back
Won't you bring back
Bring back my baby


Daybreak over the ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
Will the waves gentle motion
Bring my babe my babe back to me

And the stardust sprinkles the morning
Venus fades from my side
Will my love be returning
Like the sun to brighten up my life

And as day breaks over the ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
I pray the waves gentle motion
Will bring my babe to me

Bring back
Won't you bring back
Bring back my baby(2x)

Darlin' if you could only
Hear this song in my heart
Then you know why you need
Never feel lonenly
We'll soon be together
Never to depart

And as long as there is an ocean
Long as stars are to shine
Baby you will always have my devotion
I'll love pretty baby
Till the end of time

And as day breaks over the ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
I pray the waves gentle motion
Will bring my baby to me (2x)

Darlin' if you should ever
Wonder what you should do
Baby you should know I'll love you forever
Maybe little darlin'
That will see you through

And as the sun sets over the ocean
And the world fades from view
Baby always know our love and devotion
Will brighten up the night
We will make it through

Because I love you
Bring back
Won't you bring back
Bring back
Bring my baby back
Because I love you
Bring back
Won't you bring back
Bring back
Please my baby(2x)
