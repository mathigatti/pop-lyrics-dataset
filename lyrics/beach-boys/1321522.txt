He's the man 
With all the toys


Someone found 
A lighted house 
Late one night
And he saw 
Through the window 
A sight
A big man in a chair
And little tiny men 
Everywhere
He's the man 
With all the toys

Well how thrilled 
That someone 
Must have been
And he must have been 
Tempted to go in
He stayed out 
In the cold
And when he left them 
He told
About the man 
With all the toys

He's the man 
With all the toys

The man 
With all the toys
He's the man 
With all the toys
