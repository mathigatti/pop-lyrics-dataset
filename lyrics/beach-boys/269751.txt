Do you ever get the feelin' that you got to get away
It's a sympton of the fever all across the U. S. A.
My family doctor told me "son the flu is what you have"
But I know it's island fever and I got it real bad


Hey doc I need a pain reliever
(Oooo I got it bad) I got the island fever
I got it bad I got the island fever
(Oooo I got it bad) I got the island fever

My baby caught it and I'm not quite sure how
(Oooo I got it bad) I got the island fever
She might have got it from her travel brochure now
(Oooo I got it bad)

(Bow bow bow ooo)
Come on baby wouldn't it be nice (Bow bow bow ooo)
If I could take you down to paradise (Bow bow bow ooo)
Sweet little mama gotta get away (Bow bow bow ooo)
Your daddy knows a little hideaway (Bow bow bow ooo)

Hey girl I got some good advice
Drive your dad mad and
Make him take you down to paradise

I've been pickin' up a love vibration
(Oooo I got it bad) I got the island fever
Comin' from a little island nation
(Oooo I got it bad) I got the island fever
For my own self-preservation
(Oooo I got it bad) I got the island fever
Better make a quick reservation
(Oooo I got it bad)

(Bow bow bow ooo)
Come on baby wouldn't it be nice (Bow bow bow ooo)
If I could take you down to paradise (Bow bow bow ooo)
Sweet little mama gotta get away (Bow bow bow ooo)
Your daddy knows a little hideaway (Bow bow bow ooo)

Hey girl I got some good advice
Drive your dad mad and
Make him take you down to paradise

(Bow bow bow ooo)
Come on baby wouldn't it be nice (Bow bow bow ooo)
