Why don’t you, run away
And spend some time with me
On this summer's day
There’s nowhere else I’d rather be


Why don’t we feel the way we used to
Anymore
There’s a place along the way
That maybe we could stay
Listen to the waves at my front door

You’ve been thinking 'bout some things
We used to do
Thinking 'bout when life was still in front of you
Back where you belong, our favorite song
Won’t you listen?

Don’t you understand the words
Are singing in the wind
I wish that we could get
From there to back again

The clouds are breaking it’s a beautiful day
For a wonderful, Pacific Coast getaway
Sun is shining, could we just find a way
If you’d just fall, just fall, just fall
To the ground

Through our compromised, paradise is
Just another place upon the wall
Through the common sense of it all
We had a lot to live, we gave it all
Through the consequence, of the wine
Another place in time

Pa ra ra, pa da pa pa ra ra
Pa pa pa pa pa ra ra ra
Pa pa pa pa ra ra ra ra.
