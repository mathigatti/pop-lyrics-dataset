Flowers come up in the spring
All the love I can bring
Bring it for my lady


All I can do
You know
You know it's for my lady

I love her so
I love to grow
She’s a lady, my lady

Falling in love
Summer we’re toge  together with my lady

Love the life I live
Live the life that I love
Live it with my lady

I love her so
I’ll let her know
She’s a lady
My lady
(Humming)

Yes, I’m in love
Love, in love, in love, in love with my lady
She’s knows I’m in love
Love, in love, in love, in love with my lady
(Humming)

Love, in love, in love, in love with my lady
I love the way she smiles
Love, in love, in love, in love with my lady
(Humming)
