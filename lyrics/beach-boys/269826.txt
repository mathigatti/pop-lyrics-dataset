Time for supper now
Day's been hard and I'm so tired
I feel like eating now
Smell the kitchen now
Hear the maid whistle a tune
My thoughts are fleeting now


Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above

Young and beautiful
Like a tree that's just been planted
I found life today
I made mistakes today
Will I ever learn the lessons
That all come my way

Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above

When I was younger
My mother told me
Jesus loved the world
And if that's true then
Why hasn't he helped me to find a girl
And find my world

'Til then I'm just a dreamer
I'm convinced of it
The hypnosis of our minds can take us far away
It's so easy now
You see someone up there high
And heaven's here to stay

Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above

I'll find my world
I'll find my world
Someday I'll find my world
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah
