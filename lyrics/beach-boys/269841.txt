She came out with her best friend for the summer in L. A.
They took a small apartment down on the beach
And you'll find them there every day


And I said
California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L. A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City

We'll turn 'em on with all the things that will be happening night and day
We'll show them such a groovy time that they'll both be decidin' to stay

And let me say
California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L. A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City

California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L. A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City

California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L. A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City
