There's a story
I want you to know
About my baby
And how I love her so


Oh ohhhh, there's no other
Like my baby, oh no no no
Oh, there's no other
Don't mean maybe, oh no no no

Walkin' down the street
In a crowd
Lookin' at my baby
Feelin' so proud

Woah, there's no other
Like my baby, oh no no no
Woah, there's no other
Don't mean maybe, oh no no no

While I was dancing
My baby by my side
Whispered to her
Someday she'll be my bride

Woah, there's no other
Like my baby, oh no no no
Oh no
There's no other
Don't mean maybe, oh no no no

(Cindy.)
Cindy
Oh, not like my baby
Sherry
Oh, not like my baby
Wendy
Oh, not like my baby
Ooo-eee

Ooh ho, there's no other
Like my baby, oh no no no
No no
Oh, there's no other
Don't mean maybe, oh no no no

(Oh, that's just such a...)
(Wow, that was good.)
(That was really great.)
([...] I just love that song.)
(I thought it was really good.)
(Anybody have any cigarettes left?)
([...], Mike.)
Round...
