Oo ooo ooo ooo ooo

Now the puzzle's laid out on my table
The pieces don't fit
I move from chair to chair
But that empty one's there where she used to sit


I'm sitting here going out of my mind
'Cause she's gone away
She couldn't wait, now I
I'm afraid it's too late

I'm waitin' till my angel comes home
It's been hell bein' here alone
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home
Angel, angel come home
If you see her tell my angel come home
Oo oo oo angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home

Does she remember 
That I can't forget
Does she know I regret
I never told her how I
I wanted to hold her
I just let her go

Lonely nights thinkin'
It's starting to sink in
We had a way to go
We'll grow closer together
By being apart

When my angel comes home
It's been hell bein' here alone
God tell me, why has she flown
So far away
I pray she won't stay another day
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home
Please come home

Angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel come home
Hoo ooo angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Hey hey angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Ho oo angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Hey angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
If you see that girl my angel come home
Hey hey angel come home
