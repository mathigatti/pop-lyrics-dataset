On Santa Monica city pier
We watch the people who gather here
The uninvited who've lost their way
And now we're all here to stay


And it's a strange world
There's nothing to it
Strange world
I'm getting through it
Strange world
Thinking it over
It's a strange world after all

Multi-colourful lives we run
To catch a glimpse of the setting sun
I can't imagine how life would be
If you were not here with me

And it's a strange world
There's nothing to it
Strange world
I'm getting through it
Strange world
Strange world after all

Sunday morning
Skies so blue
Yo te amo
Means I love you

You can drive your car
To the county fair
Or ride your bicycle anywhere
It doesn't matter that much to me
Cause we're pretty good company

And it's a strange world
There's nothing to it
Strange world
I'm getting through it
Strange world
Thinking it over
It's a strange world after all
