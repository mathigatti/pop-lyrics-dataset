I can hear so much in your sighs
I can see so much in your eyes
There are words we both could say


But don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Come close, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand and let me hear your heart beat

Being here with you feels so right
We could live forever tonight
Let's not think about tomorrow

And don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Come close, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand and listen to my heart beat

Listen, listen, listen

Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
