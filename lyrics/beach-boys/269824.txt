Late last night I got an SOS
The fairytale girl's in deep distress
She said "I don't know where I am
But it's near Japan"


"My engines all burned out
My crew has all bailed out
I don't know where I am
But its near Japan"

And she said, "rescue me
I'm somewhere in the China sea
I think I'm sinkin' fast
This call is probably my last"

I'm throwin' down a life line
And I'm doin' it for old time's sake
'Though I know you're gonna
Break my heart one more time

Late last night I got an SOS
The fairytale girl's in deep distress
She said "I don't know where I am 
But it's near Japan"

"My engine's all burned out
My crew has all bailed out
I don't know where I am
But it's near Japan"

And she said "thank you dear"
I think she sounded quite sincere
And as she turned to go
She said "I crave adventure don't you know"

And now she's driftin' on some ocean junk
Her world is spinning and her hope has sunk
So I closed my eyes and I'm somewhere near Japan

Her spinnin' stopped and the world stood still
I broke her fall and I always will
Strung out in no-man's land somewhere near Japan

Rescue me
