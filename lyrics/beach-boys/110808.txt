One by one the stars appear
The light of the day is no longer here


One by one the stars disappear
The sky grows brighter every minute of the sunrise

Wake the world with a brand new morning
Say hello to another fine morning
Got my face in the running water

Making my life so much brighter
Moon shines bright, asleep in my bed
Like so many people got a big day ahead of me

Wake the world with a brand new morning
Say hello to another fine morning
Wouldn't miss it for all of its glory
I'll be there when you're calling me

One by one the stars appear
The light of the day is no longer here
