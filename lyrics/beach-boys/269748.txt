When I'm behind the wheel
Horses of gas and steel
The highway is my home
In fiberglass and chrome
Fantasy car shiny Corvette
Let's take a ride you can't forget
Come on pretty lady ride with me


In my car
I'm captain of my destiny
In my car
Pretty babe come cruise with me

Come for a drive
And we'll arrive
Feelin' alive

I'm master of my fate
When I accelerate
My new Vette is my throne
When on the road we roam we roam we roam roam
Cruisin' like we're in a dream
Feelin' like we're still sixteen
Being a part of the great American scene

In my car
I'm captain of my destiny
In my car
Pretty babe come cruise with me

Come for a drive
And we'll arrive
Feelin' alive

Cruise cruise cruise with me baby
Now move move up in the stratosphere
Zoom zoom zoom with me darlin' now
We're still cruisin' after all these 
Cruisin' after all these years

Wind blowing in my hair
I feel like a millionaire
Radio is blasting strong
We're breaking out in song
Blazing trails both near and far
Park my car behind a star
Life is full of possibilities

In my car
I'm captain of my destiny
In my car
Oh pretty babe come cruise with me

Come for a drive
And we'll arrive
Feelin' alive

In my car
I'm captain of my destiny
In my car
Oh pretty babe come cruise with me
