Darling I'm lost without you 
Sad with nothing to do
It's just a matter of time


Whoa darling
What is it you're doing
What's that mood that's brewing
It's just a matter of time

When we went our seperate ways for the first time
I was sure that it would be the last time

Whoa darling
I'm waiting for you
Sad with nothing to do
It's just a matter of time

It's just a matter of time
