Ooh, goin' on

When in the morning
I must arise
I look in the mirror (look in the mirror)
It couldn't be clearer (couldn't be clearer)
Something is gone from my eyes (from my eyes)
Goin' on (goin' on)
Goin' on


I know what is missing (do do do)
'Cause since you've been gone (do do do)
My mind keeps on reelin' (mind keeps on reelin')
My heart keeps on feelin' (heart keeps on feelin')
Why is my love goin' on (goin' on)
Goin' on (goin' on)
Goin' on

I love you
I miss you
Things won't be the same 'till I kiss you
I'm empty without you
My heart's full with my arms around you

We said it was over (do do do)
We're living apart (do do do)
We couldn't quite make it (couldn't quite make it)
But still I can't shake it (still I can't shake it)
Our love still lives on in my heart (in my heart)
Goin' on (goin' on)
Goin' on

I'll love you forever
Love won't be the same again ever (same again ever)
Without you (without you) I'm longing (I'm longing)
You gave me a sense of belonging

Why is my love goin' on (goin' on)
Goin' on (goin on)
Goin' on

I love you, I miss you
I'm sorry, forgive me (won't you forgive me)
Believe me (believe me)
My lover (my lover)
There never could be any other

Come be my, redeemer
Awaken me beautiful dreamer (beautiful dreamer)
I love you (I love you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Things won't be the same 'til I'm with you

Ah ah ah ah
