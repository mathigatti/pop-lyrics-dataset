It's been a long, long while
Since we've been strung out on love
And there's no mask of a smile
That can hide what we're thinkin' of
From your heart I hear
Only distant echoes of empty love
I guess this must be the matchpoint of our love


Early in the game when you broke me
Just like a serve (matchpoint matchpoint)
We shoulda walked off the court
But we both didn't have the nerve (matchpoint matchpoint)
So we volleyed a while with small talk
And a smile and as push comes to shove
I'd say this must be the matchpoint of our love

No one ever held me the way you did
No one could ever love me the way you did
How could love slip away from me?

In life's lonely game love too often
Can let you down (matchpoint matchpoint)
And tho' no one's to blame
Love is stil the only game in town (matchpoint matchpoint)
When it's love's last play you can only say by the stars above That this 
must be the match point of our love

Da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matcpoint)
Da da da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matchpoint)
Da da da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matchpoint)
Da da da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matchpoint)

(Oooooooooo)
(Oooooooooo)
(Oooooooooo)
