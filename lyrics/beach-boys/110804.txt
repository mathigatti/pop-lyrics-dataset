I don't wanna tell you that I care for you
And have you just ignore me
It's better that I wait and see just how you feel
And maybe you'll adore me


I know you've had so much experience
That you don't need another person in your life

I know it may sound funny
But you're the kind of woman
Who'd make a very sweet wife

Take your time, don't worry how you feel because
You know we've got forever
Maybe I'll come up with some idea and
You'd think that I was clever

I've never had someone I need someone
To live with and be good to

Don't worry 'bout your past loves
And if they've never understood you

Let's put our hearts together
And say we'll leave each other never
Let's see what we can cook up between us
Together
Together
Together you and I
