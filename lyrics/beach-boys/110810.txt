Bluebirds over the mountain
 Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea
 Bluebirds over the mountain
 Bring my baby to me
 
 A boy and a girl they once found love
 To each it seemed like heaven above
 He looked into her eyes and said
 Ooo wee baby you're so good for my head
 
 Bluebirds over the mountain
 Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea
 Bluebirds over the mountain
 Bring my baby to me
 
 Oh everyone in every land
 Please give me a helping hand
 If you see her all alone
 Oh tell my baby "won't you please come home?"
 
 Bluebirds over the mountain
 Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea
 Bluebirds over the mountain
 Bring my baby to me
 
 Oh bring my baby back
 I don't know why she's been so long
 But all I know is that she's gone
 Oh bring my baby back to me
 Well I'm in pain can't you see
 
 A boy and a girl they once found love
 To each it seemed like heaven above
 I guess that's why we fell in love
 And now she's gone and all I have to say is
 
 Bluebirds over the mountain
 Seagulls over the sea yeah
 Bluebirds over the mountain
 Bring my baby to me
 
 Bring my baby
 Oooo Baby
 Oooo oooo oooo oooo
