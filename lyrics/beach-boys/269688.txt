You know, you know you are
Be still and know you are
Your life is meant for joy
It's all so deep within, oh


Your life is beautiful
A seed becomes a tree
A mountain into a sky
This life is meant to be, oh

Now is the time life begins
Take that simple path
And love will set you free
Live in harmony
And love will set you free, oh

You know, you know you are
Be still and know you are
You know, you know you are
Be still and know you are
