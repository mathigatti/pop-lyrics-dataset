Come on baby, do the locomotion...


My little baby sister can do it with ease,
It's easier than learnin your abc,
So come on, come on, do the locomotion with me...

You've gotta swing your hips now,
Come on baby, jump up, jump back...
Well I think youve got the nack,
Woah woah...

Now that you can do it, lets make a chain now,
Come on baby, do the locomotion...
A chugga, chugga, motion like a railway train now,
Come on baby, do the locomotion...

A little bit of rhythm and a lotta soul,
So come on, come on, do the locomotion with me...

Move around the floor in a locomotion,
Come on baby, do the locomotion...
Do it holdin hands like you got the notion,
Come on baby, do the locomotion...

It even makes you happy when youre feelin blue,
So come on, come on, do the locomotion with me...

Come on baby, jump up, jump back
Well I think youve got the nack
Woah, woah
