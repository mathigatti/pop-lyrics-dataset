Well Susie Cincinnati
 Got a groovy little motor car
 She lives for the night
 And her husband's a security guard
 
 Her looks aren't exactly a plus
 But it doesn't matter to us
 Because she knows where it's at
 And she gets you there in seconds flat
 
 She knows all the honkies
 And the kids are all home in bed
 (Ooo ride Susie Cincinnati)
 She'd rather do this
 Than anything else instead
 (Ooo ride Susie Cincinnati)
 She got the nicotine fit
 And before she discovered it
 (Ooo ride Susie Cincinnati)
 Everybody in the back seat suffocated
 
 Susie Cincinnati we thought you were a winner
 Susie Cincinnati city's number one sinner
 Yeah
 Susie Cincinnati we thought you were a winner
 Woah
 Susie Cincinnati city's number one sinner
 Susie Cincinnati we thought you were a winner
 Susie Cincinnati city's number one sinner
 Yeah
 Susie Cincinnati we thought you were a winner
 Susie Cincinnati city's number one sinner
 Woah yeah
 
 She'll always pick you up
 When the others go and leave you down
 (To the ride to the ride Susie Cincinnati)
 In her little red cab she's scootin' all over town
 (To the ride to the ride Susie Cincinnati)
 She's gotta mind the meter too
 My pocket's got some signs for you [?]
 But it's just one look
 Because she'll give the ride free to you
 
 Susie Cincinnati
