Bells are ringing, soul of France
Bells are singing of romance


C'est tres jolie en Paris in the spring
Watching all the lovers walk along the Seine
Pitch a penny in her like a wishing well
Feed the pigeons in the park near Tour-Eifelle

Bells are ringing, soul of France
Bells are singing of romance

There's a chapel "Sacre Coure" in quaint Montmarte
In the open air the painters show their art
In the restaurant sip a beaujolies
What a perfect way to spend a lovely day

Bells are ringing, soul of France
Bells are singing of romance

Sunday morning, hear the bells of Notre Dame
Watching belles jeunes filles and the handsome gendarmes
Near the Arc De Triomphe on the Champs-Elysees
Coffee and croissants in a sidewalk cafe

Some people go to see the races at Deauville
Or weekend by the racing tides of Mont San Michelle
Some take the tour of Chartres on an autobus
While the writers and the artists never leave Mont Parnasse
