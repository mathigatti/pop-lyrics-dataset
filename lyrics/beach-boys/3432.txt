Well, she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand, now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man, now
And with the radio blastin'
Goes cruisin' just as fast as she can, now
And she'll have fun, fun, fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away


Well, the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks, looks, and drives like an ace, now
She makes the Indy 500
Look like the Roman Chariot Race, now
A lot of guys try to catch her
But she leads 'em on a wild goose chase, now
And she'll have fun, fun, fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away

Well, you knew all along
That your dad was gettin' wise to you, now
And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinkin' that your fun is all through, now
But you can come along with me
'Cause we've got a lot of things to do, now
And we'll have fun, fun, fun
Now that daddy took the T-Bird away
And we'll have fun, fun, fun
Now that daddy took the T-Bird away
