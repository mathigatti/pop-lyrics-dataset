I'm gonna be round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table


If you brought a big brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot

I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
Cart off and sell my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table
Oh oh taba vega vegel

I tried to kick the ball but my tenny flew right off
I'm red as a beet 'cause I'm so embarassed

Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do

Oh badumday oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh badumday oh dum do dum de dooby do

Chomp chomp chomp chomp do-do-do do-do-do
Bop bop bop bop do-do-do do-do-do

I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in
Your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vege-table

I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in
Your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vege-table
