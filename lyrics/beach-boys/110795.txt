Ooo wah
Ooo wah
Every time I have a date there's only one place to go
That's to the drive in
It's such a groovy place to talk and maybe watch a show
Down at the drive in
Forget about the plot, it'll do very well
But make sure you see enough so you're prepared to tell
About the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)
If the windows get fogged you'll have to take a breath
(Oooooooo waah oooo)
Down at the drive in
(Wah wah ooooooo)
Or the cat dressed in white will scare you both to death
Down at the drive in
A big buttered popcorn and an extra large coke
A few chili dogs and man I'm goin' broke
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
Yeah at the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)
Don't sneak your buddies in the trunk 'cause they might get caught
By the drive in
(Wah wah wah ooooooo)
And they'd look kinda stupid gettin' chased through the lot
(Wah ooooooo)
Around the drive in
If you say you watch the movie you're a couple o' liars
And "Remember only you can prevent forest fires"
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)
