Now, here we are together
This would've been worth waiting forever
I always knew it'd feel this way


And, please, forgive my shaking
Can't you tell my heart is breaking?
Can't make myself say what I planned to say

Baby
Please, let me wonder
(If I've been the one you love)
Please, let me wonder
(If I'm who you're dreaming of)
Please let me wonder, love

I built all my goals around you
That some day my love would surround you
You'll never know what we've been through

For so long I thought about it
And now I just can't live without it
This beautiful image I have of you

Baby
Please, let me wonder
(If I've been the one you love)
Please, let me wonder
(If I'm who you're dreaming of)
Please, let me wonder, love

Please, let me wonder
(If I've been the one you love)
Please, let me wonder
(If I'm who you're dreaming of)
Please, let me wonder, love

I love you
