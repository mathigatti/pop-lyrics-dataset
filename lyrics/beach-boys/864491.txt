The bells of Christmas go ring-a-ling-ling
They toll for the savior and the peace he'll bring
And little children everywhere are caroling
'Cause the presence of the Lord makes their spirits sing


Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Bells are ringing
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Children singing

The bells of Notre Dame cathedral will chime
And everywhere a princely peace
And there they light the candles up one at a time
For the ones they love at Christmastime

Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Bells are ringing
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Children singing

The omnipresent spirit of the world will sing
That Christ is born
Oh oh oh
And people of the world are all rejoicing
For the baby Jesus born in Nazarene

The bells of Christmas go ring-a-ling-ling
They toll for the savior and the peace he'll bring
And little Children everywhere are caroling
'Cause the presence of the Lord makes their spirits sing

Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Bells are ringing
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Children singing

Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Bells are ringing
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Children singing
