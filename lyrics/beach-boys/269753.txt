I used to be a famous artist
Proud as I could be
Struggling to express myself
For the whole world to see
I used to blow my mind sky high
Searching for the lost elation
Little did I know the joy I was to find
In knowing I am only me


I'm singin' in my heart
I'm singin' in my heart
I'm singin' love to sing 
I love to sing it from my heart

Of the creation yeah
Of which I'm doing my part
With an open-hearted laugh of realization in my mind
And now I'm but a child who art
Erect in humility
Serving out of love, everyone I meet
In truth who are really me

I'm singin' in my heart
I'm singin' in my heart
I'm singin' love to sing 
I love to sing it from my heart

No-no-no no no
Hoo no hey yeah no-no-no-no
It's about time now it's about time now
It's about time now don't you know now
It's about time now it's about time now
It's about time now don't you know now
It's about time we get together
To be out front and love one another
Brothers sisters everybody
We better start to help each other now
We need it now

When we're sharin' our love brother
That's when we know we can shape another world
