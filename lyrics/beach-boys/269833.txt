Cause it's gonna be a summer of love
Hey now (well it's a love thing)


People all around the world in every nation
Like to get together for some excitations
If you're a girl appreciates her recreation
Why don't you let me take you on a love vacation

Yeah I'll take you to the movies
But I'm no fool (wah wah oooo)
First I'll get you on the beach
Or in a swimming pool
Doing unto others is the Golden Rule
But doing it with you would be so
Very cool

Everytime the weather starts to gettin' hotter
Don't worry about it toos your clothes and hit the water
We'll be California dreaminin' bay watchin' everyday
Just off the Malibu surfin' U. S. A.

Now no girl ever wants to leave their
Love back home (wah wah oooo)
So if you miss him baby
Call him on the phone
But make it quick
We're almost in a party zone

Cause summer days and nights
Aren't meant to spend alone
