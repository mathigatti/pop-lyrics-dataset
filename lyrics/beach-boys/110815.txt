Well back in time with just a rhythm and rhyme
 Gregorian chants were a real big thing
 They took that chant and added harmony
 It was a different sound
 But had the same meaning
 
 I know (I know) I know (I know)
 It took us a long while
 To go (to go) to go (to go)
 And find us a rock style
 I know (I know) I know (I know)
 That we can take it one more mile
 
 Because
 We're singing that same song
 We're still singing that same song
 We're singing that same song
 That same song
 That same song
 
 The rock of ages
 Built that rockin' sound
 'Til more and more people start to come around
 They worshipped in church
 And built that great big choir
 It grew and it grew
 Until it spread like fire
 
 I know (I know) I know (I know)
 It took us a long while
 To go (to go) to go (to go)
 And find us a rock style
 I know (I know) I know (I know)
 That we can take it one more mile
 
 Because
 We're singing that same song
 We're still singing that same song
 We're singing that same song
 That same song
 That same song
 
 Same song 
 Oh yeah
 Same song 
 Oh yeah
 Same song that same song
 
 Same song 
 Oh yeah
 Same song 
 Oh yeah
 Same song that same song
