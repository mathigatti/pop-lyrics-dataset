No-go showboat no-go showboat (no-go showboat)

Well I got a wild custom that wins every show
But it's a no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
Yeah but everybody knows that she just don't go
She's my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
White wall slicks with racing mags
She's just for looks, man, not for drags
'Cause it's a no-go showboat (no-go showboat)


No go
No go

Well the guys all dig it they've got no complaints
About my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
And the chicks really flip for that metal flake paint
On my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
It really rates fine in the custom clan
With hand-formed panels, tuck-and-roll rear pan
'Cause it's a no-go showboat (no-go showboat)

No go
No go

Well the engine compartment's filled with all chrome goodies
In my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
Yeah but everybody takes me even old Ford woodies
In my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
When it comes to speed, man, I'm just outa luck
I'm even shut down by the ice cream truck
'Cause it's a no-go showboat (no-go showboat)

No go
No go
No-go showboat (no-go showboat)
No-go showboat (no-go showboat)
SheÕs just my (no-go showboat)
SheÕs just my (no-go showboat
