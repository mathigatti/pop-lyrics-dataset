It starts with just a little glance, now
Right away, you're thinkin' 'bout romance, now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her


A brand new love affair
Is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful
Think about the pain it can bring

It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long
You've got to keep in mind

Love is here
Today
And its gone
Tomorrow
It's here
And gone so fast

Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well, you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her

Well, I'm not sayin'
You won't have a good love with her
But I keep on rememberin'
Things like they were

She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long
You've got to keep in mind

Love is here
Today
And its gone
Tomorrow
It's here
And gone so fast

Keep in mind
Love is here
Today
And its gone
Tomorrow
It's here
And gone so fast

Love is here
Today
And its gone
Tomorrow
It's here
And gone so fast
