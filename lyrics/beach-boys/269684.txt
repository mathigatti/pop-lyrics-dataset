Lie alone in bed at night
Feel the pull of a lonely day
Thoughts like music start to play
I wonder where you were today


Baby, baby blue
Baby blue eyes I dream of you

Late at night 
when the whole world's sleeping
I dream of you
Close to you
I feel your sweet heart beating
I dream of you

Late at night
Late at night
Honey, late at night
I dream of you

Baby, baby blue
Baby blue eyes a lovin' you

I'll hold you in my dreams tonight
Hold you 'till morning's light

Baby, baby blue
Baby blue eyes a lovin' you

Baby, baby blue
Baby blue eyes a lovin' you

Baby, baby blue
Baby blue eyes a lovin' you
