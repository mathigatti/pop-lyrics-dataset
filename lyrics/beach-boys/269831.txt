Wasn't so long ago
That every year your family
Would rent a house from June to Labor Day
Summer in Monterey
None of us wore no clothes
In Monterey our feet were bare
Our shorts were all we'd ever wear
And I would jump for joy that you were there


Take you to the movie show
Watching arm in arm
Used to hope the film would work its charm
Then
You and I we'd saunter home
Far behind the crowd
Linger longer than your ma and pa had allowed

Never in love before
We couldn't wait to be alone
To beat it to the Ocean View Cafe
That was our hideaway
Summer in Monterey

Monterey oh Monterey
Monterey oh Monterey
I would love the crazy world to always stay that way
Ocean breeze
Breaking seas
Out on the rocks around the windy curving bay
Summer in Monterey

Ocean breeze
Breaking seas
Out on the rocks around the windy curving bay
Summer in Monterey
