It's been my secret passion to try it
To spend my christmas surfin', i can't deny it
I wanna spend my christmas on the kona coast in hawaii
For years i saved my pennies and planned it
The great pacific ocean, we'll span it
I wanna spend christmas where i dig it the most, in hawaii
Go to hawaii
Melekalikimaka is "merry christmas" in hawaii talk-a
And at lahaina we'll count the shooting stars
And it will be just you and me in hawaii
The suntanned beauties are everywhere
If you're comin' to the islands then you might stare
And find a girl waiting for you there in hawaii
Kani and wahini and the haoles, too
Wish a melekalikimaka to you
They're the friendliest people anywhere in hawaii
Go to hawaii
Melekalikimaka is how they say it in island talk-a
The island flower fragrance in the air
We'll write a card and underneath the mango trees
We'll say, "wish you were here with us in hawaii"
Winter in the sun and surf'd sure be nice
In a south sea garden paradise
I wanna spend christmas where i dig it the most, in hawaii
Honolulu, waikiki
Do you wanna come along with me?
Waimia up to hanalai
I'd love to take you to the islands today
