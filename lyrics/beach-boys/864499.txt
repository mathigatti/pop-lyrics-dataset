Santa Claus is coming to town...

Christmas is a joyous time of year.
But for an underprivileged child, this isn't always true.
This is Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys.
Alan, Michael, Carl, Brian and myself would like to ask
all of you to join in with us in donating a toy to an
underprivileged children organization, so they, too,
might possibly share in a very, very happy Christmas this year.
Thank you.
