She knows me
She knows me


Sometimes I have a weird way of showing my love
And I always expect her to know what I'm thinking of

She knows me

I treat her so mean I don't deserve what I have
And I think that she'll forgive just by making her laugh
But she knows me

She knows me too well
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her
She knows me too well

I get so jealous of the other guy
And then I'm not happy til I make her break down and cry
When I look at other girls it must kill her inside
But it'd be another story if she looked at the guys
But she knows me

She knows me too well
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her
She knows me too well

She knows me
She knows me

When I look at other girls it must kill her inside
But it'd be another story if she looked at the guys
Cause she knows me

Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her
She knows me too well
