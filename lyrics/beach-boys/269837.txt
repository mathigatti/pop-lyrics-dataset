I do them when I'm down in the tub
With avocado cream they'll take a rub
They wrinkle like a-raisins if I stay too long
I wouldn't want to do it wrong


They'll put you in the driver's seat
And to the table when you want to eat
But when you go to sit down in your chair
Something else has got to put you there

Take good care of your feet, Pete
You better watch out what you eat, Pete
Better take care of your life
'Cause nobody else will

They'll twinkle when you fall in love
And put you there when you jump up above
When you're on the spot, get them right under you
One, then the other too

If you want to do the right thing for them
Just take a walk in the grass
But don't you catch yourself fallin'
Or steppin' on a piece of glass
(Ouch glass)
Pete knows all the treacherous blows
The fallen arches and the cramp in the toes
He went to H. E. L. P. and got some sandals new
And dusty old saunas too

Take a load of your feet Pete
You better watch out what you eat
Better take care of your life
'Cause nobody else will

Do do do do do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do
