Had to phone ya'
 Had to phone ya' just to talk to you
 Had to phone ya' just to tell ya' I was missing you
 
 It lifts my spirits every single time
 Sometimes you're busy for awhile
 But when you get through
 It makes me smile
 
 A-when I phone ya'
 California's not so far away
 You're not alone ya' know I'm only just a dial away
 
 I visualize that you're looking fine
 Feels so good when you come on the line
 
 You (you) you (you) you (you) you (you)
 You (you) you (you) you (you) you (you)
 You (you) you (you) you (you) you (you)
 You (you) you (you) you (you)
 
 Come on
 Come on and answer the phone
 Come on come on
 (I hope your home)
 Come on and answer the phone
 Come on come on
 (I hope your home)
 Come on and answer the phone
 Come on come on
 (I hope your home)
 Come on and answer the phone
 Come on come on
 (I hope your home)
 Come on and answer the phone
 Come on come on
 (I hope your home)
 Come on and answer the phone
 Come on come on
 (Hello, hey Brian!)
 (I hope your home)
