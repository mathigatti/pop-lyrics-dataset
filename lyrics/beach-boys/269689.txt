When some loud braggart tries to put me down
And says his school is great
I tell him right away
"Now what's the matter buddy 
Ain't you heard of my school, 
It's number one in the state"


hey hey take it away get that ball and fight

(ra ra ra ra sis boom ba...)
So be true to your school 
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school 
And let your colors fly
So be true to your school

I got a letterman's sweater
With a letter in front
I got for football and track
I'm proud to wear it now
When I cruise around
The other parts of the town
I got my decal in back

So be true to your school 
(ra ra ra ra sis boom ba...)
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school 
And let your colors fly
So be true to your school

Do it again do it again, we like it, we like it

On Friday we'll be jacked up for the football game
And I'll be ready to fight
We're gonna smash 'em now
My girl will be working on her pom-poms now
And she'll be yelling tonight

So be true to your school 
(ra ra ra ra sis boom ba...)
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now 
And let your colors fly
So be true to your school

Push 'em back, push 'em back, way back

ra ra ra ra sis boom ba... (repeat)
