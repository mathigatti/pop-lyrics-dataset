There she was just a-walkin' down the street
singin' do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do
snappin' her fingers and shufflin' her feet
singin' do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do


She looked good, LOOKED GOOD
she looked fine, LOOKED FINE
she looked good, she looked fine
and I nearly lost my mind
Before I knew it she was walkin' next to me

singin' do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do
Holdin' my hand just as natural as can be
singin' do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do

We walked on, WALKED ON
to my door, MY DOOR
we walked on to my door
then we kissed a little more

Wo-o-o-oh, I knew we were falling in love
yes I did, and so I told her all the things
that I'd been dreamin' of
Now we're together her nearly every single day

singin' do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do
We're so happy and that how we're gonna stay
singin' do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do

I'm hers, I'M HERS
she's mine, SHE'S MINE
I'm hers, she's mine

wedding bells are gonna chime
Wo-o-o-oh, I knew we were falling in love
yes I did, and so I told her all the things
that I'd been dreamin' of

Now we're togther nearly every single day
singin' do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do
We're so happy and that how we're gonna stay
singin' do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do

I'm hers, I'M HERS
she's mine, SHE'S MINE

I'm hers, she's mine
wedding bells are gonna chime
Singin' do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do

do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do
do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do
