I was working in the lab
And late one night
When my eyes beheld
An eerie sight
When my monster from his slab
Began to rise
And suddenly
To my surprise


He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
The monster mash
It's called the monster mash

The laboratory in the castle eaves
And the master bedroom where the vampire sleeps
The girls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash
It caught on in a flash
The monster mash
It's called the monster mash

Zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman
Dracula and his little baby boy

The scene was rocking
All the digging sounds
Igor unchained ????
The Coffin Bangers were about to arrive
With a local group the Beach Boy five

They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash
It caught on in a flash
The monster mash
It's called the monster mash

Mmmm, what luck girl in the audience
Would care to dance with Igor?
The monster mash is so ghoul
Muah ha ha ha
