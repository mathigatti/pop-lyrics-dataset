The river's a bed of sweet berries and flowers
 Banks of thirsty lies
 (Please be careful)
 The stream is an eyeglass of heroes
 Bridged with bright replies
 The creek is a funnel of forgiveness
 Winning every prize
 Steamboat of living ever faithfully ride.
 
 The river's a dream in a waltz time
 Banks of jasper glaze
 (Have a ball and sing)
 The stream is a timepiece of children
 Bridged with crystal haze
 The creek is a trumpet of hard times
 Blowing tasty days
 Steamboat of living ever faithfully glide.
 
 Don't worry mister Fulton
 We'll get your steamboat rollin'.
