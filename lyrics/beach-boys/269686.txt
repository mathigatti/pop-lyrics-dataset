Betsy betsy

She was born in '32, and was she ever pretty
She rode a freight train west, all the way from detroit city
Betsy's seen more places than I'll ever hope to see
Betsy's been more loyal than any friend could be


With some she traveled fast, with others it was slow
Betsy's seen them all, she'd seen them come and go
She must have had some favorites before I finally met her
And now that she's all mine, they'd better just forget her
Betsy was a lady and that she will remain
Betsy took some beatings but she never once complained

She had a classic beauty that everyone could see
I was the last to meet her, but she gave her life to me
She may be rusted iron, but to me she's solid gold
And I just can't hold the tears back
'Cause betsy's growing old
