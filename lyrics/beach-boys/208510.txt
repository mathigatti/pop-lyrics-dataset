Ohh darlin'
My darlin' you're so fine
Ohhhh-hhh-hhh


Don't know if words can say
But darlin' I'll find a way
To let you know what you meant to me
Guess it was meant to be
I hold you in my heart
As life's most precious part

Oh darlin'
I dream about you often my pretty girl babe
(Darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love uh huh, oh

I was living like half a man
Then I couldn't love but now I can
You pick me up when I'm feeling sad
More soul than I ever had
Gonna love you every single night
Cause I think you're too outta sight

Oh oh darlin'
I dream you often my pretty girl babe
(Darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way soften my life with your love
Your precious love uh huh huh

Woah oh oh oh

Every night oh darlin'
Gonna love you every single night, yes I will
Cause I think you're too doggone outta sight

Oh darlin'
I dream about you often my pretty girl babe
(Darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way soften my life with your love
Your precious love uh huh huh
Oh
