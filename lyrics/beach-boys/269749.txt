I'm blessed with everything
A world to which a man can cling
So happy times when I break out in tears
In the back of my mind I still have my fears


I live my life with her
Love her true she knows I'm sure
I make her happy just living so plain
In the back of my mind I'm 'fraid it's gonna change

I tried to run far way from thoughts
I should try to keep away
But they just keep coming back to me
I tried to rationalize
But some day I might realize
That things are just good the way they'll be
I know it's so hard to find
A girl who really understands your mind
What will I do if I leave her
It will always be way in the back of my mind
