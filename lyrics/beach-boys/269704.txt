I've been keepin' my eyes on you
I finally found the nerve to talk to you
There's something that you ought to know
Don't you know that I love you so
Our life together could be eternal bliss
If we could just get close enough to kiss
And ya' know I'd like to get a crack at your love


Crack at your love
Crack at your love

You make me feel so warm inside
A sense of humor you can't hide
Who taught you darlin' how to move that way?
And when you smile I know the world's okay
And when I see the twinkle in your eye
It sends my heart all the way to the sky
And ya' know I'd like to get a crack at your love

Crack at your love
Crack at your love

Lonely nights, lonely days
Lonely nights, lonely days
I'm reachin' out for you
In my mind, in my mind

I'm goin' crazy
Would ya' be my baby
I'm gonna need a little help from above
Would ya' say "no" if I asked for your love?
I can't afford to get hurt again
Like the time I remember when
But I know I'd like to get a crack at your
And ya know I'd like to get a crack at your
Don't ya' know I'd like to get a crack at your love

Crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
