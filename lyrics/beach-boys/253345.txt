Look out here come those South Bay surfers
California's gettin' hot
There they go cruisin' down that coastline
Lookin' for their favorite spot


We'll find the big one

Oh the boys are rough and
Ready to handle anything

They take the big one

They've got to be the best thing going
South Bay surfers really swing

Okay rock out

Oh Chicago can't you hear them
Hear that shore pound slam

(You're gonna eat it)
(Smash!)

It rumbles clear to New York City
Detroit back to old Miam
Philly back to Alabam

You'll catch them surfing
