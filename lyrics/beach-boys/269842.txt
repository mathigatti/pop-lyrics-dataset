We met when she was younger
Then I had no eyes for her
A few years went by and I saw her
Now I'm gonna try for her


Look out babe

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

How could I ever have known that
She'd be what she is today
And look at how her boyfriend holds her
I'll be moving in one day

Split man

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

La doo day pow pow pow
La doo day pow pow pow
La doo day pow pow pow

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
