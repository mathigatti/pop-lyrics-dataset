The night was so young and everything still
 The moon shining bright on my window sill
 I think of her lips, it chills me inside
 And then I think why does she have to hide
 
 Is somebody gonna tell me why she has to hi-i-ide
 She's passin' it by, she won't even try
 To make this love go where it should
 
 The sky's turnin' gray, there's clouds overhead
 I'm still not asleep, I'm in my bed
 I think of her eyes and it makes me sigh
 I think of her voice and it makes me cry
 
 Is somebody gonna tell me why she has to lie-i-ie
 She'd be so right to hold me tonight
 Love was made for her and I
 
 It's three o'clock I go to my sink
 I pour some milk and I start to think
 Is she asleep or is she awake
 And does she think of the love we could make
 
 Wake up, call me baby call me tell me what's on your mi-i-ind
 I've got a car and you're not too far
 Please let me come over to you
 
 The night was so young and everything still
 The moon shining bright on my window sill
 I think of her lips, it chills me inside
 And then I think why should she hide
