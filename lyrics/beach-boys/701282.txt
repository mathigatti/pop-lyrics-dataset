Fun is in, it's no sin, it's that time again
To shed your load, hit the road on the run again
Summer skies in our eyes and a warmer sun
It's one for all, all for one, all for all out fun


Gotta go to it
Gonna go through it
Gotta get with it

Lookin' good down the hood of a funky ride
On the way to the tide just to tan your hide
In the shade lemonade in the sun ocean spray
To get your face in the race or lay back's no disgrace

Gotta go to it
Gonna go through it
Gotta get with it

It's ok to get out there and have some fun
By yourself maybe or else with a special one.
Good or bad glad or sad it's all gonna pass
So it's ok let's all play and enjoy it while it lasts

Gotta go to it
Gonna go through it
Gotta get with it
