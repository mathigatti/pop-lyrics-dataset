The girls dig the way the guys get all wiped out
With their feet in the air you can hear 'em shout
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth, (a-oo) they don't back down
Don't back down
You gotta be a little nuts
Don't back down
But show 'em now who's got guts
Don't back down
Don't back down from that wave
With their feet full of tar and their hair full of sand
The boys know the beach like the palm of their hand
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth (a-oo) they don't back down
Don't back down
You gotta be a little nuts
Don't back down
But show 'em now who's got guts
Don't back down
Don't back down from that wave
When a twenty-footer sneaks up like a ton of lead
And the crest comes along and slaps 'em upside the head
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (Don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth (a-oo) they don't back down
Don't back down
You gotta be a little nuts
Don't back down
But show 'em now who's got guts
Don't back down
Don't back down from that wave
Don't back down...
