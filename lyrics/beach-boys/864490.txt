You ain't got time for diamonds
And you pay no mind to gold
You gave up everything you had
But there's one thing I want you to hold


Come let the power through you
Come on and let me thrill you
Mama now

(Baby come on come on)
Come on baby
(Baby come on come on)
Come on baby
I just want to do it with you

Well I don't care where you want to go
Just so you go with me
And I don't care what you want to do
But make sure you do it with me

All I want to do with you
Well I just make-a some love to you

Come on baby
(Baby come on come on)
Come on baby
(Baby come on come on)
I said baby
(Baby come on come on)
I just want to do it to you
All night lo-ong

Yeah yeah
(Baby come on come on)
Come on baby
(Baby come on come on)
I said baby
I just want to make it with you
Ohh
Come on
Come on come on come on baby
(Baby)
