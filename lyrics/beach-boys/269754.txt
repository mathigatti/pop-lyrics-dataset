It's gettin' late
I can't wait
Come a, come a little closer
You gotta tell me that you'll stay


I've been praying for this moment
Since the second I laid eyes on you
Minutes seem like hours
When you're gone
Girl, I'm gettin' tired of waitin'
So stop your hesitatin'
I can't believe you keep me hangin' on

It's gettin late-ate-ate-ate
Ooo (it's gettin' late) time waits for no one
Love is a turn on

It's gettin' late
I can't wait
Come-a-come-a little closer
You gotta tell me that you'll stay

You got me in a situation
My love is risin' high
Don't let any more love pass us by

Girl, we can make it up to paradise
Just give it a try
So hurry now and girl make up your mind

It's gettin' late
Don't know how much more I can stand
It's gettin' late
Don't know how much more I can stand

Girl, I need your lovin'
I'm so tired of waitin'
Come on there's no one else around

Ooo, sweet girl, it's gettin' late
So, please, don't hesitate
Been waitin' to get your defenses down
