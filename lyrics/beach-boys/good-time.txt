My girlfriend Betty she's always ready
To help me in any way
She'll do my cookin' she's always lookin'
For ways she can make my day


And when I'm lookin' at her the sound of pitter patter
On rainy days like today
Could get you feelin' warmer
And you know what-a that can lead to

Maybe it won't last but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time
Might go up in smoke now but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time

My girlfriend Penny, she's kinda skinny
And so she needs her falsies on
She don't like cookin' but she's so good lookin'
I miss her when she's gone

And when she gets to dancin' I feel just like romancin'
Especially when we're dancing close
She'll do the dirty boogie
And that's when I go up in smoke

Maybe it won't last but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time
Might end up in tears now but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time

Wo wo wo wo wo wo wo uh
Wo wo wo
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
Wo wo wo

Maybe it won't last but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time
For just a few hours with nuè£²h what do we care
Let's have a good time

Good time
Oh good time
Oh good time
Goooooood tiiiiiiiiime

Hey
