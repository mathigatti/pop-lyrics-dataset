Well, east coast girls
Are hip.
I really dig those
Styles they wear
And the Southern girls
With the way they talk,
They knock me out
When I'm down there.
The mid-west farmer's daughters
Really make you feel alright
And the Northern girls
With the way they kiss,
They keep their boyfriends
Warm at night.


I wish they all could be
California girls.
I wish they all could be
California girls.
I wish they all could be
California girls.

The west coast
Has the sunshine
And the girls all
Get so tan.
I dig a french bikini
On the wild island girls
By a palm tree in the sand.
I've been around this
Great big world
And I seen all kind of girls,
Yeah, but I couldn't wait
To get back in the states.
Back to the cutest girls
In the world.

I wish they all could be
California girls.
I wish they all could be
California girls.
I wish they all could be
California girls.

I wish they all could be
California girls.
I wish they all could be
California girls.
I wish they all could be
California girls.
