Rah rah pom pom play, girl
Pom pom play, girl


(Oooooo)
You see her in a short skirt down on the grass
She's wonderin' if the team's gonna run kick or pass
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
Since she doesn't really know why she's wavin' her hands
She's a-thinking 'bout the boy sittin' up in the stands

Rah rah pom pom play, girl
Pom pom play, girl

(Chi chi bah)

Just a little social clique with the other song queens
With a freshman or a sophomore she wouldn't be seen
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
She's a doll and she knows it and she thinks that her face
Will get her any body any thing and any place

Rah rah pom pom play, girl
Pom pom play, girl
Oooooo

Chi chi bah
(Oooooo)

Since she's the head cheerleader she dates the quarterback
And her best friend's going out with the full back
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
She might even run for an office this Spring
And that ought to really make her telephone ring

Rah rah pom pom play girl
Pom pom play girl

(Chi chi bah, pom pom play, girl)
Wooooo
(Chi chi bah, pom pom play, girl)
Wooo
(Chi chi bah, pom pom play, girl)
Shake it
(Chi chi bah, pom pom play, girl)
Wave those pom poms all around
(Chi chi bah, pom pom play, girl)
(Chi chi bah, pom pom play, girl)
(Chi chi bah, pom pom play, girl)
Wow
(Chi chi bah, pom pom play girl)
Wow
(Chi chi bah, pom pom play girl)
