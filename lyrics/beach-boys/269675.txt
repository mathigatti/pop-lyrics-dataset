When I see my baby
When I see my little girl
When I see my woman
I'm gonna tell her about the lonely hours I just spent
And say the thing we got going hope it never ends
Well I'm gonna tell that little girl a thing or two


Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa
Outta sight baby
Ahhh-ha ha
Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa

When I see my baby
When I look in her pretty eyes
When I get with my darling baby
I say my heart will start to beat like a couple of drums
She'll get my temperature to rise to 'bout a hundred and one

(Yeah)
Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa
Outta sight baby
Ahhh-ha ha
Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa

A whole day away from your woman
A separation from your girl can really mess your mind
And can you dig this one thing
Well it's lucky I'm working from nine to five
I have to live with my doctors just to keep me alive
Keep on tellin' a thing or two

Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa
Outta sight baby
Ahhh-ha ha
Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa
