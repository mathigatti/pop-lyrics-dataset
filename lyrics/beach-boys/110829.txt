Look at me
 Funny face
 That's not you
 A wrinkled nose
 A tear
 You're crying
 
 Oh
 Rest your head
 Cry on me
 Don't be afraid
 I'll stay with you
 I know you'll make it
 And you'll make it good
 And you'll make it good
 And you'll make it good
 
 All of my life
 I haven't known much
 All I know
 Is what I feel
 And what I feel
 And what I feel
 Love
 I'm in love
 Love
 Love
 
 Ooo
