Oooooooo
Merry Christmas, children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooooooo


Well, down in Eugene we got girls and boys
Who wake up on Christmas morning but don't find any toys
If they're lucky their healthy mom and dad come to chat
About how they're missed, but you can change all that

Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children

Yeah, we're the Beach Boys for Crystal Ship and toys
'Cause this Christmas we want you to help spread the joy
It would feel so good, it would make them feel well
It would cheer 'em all up at Children's Hospital

Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children

Oooooooo
Merry Christmas, children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooooooo
Merry Christmas, children
Christmas toys to Crystal Ship
Oooooooo
