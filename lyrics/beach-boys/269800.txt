If you knew a-Peggy Sue
Then you'd know why I feel blue
My Peggy a-my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, yes I love you, Peggy Sue


Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Oh how my heart yearns for you
Oh Peggy--my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, yes I love you, Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue
Oh Peggy a-my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, and I need you, Peggy Sue

I love you, Peggy Sue
With a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy--my-my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, and I want you, Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue
My Peggy a-my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, and I want you, Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, and I want you, Peggy Sue
(Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue)
