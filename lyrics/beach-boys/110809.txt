Today could be a lot of fun
And precious one
I'd feel good just to walk with you
Tonight will be a special treat
You're so sweet
And I feel good just to talk with you
You know that I been a long time needing you
You say that you been a long time needing me
And don't you know that there's so much more to come


I got a heart that just won't stop beating for you
I got a love I just can't stop feeling for you
Aren't you glad now darling? there's me and you
(Tell me tell me you know what I mean) [me and you]
And I say aren't you glad with these days comes somethin' new
(Tell me tell me you know what I mean) [me and you]
And I say aren't you glad now tell me you're so glad
[Me and you]

(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Today is another day
Another way to get this feeling across to you
Tonight will be another night
That's outta sight cause I know the way to get close to you

You know that I'll be a long time loving you
I hope that you'll be a long time loving me
And don't you know that there's so much more to come
I got a heart that just won't stop beating for you
I got a love I just can't stop feeling for you
Aren't you glad now darling there's me and you
(Tell me tell me you know what I mean) [me and you]
And I say aren't you glad with these days comes summer
(Tell me tell me you know what I mean) [me and you]
And I say aren't you glad now tell me you're so glad
[Me and you]
