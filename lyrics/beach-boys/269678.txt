All I wanna do
Is always bring good to you
To give you all the love I can
And help you in whatever you do


Sure as the sun will come around again to start off another day
You can be sure that in my heart and soul I'll love you in every way

All I wanna do
Is bring happiness to you
I hope it makes you happy to know
My love's with you wherever you go

Ooh, when I sit and close my ey-eyes
A gentle thought comes in my mind
My love is burnin' brightly
Lke the moon and stars shine nightly
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do

Ooh, let these little words of love
Come romance and light your way
My love is burnin' brightly

Like the moon and stars shine nightly
All I wanna do (lonely in the night I feel)
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
My love is burnin' brightly
All I wanna do
Doo doo doo doo doo

Like the  moon and stars shine brightly
All I wanna do
My love is burnin' brightly
All I wanna do
Doo doo doo doo doo
Like the moon and stars shine brightly
