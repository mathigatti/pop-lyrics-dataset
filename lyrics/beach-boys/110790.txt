I took a walk and sat down in a park
The gardener walked out and the sprinklers went on
They watered the lawn and I went to sleep
Ten thirty I turned my radio on
Some group was playing a musical song
It wasn't too long and I went to sleep
Again at the park on a nice summer day
High up above me the trees gently sway
A bird flew away and I went to sleep
