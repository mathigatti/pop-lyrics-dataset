I'll be back in ten minutes

There's a time a for joy
A time for tears
A time we'll treasure through the years
We'll remember always
Graduation day


At the senior prom
We danced 'til three
And there you gave your heart to me
We'll remember always
Graduation day

Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys we've known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing we'll never walk alone

When the ivy walks
Are far behind
No matter where our paths may wind
We'll remember always
Graduation day

We'll remember always 
Graduation day
