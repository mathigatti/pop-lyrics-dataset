Ol' man river
That ol' man river
He must say something (he don't know nothin')
But he don't say nothing
That ol' man river
He just keeps rollin' along


He don't plant taters
He don't plant cotton
And them that plants 'em
Are soon forgotten

That ol' man river
He just keeps rolling along

That ol' man river
He just keeps rolling along
