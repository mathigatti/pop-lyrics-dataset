She's real fine, my 409
She's real fine, my 409
My 409


Well I saved my pennies and I saved my dimes
(Giddy up, giddy up, 409)
For I knew there would be a time
(Giddy up, giddy up, 409)
When I would buy a brand new 409

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, 409
(Giddy up, giddy up, 409)
Giddy up, 409
(Giddy up, giddy up, 409)
Giddy up, 409
(Giddy up, giddy up, 409)
Giddy up, 40...

Nothing can catch her
Nothing can touch my 409
409, Ooooo
(Giddy up, giddy up, oooo)
(Giddy up, giddy up, oooo)
(Giddy up, giddy up, oooo)
(Giddy up, giddy up)

When I take her to the track she really shines
(Giddy up, giddy up, 409)
She always turns in the fastest times
(Giddy up, giddy up, 409)
My four speed dual quad posi-traction 409

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, 409
(Giddy up, giddy up, 409)
Giddy up, 409
(Giddy up, giddy up, 409)
Giddy up, 409
(Giddy up, giddy up, 409)
Giddy up, 40...

Nothing can catch her
Nothing can touch my 409

Giddy up, 409

Giddy up, 409
