I had to prove that i could make it alone now
But that's not me
I wanted to show how independent i'd grown now
But that's not me
I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
What matters to me is just what i could be
To just one girl
I'm a little bit scared 'cause i haven't been home in a long time
You need my love and i know that i left at the wrong time
My folks when i wrote them and told what i was up to
Said that's not me
I went through all kinds of changes, took a look at myself
And said that's not me
I missed my pad and the places i've known
And every night as i lay there alone
I would dream
I once had a dream so i packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I'm glad i went now i'm that much more sure that we're ready (?)
I once had a dream so i packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
(repeat to fade
