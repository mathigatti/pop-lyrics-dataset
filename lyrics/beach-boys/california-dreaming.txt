All the leaves are brown
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
Walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
Warm
If I was in L.A
California dreaming
California dreaming
On such a winter's day


Stopped into the church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees
Got down on my knees
And I pretend to pray
I pretend to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold
Preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay
Knows I'm gonna stay
California dreaming
California dreaming
On such a winter's day

All the leaves are brown
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
On a winter's day

I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A
California dreaming
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
California dreaming
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
California dreaming
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
