Come-a come-a come-a come to me
Gimme gimme gimme some lovin'
Tell me tell me tell me you want it
Listen listen listen my 


Mona
How's about an eight o'clock dinner
How's about a nine o'clock movie
Won't it won't it won't it be groovy

Put your lovin' arms around me
Aren'tcha aren'tcha glad that you found me
Do you do you like fine wine now
Don't it don't it don't it taste fine now

Can'tcha can'tcha can'tcha just hear it
Rock 'n' rock 'n' rock 'n' roll music
Get-a get-a get-a that beat now
Does it does it does it feel neat now

Will you will you will you just kizz me
When you leave me don't you just mizz me
Could we could we could we get married
Enough enough enough of goin' steady

Disco disco discoteque mama
Show me show me show me the boogie
Start a start a start a little dance now
Take a take a take a little chance now

Come on
Listen to "Da Doo Ron Ron" now
Listen to it "Be My Baby"
I know you're gonna love Phil Spector

Mona
Come-a come-a come-a come to me
Gimme gimme gimme some lovin'
Tell me tell me tell me you want it
