"Walking In The Sand"


Seems like the other day
My baby went away
She went away across the sea

It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me

Oh it said that we were through
She's found somebody new
Oh baby's gone what can I do

Remember

"Walking In The Sand"

(Remember)
Hey I remember
("Walking In The Sand")
"Walking In The Sand"
(Remember remember)
("Walking In The Sand")
Walking hand in hand
("Walking In The Sand")
"Walking In The Sand"
(Remember remember)
("Walking In The Sand")
Walking hand in hand
("Walking In The Sand")

Ahhhhh
Ahhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhh

I want to know
What ever happened to
The little girl I once knew
She said that she'd be true

(Remember)
(Remember)
Remember
Hey I remember
("Walking In The Sand")
"Walking In The Sand"
(Remember remember)
("Walking In The Sand")
Walking hand in hand
(Remember remember)
("Walking In The Sand")
"Walking In The Sand"
(Remember remember)
("Walking In The Sand")
Walking hand in hand
(Remember)
Remember
("Walking In The Sand")
