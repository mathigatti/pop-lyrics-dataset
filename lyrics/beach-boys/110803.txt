I'll bet he's nice
 I'll bet he's twice
 As nice as me and it makes me cry
 'Cause I remember you and I
 Please don't tell me if it's true
 Because I'm still in love with you
 Pretty darlin' you my pretty darlin'
 You pretty darlin you my pretty darlin'
 
 I'll bet he's sweet
 (Bed eh oooo)
 I'll bet he's neat
 (Bed eh oooo)
 I'll bet he's funny and that ain't all
 I'll bet he shows you quite a ball
 Please don't tell me if it's true
 Because I'm still in love with you
 Pretty darlin' you my pretty darlin'
 You pretty darlin you my pretty darlin'
 
 Baby
 Don't you ever tell me that you're leaving
 Now that you got me to believe in
 You are the sunshine and the flower
 Come on and make my every hour
 
 I'll bet he's nice
 (Bed eh oooo)
 I'll bet he's twice
 (Bed eh oooo)
 As nice as me and it makes me cry
 'Cause I remember you and I
 Please don't tell me if it's true
 Because I'm still in love with you
 Pretty darlin' you my pretty darlin'
 You pretty darlin you my pretty darlin'
 
 Well it's you
 You my darlin'
