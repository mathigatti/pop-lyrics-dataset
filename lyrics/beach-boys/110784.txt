Gary likes a girl's tight black pants
Larry knows he doesn't stand a chance
Carl says hurry up and order it quick
Dave gets out to chase that chick

Dennis wonders what's under the hood
A big chrome tach and it sounds real good
I go down to the root beer stand
And drink up all that I can

Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)
Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)
Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)
Cold beer
root beer
Here a mug
there a mug
everybody chug-a-lug

Brian's still glued to the radio
Louie's lookin' out the rear window
Guy's got around to orderin' fries
But root beer's my best buy

Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)
Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)
Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)
Cold beer
root beer
Here a mug
there a mug
everybody chug-a-lug

Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)
Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)
Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)
Cold beer
root beer
Here a mug
there a mug
everybody chug-a-lug

Root beer
need another mug now
Root beer
chug-a-lug-a-lug now
Root beer
need another mug now
Root beer
chug-a-lug-a-lug now
Root beer
need another mug now
Root beer
chug-a-lug-a-lug now
