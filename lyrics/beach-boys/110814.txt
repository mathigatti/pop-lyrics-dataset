Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh


Everyone's in love with you
But you can't fall in love with anyone
Still everyone's in love with you
Though you can't fall in love with only one

So many people have had a love affair
Have had a love to share like mine
But I tell you people
I found something new
A love of a different kind

Everyone's in love with you
Though most just barely glimpse a part of you
They all can see your love shine through
It come s from deep within the heart of you

So many people have had their love affairs
Had their loves to share like mine
Now I tell you people
I witnessed something new
A love that could only be divine

Everyone's in love with you
And though you can't belong to only one
Still everyone's in love with you
Because (beacause) you gave your love
(Beacause) Because you gave your love (you gave your love)
Because you gave your love to everyone
