Silken hair, more silken hair
Fell on her face and no wind was blowin'
(She's goin' bald)


Silken hair, more silken hair
Lay near her pillbox down at her feet
(She'd been on a trip)

I peeked in and when I saw she'd
Lost her hair I thought I would keel
(she's goin' bald)
When she saw her shining forehead
Didn't stop she swooned to the ground
(Really flipped her wig)

Laughed so hard I
Blew my mind
I blew my cool
I blew myself over

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Sha na na, sha na na na na na na na na
What a blow
Sha na na, sha na na na na na na na na
What a blow
Sha na na, sha na na na na na na na na
What a blow
Sha na na, sha na na na na na na na na
What a blow
Sha na na, sha na na

She drew her comb acrost her scalp
And brushed what she had left
I tried to salvage what I could
And threw it in a sack
She made a b-line to her room
And grabbed all kind o' juice
She started pourin' it on her head
And thought it'd grow it back
Ah ha haaaaaa

You're too late mama
Ain't nothin' upside your head
No more no more no more no more

Upside your head

Too late mama
Ain't nothin' upside your head
No more no more no more no more

Upside

Upside your head

You're too late mama
Ain't nothin' upside your head
No more no more no more no more
