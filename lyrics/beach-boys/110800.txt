Wendy, Wendy what went wrong
Oh so wrong
We went together for so long
I never thought a guy could cry
'Til you made it with another guy
Oh Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurt so bad
Wendy, Wendy don't lose your head
Lose your head
Wendy don't believe a word he says
I can't picture you with him
His future looks awful dim
Oh Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurt so bad
Wendy I wouldn't hurt you like that
No no no
I thought we had our love down pat
Guess I was wrong
The farthest thing from my mind
Was the day that I'd wake up to find
My Wendy
Wendy left me alone
Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
Wendy, Wendy...
