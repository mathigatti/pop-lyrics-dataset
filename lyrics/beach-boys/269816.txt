I want her I need her
But I never let her know before
Kept her in the dark
Thought I lost her heart forever


She told me "just show me
The feelings that you keep inside
And I promise that
We can put it back together"

She believes in love again
She belives in me
Now we've gone far beyond
The way we used to be

And in her eyes from deep inside
She finally let me see
She believes in love again
She belives in me

I woke up I spoke up
And let her know the way I feel
Changes I could make
Wouldn't have to take a lifetime

She wants me she needs me
She always let me know before
And now it's up to me
To give her all the things she needs the right way

She believes in love again
She belives in me
Now we've gone far beyond
The way we used to be

And in her eyes from deep inside
She finally let me see
She believes in love again
She belives in me

I just nearly blew it
How could I do it
I think about the pain I had put her through
God I'm sorry
She said she'd recover
If only I'd love her
She'd open up her soul
And share her life with me

She believes in love again
She belives in me
Now we've gone far beyond
The way we used to be
And in her eyes from deep inside
She finally let me see
She believes in love again
She belives in me

In her eyes from deep inside
She finally let me see that
She believes in love again
She believes in me
