Here he is
The hard-working drummer
Denny wilson to sing a song
Well i'm the type of guy
Who'll never settle down
Wherever pretty girls are
Well you know that i'm around
I kiss 'em and i love 'em
'cause to me they're all the same
Yeah i'll hug 'em and i squeeze 'em
Baby they don't even know my name
They call me the wanderer
Yeah the wanderer
I roam around
Around around around around
Yeah, there's guam(?)[guenn] on my left arm
And there's mary on my right arm
And janey is the girl well that i'll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one i love the best
Yeah i'll tear of my sheets
And show her the roses on my chest
'cause i'm the wanderer
Yeah the wanderer
I roam around
Around around around around
Well i roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
I'm as happy as a clown
With my two fists of iron
And going all the time
I'm the type of guy who likes to roam around
I'm never in one place i roam from town to town
And when i find myself a-fallin' for that girl
Yeah i'll hop right into that car of mine
I'll drive around the world
They call me the wanderer
Yeah the wanderer
I roam around
Around around around around
~repeat~ 2 times
Thank you
You're the greatest audience in the world
