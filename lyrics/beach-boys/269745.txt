I have a girlfriend
She says I'm her only one
We wanna get married
But we're so young
So young
Can't marry no one
They say our love is
Just a teenage affection
But no one knows
Our hearts' direction


So young
Can't marry no one
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
Can't marry no one, no one

Pretty soon now
I'll go to sea
Their mother's baby
Will have seen the last of me
So young
Can't marry no one, no one

Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
