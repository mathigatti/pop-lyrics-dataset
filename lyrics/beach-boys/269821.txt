Lots of people with no place to go
I know a place where you can go
You've got the ticket, come on slip inside
And let my song take you for a ride


(Baby)
Come on won't you let me be
By your side from now and eternity
'Cause I love you
Baby I do and now

Can't you see
What has come over me
Oh my life is growing like a big oak tree
'Cause I love you
Baby I do and now

Can't you see

Why don't you come and let me kiss and make it better
I'm not the one who came and left it later
Now you relax, let your mind go free
You won't regret the feeling you receive

(Baby)
Come on won't you let me be
By your side for now and eternity
'Cause I love you
Baby I do and now

Can't you see
What has come over me
For my life is growing like a big oak tree
'Cause I love you
Baby I do and now

Can't you see
My love is growin'
Your heart is knowin'
Our love is growin'

Mama, oh can't you see
What has come over me
For my li-i-ife
Can't you see
What has come over me
For my li-i-i-i-fe
