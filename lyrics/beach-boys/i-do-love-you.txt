When you say you do
Makes me want to spend life with you
I never knew life could be so good
When you say you care
Want to be right there beside you
And show the world
You've been good to me
And you know I do


All my love
You are my love
Without your love I go nowhere
All my love
You are my life
You are the girl I'm dreaming of
You're the one I really love
I do love you
I do love you
I do love you
I do love you

When you say it's true
Lets me know we'll be forever
Insightful joy
Of a love so good
Want to be right there beside you
And tell the world
You've been good to me
And you know I do

All my love
You are my love
Without your love I go nowhere
All my love
You are my live
You are the girl I'm dreaming of
You're the one I really love
I do love you
I do love you
I do love you
I do love you
