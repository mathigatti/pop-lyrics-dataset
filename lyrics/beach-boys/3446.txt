It's automatic when I talk with old friends
Conversations turn to girls we knew
When their hair was soft and long
And the beach was the place to go.


Suntanned bodies and waves of sunshine
The California girls and a beautiful coastline
With warmed up weather let's get together
And do it again.

With a girl the lonely sea looks good in moonlight
Makes your night times warm and out of sight...
It's all right...

Well I've been thinking 'bout all the places
We've surfed and danced and
All the places we've missed, so let's get
Back together and do it again.
