Anna Lee, Anna Lee, the healer
Healer with the healing hands
Makes you well as quick as she can
You'd love to see those smiling eyes
Of Anna Lee


From the Himalaya mountain side
Up in Rishikesh
To a California beach house
Facing towards the sea
Goes a gal who got her fame
By going round healing folks

Anna Lee, Anna Lee, the healer
Healer with the healing hands
Makes you well as quick as she can
You'd feel those healing hands
Of Anna Lee

When she gets a chance to help someone
She's really happy
If you trust her with your ill
She'll quickly make you see
She can fix things up for you
Just like she did for me

Anna Lee, Anna Lee, the healer
She cures people with her hands
I'm just one of her many fans
You'd love to feel those healing hands
Of Anna Lee

The healer, the healer, the healer, the healer
