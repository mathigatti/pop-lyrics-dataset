It's a genuine fact that the Surfers rule

It's plastered on the walls all around the school now
(Surfers rule, Surfers rule)
Becoming just as common as a golden rule now
(Surfers rule, Surfers rule)
Take it or leave it but you better believe it
Surfers rule


They burn't it in the grass on the football field now
(Surfers rule, Surfers rule)
Just try to make them cool it and they'll never yield now
(Surfers rule, Surfers rule)
Take what you've heard now and go pass the word now
Surfers rule

It's a genuine fact that the Surfers rule

A woody full of Surfers pullin' long side a wagon
(Surfers rule, Surfers rule)
The Hodaddies sittin' while the Surfers are draggin'
The Surfers are winnin' and they say as they're grinnin'
Surfers rule
