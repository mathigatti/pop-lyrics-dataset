The Christmas spirit grows with each new day
And it's so close but seems so far away
And yet it comes only once a year
And 'fore you know it, it's already here
The streets are filled with laughter
And so many hearts are gay


Everybody helps to make the spirit bright
The houses turn on their Christmas lights at night
It's worth the wait the whole year through
Just to make happy someone like you
And I'll never outgrow the thrill of Christmas day

It's worth the wait the whole year through
Just to make happy someone like you
And I'll never outgrow the thrill of Christmas day

It's worth the wait the whole year through
Just to make happy someone like you
