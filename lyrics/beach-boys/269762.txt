It's been my secret passion to try it
In Captain Cook fashion, I can't deny it
I want to spend my winters on the Kona coast in Hawaii
For years I saved my pennies and planned it
The great Pacific Ocean we'll span it
I wanna go surfin' where I dig it the most, in Hawaii


(Go to Hawaii)
Hawaiian islands beckon (Hawaii)
And I'll be back here someday, I reckon
And pretty island girls greet you with a flower lei
You'll throw it back into the sea
Hopin' you be comin' back to Hawaii

Suntanned beauties are everywhere
Lovely island ladies with long dark hair
You're sure to find a honey waitin' for you there in Hawaii
Kani and Wahini and Wahowalis, too
Get a friendly aloha from this mecca to you
They're the friendliest people anywhere in Hawaii

(Go to Hawaii)
Welcome to the island mecca.  (Hawaii)
I'll learn to talk like a local, I betcha
And at Lahaina look out for shooting stars
We'll watch them fall into the sea
And it will be just you and me in Hawaii

Winter in the sun and surf would sure be nice
In a south sea garden of paradise
I wanna spend my summer on the Kona coast in Hawaii

(Honolulu, Waikiki, do you wanna come along with me?)
(Waimia up to Hanalai, love to take you to the islands today)
