I've been laying on my back
Like a freight train off a track
Trying to find a job to fit my trade
With the morning sun come 'round
Well I'll be covering plenty of ground
And I don't need nobody to pay my aid
Mmmm pay my aid


Now Bess and me were feeling bad
And all the good jobs they were had
I had to take to sweeping up some floors
Well I don't mind that so much
Or the changing of my luck
But you know I could be doing so much more

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip

Well I'll be coming home tonight
Everything will be all right
And we'll be looking at tomorrow

8. "A Day In The Life Of A Tree"
Time: 3:09 Brother Publishing Co. BMI
Brian Wilson/Jack Rieley

Feel the wind burn through my skin
The pain, the air is killing me
For years my limbs stretched to the sky
A nest for birds to sit and sing

But now my branches suffer
And my leaves don't bear the glow
They did so long ago

One day I was full of life
My sap was rich and I was strong
From seed to tree I grew so tall
Through wind and rain I could not fall

But now my branches suffer
and my leaves don't offer
Poetry to men of song

Trees like me weren't meant to live
If all this world can give
Pollution and slow death

Oh Lord I lay me down
No life's left to be found
There's nothing left for me

Trees like me weren't meant to live
If all this earth can give
Is pollution

Trees like me weren't meant to live
(Oh Lord I lay me down)
If all this earth can give
(My branches to the ground)
Is pollution and slow death
(There's nothing left for me)

Oh Lord I lay me down
My branches to the ground
There's nothing left for me
