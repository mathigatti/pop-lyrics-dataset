Tears (I got tears I got tears) in the morning (in the mornin')
They ain't gonna tell me what to do
No no those tears (I got tears I got tears) I know they're just a warnin' 
(are a warnin')
Reminding me I'm missing you


So you moved out up to Europe
You packed your warmth and you took your soul
Well I hope you do what you're damn sure of
A lonely bed here takes on the cold

Lose a wife change my life we're not together
A canceled future well it's hard on me
Gone you're gone are you gone forever
Hope you love the baby I'm never gonna see

And I've got tears (I've got tears I've got tears) in the morning (in the 
mornin')
They ain't gonna tell me what to do
No no those tears (tears I got tears I got tears) I know they're just a 
warnin' (are a warnin')
Reminding me I'm missing you

Well you know I lit a candle
It's in my heart now where it glows
Day and night feel my light it's gonna stand till
My heart believes in what you chose

I won't let nobody
Carry this load for me
Guess I keep a hold on my sorrow
I've got to feel now all that you see

And I've got tears (I got tears I got tears) in the morning (in the mornin')
They ain't gonna tell me what to do
No no those tears (I got tears I got tears) I know they're just my 
warnin' (are a warnin')
Reminding me I'm missing you
I've still got tears (tears) tears (tears) in the mornin'
(I got tears in the morning I got tears)
They ain't gonna tell me what to do
No no those tears (I got tears I got tears)
I know they're just my warnin' (I got tears)
Reminding me I'm missing you
I'm missing you
