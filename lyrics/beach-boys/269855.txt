When I grow up to be a man

Will I dig the same things 
That turned me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that
I wish I hadn't done what I did?


Will I joke around
And still take both sides?
When I grow up to be a man?

Will I look for the same things
In a woman that I dig in a girl?
Will I settle down fast
Or will I first wanna travel the world?

Now I'm young and free
But how will it be? 
When I grow up to be a man

Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo

Will my kids be proud 
Or think their old man's really a square?
When they're out having fun, yeah
Will I still wanna have my share

Will I love my wife
For the rest of my life
When I grow up to be a man?

What will I be when I grow up to be a man?
Won't last forever
It's kinda sad
Won't last forever
It's kinda sad
Won't last forever
