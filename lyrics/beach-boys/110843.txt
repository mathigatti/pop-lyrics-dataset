Boardwalk (I wanna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (I'm gonna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (I wanna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk


Ah when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof
And the street's so hot you're hoping this whole town is fireproof

Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea (oh, yeah)
I'm on a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be

And when the sun goes down
We'll take a walk along the strand
And as the tide goes out
We'll write "I love you" right there in the sand

Oh, I want to go
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea (oh yeah)
I'm on a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be

Under the boardwalk
Under the boardwalk

Oh, oh, oh
Under the boardwalk (yeah)
Down by the sea (oh, yeah)
I'm on a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be

And when the moon is out
And it's finally cooling down
Don't have to look too far
Because my girl and I just might be found

Oh, oh, oh
Under the boardwalk (yeah)
Down by the sea (oh yeah)
On a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be

Ooh, I'm on a blanket with my pretty baby
Just you and me

Boardwalk (I wanna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (I'm gonna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (I wanna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (I'm gonna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (I wanna take you girl under)
