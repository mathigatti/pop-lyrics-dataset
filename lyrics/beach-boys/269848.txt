I'm thinking about a-this whole world
Late at night I think about the love of this whole world
Lots of different people everywhere
And when I go anywhere I see love I see love I see love


When girls get mad at boys and go
Many times they're just putting on a show
But when they leave you wait alone

You are there like everywhere like everyone you see
Happy cause your living and your free

Now here comes another day for your love
(I'm thinking about a-this whole world)
(A-this whole world)
Love

Wooh ooh ooh
(Wooh ooh ooh)

Aumm woo woo bop didit

Late at night I think about the love of this whole world
(This whole world)
Oomm dot dit it
Oomm dot dit it
Oomm dot dit it
