You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why:
Santa Claus is coming to town


He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's sees you when you're sleeping
He knows if you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness' sake

Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why:
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness' sake

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why:
Santa Claus, yes, Santa Claus
Santa Claus is coming to town
