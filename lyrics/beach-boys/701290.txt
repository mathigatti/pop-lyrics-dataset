Autumn colors have gone
Birds fled south with their song
Snowflakes cover the earth quietly
Night extends through the hours
Coolly lit by the stars
The pulse of life slows silently
Cuddle up in a cozy nook
With a warm drink and a book
Within a winter symphony
Somewhere children outside
Screamin' down a daredevil slide
Rosy-cheeked bundles of cold-weather clothes
Hear the winter winds howl
Pierced by the hoot of an owl
Fingers of frost take a nip at my nose
Cuddle up in a cozy nook
With a warm drink and a book
Within a winter symphony
Winter symphony
Snowflake fantasy
Warms my heart like a tropic sea
There the sun always shines
There you'll always be mine
All in a winter symphony
Winter symphony
Snowflake fantasy
Warms my heart like a tropic sea
There the sun always shines
There you'll always be mine
All in a winter symphony
