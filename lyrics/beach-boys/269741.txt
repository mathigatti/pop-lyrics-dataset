(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
I was born in Little Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in han-an-an-an-and
I wore high-top shoes and shirt-tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
Don't you know my Papa dis'proved
My Mama hooo-ooo-hoooed it
But I told them time and time again
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
Don't you know I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey hey hey
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grows sweeter through the years
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey hey hey
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
My little baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't goin' nowhere
I was knee-high to a chimp
And the love bug bit me
And I have to be with her a thousand years
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
If the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
I know I'll still be standing there
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her
Hey hey hey
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
