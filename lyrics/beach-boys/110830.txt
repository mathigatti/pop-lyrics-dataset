There was a mansion on a hill
 But deep in a secret kingdom
 Where a young prince lived
 He had four sisters and four brothers
 
 The prince had a special bedroom on the ground floor
 With a window that looked down into a deep deep forest
 He could see distant lights from other castles in the kingdom
 From his window
 
 During the day
 He went to school
 When it became night
 He stayed by himself
 Usually in his secret hidden bedroom
 
 One night
 While nearly everyone was asleep
 He took out of the attic a radio
 And he decided to listen to it
