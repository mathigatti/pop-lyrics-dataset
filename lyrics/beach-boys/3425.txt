I know wo many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their head and stay in their safety zone
Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that won't make them defensive


I know there's an answer
I know now but I had to find it by myself

They come on like they're peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They trip through their day
And waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better

I know there's an answer
I know now but I had to find it by myself

Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better

I know there's an answer
I know now but I had to find it by myself
