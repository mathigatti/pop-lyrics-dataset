We took a vow in summertime
Now we find ourselves in late December


I believe that New Year's Eve
Will be the perfect time
For their great surrender

But they don't remember

Anger wants a voice
Voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize
Til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free
From all that questioning
But every time a problem ends
Another one begins

And the stone walls of Harmony Hall
Bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind
Could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes
Inside a place
You thought was dignified

I don't wanna live like this
But I don't wanna die
I don't wanna live like this
But I don't wanna die

Within the halls of power lies
A nervous heart that beats
Like a Young Pretender's

Beneath these velvet gloves I hide
The shameful, crooked hands
Of a moneylender
Cuz I still remember

Anger wants a voice
Voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize
Til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free
From all that questioning
But every time a problem ends
Another one begins

And the stone walls of Harmony Hall
Bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind
Could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes
Inside a place
You thought was dignified
