Bend my finger back (snap)
Wrap it in a paper towel
Break a twig in half and set it straight


Hit me with a wood bat
Hit me with a canister that's fired while
The soldiers drive away

Bend my finger back (snap)
On and on and on and on for days

Hit me with a wood bat
Hit me like a Yankee, like a son of
Freedom, never had a slave

It's etiquette, you idiot
Spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby you are mine
And baby you're not anybody's fool

Bless me with a heart attack
A real cries cardiac
And show me where to find the
Surgeon’s knife

Eviscerate me now (hack)
Take me to my punishment?
The punishment I needed all my life

Bend my finger back (snap)
On and on and on and on with strife

Listen to my bum rap
Listen to the evidence exonerating me from
Being right

It's etiquette, you idiot
Spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't
Ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby you are mine
Baby you're not anybody's fool

You know that I’ve been wicked and the
Road to hell is wide
Cursed by curiosity that made
Us go inside
Everyone was charming but we took 'em for a ride
Baby, you’re not anybody’s fool

Bend my finger back (snap)
Wrap it in a paper towel
Break a twig in half and set it straight

Hit me with a wood bat
Hit me with a canister that's fired while
The soldiers drive away

Bend my finger back (snap)
On and on and on and on for days

Hit me with a wood bat
Hit me like a Yankee, like a son of
Freedom, never had a slave

It's etiquette, you idiot
Spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby you are mine
And baby you're not anybody's fool

The harpsichord is broken and the
Television's fried
The city's getting hotter like a
Country in decline
Everyone's a coward when you look
Them in the eyes
But baby, you're not anybody's fool

See ya next year in Jerusalem
You know, the one at 103rd and Broadway?
Cause this orthodox girl fell in love with the guy at the falafel shop
And why not?
Should she have averted her eyes and just stared
At the laminated poster of the dome of the rock?

And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood

Remembrances of holy days in tarry town and rye
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die

Condolences to gentle hearts who
Couldn’t bear to try
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die

Remembrances of holy days in tarry town and rye
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die
