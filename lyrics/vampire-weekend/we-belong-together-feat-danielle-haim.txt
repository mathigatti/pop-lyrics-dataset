We go together like sound and sight
Black and white, day and night
We go together like left and right
Oh, we go together
We go together like give and take
Pains and aches, real and fake
We go together, don't be opaque
It's clear we go together


We belong together
We belong together
Baby, there's no use in being clever
Baby, it don't mean we'll stay together

We go together like pots and pans
Surf and sand, bottles and cans
We go together like lions and lambs
Oh, we go together
We go together like Keats and Yeats
Bowls and plates, days and dates
We stay united like these old states
It's how we go together

We belong together
We belong together
Baby, there's no use in being clever
Baby, it don't mean we'll stay together

Hallelujah, you're still mine
All I did was waste your time
If there's not some grand design
How'd this pair of stars align?
