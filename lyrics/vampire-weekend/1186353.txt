It's going to take a little time
While you're waiting like a factory line
I'll ride across the park
Backseat on the 79


Wasted days
You've come to pass

So go, I know
You would not stay
It wasn't true
But anyway
Pollination yellow cab

You walk up the stairs
See the French kids by the door
Up one more flight
See the Buddha on the second floor

Coronation
Rickshaw grab

So go, I know
You would not stay
It wasn't true
But anyway
Racist dreams
You should not have

No excuse
To be so callous
Dress yourself
In bleeding madras
Charm your way
Across the Khyber Pass

Stay awake
To break the habit
Sing in praise
Of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step
Along the arch of...

No excuse
To be so callous
Dress yourself
In bleeding madras
Charm your way
Across the Khyber Pass

Stay awake
To break the habit
Sing in praise
Of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step
Along the arch of...
Glass
