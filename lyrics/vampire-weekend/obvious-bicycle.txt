Morning’s come, you've watched the red sun rise
The led still flickers in your eyes
Oh you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one’s gonna spare their time for you
No one’s gonna watch you as you go
From a house you didn’t build and can’t control
Oh you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one’s gonna spare their time for you
You ought to spare the world your labor
It’s been twenty years and no one’s told the truth


So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don’t wait
Don’t wait

So keep that list of who to thank in mind
And don’t forget the rich ones who were kind
Oh you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one’s gonna spare their time for you
Why don’t you spare their world a traitor
Take your wager back and leave before you lose

So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don’t wait
Don’t wait

So while the sun’s coming out
Cover ground, cover ground
And if you find some love for these clowns
Turn around, turn around
I’ll be half asleep on the floor of a high school gym
Thinking of you and wondering if anyone else could begin

To listen
Listen
Don’t wait
Don’t wait

So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don’t wait
Don’t wait
