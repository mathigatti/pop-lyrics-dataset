Every dollar counts
And every morning hurts
We mostly work to live
Until we live to work
She said, "You know,
There's nowhere else to go."
But change in rows
It struck me that the two of us could RUN.


(Horns)

Worlds away from cars
And all the styles and bars
Where a little bit of competition means so much
And a little bit of change is all your little fingers touch
I said, "You know,
There's nowhere else to go."
But change in rows
It struck me that the two of us could RUN.

(Horns)

It's only with you
It's the only else where to go
And I could take two
But I really couldn't ever know

Honey with you
And a little powered radio
We could try.

So lead my feet away
'Cuz all they do is stay
And I don't think your eyes
Have ever looked surprised.

She said, "You know,
There's no where left to go."
But we have found
It struck me that the two of us could RUN

It's only with you
It's the only else way to go
And I can take two
For I really couldn't ever know

Honey with you
And a little powered radio
We could try.
