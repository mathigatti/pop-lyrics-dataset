Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who's going to save a little warmth for me?


We know the fire awaits, unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

If I'm born again I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace
But who's going to say a little grace for me?

We know the fire awaits, unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and i will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

I'm not excited
But should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?

I know I love you
And you love the sea
Wonder if the water contains a little drop, little drop for me

See the sun go down
It's going on down when the night is deep
Want a little light
But who's going to save a little light for me?

We know the fire awaits, unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

I'm not excited
But should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?

I know I love you
And you love the sea
Wonder if the water contains a little drop, little drop for me
