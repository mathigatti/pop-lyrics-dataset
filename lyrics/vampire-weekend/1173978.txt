As a young girl, Louis Vuitton
With your mother, on a sandy lawn
As a sophomore, with reggaeton
And the linens you're sitting on


Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?
Do you want to fuck?
Like you know I do
Like you know I do

But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too

Can you stay up to see the dawn
In the colors of Bennetton?

Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?
Do you want ta?
Like you know I do
Like you know I do

Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too

Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?
Do you want ta?
Like you know I do
Like you know I do
