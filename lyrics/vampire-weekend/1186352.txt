A devastating backstroke
All the way from France
With shiny, shiny cufflinks
A shirtsleeve to enhance


The pin-striped men of morning
Are coming for to dance
With pure Egyptian Cotton
The kids don't stand a chance

You criticize the practice
By murdering their plants
Ignoring all the history
Denying them romance

The pin-striped men of morning
Are coming for to dance
Forty-million dollars
The kids don't stand a chance

I didn't like the business
But that was at first glance
Your pillow feels so soft now
But still you must advance

The pin-striped men of morning
The partners in the dance
The paper's shot to pieces
The kids don't stand a chance
