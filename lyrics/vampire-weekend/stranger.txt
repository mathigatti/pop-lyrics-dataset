I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change


Another night indoors, another sign of life-ife
Wobbling up through the floor
You and Kidada
Ooh, I might get low, low, low
But now I'm too high to know
The sound of you and your sister
I couldn't face these days alone
You got the right light, candles burning
We don't need the moon anymore
I used to look for an answer
I used to knock on every door
But you got the wave on, music playing
Don't need to look anymore

I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change

You and Kidada
Ooh, the lights get low, low, low
And I got nowhere to go
I used to freeze on the dance floor
I watched the icebergs from the shore
But you got the heat on, kettle screaming
Don't need to freeze anymore

I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change

Who knows the reason that kindness lost its hold?
Those better angels confined to minor roles
I left the wilding, wilding, wilding days of old
Your house is warmer the wilderness is cold

Things have never been stranger
Things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change
Things have never been stranger
Things are gonna stay strange
I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change

Ooh
Things have never been stranger (oh)
Things are gonna stay strange (oh)
I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I
