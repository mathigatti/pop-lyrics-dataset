You've been 
Checking on my facts
And I admit 
I have been lax
In double-screening 
What I say
It wasn't funny anyway


I stand corrected

No one cares 
When you are wrong
But I've been 
At this far too long
To act like 
That when we should be
In perfect harmony

I stand corrected

Lord knows 
I haven't tried
I'll take my stand
One last time

Forget the protocol
I'll take your hand
Right in mine
