You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didnt close the door.
You and this model sit outside the side-
In a house on a street they wouldnt park on the night.


Dad was a risk taker.
His was a shoe maker.
You greatest hits 2006,
Little listmaker.
Caught in the melody,
You wait in the car.
You were born with ten fingers
And you're gonna use them all.

Interest in colors I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty
You'll be toasting my health
If an interest in coats,
You should be lining the walls.
When your birth right is interest
You could just screw it all.

Me and my cousins
And you and your cousins
Its a line that is always running.
Me and my cousins,
You and your cousins,
I can feel it coming

You can turn your back on the biddlewood (4x)

Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Its a line thats always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Its a line thats always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming
