I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, leave me to myself
I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, lead me to myself
Oh I was made to live without you,
But I’m never gonna understand, never understand
Oh I was born to live without you,
But I’m never gonna understand, never understand


Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath a chandelier
That’s going down

I thought it over, and drew the curtain
Leave me to my cell, leave me to my cell
I hummed the dies irae as you played the hallelujah
Leave me to my cell, leave me to my cell

If you’d been made to serve a master
You be frightened by the open hand, frightened by the hand
Could I have been made to serve a master
When I’m never gonna understand, never understand

Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier
That’s going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier
That’s going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms
