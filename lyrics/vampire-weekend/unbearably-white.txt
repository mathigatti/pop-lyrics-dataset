Baby, I love you
But that's not enough
And pulling away has been unbearably buff
I ran up the mountain
Out of your sight
The snow on the peak was just unbearably white


The city was freezing
An elegant floe
The wind at the doorway was unbearably cold
You walked to the bedroom
And sat down to write
The page in your notebook was unbearably white

There's an avalanche coming
Don't cover your eyes
It's what you thought that you wanted
It's still a surprise
It's hard on the body
It's hard on the mind
To learn what kept us together, darling
Is what kept us alive

Sooner or later
The story gets told
To tell it myself would be unbearably bold
Presented with darkness
We turn to the light
Could've been smart, we're just unbearably bright

There's an avalanche coming
Don't cover your eyes
It's what you thought that you wanted
It's still a surprise
It's hard on the body
It's hard on the mind
To learn what kept us together, darling
Is what kept us alive

Call it a day
Call it a night
Calloused and cold
And just unbearably white
Call it a day
Call it a night
Calloused and cold
And just unbearably white
Call it a day
Call it a night
Calloused and cold
And just unbearably white

Baby, I love you
But that's not enough
And pulling away has been unbearably buff
I ran up the mountain
Out of your sight
The snow on the peak was just unbearably white

Call it a day
Call it a night
Careless and cold
And just unbearably white
Call it a day
Call it a night
