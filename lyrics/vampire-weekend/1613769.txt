Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
Its locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
All though its been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That Now you're giving up the gun


When I was 17
I had wrists like steel
And I felt complete
And now my body fades
Behind my brass charade
And I'm obsolete
But if the change remains
To see those better days
I'd cut the cannons now
My ears are blown to bits
From all the rifle hits
But Still, I crave that sound

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
Its locked up like a trophy
Foretting all the things its done

And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That Now you're giving up the gun

I heard you play guitar
Down at a seedy bar
Where skinheads used to fight
You Tokugawa smile and your garbage style
Used to save the night


You felt the coming wave
told me we'd all be brave
You said you wouldn't flinch
But in the years that passed
Since I saw you last
You haven't moved an inch

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Foretting all the things its done

And though its been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
that Now you're giving up the gun

I see you shining your way
Go on, go on, go on (8x)

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
Its locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
All though its been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That Now you're giving up the gun
