Tough choice? Don't make me laugh
My life's a joke, your life's a gas
You broke my heart at midnight mass
Now I'm the ghost of Christmas past
The only choice you gave to me
Is one I took reluctantly
'Cause when we play democracy
You always take immunity


How long 'til we sink to the bottom of the sea?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

How long? (la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)

What's the point of getting clean?
You'll wear the same old dirty jeans
What's the point of being seen?
Those eyes are cruel, those eyes are mean
What's the point of human beings?
A sharpie face on tangerines
Why's it felt like Halloween since Christmas 2017?

How long?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

How long? (la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)

Getting to the top
Wasn't supposed to be this hard
The house is on Mulholland Drive
The car's on Sunset Boulevard
The registration's here with me
But neither of us has the key
We can live down in the flats
The hills will fall eventually

How long 'til we sink to the bottom of the sea?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

How long? (la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)

How long?
How long?
How long?
How long?
