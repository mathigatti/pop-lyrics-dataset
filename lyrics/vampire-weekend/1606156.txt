An ancient business
A modern piece of glasswork
Down on the corner that
You walk each day in passing
The elderly sales clerk
Won't eye us with suspicion
The whole, immortal corporation's given it's permission


A little stairway
A little bit of carpet
A pair of mirrors that
Are facing one another

Out in both directions
A thousand little Julia's
That come together
In the middle of Manhattan

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

Around the corner
The house that modern art built
A house for modern art
To keep it out the closets
Of people who might own it
The sins of pride and envy
And on the second floor
The Richard Cera Skate Park

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

Sit on the park walk
Ask all the right questions
"Why are the horses racing taxis in the winter?"

Look up at the buildings
Imagine who might live there
Imagining you're wolfords
In a ball upon the sink there.

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once
