Occident out
On the weekend
That's the way
That we relax


English Breakfast
Tastes like Darjeeling
But she's too cute
To even ask

Blake's got a new face
(Blake's got a new face)

Nastiness
Will cause your doom
Turn and walk back
To your room

The precedent's
Already set now
You spend a week
In Old San Juan

Spanish brownstone
With chairs of leather
And Spanish waves
To roll along

Majesty's
Not overheard
Cryptographs
Can't stand the word

Oh, your collegiate grief
Has left you dowdy
In sweatshirts
Absolute horror
