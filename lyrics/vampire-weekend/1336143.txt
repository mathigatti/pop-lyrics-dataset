I saw you
Down at the station
Your leather suitcase
Burst at the seems
Stay all day
Up in your rooms now
That's not a problem
You've ever seen


Fall on your knees
Wasting your arrows
You found 
You've walked 
Along these halls

I awoke
Up in a bedroom
You've gone up 
Hunting
I was asleep
Spend my day
Out at the fountain
That's not a problem
You've had foreseen

Fall on your knees
Wasting your arrows
You found 
You've walked 
Along these halls

Fall on your knees
Wasting your arrows
You found 
You've walked 
Along these halls

Oh, it's no use
At all
But that line 
In the church 
Could still remain
