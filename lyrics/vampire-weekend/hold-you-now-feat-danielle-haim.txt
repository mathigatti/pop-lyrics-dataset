I know the reason why you think you gotta leave
Promises of future glory don't make a case for me
I did my best and all the rest is hidden by the clouds
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now


Leaving on your wedding day, all calm and dressed in white
All I'll keep's the memory of one last crooked night
The pews are getting filled up, the organ's playing loud
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now
Alright

God, yu tekem laef blong mi
Mi mi givim nao long yu
Bak mi giv evride
Blong leftemap nem blong yu

I know the reason why you think I oughta stay
Funny how you're telling me on my wedding day
Crying in those rumpled sheets like someone's ‘bout to die
You just watch your mouth when talking ‘bout the father of the bride

Why's your heart grown heavy, boy, when things were feeling light?
Turning this June morning into some dark judgment night
This ain't the end of nothing much, it's just another round
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now

God, yu tekem laef blong mi
Mi mi givim nao long yu
Bak mi giv evride
Blong leftemap nem blong yu

Alright
