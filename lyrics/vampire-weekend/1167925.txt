Who gives a fuck about an oxford comma?
I've seen those english dramas too
They're cruel
So if there's any other way
To spell the word
It's fine with me, with me


Why would you speak to me that way
Especially when i always said that i
Haven't got the words for you
All your diction
Dripping with disdain
Through the pain
I always tell the truth

Who gives a fuck about an oxford comma?
I climbed to dharamsala too
I did
I met the highest lama
His accent sounded fine
To me, to me

Check your handbook
It's no trick
Take the chapstick
Put it on your lips
Crack a smile
Adjust my tie
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys

Why would you lie
About how much coal you have?
Why would you lie
About something dumb like that?
Why would you lie
About anything at all?
First the window
Then it's to the wall
Lil' jon, he always tells the truth

Check your passport
It's no trick
Take the chapstick
Put it on your lips
Crack a smile
Adjust my tie
Know your butler
Unlike other guys

Why would you lie
About how much coal you have?
Why would you lie
About something dumb like that?
Why would you lie
About anything at all?
First the window
Then it's through the wall
Why would you tape my conversations?
Show your paintings
At the united nations
Lil' jon, he always tells the truth
