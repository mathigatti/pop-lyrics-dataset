Ion displacement
Won't work
In the basement
Especially
When I'm not with you
Here in the heartland
A feeling so startling
I don't know what I should do


Oh, Bryn
You see through the dark
Right past the fireflies
That sleep in my heart
You know, it's easy to see
Wait for the season
To come back to me

Lights by the ocean
A westerly motion
That moves
California to sea
Eyes like a seagull
No Kansas-born beetle
Could ever
Come close to that free

Oh, Bryn
You see through the dark
Right past the fireflies
That sleep in my heart
You know, it's easy to see
Wait for the season
To come back to me
