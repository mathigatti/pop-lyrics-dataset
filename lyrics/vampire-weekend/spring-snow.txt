The snow fell last night
Your flight couldn't leave
Come back to the bed
Let's take this reprieve
It felt like the end
The end's been delayed
You're here in my arms
So what should I say?


The words of a song
The prayers that we pray
The lock on the door
Won't keep them away
The snow slows them down
If just for a a day
But here comes the sun
Those toxic old rays

Trains start to move
Bells start to ring
The seasons we had
Don't mean anything

Trains start moving
Bells start to ring
The seasons we had
Don't mean anything
