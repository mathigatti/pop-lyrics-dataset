Flower moon cursed the night
If the sun don't make things right
Then it's gonna take a year
Gonna take a year


Flower moon, sacred sign
Coca-Cola and red wine
Now's the time to disappear
Gonna take a year

It was the right place, wrong time
Another night at the borderline
Another night in the sway of the flower moon
It was the right week on a cursed day
Another chapter was underway
Another year in the light of the flower moon

It was the right place, wrong time
Another night at the borderline
Another night in the sway of the flower moon
It was the right week on a cursed day
Another chapter was underway
Another year in the light of the flower moon

It was the right place, wrong time
Another night at the borderline
Another night in the sway of the flower moon
It was the right week on a cursed day
Another chapter was underway
Another year in the light of the flower moon

A shift in weight
A simple twist of fate
Suddenly, it's much too late
The rising tide's already lapping at the gate

Flower moon cursed the night
If the sun don't make things right
Then it's gonna take a year
Gonna take a year

Flower moon, sacred sign
Coca-Cola and red wine
Now's the time to disappear
Gonna take a year

Flower moon cursed the night
If the sun don't make things right
Then it's gonna take a year
Gonna take a year
