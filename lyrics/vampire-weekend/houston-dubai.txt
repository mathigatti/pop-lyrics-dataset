Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
I just want to wake up
Where I went to sleep


As this old world keeps turning
Me through my fever dream
Houston just did ninety-nine
Dubai's one-eighteen

Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
I just want to wake up
Where I went to sleep

I got a wife back home, you know
She always thinks I cheat
I think about those Denton days
When life was light and sweet

Every time I think I'm done
The plane keeps flying back
And every race beneath the sun
Just takes another lap

Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
I just want to wake up
Where I went to sleep

I know the price, I know the map
But don't know what it's worth
So let the thieves and killers
Take my treasure on the Earth

Houston, goodbye
Goodbye to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep
Houston, goodbye
Goodbye to Houston
Now I'm gonna wake up
Where I went to sleep
