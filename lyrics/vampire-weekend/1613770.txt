Unsentimental,
Traveling around,
Sure of myself,
Sure of it now,
But you were standing there so close to me,
Like the future was supposed to be,
In the aisles of the Grocery,
And the blocks uptown.


I remember,
Remember well,
But if I'd forgotten,
Could you tell?

In the shadow of your first attack,
I was questioning and looking back,
You said "baby we don't speak of that",
Like a real aristocrat.

Compound to compound,
Lazy and safe,
Wanted to leave it
Wanted to wait.

When the taxi door was open wide,
I pretended I was horrified,
By the uniform and clothes outside,
Of the courtyard gate,

You're not a victim,
But neither am I,
Nostalgic for garbage,
Desperate for time.

I could blame it on your mother's hair,
Or the colors that you father wears,
But I know that I was never fair,
You were always fine.

Unsentimental,
Traveling around,
Sure of myself,
Sure of it now.
But you were standing there so close to me,
Like the future was supposed to be,
In the aisles of the Grocery,
And the blocks uptown.

I remember,
Remember well,
But if I'd forgotten,
Could you tell?

In the shadow of your first attack,
I was questioning and looking back,
You said "baby we don't speak of that",
Like a real aristocrat.
