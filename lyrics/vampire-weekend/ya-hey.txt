Oh, sweet thing
Zion doesn’t love you
Babylon don’t love you
But you love everything


Oh, you saint
America don’t love you
So I could never love you
In spite of everything

In the dark of this place, there’s the glow of your face
There’s the dust on the screen, of this broken machine
And I can’t help but feel, that I made some mistake, but I let it go
Ya hey
Ya hey
Ya hey

Through the fire and through the flames
{ya hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, yo hey}
You won’t even say your name
{ya hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, yo hey}
Through the fire and through the flames, you won’t even say your name
Only I am that I am
But who could ever live that way?
{ya hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, yo hey}

Oh
The Motherland don’t love you
The Fatherland don’t love you
So why love anything?

Oh, good God
The faithless they don’t love you
The zealous hearts don’t love you
And that’s not gonna change

All the cameras and files, all the paranoid style
All the tension and fear of a secret career
And I can't help but feel, that you see the mistakes, but you let it go
Ya hey
Ya hey
Ya hey

Through the fire and through the flames
{ya hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, yo hey}
You won’t even say your name
{ya hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, yo hey}
Through the heart and through the flames, you won’t even say your name
You say I am that I am
But who could ever live that way?
{ya hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, yo hey}


Outside the tents, on the festival grounds
As the air began to cool, and the sun went down
My soul swooned, as I faintly heard the sound
Of you spinning Israelites, into 19th Nervous Breakdown

Through the fire and through the flames
{ya hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, yo hey}
You won’t even say your name
{ya hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, yo hey}

Through the fire and through the flames, you won’t even say your name
Only I am that I am
But who could ever live that way?

Through the fire and through the flames, you won’t even say your name
Only I am that I am
But who could ever live that way?
{ya hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, ya hey, ya yo hey, yo hey}
