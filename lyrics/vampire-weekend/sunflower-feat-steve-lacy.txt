Sunflower in the morning
Standing in the garden
All before you wake
No power can compel you
Out into the daylight
Let that evil wait


Strange thought upon the pillow
What day demands a date?
Well I don’t know

Sunflower in the evening
Standing in the garden
Taking up that space
No power can compel me
Back into the daylight
Let that evil wait

Strange thought upon the pillow
What day demands a date?
Well I don’t know
