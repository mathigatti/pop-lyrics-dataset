Only in the way you want it
Only on the day you want it
Only with your understanding and every single day you want it


Only in the way you want it
Only on the day you want it
Only with your understanding and every single day you want it
You, you

City with the weight upon it
City in the way you want it
City with the safety of a never-ending place on it

City with the weight upon it
City in the way you want it
City with the safety of a never-ending place on it
You, you

We worshipped you
Your red right hand
Won't we see you once again?
In foreign soil, in foreign land
Who will guide us through the end?

Calling on a change, you want it
Calling on the same, you want it
Calling for the misery to always be explained, you want it

Calling on a change, you want it
Calling on the same, you want it
Calling for the misery to always be explained, you want it
You, you

Energetic praise you wanted
Any kind of praise you wanted
Little bit of light to get us through the final days you wanted

Energetic praise you wanted
Any kind of praise you wanted
Little bit of light to get us through the final days you wanted
You, too

We worshipped you
Your red right hand
Won't we see you once again?
In foreign soil, in foreign land
Who will guide us through the end?
