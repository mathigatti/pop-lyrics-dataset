I could let it be what she wants to
Shes never asking questions
Never puts up a fight
I spent a couple years trying to follow her
Lurking in the shadows when she's nowhere inside


Oh, I could be wrong
(I could be wrong)
But she knows where to hide
(She knows to hide)
When she's leading me on
(Leading me on)
I just take it in stride
(In stride and stride)

Now everybody says I should take it slowly
I let her set the pace
And I follow her lead
Building up a ***, a situation
She takes it all apart
With a look I can't read

And I could be wrong
(I could be wrong)
But she knows where to hide
(She knows to hide)
When she's leading me on
(Leading me on)
I just take it in stride
(In stride and stride)

She keeps a lot of boys alone and waiting
Shes keeping me unmatched
When I used to be bold
She keeps it to the best
I won't say crafted
She keeps it to herself
But I won't say go

And I thought I had it figured out
She escapes me
I wanted to discuss it
But she turned off her phone

And I tried to give it time and understanding
But I can't comprehend
Is why she still ***

I could be wrong
(I could be wrong)
But she knows where to hide
(She knows to hide)
When she's leading me on
(Leading me on)
I just take it in stride
(In stride and stride)


She makes me want to shout it out
Shout it out
Shout it out at the top of my lungs
