Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?

Don't you know that your life would be lost out of Cape Cod tonight?


Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?

Walcott, the bottleneck is a shit show
Hyannisport is a ghetto out of Cape Cod tonight

Lobster's claw is sharp as knives
Evil feasts on human lives
The Holy Roman Empire roots for you

All the way to the Garden State, out of Cape Cod tonight

Walcott, fuck the women from Wellfleet
Fuck the bears from Provincetown
Heed my words and take flight

Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?
