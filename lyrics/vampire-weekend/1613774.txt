Holiday, O, A Holiday!
And the best one of the year
Dozing off underneath my sheets
While I cover both my ears


But if I wait for a holiday could it ever stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day never seemed so clear

Holiday, still so far away
Our republic on the beach
I can't forget just how bad it gets
When I'm counting on my teeth

But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

A vegetarian since the invasion
She'd never seen the word BOMBS
She'd never seen the word BOMBS blown up
To 96 point Futura
She'd never seen an AK
In a yellowy Day Glo display
A t-shirt so lovely it turned all the history books grey

I've got wheels, I've got cutter spray
And a healthy sense of worth
Half of me is the gasoline
But the other half's the surf
So if I wait for a holiday could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day never seemed so clear
