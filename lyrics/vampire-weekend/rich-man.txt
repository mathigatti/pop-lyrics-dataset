When I was young, I was told I'd find
One rich man in ten has a satisfied mind
And I’m the one


100 to one says I wouldn't react
But I'm the 1 in 100 who would swing right back
Yes, I’m the one

Thousands of steps and staircases to climb
Thousands of men you'd most likely decline
And yet I'm the one

10, 000 to 1, could I possibly bet?
I'm compelled by your love and I haven't lost yet
Clearly, you're the one

One in a million don't mean what it meant
And these millions of gold coins don't gleam when they’re spent
You’re left with none

Ten million dollars could win the whole lot
But if ten million dollars is all that you got
You won't be the one

Hundreds of millions of papers to sign
Hundreds of millions of souls left behind
And yet, we’re the ones

A billion to one, don't the odds make you sick?
To be one in a billion's a terrible trick
You're the wretched one

When I was young, I was told I’d find
One rich man in ten has a satisfied mind
And I'm the one
