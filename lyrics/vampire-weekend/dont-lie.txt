One look sent knees to the ground,
Young bloods can't be settling down
Young hearts need the pressure to pound,
So hold me close my baby


Don't lie, I want him to know
Gods' loves die young, is he ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know

Young turks, young saturday nights
Young hips shouldn't break on the ice
Old flames, they can't warm you tonight
So keep it cool, my baby

Don't lie, I want him to know
Dial up, three rings and return him his gold
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a headstone right in front of you
And everyone I know

Don't lie, I'm want 'em to know
God's love die young, are you ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
Cause the fire can't last and the winter's cold

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know
