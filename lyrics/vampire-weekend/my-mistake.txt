Skin under sun
Summer breeze, summer break
Oh, I was young then
Hadn't made my mistake
Unaware of the fall
Unaware of my fate
There was peace in the valley
'Til I made my mistake


Quick in the night
As the storm took its shape
Caught at the border
As I made my escape
It was cold, it was dark
You were cruel, you were fake
Hoping for kindness
Was my greatest mistake

I was young then
Hadn't made my mistake
There was choice to get out
Or remain in this state
There was springtime and future
'Til I made my mistake

Quick in the night
As the storm took its shape
Caught at the border
As I made my escape
It was cold, it was dark
I was foolish and lame
Hoping for kindness
Was my greatest mistake
