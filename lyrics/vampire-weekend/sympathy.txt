I think I take myself too serious
It's not that serious


Alone in someone's bedroom, she firmly took my hand
The isolation ended, I began to understand
In the ping-pong match of constant desire
I was never gonna get ahead
'Cause I was looking in the mirror

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

Judeo-Christianity, I'd never heard the words
Enemies for centuries, until there was a third
In the ping-pong match of constant desire
I was never gonna get ahead
'Cause I was looking in the mirror

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

Diego Garcia, surrounded by the waves
Lonely in the ocean, but in every other way
It was full of love
In the warmest fellow-feeling

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

I didn't have your sympathy, but I knew where to start
Explaining to you patiently that the one who broke my heart
Would have broken yours
And thrown the pieces in the river

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

Sympa
Sympa
Let's go
Sympa
Let's go
Sympa
Let's go
Sympa

Desperate for an enemy, but too afraid to kill
Use the pain of someone else and triumph for their will
And spill the blood
Of the arrogant mosquitoes

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go!
