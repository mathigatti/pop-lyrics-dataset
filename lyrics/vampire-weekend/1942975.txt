Heres every world
Cutting teeth and I talk to curl
Oohhh Grind into the soil
In the river beds, I am
Oooh
And now the play that I see
Has got an extra miles
Oooh
Intestines stretch across the heartland I am
( intrumental break)
And all the silos have missiles
And all the tables have bread on them
Now you know girls beautiful and big tailed
Million little boys with sling shots and big dreams
There's a single snowflake for every blade of grass
And now the silos have missiles
And know the tables have bread on them
I am
(Instumental break)
It's a cool bath
I am
It's a cool bath
I am
It's a cool bath
I am
Ohhh ohhh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
