You torched a saab like a pile of leaves
I'd gone to find some better wheels
Four, five meters running round the bend
When the government agents surround you again
If diane young won't change your mind,
Baby, baby, baby, baby right on time


Out of control but you're playing a role
Do you think you can go til the 18th hole
Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship?
Try to go it alone on your own for a bit

If diane young won't change your mind,
Baby, baby, baby, baby right on time
Baby baby baby baby right on
Baby baby baby baby right on
Baby baby baby it's a light on
Baby baby baby it's a lifetime
Baby baby baby baby right on
Time, time, time, time, time
Baby baby baby baby right on time

If diane young won't change your mind,
Baby, baby, baby, baby right on time
Irish and proud, baby, naturally
But you got the luck of a kennedy
So grab the wheel and keep holding it tight
'Til you're tottering off into that good night

If diane young won't change your mind,
Baby, baby, baby, baby right on time

Baby baby baby baby right on
Baby baby baby baby right on
Baby baby baby it's a light on
Baby baby baby it's a lifetime
Baby baby baby baby right on
Time, time, time, time, time
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Nobody knows what the future holds
And it's bad enough just getting old
Live my life in self-defense
You know I love the past, cuz I hate suspense...
If diane young won't change your mind,
Baby, baby, baby, baby right on time
