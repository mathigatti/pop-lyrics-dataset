We sit in the car outside your house
I can feel the heat coming 'round
I go to put my arm around you and you
give me a look like I'm way out of bounds, you let out one of your bored sighs
Well lately, when I look into your eyes I'm goin' down
We get dressed up and we go out baby for the night
We come home early burning, burning, burning in some fire fight
I'm sick and tired of your setting me up, setting me up just to knock-a, knock-a, knock-a me down
I pull you close but when we kiss I can feel a doubt
I remember back when we started, my kisses used to turn you inside out
I used to drive you to work in the morning
Friday night I'd drive you all around
You used to love to drive me wild
But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down
