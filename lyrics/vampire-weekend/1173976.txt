Johanna drove slowly
Into the city
The Hudson River
All filled with snow
She spied the ring
On His Honor's finger
Oh-oh-oh


A thousand years
In one piece of silver
She took it from
His lilywhite hand
Showed no fear
She'd seen the thing
In the Young Men's Wing
At Sloan-Kettering

Look outside
At the raincoats coming, say oh

His Honor drove
Southward seeking exotica
Down to the Pueblo
Huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth
On turquoise harmonicas
Oh, oh, oh

I saw Johanna
Down in the subway
She took an apartment
In Washington Heights
Half of the ring
Lies here with me
But the other half's
At the bottom of the sea
