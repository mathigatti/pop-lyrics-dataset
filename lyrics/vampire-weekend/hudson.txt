Hudson died in Hudson bay
The water took its victim’s name
Now rivers rise told Riverside
To change their names again


A stranger walked in through the door
Said “all apartments are pre-war”
We laughed and asked him for his name
He stayed until the end

We watched the germans play the greeks
He marked the ninety-nine-year lease
Our fathers signed which I declined
To try and comprehend

Over and over again are these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that’s changing hands
The time has come
The clock is such a drag
All you who change your stripes
Can wrap me in the flag

The legendary wooden gate
First established real-estate
It’s lost a time like other crimes
Though on this pleasant land

Over and over again are these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that’s changing hands
The time has come
The clock is such a drag
All you who change your stripes
Can wrap me in the flag

Hudson died in hudson bay
But I was born on Sutton Place
The rising tide helped me decide
To change my name again

Some men tend to linger on
And some make haste from Babylon
Some were on the ruined home
Rejoicing…To the end

Over and over again are these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that’s changing hands
The time has come
The clock is such a drag
All you who change your stripes
Can wrap me in the flag

The lines are drawn
The map is such a drag
All you who change your stripes
Can wrap me in the flag
