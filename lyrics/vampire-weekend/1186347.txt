I see a mansard roof 
Through the trees
I see a salty message 
Written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet
The hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings 
I can see them too


The Argentines 
Collapse in defeat
The admiralty surveys 
The remnants of the fleet
The ground beneath their feet
Is a nautically-mapped sheet
As thin as paper
While it slips away from view
