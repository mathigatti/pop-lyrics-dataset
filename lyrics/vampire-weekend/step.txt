Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl


Back, back, way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg, Anchorage and Dar es Salaam
While home in New York was champagne and disco
Tapes from L.A. Slash San Francisco
But actually Oakland and not Alameda
Your girl was in Berkley with her communist reader
Mine was entombed within boombox and walkman
I was a hoarder, but girl that was back then

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I’m stronger now
I’m ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can’t do it alone
I can’t do it alone

Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl

Ancestors told me that their girl was better
She’s richer than croesus
She’s tougher than leather
I just ignored all the tales of a past life
Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
And punks who would laugh when they saw us together
Well they didn’t know how to dress for the weather
I can still see them there huddled on Astor
Snow falling slow to the sound of the master

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I’m stronger now
I’m ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can’t do it alone
I can’t do it alone

Wisdom’s a gift, but you’d trade it for youth
Age is an honor, it’s still not the truth
We saw the stars when they hid from the world
You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl
Maybe she’s gone and I can’t resurrect her
The truth is she doesn’t need me to protect her
We know the true death, the true way of all flesh
Everyone’s dying, but girl you’re not old yet

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I’m stronger now
I’m ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can’t do it alone
I can’t do it alone

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I’m stronger now
I’m ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can’t do it alone
I can’t do it alone

Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl
