Something's happening in the country
And the government’s to blame
We got married in a gold rush
And the rush has never felt the same


Shared a moment in a café
Shared a kiss in pouring rain
We got married in a gold rush
And the sight of gold will always bring me pain

I don't wanna hear the rumors, please don't say it loud
I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud
Boy, who’s your baby?
Girl, if you don't know by now
There's two seats on the midnight train
The gold won't weigh us down

Hanging gardens turned to desert
All that loving turned to hate
We got married in a gold rush
And those wedding bells were ringing out our fate

I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud
I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud
Boy, who's your baby?
Girl, if you don't know by now
There’s two seats on the midnight train
The gold won’t weigh us down

The rush is on to somewhere else, we're running out of time
Everything was ours, now it’s just an empty mine
Animals don't understand the words on the danger sign
For them, it's just some shade from the morning shine

I thought you might learn the language
I thought you might learn to sing
We were born before the gold rush
So why can't I remember anything?
I want to put things back together
I wanna give, I don’t wanna take
Time to disavow the gold rush
And the bitterness that's flourished in its wake

I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud
Please don't say it loud
I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud
Boy, who's your baby?
Girl, if you don't know by now
There's two seats on the midnight train
The gold won't weigh us down

I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud
Please don't say it loud
I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud
Boy, who's your baby?
Girl, if you don't know by now
There's two seats on the midnight train
The gold won't weigh us down
