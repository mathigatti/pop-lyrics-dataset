I wake up
My shoulder's cold
I've got to leave here
Before I go
I pull my shirt on
Walk out the door
Drag my feet
Along the floor
I pull my shirt on
Walk out the door
Drag my feet
Along the floor


Then I see you
You're walking
Cross the campus
Cruel professor
Studying romances
How am I supposed
To pretend
I never want
To see you again?
How am I supposed
To pretend
I never want
To see you again?

Walk to class
In front of ya
Spilled kefir
On your keffiyah
You look inside
And turn to the door
Drag your feet
Along the floor

Then I see you
You're walking
Cross the campus
Cruel professor
Studying romances
How am I supposed
To pretend
I never want
To see you again?
How am I supposed
To pretend
I never want
To see you again?

In the afternoon
You're out
On the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping
On the balcony
After class
