You should have let me know that I have no chance at all
I can never be what you wanted
Should let me know… Still think about us
You told me you was on it!
Sometimes I wonder why, why I even bother
Try to pull you out, boy!
Should have let me know I would lose you to the drink


Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide you, I can guide you
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you’re scared to death
Running out of breath
I can hold you, hold you!

You should have let me know
But you worked around the clock
They try to live harder, yeah!
You should have let me know
But you’re afraid to love me
You’re looking like a liar!
Sometimes I wonder why, why I even ask you
But I do!

Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide you, I can guide you
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you’re scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you!
