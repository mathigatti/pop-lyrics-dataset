Are you gonna hurt me now?
Or are you gonna hurt me later?
Are you gonna go to town?
Maybe you should play it safer


You've got me all dressed up tonight
Springsteen on the radio
You've got me all freaked out tonight
Somethin' you're tellin' me- what? I don't know

You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but

You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

Drinks on the patio

Are you gonna tell me now?
Are you gonna tell me later?
'Cause if you think that I don't know
I'm gonna have to say you're crazy

I'm getting all dressed up tonight
Dressed up just to hear you, boy
I already know what you got in store
Why I go, baby, I don't know

'Cause you don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but

You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
Actin' like a big shot
I'm sure
So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
You're actin' like a big shot

You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again
