Alright, you caught me
I don't play a good guitar
But, what do you want from me?
It's just a stupid bar
I didn't promise anything, no


You think I'm pretty and I like the way you talk
You like my music and I like the way you walk
So, I think we're gonna get along

I like the way you wear
Your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair comes down
And makes you look older
How you get so handsome, my boy?

Pretty baby, pretty baby

The way your face is shaped
I wonder if you know
The way you stand there
And your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night now

Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me, and tell me, to come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
You want here, no?
You want here, no?

Pretty baby, pretty baby
