I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl


When you wake up to the day
And see the city, dark and gray
You can already see the curtain coming down
Sittin', open up your files
Right click just to see her smile
Transfer to your heart, and let the world go ’round
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darlin', I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

​iPhone ringing, boss is screaming
On the TV, news streaming
It means nothing to you though, you tune it out
Close your eyes and change the station
Switch the pictures on your wavelength
Put me on your playlist, I’m your favorite song
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darlin', I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

Candlelight burns twice as bright, baby burns half as long
So keep your fire burning, so you always love me strong
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah-woah
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah, baby
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah-woah
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah, baby

Now it's night time, driving uptown
City's sparkling, but you shut down
So you signal right and turn your engine off
Cars fly by you, stars beside you
Turn that radio inside you
Tune the station that's playing the one you love
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl
When it all gets too much
Darlin', I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby
I can be your dream girl, baby
