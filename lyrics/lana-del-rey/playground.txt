They all know my name now
It’s just another lonely day on the playground


I just wanna party boy, I don’t wanna fight
But everybody knows that that’s the way it is
Only players can survive

They all know my name now
It’s just another lonely day on the playground
(Only players can survive)
Rain, rain go away, now
Come again another day in the game now
(Only players can survive)

I just wanna party boy, I don’t wanna fight
But everybody knows that that’s the way it is
Only players can survive

They all know my name now
It’s just another lonely day on the playground
(Only players can survive)
Rain, rain go away, now
Come again another day in the game now
(Only players can survive)

Ring around the rosie, oh
I don’t wanna fall down
Keep my feet on the ground
Pocket full of nursery rhymes
I’m just biding my time
Biding my lines

They all know my name now

Come again another day in the game now
(Only players can survive)

Ring around the rosie, oh
I don’t wanna fall down
Keep my feet on the ground
Pocket full of nursery rhymes
I’m just biding my times
Biding my lines
