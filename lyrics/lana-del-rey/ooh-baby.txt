Ooh Baby, can’t you hear out favorite song
Ooh Baby, make me wait a bit too long
I don’t ever wanna stop, show me everything you got
I’ve done this before and I should know better
Ooh Baby what planet are you o-on?


What’cha waiting for?
What’cha waiting for?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me
Did you say that there’s a chance for me?
Are you ready now?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Should be taking off your pants for me
Are you ready for me finally?
Are you ready now?

Ooh Baby look at all your hard well friends
Ooh Baby thinking I don’t understand
Cause I’m drinking diet coke a lot

Sucking on my lollipops,
I’m the one that grown up, but no one’s better
Ooh Baby when you gonna be my man?

What’cha waiting for?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?

Are you ready now?

You tell me that you love me

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me
Did you say that there’s a chance for me?
