Even my best days without you
Were nothing in comparison to my worst days once I had found you
Once I had you, I had everything
I had everything
I had everything
Please don't leave
It's all happening


When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
At last you're beside me
I have you
Yes, I have you smiling in your sleep
Pillow talk to me
In my wildest dreams I never knew
I'd find somebody like you

Like you
Like, like you
I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like you

When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
At last you're beside me
I have you
Yes, I have you smiling in your sleep
Pillow talk to me
In my wildest dreams I never knew
I'd find somebody like you

Like you
Like, like you
I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like you
