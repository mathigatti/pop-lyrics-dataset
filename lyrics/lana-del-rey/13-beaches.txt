I don't belong in the world
That's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn
There's something blocking my escape


It took thirteen beaches
To find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With dripping peaches
I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

But I still get lonely
And, baby, only then
Do I let myself recline?
Can I let go
And let your memory dance?
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal

And that I've been dying
For something real
That I've been dying
For something real

It took thirteen beaches
To find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura
And lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

But you still can find me
If you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies
Feeling hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across that county line

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal

And that I've been dying
For something real
That I've been dying
For something real

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
