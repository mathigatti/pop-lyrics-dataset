Would you be mine?
Would you be my baby tonight?
Could be kissing my fruit punch lips
In the bright sunshine
'Cause I like you quite a lot
Everything you got
Don't you know?
It's you that I adore
Though I make the boys fall like dominoes


Kiss me in the d-a-r-k, dark tonight
(D-a-r-k, do it my way)
Kiss me in the p-a-r-k, park tonight
(P-a-r-k, let them all say)

Hey, Lolita, hey
Hey, Lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey, Lolita, hey
Hey, Lolita, hey
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope, skipping heartbeats
With the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down

I could be yours, I could be your baby tonight
Topple you down from your sky 40 stories high
Shining like a God
Can't believe I caught you and so
Look at what I bought, not a second thought
Oh, Romeo

Kiss me in the d-a-r-k, dark tonight
(D-a-r-k, do it my way)
Kiss me in the p-a-r-k, park tonight
(P-a-r-k, let them all say)

Hey, Lolita, hey
Hey, Lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey, Lolita, hey
Hey, Lolita, hey
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope, skipping heartbeats
With the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down

I want my cake and I want to eat it too
I want to have fun and be in love with you
I know that I'm a mess with my long hair
And my suntan, short dress
Bare feet, I don't care
What they say about me, what they say about me
Because I know that it's l-o-v-e
You make me happy, you make me happy
And I never listen to anyone
(Let them all say)

Hey, Lolita, hey
Hey, Lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey, Lolita, hey
Hey, Lolita, hey
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope, skipping heartbeats
With the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down
