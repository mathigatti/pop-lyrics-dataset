You say that you wanna go
To a land that's far away
How are we supposed to get there
With the way that we're living today?


You talk lots about God
Freedom comes from the call
But that's not what this bitch wants
Not what I want at all

I want money, power and glory
I want money, and all your power, all your glory
Alleluia! I wanna take you for all that you got
Alleluia! I'm gonna take them for all that they got

The Sun also rises on those who fail the call
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
I can do it if you really, really like that
I know what you really want, b-baby
I can do it if you think you like that
You should run, boy, run

I want money, power and glory
I want money, and all your power, all your glory
Alleluia! I wanna take you for all that you got
Alleluia! I'm gonna take them for all that they got

Dope and diamonds, dope and diamonds, diamonds
Dope and diamonds, dope and diamonds
That's all that I want
Dope and diamonds, dope and diamonds, diamonds
Dope and diamonds, dope and diamonds, diamonds

I want money, power and glory
I want money, and all your power, all your glory
Alleluia! I wanna take you for all that you got
Alleluia! I'm gonna take them for all that they got
