I'm America's Sweetheart
Trying to get away
You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay
I am so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the fighting, baby we're
Not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
Boy, I'm so afraid


But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear

So I'm going back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought I could make you change
I'm so afraid

But it's not love that keeps me here

We were just teenagers
When we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough

You should never come between
A woman and her dreaming
A man that never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came

But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear

So baby, now I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
But I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart, boy
Thought I could make you change
I'm so afraid

And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years

But I'm leaving now
I'm going

Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
But I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change
But I'm so afraid

Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I'm done being afraid
Oh-oh-oh
