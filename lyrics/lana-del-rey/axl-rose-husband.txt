You my Axl Rose husband
Blue hydrangea
White Pontiac heaven
Me your red, white and blue girl
Star spangled danger
You my heaven
Heaven King, king


I said, Daddy, I need you (yes)
Greenwich, I need you
Strangled up in ivy
I'm the garden of Eden
Lady the Birdy
Til it flame I'm shinin'
Queen, queen

You're my one king daddy
And I'm your little queen
Red, white and blue
White and blue

Record executive I
Need you to leave, find
Someone come replace you
Should I happen to meet you
Downtown, or see you
I would fall down dead
I'm breathed by you
Breathed by you

In blue denim I meet you
Barefoot I need you
Diamond horseshoe sparklin'
You're my king Jewish maven
Kids on vacation
Florida Keys are calling
Come back to me
Come back to me
