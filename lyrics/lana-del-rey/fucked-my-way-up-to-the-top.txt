Life is awesome, I confess
What I do, I do best
You got nothing, I got tested
And I'm best, yes


Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Let me down tonight, Riviera girls

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go

Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

I'm a dragon, you're a whore
Don't even know what you're good for
Mimickin' me's a fuckin' bore
To me, but babe

Lay me down tonight in my diamonds and pearls
Tell me songs at night 'bout your favorite girl

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go

Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Need you, baby, more, more, more, more
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Fuckin' need you, baby, more, more, more, more

Lay me down tonight in my linen and pearls
Lay me down tonight, I'm your favourite girl

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go

Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Need you, baby, more, more, more, more
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Need you, baby, more, more, more, more
