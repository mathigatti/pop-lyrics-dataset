All that's real to me
Is Marilyn and Jesus
Jumping off'a bridges
Sparklers and streamers


Honey, I wanna fly
I wanna fly, I wanna fly

Do you wanna' come to the motel honey?
Do you wanna' hold me down; tell me that you love me?
Do you know that I have really never loved nobody?
But you

All that's real to me
Is Halloween and Jesus
Coney Island beaches
Chandeliers and seizures

Honey, I wanna fly
I wanna fly, I wanna fly

I can't be with the man I love
I can't be if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up

All that's real to me
Is trailer parks and beaches
Alabama freezes
Platinum impeaches

Honey, I wanna fly
I wanna fly, I wanna fly

I can't be with the man I love
I can't be if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up

Do you wanna' come to the motel honey?
Do you wanna' hold me down; tell me that you love me?
Do you know that I have really never loved nobody?
But you
