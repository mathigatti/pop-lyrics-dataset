I am sleeping with your best friend
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?


I am sleeping with your best friend
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?

Come on, get drunk, you know you wanna
I am, you can, won't tell no one bout it
It's gonna be a ball
It's gonna be a ball

I am lying, using again
Come on. It's gonna be ball

Come on, get drunk, you know you wanna
I am, you can, won't tell no one bout it
It's gonna be a ball
It's gonna be a ball

Cigarettes and robitussin, will I ever get to heaven?
It's not looking good now
It's not looking good now

Come on, get drunk, you know you wanna
I am, you can, don't tell no one bout it
It's gonna be a ball
It's gonna be a ball
