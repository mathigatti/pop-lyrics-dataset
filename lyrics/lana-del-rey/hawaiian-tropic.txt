Hawaiian tropic, dark and a bottle of jack
In the Cadillac as I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
So I let the wind hit me in my face


Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish

Your red hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hangin' round with your friends by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flag

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

Copacabana, yes, in my party dress,
Iâ€™m shimmering in love on that crystal meth
A Coca Cola kid, roller coaster child
You my everything, give me that baby doll smile

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, where is mine?
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, were you lying?

And the Velvet Elvis and the rosaries
And your white Corvette under willow trees
You the one for me, my one true king

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

I remember
(Every man gets his wish)
Party dresses
(Every man gets his wish)
I remember
(Every man gets his wish)
Party dresses
(Now you're gone)

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
But sometimes it comes too late
