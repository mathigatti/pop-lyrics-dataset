I'm doing alright, most of the time
In fact, yesterday, I was even doing real well
And I think that I might claim you as mine
So that my half can rest
And everybody can tell


And I had a strange dream
And I called you at night
And I had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

I make it a point to rest through my day
To close my eyes
And visualize my troubles away
And I think of you here
And I close my eyes tight
So now the vision of you near
Makes me feel alright

And I had a strange dream
And I called you at night
And I had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind

Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
