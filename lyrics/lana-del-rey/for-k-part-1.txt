It was a drive-by Sunday night
Most of us were in bed alright
I turned down the light
Then I heard the sirens interrupt the silence


Is this what you wished?
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished?
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished?
To commit a crime, commit a crime, commit a crime?

You was a nice guy, really bright
Making money's hard to do right
Guilty was his plight
Now he's in a jail cell first some 30 years now

Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time, serving time, serving time?

K's a friend of mine
I think about him as he does time
Miss his white wine
Funny how I feel free even though it's not me

Is this what you wished?
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished?
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished?
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?

Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on a death row not to hang around, no

Is this what you wished?
Did you wanna die?
Is this what you wished?
Did you wanna die?
Is this what you wished?
Did you wanna die, wanna die, wanna die?
Did you wanna die, wanna die, wanna die?
