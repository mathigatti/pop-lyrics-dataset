Well there is something about watching a crime
It makes me wanna go out and make it all mine
It's something about seeing you fight
It makes me wanna go out tonight


I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease to fall into
Yeah it's true

There's something about seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective, and I
Wanna stay home, be left alone
Someone make my mind up so I don't have to decide

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease to fall into
Yeah I do

There's some reason why I can't sit still
Every waking moment I feel so unfulfilled
I drive and I drown, but I don't know how
Baby, when I'm sleeping, if it's less like I'm dreaming

Oh my God
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease, it's got me down
On my knees

There's a fear I have, a feeling real bad
I'm final if I find out that I'm not, I'll be sad
I try to cry to thoughts in the night
Oh, they got me thinking I'd be happier just drinkin'

It's not true
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease, it's got me down
On my knees
I got a bad disease
Will no-one help me please?
Not even you?
