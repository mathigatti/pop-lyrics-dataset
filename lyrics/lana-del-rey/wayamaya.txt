He was a big wave surfer
Living down by Waimea bay
We had a few friends
Never thought it would end
I remember an all white day
With eight story waves
He said: Your eyes are grey (Beautiful)
We were living on Coeur d’Alene
On Carol lane, Sun Manta Ray


Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury
Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury

I remember we came in May
And we changed our names to Lana and Rey
We’d be up ’til the Sun rose, ay
I’m in gold Lamé, your pink floral haze

Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury
Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury

Waikiki, cove
Waikiki, cove
Waikiki, Waikiki, Waikiki, cove
Waikiki, cove
Waikiki, cove
Waikiki, Waikiki, Waikiki, cove
