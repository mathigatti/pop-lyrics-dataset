He don’t like no small things
Even riding around on tall dreams
I don’t want to go


He’s a sweet baby, but it looks mean
In his soft leather, in his blue jeans
He got away, baby, he got away, oh, baby
He got away with his words

They’d be like diamonds and pearls
They’d be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his favorite girl

But I don’t want to go, go home
I don’t want to go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

He don’t like no spotlight
Stands real quiet in the moonlight
He got away, oh, baby, he got away, oh, baby
He got away with those words

They’d be like diamonds and pearls
They’d be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his favorite girl

I don’t want to go, go home
I don’t want to go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

Loving you isn’t right
Black leather won’t like the giving
Loving you isn’t right
It’s original sin

I don’t want to go, go home
I don’t want to go, go, home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything my whole life
I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything tonight
Baby, tonight
Tonight
