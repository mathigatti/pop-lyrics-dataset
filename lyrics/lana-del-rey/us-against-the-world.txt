What do you need to get high for
When your baby's so die for?
Quit your job let's make a ride for it


If you want it supersize
I can do that for you
If you want it double fries
I can do that for you

If you wanna good surprise
I can do that for you
If you won't believe your eyes
I can do that for you

What do you need to get high for
When your baby's so die for?
Quit your job let's make a ride for
It's us against the world

If you want a cola
I can make it colder
If you want a bad girl
Nobody's bolder
And if you want the queen
Of New York then you
Better call me, call me

If you want some dirty lies
I can do that for you
Watch me dance for other guys
I can do that for you

Tell you everythin's alright
I can do that for you
Never ever leave your side
I can do that for you

What do I need to get high for?
There ain't no reason to cry for
Quit your job, let's make a life
Boy, it's us against the world

If you want a cola
I can make it colder
If you want a bad girl
Nobody's bolder
And if you want the queen
Of New York then you
Better call me, call me

Lights, lights
Sights, sights
Buy me coca cola
In the middle
Of the night
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

Lights, lights
Sights, sights
Buy me coca cola
In the middle
Of the night
Ah-ah, ah-ah

What do you need to get high for
When your baby's so die for?
Quit your job let's make a ride for
It's us against the world

If you want a cola
I can make it colder
If you want a bad girl
Nobody's bolder
And if you want the queen
Of New York then you
Better call me, call me

If you want a cola
I can make it colder
If you want a bad girl
Nobody's bolder
And if you want the queen
Of New York then you
Better call me, call me
