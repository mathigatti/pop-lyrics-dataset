I was in the winter of my life
And the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and
Laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour
And my memories of them were the only things that sustained
Me
And my only real happy times


I was a singer, not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of events
Saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in
The night sky
That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn't really mind because I knew that
It takes getting everything you ever wanted
And then losing it to know what true freedom is

When the people I used to know found out what I had been
Doing
How I had been living, they asked me why
But there's no use in talking to people who have a home
They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other
People
For home to be wherever you lie your head

I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul

No moral compass pointing me due north
No fixed personality
Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as
Wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn't plan for it to turn out this way I'd
Be lying

Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing, who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience and an obsession for
Freedom
That terrified me to the point that I couldn't even talk
About it
And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both
Dazzled and dizzied me

I've been out on that open road
You can be my full time, daddy white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full time, baby
Hot or cold
Don't break me down
I've been traveling too long
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone in midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride
Dying young and I'm playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk till dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, ride till dark
Don't leave me now
Don't say goodbye
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone in midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving till I see stars in my eyes
I look up to hear myself saying, baby
Too much I strive, I just ride
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone in midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride

Every night I used to pray that I'd find my people
And finally I did
On the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired
Anymore
Except to make our lives into a work of art

Live fast
Die young
Be wild
And have fun

I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever
"I believe in the kindness of strangers"

And when I'm at war with myself
I ride
I just ride

Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can
Experience them?

I have
I am fucking crazy
But I am free
