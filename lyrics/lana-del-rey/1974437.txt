I like the snake on your tattoo
I like the ivy and the
Ink blue
Yayo, yes you
Yayo
You have to take me right now
From this dark trailer park
Life now
Yayo, how now
Yayo


Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifty's baby doll dress for my I do
It only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you tiger
Ahhh-ah-ah
Let me put on a show

I need you like a baby
When I hold you
Like a druggy
Like I told you

Yayo, ayo
Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifty's baby doll dress for my I do
It only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you tiger
Ahhh-ah-ah
Let me put on a show

Hello heaven
You are a tunnel lined with yellow lights
On a dark nite
(Dark night)

Yayo

Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifty's baby doll dress for my I do
It only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you tiger
Let me put on a show
