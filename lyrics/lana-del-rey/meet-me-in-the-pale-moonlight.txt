Understand this
I’m not looking for true love tonight
If you wanna be my little baby
You can meet me in the pale moonlight
I’ve been workin’ everyday 8 to 9
And servin’ coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me you know where to find me


I can be your one-time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don’t wanna care tonight
I don’t wanna fight
You don’t have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss-kiss on my lips now, baby

Understand this
I’ve been liking you since I was small
I don’t wanna get you runnin’ scared
When there’s no pressure there at all
I’ve been workin’ 8 to 9 everyday
And think about you almost all the time, all the time
And if I want to see you, I drive by

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don’t wanna care tonight
I don’t wanna fight
You don’t have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss-kiss on my lips now, baby

I’m the sweetest girl in town
So why are you so mean?
When you gonna ditch that stupid (bitch) you got
It’s me you should be seein’

Hello-o-o, you are looking so fine, so fine
Fantasy about you’s like a goldmine, goldmine
Asking everybody: Is he mine, is he mine?
Not quite yet, but I’m gonna get, get ‘im
Not quite yet, but I’m gonna get, get ‘im

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don’t wanna care tonight
I don’t wanna fight
You don’t have to give me anything
Just put your sweet-kiss kiss on my lips now, baby
