One day my hoops will be made of diamonds
And my knuckles made of real gold
I’ll spend my days getting high with all my friends
In the glamorous and green old part of Hollywood
Sun will rise, I’m a supernova
Body electric and I dance like Morrison
When the night begins, baby comes alive again


In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I’m alive again
I’m alive again

One day I’ll drive in a gold Mercedes-Benz
Singing opera on Bel Air Road
Hair to my ass will be flying in the wind
Shootin’ heroine and speedballs
See the sea, I’m a supernova
I walk on water and I dance like Joplin
When the sun descends, I dive into the waves again

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I’m alive again
I’m alive again

Oh, can you see me?
Woah, my heart beating fast
I can feel it chasing in the speedlights
I was built to last
Woah, c-can you feel that?
Ah, my heart's shakin fast
I can feel that you’re the one for me
You'll be my first and you'll be my last

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood

I’m alive again
I’m alive again
I’m alive again
I’m alive again
