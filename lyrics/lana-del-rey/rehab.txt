Well you can call me i play a good guitar
What do you want from me is just a stupid buy
And hiding from this anywhere


You think i'm pretty and i like the way you talk
You like my music and i like the way you walk
I think you're gone,again alone

I like the way you wear your sweater of your shoulder
The way your hair comes and it makes you look older
How did you get so handsome,my boy

The way your face is shaped,honey you get now
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows
I'm electrified
I'll be up all night

You got voice
Sing a song
Tell me and tell me
To come on ,come on,come on
Come on, come on
You won't even know,know

Hey hey baby
