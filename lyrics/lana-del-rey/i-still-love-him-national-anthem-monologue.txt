And I remember when I met him
It was so clear that he was the only one for me
We both knew it, right away
And as the years went on, things got more difficult
We were faced with more challenges
I begged him to stay


Try to remember what we had at the beginning
He was charismatic, magnetic, electric and everybody knew it
When he walked in

Every woman's head turned, everyone stood up to talk to him
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself
I always got the sense that he became torn
Between being a good person and missing out
On all of the opportunities that life could

Offer a man as magnificent as him
And in that way I understood him
And I loved him
I loved him, I loved him, I loved him
And I still love him
I love him
