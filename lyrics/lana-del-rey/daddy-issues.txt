You say you a bad guy
You-you-you a bad guy
That’s why everyone likes you
They say that you’re so fun
And you’re so cool
They call you baby blue

’Cause it’s your favorite color, boy
I’m not worthy of the little girl you nuzzle to

A-a-a-a-a-and they call you baby blue
’Cause it’s your favorite color
A-a-a-a-a-and they call you baby boy
Because they like you, ooh

It’s not a joke how much I like you
I know I play it off, but I lie to you
You say hi, say hi, boo
Everyone knows why I do what I do
The city is dangerous
I need your kiss to survive
The city is my dirtiest
I would advise

It’s nice, ice, baby, how much I’m liking you
Stone cold, baby, somebody come and save me
Rock, rock, baby, somebody come and save me
Rock, rock, baby, you don’t want to come and save me

Baby blue
’Cause it’s your favorite color
Baby blue

You’re always so high
You’re such a tough guy
But nothing to boy I knew
How come you got so bad, remember what we had
Remember how, baby blue

A-a-a-a-a-and they call you baby blue
’Cause it’s your favorite color
A-a-a-a-a-and they call you baby boy
Because they like you, ooh

The city is dangerous
I need your kiss to survive
The city is my dirtiest
I would advise

It’s nice, ice, baby, how much I’m liking you
Stone cold, baby, somebody come and save me
Rock, rock, baby, somebody come and save me
Rock, rock, baby, you don’t want to come and save me
Baby blue
