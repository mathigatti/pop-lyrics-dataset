We both know that it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go cause truly
There's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard if we choose
Or whatever you want to do
We make the rules


Our Honeymoon
Our Honeymoon
Our Honeymoon

Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

We both know the history
Of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose
Now that I've found you
We could cruise to the news, Pico Boulevard
In your little bullet car if we choose
Mr. Born to lose

Our Honeymoon
Our Honeymoon
Our Honeymoon
Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs
And fire that surrounds you
That no wonder every man in town
Had neither fought
Nor found you
Everything you do is elusive too
Even your honey dew

Our Honeymoon
Our Honeymoon
Our Honeymoon

Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
