Take me in your fast car Mercedes
Kissing on your neck while your driving
Doesn't care I'm always on my Blackberry
All the time, all the time
Buying into every line


I'm a flashy little lush
But he thinks I'm really fine
Notorious and wild
Takes me where I'm gonna shine

Where the bad boys roll hard
Dressing like James Dean
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be

We're children of a bad revolution
And partying is the only solution
In our minds ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We gonna get free, free, free, free
Get free

Baby, we are chancers on the scene
Glamour in the gutters only so arty
Sick graffiti artists and tabloid queens
Mix it up, mix it up
Every dude you ever seen

We're acting really tough
Like the world belongs to us
'Cause it does, yeah, it must
What we do create the buzz

Where the bad boys blow smoke
Just like they're James Dean
And the it girls blow kisses just like Marylin

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying is the only solution
In our minds ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We gonna get free, free, free, free
Get free

We run for our lives
Break out of our chains
Let's hope that we merge
Create our own games
Dj's, rockstars, posers
We are the new politicians
The celebrity editions
And it's so pornographic and it's tragic
Nothing magic makes us free
To be what we wanna be, wanna be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying is our only solution
In our minds ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be

We're children of a bad revolution
And partying is our only solution
In our minds ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We gonna get free, free, free, free
Get free, we gonna get free
