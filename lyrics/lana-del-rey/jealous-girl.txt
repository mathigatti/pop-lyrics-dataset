You say you want your own life well I do, too
You wanna' lead me all night well I'll show you
C'mon girls march it out show him what you're all about it


Whoopin' the house down, show him who's the leader
Bring ya', baby, down, down
Go cheerleader

Baby, I'm a gangsta too and it takes two to the tango
You don't wanna' dance with me, dance with me
Honey, I'm in love with you if you don't feel the same
Boy, you don't wanna' mess with me, mess with me

I'm a jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, if I can't have you baby
Jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, no one else in this world can

You say you got your own life; good for you
You got more important things to do
C'mon girls, say it loud, tell him that it's over now

Whoop!

I know whatcha' done done, sing cheerleaders

Baby, I'm a gangsta too and it takes two to the tango
You don't wanna' dance with me, dance with me

If you don't feel the same
Boy, you don't wanna' mess with me, mess with me
