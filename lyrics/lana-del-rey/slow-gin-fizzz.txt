My dad says slow gin fizz
Is swinging in the lobby
On the sunset
I can do it
You can do it
Move your hips


Go on everybody, get dangerous
That is if anybody wanna get an invite
Then pick up, and pick up
Pick up the liquor

Here’s a chance and I’m gonna get it
It’s about time
Ladies if you really wanna
Ring them suckers
Lay down your lips
It’s about the only way
To get the motherfuckers

Do what you want, too
It’s a party, it’s a party
It’s a party, it’s a party
You think you can run
It’s a party, it’s a party
It’s a party, it’s a party
You think you can run

Baby if you really wanna know my secret
Come a little closer and get it
I’ll promise I keep it
Come a little near until you’ll gonna need it
I’m gonna tell you
Sweeter than cherry pie, treat her
They deserve to be hold
They realize
It’s worth, worthwhile

It’s a party, it’s a party
It’s a party, it’s a party
You think you can run
It’s a party, it’s a party
It’s a party, it’s a party
You think you can run

Baby you can buy me diamonds
And we’ll get right down to it
It’s me and you
You’re playin’ in the hood
Like it’s a flat truck
In the spotlight we see
The car from a mile away
We’re slowin’
They say it’s a mountain dance

It’s a party, it’s a party
It’s a party, it’s a party
You think you can run
It’s a party, it’s a party
It’s a party, it’s a party
You think you can run
