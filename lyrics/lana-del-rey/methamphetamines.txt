Methamphetamines
Pink flamingo
Blue 50's queen
Blue oyster globe


For then, a dream
Why don't we go
To coney island?

When the autumn
That guy I saw
Through record spins
Blue 50's song

The horrendous
Look so shimmer
Neon palm sway

What's happening?
Where did we go?
The jersey shore
Was long ago

As we fly hopes
And oceans grow
And so I bid you farewell
