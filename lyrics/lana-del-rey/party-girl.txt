Standing on the rooftop, just out of earshot
Looking at this gansgter guy
Thinking he's a hot shot, pouring me a big shot
Trying to get me drunk and high


He wishes to be seen with me in his limosouine
And he says we'll have a real good time
Well, xxo
But I want you to know

Every single night
In the lights I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight, it's alright
Let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl and I'm just warning you

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display, bringing new york down to st. Tropez
You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
(One) I won't fall in love
(Two) I won't ever stop
(Three) I'm partying all night
(Four) I'm gonna make it pop

Kissing on your white yacht
Show me what you got-got
Play your little rock 'n' roll
I'm the island hot spot
Maybe we shot dot, dot, dot
Lose control

Do you think it's really mean that I'm only on the scene 'cause I want a little danger, boy?
Well, xxo
But I told you so

Every single night
In the lights I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight, it's alright
Let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl and I'm just warning you

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display, bringing new york down to st. Tropez
You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
(One) I won't fall in love
(Two) I won't ever stop
(Three) I'm partying all night
(Four) I'm gonna make it pop

Well, it's not about us
Just forget about us tonight
Put your cigarette down, baby
Light up the town beside me

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display, bringing new york down to st. Tropez
You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
(One) I won't fall in love
(Two) I won't ever stop
(Three) I'm partying all night
(Four) I'm gonna make it pop
