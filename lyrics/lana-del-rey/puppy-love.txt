It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love


You make me wanna be like one of those girls
From the 1950s wearing those big pearls
I cook you breakfast, coffee on your desk, yes
Someone burn your toast baby, I'm still the bestest

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
On the color TV, it was a new world
The Dick van Dyke show, we're Cher and Bono
The way I sing I Got You Babe, makes you say: Oh no
Cause you are the class president without Jackie O
And I'm singing happy birthday like Marilyn Monroe

(One) This is not a school girl crush (no)
(Two) This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing and you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby

(One) This is not a school girl thing (no)
(Two) What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
Calendar pin-up queen, in platinum curls
I'll do my summer pose, golden sand between my toes
You can pack my favorite snack, a wife and Ho-Ho's
You're everybody's hero and you're hitting it hard
While I'm singing for the soldiers like Marilyn Monroe

(One) This is not a school girl crush (no)
(Two) This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing and you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby

(One) This is not a school girl thing (no)
(Two) What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby

And if I call you on the telephone, I might overdose
Cause I'm strong but I'm lonely like Marilyn Monroe

This is not a school girl crush
This is not puppy love
It's the real thing and you told me you loved me
Whatever happened to old you, trust me baby

(One) This is not a school girl crush (no)
(Two) This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing and you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby

(One) This is not a school girl thing (no)
(Two) What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby

Is not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
Is not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
