Oooh baby, when you call me, I come to
From dreams I'll wake
And I'm waiting for you


Oooh baby, when you call me, I come to
I jump through hula hoops of fire
Just to get to you

You're making me crazy, oh little baby
Shut your complaining, aye-aye-aye-aye

You make me so angry, someone should pay me
Why don't you get the sty-y-y-yle

Make me smile

Life's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?

Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul

You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

Oooh honey, when you call me, I want to
Stay on the telephone for hours
Just to get you home

Oh sugar, when you call me after school
I see your smile
And I could run a methampheta-mile

I'll never forget it, oh you'll regret it
Nowhere to kiss it, aye-aye-aye-aye

Take it or leave it, better believe it
You'll never see why-y-y-y

Say goodbye

Life's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me
Why keep leading me on?

Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul

You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

New kind of porno
One that has yet been born, oh

Loving you's like loving a hurricane, I'm tired of
All the mess you make
All the hearts you break

Loving you's like loving a dirty bomb
You're blowing up
All the cash I'm paid, all the love we made

Life's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me
Why keep leading me on?

Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul

Life's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me
Why keep leading me on?

Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul

You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

Your problem with commitments
The bane of my existence

True love, it comes once
You messed it up, you stupid (cunt)
