Watching from a distant constellation
Eyes I can see the world unchanging hills


Is everything, is that everything, is everything
The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
’Cause I’ve layed down I take you down
And I love it every step of your way

There’s still unfalling waiting
Time with you is that love is the only truth

Is everything, is that everything, is everything
The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
’Cause I’ve layed down I take you down
And I love it every step of your way

The earth is but a dayglo reflection
Like turn that with rain you only light
I’m falling to myself but I’m not going
Waiting for the day to bring me light
