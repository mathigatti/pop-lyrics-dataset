Our kind of love
It was once in a lifetime
It couldn't last
It was doomed from the first time


And you were 50's cool
In blue suede shoes
But it was a cover for all of the trouble
You got into

I always run for the wrong guy
Things that are bad always taste nice
That's what girls like me do
Lose you

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Vicious in flames
Roman is dying
And in the light you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickenly beautiful

This kind of life
Wasn't meant for the good girl
Dry is our mind
In the end, it's a cruel world

And you are living proof
Sinatra or Louvre
That you all that I do, only went after
Once too soon

I only suffer the same time
Gangsters in Vegas on game night
That's what girls like me like
The limelight

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Marilyn's sad
Hendrix is lying dead
In the light you're sickenly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickenly beautiful

If you should go before me, then know
That I always loved you
There's no one above you, babe

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Lennon, wake up
Coleman, stop lying there
In the light you're sickenly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickenly beautiful
Say goodnight, you're so beautiful

Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah
