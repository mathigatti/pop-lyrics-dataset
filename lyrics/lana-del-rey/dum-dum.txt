I'm a wild child, bright child
Knocking at your door
You thought that you were done
But now you want me even more
Dum dum
You want me even more
Dum dum


I'm a star child, big smile, living in L.A
I'm coming over, baby, you can't go to school today
Dum dum
Go to school today
Dum dum

I belong to a bygone era
Like the Scarlett O'Hara of the downtown scene
Cause I just wanna dream, I just wanna drink
I'm a pop-blues singer, fam-bam zinger
Mansfield ringer from the Hollywood silver screen, silver screen

Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of heaven my way
You'll be forever changed

I'm a wild child, sky high, lying on your floor
I know I had a lot, but baby, what's a little more?
Dum dum
Want a little more
Dum dum

In my white mink, pink cigarettes from the store
We're making robberies from Tijuana to the shore
Dum dum
'Juana to the shore
Dum dum

I belong to a bygone era
Like the Bugsy Malone of the deep Sahara
Cause I'm on the scene, yeah, I'm on the scene
I'm a bad jazz singer, giving you the finger
No matter what, you'll linger
Cause you like me even when I'm mean, I'm the queen

Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of heaven my way
You'll be forever changed

Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of heaven my way
You'll be forever changed
