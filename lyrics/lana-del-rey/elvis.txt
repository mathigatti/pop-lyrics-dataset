Platinum and vale acrylics
Skim the paper for the critics
Babys breathin' elvis lyrics
On the cover bar


Late, an' motel lounge is singin'
Spotlight on the band is swingin'
Chateau marmont memories fading
Hope is very far

Elvis where are you when i need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air

Tipping back, his head relaxing
Thank you very much an' i'm laughing
All my chantilly lace catchin'
Baby, on the chandelier

Sweeping scents and blue hydrangea
Summer hail and summer stranger
Baby, he's in constant danger
Help is very far

You look like a florida native
[m√°s letras en http://es.mp3lyrics.org/e8ix]
Are you? i said, at the rate of
Slow molasses from the state of
Vermont with the southern drawl

Elvis where are you when i need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air

Tipping back, his head relaxing
Thank you very much an' i'm laughing
All my chantilly lace is catchin'
On the chandelier

He said he come to welcome warn me
Gesture diamond to adorn me
Come to be and see the one and only
For my final year
Well thank you

Elvis where are you when i need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air

Tipping back, his head relaxing
Thank you very much an' i'm laughing
All my chantilly lace is catchin'
On that chandelier

Its catchin' on that chandelier
Where are you when i need you most?
