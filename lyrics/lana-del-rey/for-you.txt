All these feelings, I'm tired of them
Ruling over my life again
Emotions aren't my friend
I keep them watered as best I can


I can, you can, we can do, can keep it all together
Lame and work, man is mannered man, how about the weather?

All these people I'm tired of them
Sifting into my life again
Their questions, the how and when
I try and answer the best I can

But I can, you can, we can do, can keep it all together
Lame and work, man. He is a mannered man, how about the weather?

All my worries they come and go
They tend to leave when I let you know
On bad days, I take it slow
I try to dance when I hit the low

I can, you can, we can do, can keep it all together
Remembered man is mannered man, it will all get better

All the days they go so fast
I can't believe what is in my past
The future is here at last
I don't need to have what she has

I can, you can, we can do, can keep it all together
Remembered, man. He's mannered man, it will all get better

Sing it out, sing it loud
Sing it out, sing it loud
Be proud, come out
Be proud, come out
I can, you can, we can do, can keep it all together
Remembered, he's mannered man, we can make it better
We will have it better
