Wait, wait, for me
Wait, wait, wait, for me
Come on, baby


I was in a bad way, honey
Til I met you
I was in a bad place, honey
I need you

I was going nowhere fast, you were bringing me down
I wanted to go, you were the cutest guy in town

Wait, wait, wait, for me
I don’t wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go, I wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go

I was in a bad way, honey
I was in a bad way, I was in a bad way
Bring me that bud/bring it on up punk, you know that I want you it
I’m not a bad girl but when I go to clubs, I want to flaunt it
Everybody used to say, you’re superman, and I’m not
It’s on your terms, we can waste all my time
Because I want you, I want to go with you
Don’t leave me here, I want to go with you

Can I be your babydoll, my my
Can I be your cherry pie?
Why do all the best girls like bad guys? 'cuz they’re to die for

I know what they say about you, you know that I never care
You were always my type with your dark heart and your long, black hair, yeah
Baby, I wanna take you higher, higher
So let me, so let me, let me, let me
Let me, let me, let me, let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you

I don’t wanna go
Take me with you
I don’t wanna go away, no
Take me with you

I need you, I want you, you know that
