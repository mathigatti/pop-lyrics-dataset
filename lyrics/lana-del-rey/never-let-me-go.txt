Hold me in your arms
Love me like your best friends did
Promise I won’t hurt you, kid
Hold me really tight until the stars look big
Never let me go


All the world is ours
Like they say in Scarface, kid
You can push your drugs and I can make it big
Singing CB Jeebies have a real good gig
Hey, you never know

'Cause baby we were born to live fast
And die young
Born to be bad, have fun
Honey, you and me can be one
Just believe, come on

If you love me hardcore
Then don’t walk away
It’s a game boy
I don’t wanna play, I just wanna be yours
Like I always say
Never let me go

Boy, we’re in a world war
Let’s go all the way
Put your foot to the floor
Really walk away
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

We gonna go far
I can already taste it, kid
LA's gonna look real good
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big
Never let me go

Send me to the stars
Tell me when I get there, kid
I can be your Nancy, you can be my Sid
Get into some trouble like our parents did
Hey, they’ll never know

'Cause baby we were born to be bad
Move on, built to go fast
Stay strong
Honey, you and me and no one
Just believe, come on

If you love me hardcore
Then don’t walk away
It’s a game boy
I don’t wanna play, I just wanna be yours
Like I always say
Never let me go

Boy, we’re in a world war
Let’s go all the way
Put your foot to the floor
Really walk away
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

I remember when I saw you for the first time
You were laughing, sparking like a new dime
I came over
Hello, can you be mine? 
Can you be mine?
Can you be mine?

If you love me hardcore
Then don’t walk away
It’s a game boy
I don’t wanna play, I just wanna be yours
Like I always say
Never let me go

Baby it’s a sweet life
Sing it like song
It’s a short trip
Only getting one who can count on me, my love
More than anyone
Never let me go

If you love me hardcore
Then don’t walk away
It’s a game boy
I don’t wanna play, I just wanna be yours
Like I always say
Never let me go

Boy, we’re in a world war
Let’s go all the way
Put your foot to the floor
Really walk away
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay
