Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that


Life doesn’t always work out
Like you planned it
They say make lemonade if you got lemons
But I try and I just can’t understand it
All this trying for not good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask?
Well, once you and I
We were the king and queen of this town
It doesn’t matter now
The sun set on our love
Bye, baby

Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Life doesn’t always work out
Like you planned it
They say make lemonade if you got lemons
But I try and I just can’t understand it
All this trying for not good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask?
Well, once you and I
We were the king and queen of this town
It doesn’t matter now
The sun set on our love
Bye, bye, baby

Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

It doesn’t matter what they say
Let’s go do it anyway
‘Cause you have an undying kind of love
You can be mine, I’ll be yours
C'mon, baby

Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that
