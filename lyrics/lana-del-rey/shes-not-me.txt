Let’s Go
When you got her in the back seat
Drivin’ round the back streets
Trying to block me out
Do you remember my name?


Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard
Does it light up the spark?
Do you remember my name?

Is she a ride or die bitch?
Does she know I’m tattooed onto your heart?
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can do

When you think you’re over me and
Your bad baby is dead and gone
(Remember)
I’m the ghost in your machine
I’m your real life suicide girl

You’re in love
You’re in love
You’re in love
Well she might be here
Might be hot
But baby she’s not me
She’s not me

When you take her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause you book the top suite
Lay her on the bed
Do you remember my name?

Strip her down to her bare ass
In her Kiki de Montparnasse
Like I used to have
Do you remember my name?

Is she a ride or die bitch?
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?
It wont be the same again
She don’t compare to who I am

When you think you’re over me and
Your bad baby is dead and gone
(Remember)
I’m the ghost in your machine
I’m your real life suicide girl

You’re in love
You’re in love
You’re in love
Well she might be here
Might be hot
But baby she’s not me

You try to forget and you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips

It’s me taking over you
Throwing you a curve ball
Reminding you of our true romancin’

Just like the first time, you and me dancin’
I show you all those moves she can’t do
She’s not me

When you think you’re over me and
Your bad baby is dead and gone
(Remember)
I’m the ghost in your machine
I’m your real life suicide girl

You’re in love
You’re in love
You’re in love
Well she might be here
Might be hot
But baby she’s not me

When you think you’re over me and
Your bad baby is dead and gone
(Remember)
I’m the ghost in your machine
I’m your real life suicide girl

You’re in love
You’re in love
You’re in love
Well she might be here
Might be hot
But baby she’s not me
She’s not me
