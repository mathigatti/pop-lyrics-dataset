My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
I'm sweet like cherry pie, and he likes this
I buy him drinks and he buys me cigarettes
He thinks that we're a little bit like Romeo and Juliet
Throw me 'round like a hot potato, if he wants the butter, then say so
It's wrong, but well, it's okay though
It's okay though


Baby ghetto love
Mama knows I like the bad boys
Baby ghetto love
Just like daddy was a bad boy
Ooh, ah
Take me out tonight, baby save my life
Ooh, ooh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies, it never dies
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies

My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
He thinks it's a little like hair, tits, lips, sips
It doesn't really matter that I do my lipstick all day long, all day long
My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
Dear Bonnie and Clyde, it's just like this
He thinks a little like my polka dot dress on
He like my hair long

Baby ghetto love
You know no one loves you better
Baby ghetto love
You can be oh be no better
Ooh, ooh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life
Ooh, ooh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life

Save my life, save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life, save my life
'Cause true love never dies
It's what I want
When I see what's up high
True love never dies

Baby ghetto love
Mama knows I like the bad boys
Baby ghetto love
Just like daddy was a bad boy
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies, it never dies
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies
