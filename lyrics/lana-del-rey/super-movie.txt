Drop me off at the Copacabana
You my one true love, aren't you man, ah?
I'm your little super 8 movie
You know I'm in love with ya truly, yeah
So when, baby if you
Don't get down (ah, ah, ah)
Don't get down


Spin me round kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
Its finally time to make a safe get away
I could not be happier
Drop me off Santo Casino
I got an idea, why don't we go to Mexico?
Like we said we would and you don't want to
But I think, I think it'd be good for you, Billy
You never want to do nothing anymore than die
Remember the days when you used to sway and you'd

Spin me around kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
It's finally time to make a safe get away
I love you, baby

What happened to us me and you?
I was funny once and you were funny too
One day we woke up and we found we had grew
And only I wasn't me
I had come out blue
And you, I don't know what to make of you
You're not a color, you're more of a shape
Of your former self, like they say, babe

I remember the days when you'd
Spin me around kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
And I'll continue always to keep that way

Yellow, red or blue
Don't matter to me if you don't matter to you
We just keep on trucking and see what we do and
I remember every way that you loved me, baby

Spin me around kiss me in your Chevrolet, top down
Howlin' Vegas all the way
We almost had it all didn't we, baby, ah, ha, ha
