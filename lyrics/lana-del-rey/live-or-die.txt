Baby, you’re my Bugsy Malone
And I’m your suicide blonde
You can be my film noir star
I’m your Queen of Saigon
If they don’t think we’re good together
Baby, just forget ‘em
And let bygones be bygones


Baby, I can’t do it alone
‘Cause you’re the one that I want
You can be my Tony Montana
And I can be your Pfeiffer
Fire, I can take you higher
I can get you hooked on love and desire

Hello, pretty baby, you can be my cherry pie
I know what you’re doing, I can be your alibi

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
Is either live or die, boy
Is either live or die

Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true-love suicide?
It's either live or die, boy
It's either live or die

I've been murdering and murderin'em just for fun
Murdering and murderin'em one by one
It's either live or die, boy
It's either live or die

So tonight are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
Is either live or die, boy
Is either live or die

Baby, you’re Sylvester Stallone
And I can be your Adrian
With Thunderlips I got you in the ring
To say my name again
Say my name again, say my name again

Baby, I can’t do it alone,
‘Cause you’re the one that I want
You can be my Tommy Mottola and I can be Mariah
Tiger, scream a little higher
I can get you high on love and desire

All since Bonnie and Clyde was two kids
So good at being bad, bad, bad
I’m flirting with the checkout counter, baby
You put the money in the bag

So tonight are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
Is either live or die, boy
Is either live or die

Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true-love suicide?
It's either live or die, boy
It's either live or die

I've been murdering and murderin'em just for fun
Murdering and murderin'em one by one
It's either live or die, boy
It's either live or die

So tonight are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
Is either live or die, boy
Is either live or die

Would you kill for me?
Would you die for me?
Put your hands where I can see them
Put them in the air

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
Is either live or die, boy
Is either live or die

Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true-love suicide?
It's either live or die, boy
It's either live or die

I've been murdering and murderin'em just for fun
Murdering and murderin'em one by one
It's either live or die, boy
It's either live or die
