All my friends tell me I should move on
I’m lying in the ocean
Singing your song
Ah, that’s how you sang it
Loving you forever can’t be wrong
Even though you’re not here
Won’t move on
Ah, that’s how we play it


And there’s no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won’t leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
(Dead, like you)

Everytime I close my eyes
It’s like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I’m scared that you
Won’t be waiting on the other side

Everytime I close my eyes
It’s like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I’m scared that you
Won’t be waiting on the other side

All my friends ask me
Why I stay strong
Tell ‘em when you find true
Love it lives on
Ah, that’s why I stay here

And there’s no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won’t leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
(Dead, like you)

Everytime I close my eyes
It’s like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I’m scared that you
Won’t be waiting on the other side

Everytime I close my eyes
It’s like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But that there’s no you
Except in my dreams tonight

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ha, ha, ha, ha
I don’t wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ha, ha, ha, ha
I don’t wanna wake up from this tonight

There’s no relief
I see you in my sleep
And everybody’s rushing me
But I can feel you touching me
There’s no release
I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I’m fine

Everytime I close my eyes
It’s like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I’m scared that you
Won’t be waiting on the other side
(Dead, like you)

Everytime I close my eyes
It’s like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But that there’s no you
Except in my dreams tonight

Oh oh oh oh
Ha ha ha ha
I don’t wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh
Ha ha ha ha
I don’t wanna wake up from this tonight
