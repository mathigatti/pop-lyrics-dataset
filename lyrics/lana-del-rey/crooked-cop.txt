My baby daddy, a crooked cop
I know it's stupid but I cannot stop
I like the way that you move the stick
And every way when you make it sick


He got a bad reputation on the streets
But in the house you're like a bag full of sweets, what?
He says I'm his snowflake ice queen, oh
I just can't cause he treat me so mean, oh

Ah, I like it
Ah, I like it
Ah, I like it rough
