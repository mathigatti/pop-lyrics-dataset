Remember how we used to party up all night
Sneaking out and looking for a taste of real life
Drinking in the small town firelight
(Pabst blue ribbon on ice)


Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walkin' down the streets as they whistle, hi, hi!
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

There she was my new best friend
High heels in her hands, swayin' in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara running down her little bambi eyes
Lana, how I hate those guys

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something that we'd die for
It's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it

This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together, 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

And that's where the beginning of the end began
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job
(With the boss)

Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive
Cheerin' our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet night

Yo, we used to go break in to the hotel
Glimmering and weâ€™d swim
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screaming "get us while we're hot"
Get us while we're hot
(Come on take a shot)

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for
It's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it

This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together, 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

The prettiest in crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was wavin' on the train platform
Crying, 'cause I know I'm never comin' back

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something that we'd die for
It's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it

This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together, 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen
