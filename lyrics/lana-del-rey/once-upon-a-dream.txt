I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, the look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem


But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

But if I know you, I know what you do
You love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem

But if I know you, I know what you do
You love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream
