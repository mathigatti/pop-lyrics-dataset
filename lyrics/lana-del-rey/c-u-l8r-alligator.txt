Don’t say I’ll see you later alligator, so cute
When you know it’s not true
I know you’re seeing her
But you can still see me, too
If you wanted to, baby


I know they say I’m cheap
And you’re two-timing me
That’s what you get
We’re in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know you’ll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby

You’re all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic’s flawed and you’ve been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You’re all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you’re scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news

I know that’s not the way
Most people meet but, hey
We’re living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
You’re not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
You’re not the only one
I’ve heard say: maybe

You’re all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic’s flawed and you’ve been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You’re all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you’re scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?
