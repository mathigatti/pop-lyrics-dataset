Finally, I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world to the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly, that will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea and the darkness from the arts


This is my commitment, my modern manifesto
I'm doing it for all of us who never got the chance
For, and for (shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise who never got to fly at night
'Cause they were caught up in the dens

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep riding the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do, I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)

Finally, gone is the burden
Of the Crawley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was, I was not discerning
And you, as we found out, were not in your right mind

There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions, solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (you, you)
And put you in a trance (ah, ah, ah, yeah)

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep riding the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or to live my own life
And now I do, I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
