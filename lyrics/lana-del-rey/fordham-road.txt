30 Blocks to fordham road
That’s a bad neighborhood
Gray house on the corner
I know I shouldn’t do what it is I could


The stone mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
She said I better get walking
I better walk away

I don’t know why it is that I wanna stay
I don’t know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I’m not gonna do what I hear me say
I’m just gonna walk
I’m gonna walk away

I catch a dollar in the wind and I buy a cup of coffee
There’s a place on valentine that still charge ninety cent

I keep on walking in the daytime and in my eyes it’s always night time
And I like it when it’s me at night
‘Cause that’s when all the stars come out

I don’t know why it is that I wanna stay
I don’t know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I’m not gonna do what I hear me say
I’m just gonna walk
I’m gonna walk away

It’s the greatest
It’s the greatest day

It’s the greatest
It’s the greatest day

I’m not gonna do what I hear me say
I’m just gonna walk
I’m gonna walk away
