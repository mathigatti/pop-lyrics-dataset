Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room
You know, you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean, for sure
You so fresh to death
And sick as ca-cancer


You were sort'a punk rock
I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know, that love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day
We met in December, oh, baby

I will love you until the end of times
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
I will love you until the end of times

Big dreams, gangster
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like: No, please, stay here
We don't need no money
We can make it all work

But he headed out on Sunday
Said he'd come home on Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing
But he was chasing papers
Caught up in the game
That was the last I heard

I will love you until the end of times
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
I will love you until the end of times

He went out every night
And, baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did
I'd be by your side
'Cause I'm a ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well shit, at least you tried

But when you walked out that door
A piece of me died
I told you I wanted more
But that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancing all night
Then they took you away
Stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

I will love you until the end of times
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh, baby)
Say you'll remember, (oh, baby)
I will love you 'till the end of times
