Come back, baby
Come back to me
I'll be in my sundress watching TV
I've been missing you
Have you been missing me?
Thinking 'bout your loving, babe, loving sweet sweet


Come back, sug-ey
Come back to me
Fix me up a mixed drink, Bacardi
I'll put on your favourite dress and we'll party
Take a drive, kiss-kiss by the sea

You don't have to say
I'm the girl that got away
I been drinking Jack and Coke a lot
Sucking on my lollipops
Listening to my hard rock mu-mu-mu-music
Thinking 'bout you quite a lot
Smoking all my cigarettes
Missing what we used to got
You-you-you you kid

Won't you come home to me now, babe?
I've been holding it down, but I'm losing my ground
Won't you come home to me now babe?
I'm strong, babydoll, but I want you around

Come back, honey, don't be so mean
Come back to your trailer, come see your queen
You been missing out peach, peaches and cream
Dreaming 'bout your dolly, sweet dolly dream dream

You bad baby, dumb as can be
Who could you find better, better than me?
I've been missing you
You been missing me
Thinking 'bout your sugar sweet ca-candy

You don't have to say
I'm the girl that got away

I been drinking Jack and Coke a lot
Sucking on my lollipops
Listening to my hard rock mu-mu-mu-music
Thinking 'bout you quite a lot
Smoking all my cigarettes
Missing what we used to got
You-you-you you kid

Won't you come home to me now, babe?
I've been holding it down, but I'm losing my ground
Won't you come home to me now, babe?
I'm strong, babydoll, but I want you around

Come on over, pretty baby
What you make your mommy crazy
Come on over, pretty baby
What you make your mommy crazy

I want my cake and I wanna eat it too
I wanna be friends, be in love with you
Go out on weekends, party it up, boo
Back the way it was, a summer of love, love

You don't have to say
I'm the girl that got away

I been drinking Jack and Coke a lot
Sucking on my lollipops
Listening to my hard rock music
Thinking 'bout you quite a lot
Smoking all my cigarettes
Missing what we used to got
You-y-you kid

Won't you come home to me now, babe?
I've been holding it down, but I'm losing my ground
Won't you come home to me now, babe?
I'm strong, babydoll, but I want you around
