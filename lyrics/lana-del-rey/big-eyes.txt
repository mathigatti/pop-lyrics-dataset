With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies


I saw you creeping around the garden
What are you hiding?
I beg your pardon
Don't tell me, nothing

I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion
To my surprise
My loves demise was his own greed and lullabies

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned

You paced around like you'd been waiting
Waiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watching
As I looked on, the flames grew high
You watched me frown
I said, goodbye

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

Is it me? Was I wrong to have trusted you?
Did I see what I wanted? What wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?
It's amazing what women in love will do

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies
