I say hey, Jimmy Gnecco
I like the way your name echo
You are so fine
I say hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Do you wanna help me let go
Of my dark mind?


If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
You're my sunshine
I say, Jay, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine

I say hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You are on another level
You are so fine
I say, hey Jimmy, let's go
I've been in love since I met you
You are all mine

If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
Take a high ride
I say, Jay, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me a hot dog
Kiss me in the dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me cotton candy
Kiss me in the dark

I say hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Hey, I like your heavy metal
Do you like my mine?
I say hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You are smashing from the from the get go
This is your time

If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
Take a high ride
I say, Jay, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me cotton candy
Kiss me in the dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Take me to the park
Buy me something pretty
Kiss me in the dark

Jimmy Gnecco, Jimmy Gnecco, Jimmy Gnecco
You are so fine
