I won't cry myself to sleep
Like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now you fall asleep with another
Damn you


'Member how we used to escape for the summer?
Fireworks and sparkles
Would light up the black skies
We'd hold on tight for our lives to each other

Hello, hello, where did you go?
We were two kids living life on the run
Like the american dream, baby!
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast
Too young

But I won't cry myself to sleep
Like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you

Flowers in my hair
And your breath smelled like whiskey
Promised anywhere that I'd go
Take you with me
Dancing on your feet like a child to the radio

Hello, hello, where did you go?
We were two kids living life on the run
Like the american dream, baby!
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast
Too young

But I won't cry myself to sleep
Like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now you fall asleep with another
Damn you, damn you
Damn you, damn you

Every once in a lifetime
Dreams can come true
Now and then when the stars shine
You meet somebody like you

But I won't cry myself to sleep
Like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
I pray you're life is sweet
You fucker
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you
