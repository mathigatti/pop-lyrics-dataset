Come one, come one
I hope you remember me like this
Smoking cigarettes in my sundress
Glamourous and ganster oh yes
My battle lines look like paradise next to you
I hope I remember you just like that
Lookin fresh to death in your ball cap
You say you'll tap it like a high hat
Your stupid lines they're like dynamite
The future looking bright its black tonight
Tell me la-la-love like I'm on a drug
Baby if its wrong I don't want to be right
I don't know a thing but this I'm sure


There's no where on this earth that I'd rather be
Then in your bed bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling its so deadily
Honey you're heavenly
Television heaven with you
Swinging in new york
To a nirvana song
With nothing but that t-t-televison on
Kissing in the dark in my diamonds
Put the empty tv on television heaven with you

I wonder if you think of me like this
On your fire escape like a hot mess
You say you're beautiful but hopeless
Come on inside, oh you crazy child look at you
I promise I'll think of as the king
Put on corleone like you soaring
It goes for most cause its our thing
I'm aging wine like a thousand times

Lucy's in the sky where it flies tonight
Heaven knows I try hard to find a cure
Baby if its wrong I don't want to right
And if you ask again I'll say I'm sure

There's no where on this earth that I'd rather be
Then in your bed bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling its so deadily
Honey your so heavenly
Television heaven with you
Swinging in the new york
To a nirvana song
With nothing but that t-t-televison on
Kissing in the dark in my diamonds
Put the empty tv on television heaven with you

Stay up tonight
Turn off the light
It feels so right
Baby your a vision in blue
Stay up tonight
Turn off the light
It feels so right
Watching television with you
Oooooohohhho

There's no where on this earth that I'd rather be
Then in your bed bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling its so deadily
Honey your so heavenly
Television heaven with you
Swinging in new york
To a nirvana song
With nothing but that t-t-televison on
Kissing in the dark in my diamonds
Put the empty tv on television heaven with you
