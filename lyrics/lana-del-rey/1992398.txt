You, you light my red fire, babe
Hot white, and blue
And I, I think that you
I think you're so cool babe
Loving everything you do


You say we're gonna run away
Put on your sundress, summer day
Flying around on the highway

Spin me round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
Top down, gonna make a get away, top down
Spin me round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down, we're going all the way, touchdown

You, know what I want
Take me to the k-mart
Pick me up pink lipgloss
How, you get so hot?
You're making me crazy
Hoping you'll never stop

You say that we were meant to be
We'll be together, finally
Flying around and I'm finally free

Spin me round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
Top down, finally gonna get away, top down
Spin me round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down now we're going all the way touchdown

We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way

Why, did I think too much?
You tell me not to worry
Because you're the boss
And you, you got a real good plan
My trouble's all over now
Because you're my man

You don't know what you've done to me
You're heavier than heavenly
Life on the run has set me free, me free now

We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way
