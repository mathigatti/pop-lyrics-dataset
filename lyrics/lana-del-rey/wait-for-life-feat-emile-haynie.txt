Why you make me work so hard
To put on that evening show
When you know that all I want
Is to make your mind grow


You're like a baby
Who don't got nowhere to go
I feel your eye in me
You try to keep it on the low

But I can't let you in
And I can't keep you out
Wait for life to win
But it never comes around
And I can't let you go
And I can't let it show
A way for we to break
But it never comes around

And I'm lonely
I'm lonely
I'm lonely

Why you make me take that chair
To put on that evening show
When you know I don't need it

You're like a baby
Don't know better, you don't know
You drag me down
You try to keep it on the low

But I can't let you in
And I can't keep you out
Wait for life to win
But it never comes around
And I can't let you go
And I can't let it show
A way for we to break
But it never comes around

Feeling like I'm falling apart
Feeling like I'm falling apart
Feeling like I'm falling apart

Would you tell me?
Would you tell me?
Would you tell me?

But I can't let you in
And I can't keep you out
Wait for life to win
But it never comes around
And I can't let you go
And I can't let it show
A way for we to break
But it never comes around

And I'm lonely
I'm lonely
I'm lonely
