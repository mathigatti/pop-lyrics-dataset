All dressed up, with nowhere to go
That’s the story of the girl you know
Me


I’m all smiles but inside I frown
Cause I’ve seen you walkin around with Betty Rue
Didn’t I tell you what I heard about her?

It don’t matter to you
It don’t matter to you
It don’t matter to you what them other girls do
You’ll date anyone, you’ll date anyone

How they’re more fun than me, baby
I’m smiling then your jersey queen
And you’re the best thing I ever seen
So I watch you pull up your white coffee champagne
Let me get a better look at your face

I know it ain’t noon
But I know what you like
So come on inside and I’ll fix you ice-cream
A little banana split for you, Jim

You’re so fine, you’re like Sikaru
Guess that’s why you keep slipping through my fingers

Yellow state’s number one
Everybody knows it
You smile all the time
Cause how can you not show it
When even you know
That you’re so
To die for, to die for
What does remain to you half full
When I have you
When I have you

It don’t matter to you
It don’t matter to you
It don’t matter to you what those other girls done

I’m gonna prove to you
I’m gonna prove to you
You’ll never find nobody more fun
More fun
