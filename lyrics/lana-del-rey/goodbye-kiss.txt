Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss
I broke my wrist


It all kicked off
I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind
'Cause love's hard to find

Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs
No more photographs

Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words
Can save this
You're broken
And I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man
I ought to
Rock and roll
Sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again

Running wild
Giving it everyone
Now that's all done

Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence for too long
Open you're eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs
No more photographs

Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words
Can save this
You're broken
And I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man
I ought to
Rock and roll
Sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again

You go your way
And I'll go my way
No words can save us
This lifestyle made us
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man
I ought to
Rock and roll
Sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again
