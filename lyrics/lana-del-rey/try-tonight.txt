Can’t put my finger on it
But I know I want it
I’m willing to try another way
That is if I get by another day
Back and forth, I don’t know
Get anywhere, and I’ve been searching
Everywhere


He’ll try tonight
Just try tonight

Happy as the Moon shine
Shifting in the night time
Clichés find a home inside of him
When he enters all of the lights go dim
He’s so sure he’s got a tragic lifestyle
And I’m so sure I can, make that man smile

He’ll try tonight
Just try tonight

A dark room in the nighttime
Is how he spends all his time
If he could go on without your help
Then he would do it all by himself
But I don’t think he got, strength to muster
And he don’t got a lot, lack of luster

He’ll try tonight
Tonight get higher
He’ll try tonight, tonight I’ll get high
But he will, he will, he will, yes he will
