Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said: I love you
You're fun, and you're wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad, and you blame the news
But I can't change that, and I can't change your mood
Ah-ah


'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue

Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon, know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see you through
Why wait for the best when I could have you?
You

'Cause you’re just a man
It’s just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue
You make me blue

Blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
