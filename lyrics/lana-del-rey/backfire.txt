Salvatore, you can def
Be my baby blue
Be my mafiosi rock 'n' roll high
Back to Malibu, and our
Trailer park for two
We're like Sid and Nancy loving the fight


We got a jumper, got a jumper
Got a jumper, got a jumper
My man's crazy and his mind isn't right
But I like him, fact I love him
I can't get e-enough of him
He knows only I can save him tonight

I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you
Like the others but I don't know how
Don't know how

It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire
Gonna backfire, baby

Told you a million times before
Yes, I’m up for it a million more

I'm tired of fighting you
Seems like everything I do
Even when I win I lose wit’ you, man
And it's not something you chose
You say trouble follows you
It's been like that since the day you began

We got a jumper, got a jumper
Got a jumper, got a jumper
I know very well you're bringing me down
I will follow, I will follow
For a little piece of heaven
I am ready, I am willing to drown

I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you
Like the others but I don't know how
Don't know how

It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire
Gonna backfire, baby

Told you a million times before
Yes, I’m up for it a million more

We’re always taking trips downtown
Officer Brown's always coming around
Tapping on our windows: Kids, come out
Ain’t no way to live, let me show you how

But we know we're not gonna change
Keep hustlin', every night and day

I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you
Like the others but I don't know how
Don't know how

It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire
Gonna backfire, baby

Done it a million times before
And I’ll run for it a million more
