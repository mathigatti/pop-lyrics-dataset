What you do to me is indescribable
Got me sparkling just like an emerald
Set my soul on fire, make me wild
Like the deep blue sea


No other boy ever made me feel beautiful
When I'm in your arms, feels like I have it all
Is it your tattoos or golden grill
That makes me feel this way

Got me spinning like a ballerina
Feelin' gangsta everytime I see ya'
You're the king and, baby
I'm the queen of disaster, disaster

You got me spinning like a ballerina
You the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and, baby
I'm the queen of disaster, disaster

Got mascara thick, I get emotional
You know I was more than just a party girl
Isn't hard to see what's goin' on
I'm so far gone, (mm, so far gone)

When I saw your face it was incredible
Painted on my soul, it was indelible
('Cause you're the one) who celebrate
Our twisted fate, we're the broken ones

Got me spinning like a ballerina
Feelin' gangsta everytime I see ya'
You're the king and, baby
I'm the queen of disaster, disaster

You got me spinning like a ballerina
You the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and, baby
I'm the queen of disaster, disaster

Ladies and gentlemen
For the very first time

You got me spinning like a ballerina
Feelin' gangsta everytime I see ya'
You're the king and, baby
I'm the queen of disaster, disaster

You got me spinning like a ballerina
You the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and I'm the
Beauty queen of disaster, disaster
