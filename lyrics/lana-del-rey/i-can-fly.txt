I can fly
You had me caged up
Like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy
On fire, waiting to fly
I can fly


I had bright wishes in the summer
I was bathing in sunlight
Painting in the garden like a ghost in mid-July
Running fast from something with my eyes wide
Like saucers spinning in the Sun

I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

I can fly
You had me caged up
Like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy
On fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

Your lies were hard kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake, dreaming of the water
Where I'd rise like a phoenix
Or at night from the fire
I've got things to tell you, like
I know that you're a liar

I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

I can fly
You had me caged up
Like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy
On fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

Your words cut like a knife in butter
I was fighting for my art
Fighting with my lover, you had me so tied up
Thinking there's no other
Yeah, right
Yeah, right

I can fly
You had me caged up
Like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy
On fire, waiting to fly
I can fly
