Well, dark clouds they'll subside for awhile
And sit down I can make my friends smile
I have lost a lot but I'm sane you know
And I'm calling you up just to say hello so
Hi, my lovely, hi, my lovely
I am someone else
I did think I would live life alone
Do do do mmm


I was sure I was made out of stone
I have lost a lot but you helped me find
What was really real and some peace of mind
And I'm awfully thankful and I am so grateful
I need no one else
Will you think of me when I am gone?
Mmm, will you comfort me when I am wrong?

I have a lost a lot but I'm feeling fine cause I
Finally found out nothing's mine and I'm
Only human, I'm so human
I am nothing else
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Do do do do do
