Little bits and pieces falling to the corners
Box of broken laces lined up in an order
I'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way
I'll tell you the future, you tell me your story


I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Smiles from the stranger seem to change a day when
You were just about to go and throw your towel in
Lately I've been thinking about making changes
It's been on my mind for some time and I'm anxious

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Scowling like the sunshine set on sarasota
Happy like a twister over Oklahoma
Clear as penny mason lying in a coma
This is our feeling, all my hurt is over

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me
Tell me that it's over now that you have found me
Walk me to the river, see the willow bowing
Carry me into the water, now we're drowning

We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going to go home again
