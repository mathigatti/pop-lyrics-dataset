Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school


Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

Baby, let's do drugs
Make love with our teachers
Come on, baby, tell me
What is tattooed as featured

I'm a vain, a pro and a nation
Had to do drugs to stop the
F-food cravings

If you wanna get high with me
I'm in the back doing crack
Drinkin' p-p-Pepsi

Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school

Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

Cheap trailer trash and
Everyone knows it
But she got a great ass
And she knows how to show it

With American flags on
Each little finger
You're crashing on Wall Street
While I'm blowing up as a singer

If you wanna get that scarlet champ'
Loves not a problem, let's solve it
Educated in the language of doin' it
Get down like your tutor taught you to
And do it

Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school

Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

If you wanna get that sugar cane
If you wanna be that pin-up queen
You can, you can

If you wanna do that south beach swing
Hope you wanna groove vacationing
You can, you can, you can

(Three, four)

When they said prolific
They weren't kidding
You thought that I was just
A calender kitten

But now you heard me
Purring tiger you're smitten
So let's begin to major
In the art of sinnin'

Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school

Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

Get down, get down, ooh-ooh
