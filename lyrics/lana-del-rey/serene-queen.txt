Why you so uptight, what’s the problem?
Everybody knows you're doing it anyway
Why you act so tired when you got so much?
You could be sending it my way
Those guys were cool, but you'll never give yourself away
And I’m not a fool, no I love you I said


He had all his guns and all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around me, so amazing
He had all his guns all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around me, so amazing
Amazing, amazing, amazing

He'd call me the serene queen
(Come on, baby, if you want it you can get it right)
The serene queen
(Come on, baby, if you want it you can get it right)
The serene queen
(Come on, baby, if you want it you can get it right now)
I don’t stop fights but I’ll stop 'em all by my any means
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Why you so upset, what’s the problem?
Everybody knows you’re doing it anyway
Why you act so tough when you got so much?
Going for you already
Those guys were cool, but you never gave yourself away
Baby, it's true, you I’d never betray

He had all his guns and all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around me so amazing
He had all his guns, all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around me so amazing
Amazing, amazing, amazing

He'd call me the serene queen
(Come on, baby, if you want it you can get it right)
The serene queen
(Come on, baby, if you want it you can get it right)
The serene queen
(Come on, baby, if you want it you can get it right now)
I don’t stop fights but I’ll stop 'em all by my any means
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

You think too much, you dream too much
You think too much, you dream too much
You think too much, you dream too much
But what a beautiful mind is such

He had all his guns and all his guns were blazing
He never gave himself away
He had all his guns and all his guns were blazing
I’d never betray

He'd call me the serene queen
(Come on, baby, if you want it you can get it right)
The serene queen
