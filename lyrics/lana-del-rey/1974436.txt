Bound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know I am going to leave you?
Do you know I am going
To leave you?


I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
All our love's flying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can

Tell me about Ray and his girl
Do I know, Ray is going to meet you?
Love you? I do
Stay here? I won't
As stars fade from your eyes

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
All our love flying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can

1, 2
Make it fun
Don't trust
Anyone

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can
