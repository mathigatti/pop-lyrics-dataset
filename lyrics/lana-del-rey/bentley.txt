You drive up in a summer sky, blue bentley
Death reflect detecting in his eyes
Thought about all the women who loved me
I said, oh no!
He said, get inside
I said, oh no!
He said, get inside


I got into his summer sky, blue bentley
Sun reflect detecting in my eyes
Thought about all the fun I had lately
I said, uh huh I said I want to drive
I said, uh huh I want, I want to drive
We drive, we drive

You say you wanna go swimming in my ring
It's green and shimmering
Like my lipstick, the colour of dawn
Like my lipstick, the colour of dawn
We got out of his summer sky, blue bentley

Death reflect detecting in the sky
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me
I said, uh huh, I want, I want to die
Uh huh, I want, I want to die
