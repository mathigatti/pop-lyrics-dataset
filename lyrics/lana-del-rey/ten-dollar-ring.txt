I came back to town for the wedding
The last of the stephenson brides
The talk died down to a whisper when they let me inside
I saw you there at the table
You smiled and you waved your right hand
Then they called for a toast and they all raised their glasses again


And there's a ten dollar ring on your finger
There's a five dollar ring in my hand
There's a ten dollar ring on your finger
And that five dollar ring went back in my pocket again

I almost laughed when I saw you
In that suit that you borrowed from john
The pants are too short and the sleeves are a little too long
I only smiled but I tell you
That I really wanted to cry
Cause I'm here at this table with somebody else by my side

There's a ten dollar ring on my finger
Cause you never asked for my hand
There's a ten dollar ring on my finger
Cause I never thought that I'd ever see you again

No need to impress
Just a second hand dress
And something that's borrowed or blue
It'd be all right
If you didn't wear white
As long as I'm there next to you I left right after the wedding
And I didn't say anything

Then I went to the river and I threw in that five dollar ring
I looked for you the whole damn evening
So much that I wanted to say
But whenever I need you, baby, you just run away

There's a ten dollar ring on my finger
And you didn't even shake my hand
There's a five dollar ring in the river
And believe me, my darling, you'll never see me again
