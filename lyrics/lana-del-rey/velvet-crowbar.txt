I was addicted to you
But I didn't know it
You were afflicted by booze
You didn't show it, huh


Life is a velvet crowbar
Hittin' you over the head
You're bleeding but you want more
This is so like you, I said
Put yourself on back to bed

You're like crack to me
I don't want to leave
I'm watchin' you sleep
Pray you'll start breathin'
My baby's on his
Eighth life darlin'
Stayin' with him
Till the mornin'

You're like crack to me
So fun I can't see
With your golden grill
Your purple dream
My baby's on his
Eighth life darlin'
Gonna watch him
Till the mornin'

I was addicted to you
Didn't wanna blow it
You were a dick with your crew
Always on the road

You wanna touch life so hard
Why can't you give it a rest?
You're not that bright for a star
Burned yourself out, nothing left

You're like crack to me
I don't want to leave
I'm watchin' you sleep
Pray you'll start breathin'
My baby's on his
Eighth life darlin'
Stayin' with him
Till the mornin'

You're like crack to me
So fun I can't see
With your golden grill
Your purple dream
My baby's on his
Eighth life darlin'
Gonna watch him
Till the mornin'

Styrofome on the microphone
Can't give it up
Can't go it alone
Flame coloured paradise
For you darlin'
But death doesn't come
With a warning

Life is a velvet crowbar
Hittin' you over the head
You're bleeding syrup amour
Bleeding to death

You're like crack to me
I don't want to leave
I'm watchin' you sleep
Pray you'll start breathin'
My baby's on his
Eighth life darlin'
Stayin' with him
Till the mornin'

You're like crack to me
So fun I can't see
With your golden grill
Your purple dream
My baby's on his
Eighth life darlin'
Gonna watch him
Till the mornin'

(My baby's on his)
(Last life, darlin')
(Gonna stay around)
(Till morning)

(My baby's on his)
(Last life, darlin')
(I've got to stick around)
(Till morning)
