Carry me off stage
I can't do this anymore
Been gone for 3 years
Is that enough for you, boy?


Carry me to my bed
Paint my toe nails blue
Tell me all about the things
That you and I will never do

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl, oh
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl, oh

Carry me off stage
I've had too much to drink
Been on the road too long
And I've had too much time to think

Carry me to my bed
Lay me in a pillow town
Kiss me on my head
Remind me of the way we will not know

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl, oh
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl, oh

Late at night, baby, you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, laying in Versailles
You and I get to know one another

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, baby, you and I
Can get to know one another

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl, oh
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl, oh
