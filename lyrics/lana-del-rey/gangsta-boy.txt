My gangsta boy
I don’t care if you’re going to prison
I wouldn’t say I l-love you if I didn’t
I can't cheat cause I know what I’m missin’
Boop, boop, woopty doo


I won’t play cause I’m already winnin’
Kissing your lips
Hot-hot like I’m sinnin’
High school, loved you from the beginnin’
Boop, boop, woopty doo

I want you, you, you
By my swimming pool
You, you, you
That would be so cool

You’re my gangsta boy
You’re my gangsta boy
Cause you’re my favourite toy
You’re my favourite toy
Get you out
Get you wet
No, I’ll ever never stop

You’re my gangsta boy
You’re my gangsta boy
Oooh

I don’t care what my girls and my mama say about you, bad boy
I like the drama
We can ditch ‘em all while you’re out, if you wanna
Boop, boop, woopty doo

Like your leather and your long hair, honey, honey
You can bring your love and baby, I got the money
Love you baby boy
Like I never loved nobody
Boop, boop, woopty doo

I want you, you, you
By my swimming pool
You, you, you
That would be so cool

You’re my gangsta boy
You’re my gangsta boy
Cause you’re my favourite toy
You’re my favourite toy
Get you out
Get you wet
No, I’ll ever never stop

You’re my gangsta boy

Summer’s almost over, baby
Everybody thinks I’m crazy
I could have it all
But it means nothing without you

Boy, I’ve been so lonely lately
I’ll never get tired of waiting
I could have the world
But it means nothing without you
You’re my gangsta boy
You’re my gangsta boy

You’re my gangsta boy
You’re my gangsta boy
Cause you’re my favourite toy
You’re my favourite toy
Get you out
Get you wet
No, I’ll ever never stop

You’re my gangsta boy
You’re my gangsta boy
