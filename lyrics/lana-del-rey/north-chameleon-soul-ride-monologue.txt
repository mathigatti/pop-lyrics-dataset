I was in the winter of my life
And the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and
Laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour
And my memories of them were the only things that sustained
Me
And my only real happy times


I was a singer, not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of events
Saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in
The night sky
That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn't really mind because I knew that
It takes getting everything you ever wanted
And then losing it to know what true freedom is

When the people I used to know found out what I had been
Doing
How I had been living, they asked me why
But there's no use in talking to people who have a home
They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other
People
For home to be wherever you lie your head

I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul

No moral compass pointing me due north
No fixed personality
Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as
Wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn't plan for it to turn out this way I'd
Be lying

Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing, who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience and an obsession for
Freedom
That terrified me to the point that I couldn't even talk
About it
And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both
Dazzled and dizzied me
