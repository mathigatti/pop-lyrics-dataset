Elvis is my daddy, Marilyn's my mother
Jesus is my bestest friend
We don't need nobody 'cause we got each other
Or, at least, I pretend


We get down every Friday night
Dancin' and grindin' in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry, we're feelin' alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind (I said don't worry about it)

I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric

In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an Angel
Looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer
Life imitates art

You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said 'baby that's alright with me

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
Fuck, yeah, give it to me, this is heaven, what I truly want
It's innocence lost

Don't be afraid of me, don't be ashamed
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection
Idol of roses, iconic soul
I know your name

My clothes still smell like you
And all the photographs say, that we're still young
I pretend I'm not hurt
I go about the world like I'm havin' fun
We get crazy every Friday night
I drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry, feelin' all right
Mary's swayin' softly to her heart's delight

I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
I'm on fire, sing that body electric

Lead me to war with your brilliant direction

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light
I can sleep late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Grenadine sunshine, can you fade inside of mine?
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby
