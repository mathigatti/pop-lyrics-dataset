I hope you remember me like this
Dancing in the stars in my sundress
I was just a dreamer, no stress
And battles lines became paradise next to you


You been working hard 9 to 5 and
I'm doing my part in trying
Just make you smile and get happy
Like daddy used to say to me
When you're young and free
Stop and think of me
Staying together is heaven when you look so good
And you taste so sweet

Never let me go
Boy hang on me
Staying together forever
It's heaven when you taste so sweet
When you're young and free
