Gargoyles standing
At the front of your gate
Trying to tell me to wait
But I can’t wait to see you
So I run like a mad to heaven’s door
I don’t wanna be bad
I won’t cheat you no more


Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I’ve been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light
I can see late at night
Darling, I’m waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Spotlight
Bad Baby
You’ve got a flair
For the violentest kind of love
Anywhere out there
Mon amour
Sweet child of mine
You’re divine
Didn’t anyone ever tell you
It’s ok to shine?

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I’ve been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light
I can see late at night
Darling, I’m waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Don’t be afraid of me
Don’t be ashamed
Walking away from my soft resurrection
Idol of roses
Iconic soul
I know your name
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I’ve been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light
I can see late at night
Darling, I’m waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I’ve been waiting to meet you
Grenadine, sunshine
Can you fade inside of mine?
Darling I’m waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby
