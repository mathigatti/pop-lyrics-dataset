Blue hydrangea
Cold cash, divine
Cashmere, cologne
And white sunshine
Red racing cars
Sunset and vine
The kids were young and pretty


Where have you been?
Where did you go?
Those summer nights
Seem long ago
So is the girl you used to call
The queen of New York City

But if you send for me
You know, I'll come
And if you call for me
You know, I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

The power of youth is on my mind
Sunset, small town
I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty?

My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

But if you send for me
You know, I'll come
And if you call for me
You know, I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

And if you call I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind
I'll come, come, come

Blue hydrangea
Cold cash, divine
Cashmere, cologne
And hot sunshine
Red racing cars
Sunset and vine
And we were young and pretty
