Do I make you feel like Christmas time?
Put me in a party dress one time
Love me 'till I see the sunshine
Say you'll never leave me
Say you'll never leave me


Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does?
Who has a choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does? (Nobody)
Who has the choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody, nobody

Say I make you feel like Christmas time
Say I make you feel like Christmas time
Tell me you don't feel like Christmas time
Put me in a party dress my-my

Baby, if you loved me you would call me your bunny
Tell me I'm just a baby, honey
Beat me and tell me that no one will love me
Better than you do
Better than you do
Dance me all around the room
Dance me around the room
Keep out the stars, turn out the lights
This little world is yours tonight
Dance me all around the room
Say you'll never leave me

Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does?
Who has a choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does? (Nobody)
Who has a choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody, nobody

Say I make you feel like
Like you did, like you did when you were thirteen
Say I make you feel like
When you were the dirty heavy metal king
Say I make you feel all right, all right, all right

Kissing me 'till I see the sunshine
Kissing me 'till I see the sunshine
Keep out the stars, turn out the lights
This little world is yours tonight
Is yours tonight
This little world is yours tonight
Say you'll never leave me
Say you'll never leave me

Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does?
Who has a choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does? (Nobody)
Who has a choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
