Bound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know
I am going to leave you?
Fresh from the shore
Blonde hair is white
The Ocean makes me cry


I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can

Tell me about
Ray and his girl
Do I know Ray has gone
To meet you
Love you, I do
Stay here, I won't
The stars fade from your eyes

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can

One, two
Make it fun
Don't trust anyone
One, two
Make it fun
Don't trust anyone

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can
I'm in love with a dying man
