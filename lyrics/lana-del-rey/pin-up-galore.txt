Pin up girls at the roller derby
Take me down to Newark, New Jersey
American flags, blue blue streamers
Everybody's laughing
The crowd is cheering


Baby I've become someone
Baby I've become
Baby I've become someone
Not of this world
Hey-ey-ey
Not of this world
Hey-ey-ey

Dance at night back in Alabama
Christmas lights on my teal green trailer
American flags, blue blue streamers
All the men are watching
The crowd is streaming

Baby I, I've become someone
Baby I've become
Baby I've become someone
Not of this world
Yeah-ey-ey
Not of this world
Hey-ey-ey

Prizes, prizes
A diamond tiara
Here's to the girl with the blue mascara

I have a disco ball mind
Lights flashing all of the time
I have a disco ball mind
I wanna die, I wanna die
I wanna die, I wanna die

Baby I've become someone
Baby I've have become
Baby I've have become someone
Not of this world
Hey-ey-ey
Not of this world
