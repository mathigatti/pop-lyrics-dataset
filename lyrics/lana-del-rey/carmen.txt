Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself
'Cause her liquour's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly
How charming she can be
Fooling everyone
Telling them she's having fun


She says
You don't want to be like me
Don't want to see all the things I've seen
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'
She says
You don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lyin', I'm lyin'

The boys, the girls
They all like carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes

She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Buy her tonight, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, white lightning

Carmen, carmen
Staying up till morning
Only 17, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming truly
How disarming you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream
Coney island queen

She says
You don't want to be like me
Lookin' for fun, gettin' high for free
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'
She says
You don't want to get this way
Streetwalk at night and a star by day
It's tirin', tirin'

The boys, the girls
They all like carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes

She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Buy her tonight, she's still shining
Like lightning, white lightning

Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry knots
Smiling, doing party favours
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song
Now the camera's on
And you're alive again

Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi
Tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrerai sans toi
Je tuerai pour toi

The boys, the girls
They all like carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes

She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Buy her tonight, she's still shining
Like lightning, white lightning

Darlin', darlin'
Doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself
'Cause her liquour's top shelf
