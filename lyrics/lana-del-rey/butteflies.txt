We’re sippin' cocktails, lookin' down upon the riot
You whisper: Baby, love the way you look tonight
I wanna save you, save you from the world outside
I know it seems you’re all I wanted and much more
But then, to tell the truth, I’ve been through this before
They say I’ll save you, save you, but they never do


I think you know I want to believe you
But in my heart, I know that I’ll leave you
It’s sort of sad how instincts deceive you, or does it please you?
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies

Well back in high school, in the yard, we used to fight
But you would sneak in through my window every night
I wanna take you, take you to the world outside
Well, I assume it’s what I wanted at the time (oh, at the time)
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign (oh, warning sign)
I wanna take you, take you and I didn’t mind

And even then I didn’t believe you (no)
You had a smile so easy to see through
I know a little part of me will always need you (yes)
Try to reach you, try to please you (what?)
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies

I know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I can’t let go, I’m sure that we should be forever

I look around, there’s no one above you
I think you know that I’ll always love you
And baby, I’m bad too, it’s not just you
But I can’t wait forever to trust you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you’ve done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
