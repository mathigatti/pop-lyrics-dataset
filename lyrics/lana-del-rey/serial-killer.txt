Wish I may
Wish I might find my one true love tonight
Do you think that he could be you?
If I pray really tight
Get into a fake bar fight
While I’m walking down the avenue
If I lay really quiet
I know that what I do isn’t right
I can’t stop what I love to do
So I murder love in the night
Watching them fall one by one they fight
Do you think you’ll love me too, ooh, ooh?


Baby, I’m a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
‘Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much (much, much)
You can see me drinking cherry cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush
(Rush, rush)
(You send me right to heaven)

Sweet serial killer
(I guess I’ll see him over)
Do it for the thrill of the rush
Love you just a little too much, much
(You send me right to heaven)

Sweet serial killer
(I guess I’ll see him over)
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much

My black fire’s burning bright
Maybe I’ll go out tonight
We can paint the town in blue

I’m so hot, I ignite
Dancing in the dark and I shine
Like a light I’m luring you

Sneak up on you, really quiet
Whisper: Am I what your heart desires?
I could be your ingenue

Keep you safe, and inspired
Baby, let your fantasies unwind
We can do what you want to do, ooh, ooh

Baby, I’m a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
‘Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much (much, much)
You can see me drinking cherry cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thirll of the rush (rush, rush)

(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I’ll see him over)
Do it for the thrill of the rush
Love you just a little too much, much

(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I’ll see him over)
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much

Just have fun
Wanna play you like a game boy
Don’t want one
What’s the thrill of the same toy?
La la, la la la, la la, la la lie down, down

Just have fun
Wanna play you like a game boy
Don’t want one
What’s the thrill of the same toy?
La la, la la la, la la, la la lie down, down, down

Ugh
You can see me drinking cherry cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thirll of the rush
(Rush, rush)

(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer (I guess I’ll see him over)
Do it for the thrill of the rush
Love you just a little too much, much

(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I’ll see him over)
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much
