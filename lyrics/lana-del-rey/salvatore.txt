All the lights in miami begin to gleam
Ruby, blue and green, neon too
Everything looks better from above, my king
Like aquamarine, oceans blue


Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, limousine
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ciao amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, soft ice creams

All the lights are sparkling for you, it seems
On the downtown scenes, shady blue
Beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain
Like a boss, he sang jazz and blues

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, limousine
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ciao amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, soft ice creams

The summer's wild and I've been waiting
For you all this time I adore you
Can't you see, you're meant for me?
Summer's hot but I've been cold without you
I was so wrong not to tell
Medell√≠n, tangerine dreams

Catch me if you can, working on my tan, salvatore
Dying by the hand of a foreign man happily
Calling out my name in the summer rain: Ciao amore
Salvatore can wait, now it's time to eat soft ice cream

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, cacciatore
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, limousines
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, ciao amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, soft ice cream
