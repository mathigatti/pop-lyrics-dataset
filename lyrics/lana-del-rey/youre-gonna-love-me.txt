Jerry is in the town
I think I have
A good idea
That I should do the opposite
Of whatever it is I feel


It's because I have a bad mind
And I have gold in my veins
But he says I got the purest heart
That he's ever seen

What God give me a brain for?
If he won't let me use it
What God give me a plan for?
If he won't help me do it

You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you

Well I can tell that you're the type
To never trust a Beauty Queen
But I was never voted for nothing in High School
Never meaned anything to anybody
Never ever gave myself away
But even when I'm funny
You think I'm actin' so I say

What God give me a brain for?
If he won't let me use it
What God give me a plan for?
He never helps me do it

You're gonna love me
I'm gonna have to make you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you

You say that you don't want to be hypnotized
But baby I, I don't wanna hypnotize you
There's nothing from you that I wanna take
I just wanna be like you
Maybe love you just a little bit
Please, oh oh oh

Jim I'mma dedicate this whole album to you
You told me to get my way, that's exactly what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna strike out
Right now
I'm strikin' out right now
With this song
But I can't help myself
I can't do right for long

You know that
What God give me a brain for?
He knows that I can't use it
