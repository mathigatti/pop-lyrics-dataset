What an unusual name you said
What a spectacular letter
You really seem like a prize, to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are notorious
Oh what do you mean to me he said
How do you know me so well?
After only one night I, I, I, I had
How do I love you, tell me
Though in my mind
I'm indebited to you, I'm indebted to you
Always


There's something he doesn't know about me
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive sign on his arm
Oh my, ai, ai
She got the skeletons dance when
Some secrets he know she never tell
People who keep her alone
And she said, how did I know you so well

Why am I not surprised?
He said, baby go to hell and
That will set demise of your love
Don't ever pick up the man
If you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you
Have a history of being a loving fool
So that's what she got when she married him

A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know him so well
Not more than one night
Do you still love me, oh tell me
With all of your might
I'm indebited to you, in indebted to you
My love
