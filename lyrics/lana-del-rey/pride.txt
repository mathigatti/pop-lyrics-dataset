You have this way of making me say
The opposite of everything I mean
I kiss you
I hug you
But I could not feel less connected from you!
I know I want it all this
In the beginning I really tried


I know I caught you
At a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than all your junky pride
I don't quit fit the part of she who
Loses everything and falls into insanity
The sunbeams, mean nothing
If you can't find the light shining in one thing

I know I want it all this
In the beginning I really tried
I know I caught you
At a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride
It's fine if you're hateful
As long as you remain grateful

It made me nervous
To know you didn't like me
I really tried
The way I'm feeling in
This moment it can't last my whole life
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride
