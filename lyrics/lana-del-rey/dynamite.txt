French vanilla ice cream, just the way I like
Dripping on your windscreen, I can’t get a bite
Guess we could be more than friends, ‘cause this kiss won’t end
And you got me trembling


You’re dynamite, I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite, I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're one thing, rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite

Speeding through the wasteland, sparkling in the lights
Roll up the boardwalk, derelict delight
Eyes are on my dress again
I know how this ends
Boy, you’re all adrenaline

You’re dynamite, I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite, I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're one thing, rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite

He’s not like other guys, I can’t apologize
For what my body wants and what my heart decides
‘Cause I’m so close to the real thing
Yeah, I’m so close to the real thing
I’m so close to the real thing I could almost die

Say it isn’t over, say it’s not goodnight
Maybe we could go somewhere and start a pillow fight

You’re dynamite, I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite, I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're one thing, rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite
