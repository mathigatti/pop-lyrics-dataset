You roll like thunder
When you come crashing in
Town ain't been the same
Since you left with all your friends
You roll like thunder
When you come crashing in
Regattas in the wind
That's why you're visiting


You act like fucking Mr. Brightside
When you're with all your friends
But I know what you're like
When the party ends

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

You roll like thunder
Pourin' all your drinks
The party's lit and you my friend
Half cut when it begins
You roll like thunder
You tryna catch that wind
That lightning in the bottle
That moonbeam in your hand

And you try to see the bright side
When each new day begins
But you're not satisfied
At the rainbow's end

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
I don't wanna beg
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

Cause if you're on fire, you're on fire
Just keep burning
Till it rains, baby
Keep me ablaze
Honey, if you're on fire, you're on fire
Just keep burning
Keep me alive
Spare your blade

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If our love just means goodbye
Then honey better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If our love just means goodbye
Then baby better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
Cause I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
If you're on fire, you're on fire
You should just keep burning
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
