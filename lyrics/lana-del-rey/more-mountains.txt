Atop every mountain
There's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them
You will understand as I


There is no solution
Life is without resolution
You must ask yourself
What you really want in life
You must trust in me
When I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

I remember new year's
That year everything seemed right
We had not made plans
And we just drove all the whole night

Let's all go find a friend
Don't stop until the end
You must ask yourself, am I really the one?
You can't be of help
If you can't have any fun
I'm your one if you want me to be

Please leave me be
Who are you to say
A soul won't live forever?
Yeah, yeah

Atop every mountain
There's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them
You will understand as I

Each breath is sent from angels
These people, they are not strangers
You must ask yourself
What you really want in life
You must trust in me
When I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight
