Shine on me sunshine walk with me world it's a skip-a-dee-doo-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole usa


Good morning morning hello sunshine wake up sleepy head
Why'd we move that beanjungle clock so far away from the bed
Just one more minute that's why we moved it one more hug or two
Do you love wakin' up next to me as much as I love wakin' up next to you

You make the coffee I'll make the bed I'll fix your lunch and you'll fix mine
Now tell me the truth do these old shoes look funny honey it's almost time
Now you'll be careful gotta go I love you have a beautiful day
And kiss the happiest girl in the whole usa

Skip-a-dee-doo-dah thank you lord for making him for me
And thank you for letting life turn out the way that I always thought it could be
There once was a time when I could not imagine how it would feel to say
I'm the happiest girl in the whole usa

Now shine on me sunshine walk with me
Shine on me sunshine walk with me
Shine on me sunshine walk with me
