Put the radio on
Put the radio on (hello)
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong


Sugar and spice
Everything nice
Keep me on lockdown
Put me on ice

'Cause I’m a really good girl
You a very bad guy
We’re a little match made in heaven
If I say so, yay-o
Come over here boy and play-o

Work it out, work it right
Baby’s locking low tonight
Work it out, keep it tight
You’re so rock and roll
Sold your soul now, baby

Put the radio on
Put the radio on (yes, yes)
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong

Put the radio on (and take a breath)
Put the radio on ( come over here)
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong for you

Peaches and cream
Everyone’s dream
You think you like me now
You should hear me sing

'Cause baby I’m a fly girl 
And you’re a big shot,
If we got together I know it would be hot-hot
Say so, stay-o
I’ll give you something to pray for

Work it out, work it right
Baby’s locking low tonight
Work it out, keep it tight
You’re so rock and roll
Sold your soul now, baby

Put the radio on
Put the radio on (yes, yes)
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong

Put the radio on (and take a breath)
Put the radio on (come over here)
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong for you

I’m waiting by your backdoor
Let me come in
I got your favourite dress on
Long hair pinned up

I like you lots, Polka dots
Some desire in your thoughts
Thinking of you, dreaming of us

Like you lots, Polka dots
Some desire in your thoughts
Thinking of you, dreaming of us

Put the radio on
Put the radio on (yes, yes)
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong

Put the radio on (and take a breath)
Put the radio on (come over here)
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong for you

You know I got a taste for tonic and gin
You know I got an eye for fur and fine things
You know that I’m to die for
Baby, give in
I told you when we met what you were in for

Put the radio on
Put the radio on (yes, yes)
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong

Put the radio on (and take a breath)
Put the radio on (come over here)
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong
I don’t wanna know I’m wrong for you
