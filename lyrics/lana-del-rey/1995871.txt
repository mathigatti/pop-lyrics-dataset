Give me coffee, king size cup
Come on kitty cat, fill her up
What's your name little buttercup?
That's for me to know and you to make up


Love casinos and neon reservations
But baby if you love me, take me to the gas station
Gas station

Look at you smoking in them neon lights
Under the thunder yo, you like so nice
Made me wonder how you spend them nights
Me, i spend them looking for men you might like

Like you
Like you
Like you
Like you

Love casinos and neon reservations
But baby if you love me, take me to the gas station
Take me to the gas station

Give me coffee, utah love
I'm the kinda girl you dream of
I'm trying to tell you what i dream of
And that's gas stations
The slurpee machines and organs playing
Preferably, with smoking inside
If you can swing it (swing it, swing it, swing it)
Can i be real pleased if we could find one just like here again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again, again, again, again, again

Love casinos and neon reservations
But baby if you love me, take me to the gas station
Gas station

Gas station
Gas station
Gas station

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
