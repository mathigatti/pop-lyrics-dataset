Down on the west coast
They got a saying
If you're not drinkin' then you're not playin
But you’ve got the music
You’ve got the music in you
Don’t you?


Down on the west coast
I get this feeling like
It all could happen
That’s why I’m leaving you for the moment
You for the moment
Boy blue, yeah, you

It's getting harder to show it
I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me
And I always say I miss you so much
Something keeps me real cold
I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love

I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)

Down on the west coast
They got their icons
Their silver starlets
Their queens of saigons
And you’ve got the music
You’ve got the music in you
Don’t you?

Down on the west coast
They love their movies
Their golden dozen
And rock and roll groupies
And you’ve got the music
You’ve got the music in you
Don’t you?

You push it hard, I pull away
I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really
Made me feel that much higher
Te deseo cariño, boy it’s you I desire
Your love, your love, my love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love

I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love

I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
