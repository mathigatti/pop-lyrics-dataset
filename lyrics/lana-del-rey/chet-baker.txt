Stop your crying oh little boy
'Cause I know a place that you will enjoy
It's a place that's full of diamonds and toys
And chet baker's playin' trumpet there


So go there now, with joy
Go there don't feel low
'Cause chet baker's playin' trumpet alone
For you

Don't you worry that girl is gone
Don't you worry for the things that she's done
Just relax, you still got time to go on
'Cause this place is openminded to you

So go there now, with joy
Go there don't feel low
'Cause chet baker's playin' trumpet alone
For you

So go there now, with joy
Go there don't feel low
'Cause chet baker's playin' trumpet alone
For you
