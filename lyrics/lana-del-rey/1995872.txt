Oh say, can you see my stars?
The night time is almost ours
To wander through hayley's and look at the bars
Nighttime is almost ours


The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face then leave me the dark
The voice of nirvana says: come as you are
And I will
The nighttime is almost ours

A sway of the hips and arms
We'll cradle you from afar
They swing till you tire and send it alarms
Nighttime is almost ours
