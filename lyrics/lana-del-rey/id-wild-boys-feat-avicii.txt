So bold and fine
I’ve known you for some time
Oh, I changed wild boys like yours and mine
Go dance in the woods
And down we go, down, down
Oh, boy, you’re mine
Do you remember our time?


Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, I always wanna be with you
Never doubt boy, everything I ask for you
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, I always wanna be with you
Never doubt boy, everything I ask for you

Never doubt boy, everything I ask for you

Oh, love of mine
Distraction and cry
For those who find
Love is a game like you and I
Go dance in the waters
Of all the tears we cried
Oh, boy, if I do remember
All the times

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, I always wanna be with you
Never doubt boy, everything I ask for you
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, I always wanna be with you
Never doubt boy, everything I ask for you
