I think we’re losing what we used to have, you know?
You loved me better one year ago
Don’t let me down
Don’t let me down so low
But I won’t be ashamed if you leave me
Won’t be all that mad if you go
‘Cause I know
Yes, I know


You’re always spending all that stupid time with your band on the road
But your band is all the rage
So I’ve been told
But you can still come home
You can still come home when you want
And I won’t be ashamed to take you back
Yea, won’t be ashamed to put a kiss on your lips
‘Cause I know, I know

Boy don’t call me up quickly on the phone
It’s been five nights since I’ve heard the tone of your voice
You were a tike, everything’s alright
But we both know, we both know that it’s not
And it’s far from ever being good again
But I’m gonna love you forever
If you come back I’ll take you back in baby
Back in baby
Back in,  back in

I love you more than I will even know
You’re so special
I guess that’s why you got it where you go but
When you get real big baby
Remember that little old cowgirl
Waiting for you back in that red river valley
Waiting back in that tallahassee
I love you
