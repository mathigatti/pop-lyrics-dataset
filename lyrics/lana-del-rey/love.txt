Look at you kids, with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusing


It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy

You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough

To be young and in love (ah, ah)
To be young and in love (ah, ah)

Look at you kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse it

Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough

To be young and in love (ah, ah)
To be young and in love (ah, ah)

Hmm (ah, ah), hmm (ah, ah, ah, ah), hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (ah, ah), hmm (ah, ah, ah, ah), hmm
Don't worry, baby

And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come

'Cause I'm young and in love (ah, ah)
I'm young and in love (ah, ah)

Hmm (ah, ah), hmm (ah, ah, ah, ah), hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (ah, ah), hmm (ah, ah, ah, ah), hmm
Don't worry, baby
