Love
I said real love
It's like feeling no fear
When you're standing in the face of danger
'Cause you just want it so much


A touch
From your real love
It's like heaven taking the place of something evil
And lettin' it burn off from the rush
Yeah, yeah (fuck)

Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine
Rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches (are ruined)

Love
I said real love
It's like smiling when the firing squad's against you
And you just stay lined up
Yeah (fuck)

Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces (bitch)
My cherries and wine
Rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches (are ruined, bitch)

My rose garden dreams
Set on fire by fiends
And all my black beaches (are ruined)
My celluloid scenes
Are torn at the seams
And I fall to pieces (bitch)
I fall to pieces when I'm with you

(Why?)

'Cause I love you so much
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine
Rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches (are ruined, bitch)

Are ruined (bitch)
Are ruined (fuck)
