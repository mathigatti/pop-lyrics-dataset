Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you’re the best


I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I’m feeling alive

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I’m on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you’re the best

I’ve got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh

I’m feeling electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin’ ‘bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I’ll die happy tonight

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I’m on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you’re the best

I’ve got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh

I think I’ll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies
Later’s better than never
Even if you’re gone, I’m gonna drive
Drive, drive

I’ve got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you’re the best

I’ve got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh
