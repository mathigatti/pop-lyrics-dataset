Got a light in your eyes, I can see it
Look into my mind to believe it
Try hard to remember the page
Blue water from the sea, hands all over me
Tattoos, they were glistening
It's been so long since someone made me different


Give heaven a try
Be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try
Be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It's just you and the sun
It's just you and the sun now, baby

Gonna' light up the skies, I can see it
You're God's favorite's child, boy, believe it
Tryin hard to remember the days
Sick as fucking cyanine
Diamonds and getting blazed
Tattoos, still magnificent
No longer high, but you're not very different

Give heaven a try
Be young and be wild
Be free and alive, baby
Give heaven a try
Be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It's just you and the sun
It's just you and the sun now, baby
Baby, baby

I get so damn tired
You set my soul on fire
Ignite me, inspire
Make me higher and higher

Give heaven a try
Be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try
Be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It's just you and the sun
It's just you and the sun now, baby
