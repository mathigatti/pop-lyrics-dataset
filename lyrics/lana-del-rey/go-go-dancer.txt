I drop it like it's hot
On the pole, on the pole
Shining in the club
Neon gold, neon gold


They call me firecracker
And alcohol's a factor

I drop it like it's hot
Baby, bolt, baby, bolt
A little bit of fun
For your soul, for your soul

They call me firecracker
'Cause ain't nobody faster

I'm your go-go dancer
Midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart
Queen of the night

Vegas, baby
If you pay me
Anything you like
Anything you like

Go-go dancer
Midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart
Queen of the night

Vegas, baby
If you pay me
Anything you like
Go, g-go, g-go
Dancing tonight

Pushin' up my, uh
In your face, in your face
Keep your fingertips
On my waist, on my waist

I'm your go-go dancer
Credit card romance

Corner of the road
With the lights, with the lace
Catch me after twelve
In the place, yeah the place

Boy, make out your dollars
Baby, needs a new fur

I'm your go-go dancer
Midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart
Queen of the night

Vegas, baby
If you pay me
Anything you like
Anything you like

Go-go dancer
Midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart
Queen of the night

Vegas, baby
If you pay me
Anything you like
Go, g-go, g-go
Dancing tonight

Girl next door
Let me come in
I know I go-go dance
But I do it for kicks

I'll never have to work
'Cause my daddy is rich
I'm partyin' all night
Shinin' in the lights

Is it a crime
To wanna shine
In my white
Go-go boots and my
Silver design
I know it makes you wild
I know it makes you wild!

I'm your go-go dancer
Midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart
Queen of the night

Vegas, baby
If you pay me
Anything you like
Anything you like

Go-go dancer
Midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart
Queen of the night

Vegas, baby
If you pay me
Anything you like
Go, g-go, g-go
Dancing tonight
