You are brawling hard
Santa Monica Boulevard
Black tint glass on your cherry red car
You know very well no one's bad as you are


You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

Oh, you look so hot
Your face is like a map of the stars
Your switch blade smile and your battle scars
I'm so hot for you baby, baby, this love is ours

You're still in the game
I want you to change
Stop making it right
I wanna be your girl, wanna be your girl

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

Oh, you look like art
Shining like a star in the dark
Lightning strikes, you're my infinite spark
Set the world on fire and it's lovely to watch
Dead scared of your name, they know you're insane
I like it that way, I have to be your girl
I gotta be your girl

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
An arrow through my heart, now I want you a lot

Life is wild, like a little game
That we like to play just for fun, just for fun
'Cause we take nothing seriously
Nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong

Life is like, like a piece of cake
'Cause we love to play just for fun in the sun
Yeah, we know nothing means a thing
'Cause we have won, boy, we won

Oh, be still my heart
You're shining like a light in the dark

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
