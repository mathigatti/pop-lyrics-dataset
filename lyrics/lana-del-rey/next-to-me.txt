Another day is over
Another day is done
And now I'm getting closer
To the rising sun


Hey there, what you doin'?
Would you like a little company?
Hey man, how you doin'?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Another day is over
Another day is done
Another night I'm waiting
Waiting for the sun

Hey there, what you doin'?
Would you like a little company?
Hey man, how you doin'?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Well, I don't know, little lady
You're offly pretty, but I'm a nice man
I live a nice life, I have a nice house
I have a great wife
And I'm tired of making decisions
Without thinking, ohohoh

Another moon is shining
Another evening come
Another hour unwinding
'Till the night is done

Hey there, what you doin'?
Would you like a little company?
Hey man, how you doin'?
Would you like to sit next to me?
