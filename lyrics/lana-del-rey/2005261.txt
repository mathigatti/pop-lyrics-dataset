Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I'll be flying overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy, I've been raised from the dead


No one even notice how hard life was
I don't even think about it now
Because I've finally found you
Now sing it to me

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Lick me up and take me like vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)

American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase until I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said

I don't even notice what life was like
Now I'm in LA and it's paradise
I finally found you
Now sing it to me

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Lick me up and take me like vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)

Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Finally found you
Now sing it to me

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Lick me up and take me like vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Now sing it to me

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
Lick me up and take me like vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(How do you like me now?)
