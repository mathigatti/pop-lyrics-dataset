Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'd be heavily battling on the grind
Cause to sing this nice, it would be a crime
Of the lettering, I'm murdering 'em


Like the summer of love back in '69
You can say that I'm rose, that my body is divine
I belong to everybody that I walk by
Like hi, hi

I'm the master of my destiny
You haven't seen the best of me
And if you want the rest of me
You'll have to pay a lovely fee
Hard, to stay far, far away from me
Cause I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch boy
Stay away from me

Baby I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh, on the e-est side
Baby I'm a vitamin girl
Keepin' in and cut your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby I'a a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me

I've been murdering, I'm murdering on
I be murdering, I'm murdering on

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I've been tyeing them up, and hang 'em out to dry
Cause I'm hot like that when I walk to die
I be murdering, I'm murdering them
Like the summer of love back in '69
When I get on the microphone my, my
Baby looking at you shudder like ay, ay, ay
Like bye, bye
Please excuse my mo-vivacity, capacity for hating
Cause it's incredible
It's better if you stay away from me,
I know it's hard, hard to stay far, far away from me
I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch boy
But boy stay away from me

Baby I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh, on the e-est side
Baby I'm a vitamin girl
Keepin' in and cut your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby I'am a dangerous girl,
Baby should stay away from me

I've been murdering, I'm murdering on
I'm half away
Murdering, I'm murdering 'em ah, ah
Murdering, I'm murdering 'em

Now everyone knows I'm a good girl
I'll give you a fist fight
And you'll be in a fight
Kissable, invincible behavior is despicable
If you're looking for fun you can come out with me tonight
I am the baddest girl in NYC
I am the baddest, liking what you see?

Baby I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh, on the e-est side
Baby I'm a vitamin girl
Keepin' in touch your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby I'a a dangerous girl,
Baby should stay away from me
