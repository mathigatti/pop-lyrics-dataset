I was lounging at the Chateau Marmont
Glimmering by the swimming pool
My man walked in like a slow motion movie
I said, you're so cool


I heard a man screaming
Lights, camera, action
I c-c-can't remember what happened
I overdose,
You throw me over your shoulder
I was dying, you were screaming
Open up that Lambourghini

Open up your butterfly doors
Heavy Hitter
Open up your butterfly doors
What do you say?
Open up your butterfly doors
Heavy Hitter
Let's ch-ch-change a DNA
Let's change our DNA

You're the king, my fear baby
I am the Queen of Alchemy
I know a way to make gold by mixing our souls to escape reality

Queen in Monterey
Run to that ocean
I got that magical trance potion
Gotta leave
I can't wait 'til I'm older
You was laughing, I was running
Use that remote to open up

Open up your butterfly doors
Heavy Hitter
Open up your butterfly doors
What do you say?
Open up your butterfly doors
Heavy Hitter
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

You can be my higher power baby
I can be your endless USA
We can go for drives for hours baby
Let's change our DNA
Let's change our DNA
Let's change

Open up your butterfly doors
Heavy Hitter
Open up your butterfly doors
What do you say?
Open up your butterfly doors
Heavy Hitter
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

Heavy Hitter!
