Don't fuck with me
I told you don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me


Fuck you attitude
You know what I wanna do
Light it up red, white and blue
Do I look high to you? Well that's because I am
That's because I am
Do you know what I had to do
To get here, man!?

No no, you don't, don't
'Cause you're not a gangsta
No no, you don't don't
'Cause you're not a gangsta
Like I

Scarface, sacrifice
Sold my soul to make it nice
It was worth it, paid the price
Life is death when blow is life

But me and my crew
We know what we like
We know how to roll
Will we ever stop? No!

Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
You're not a gangsta
Don't fuck with me

Yes, yes yes
You're not a gansta
Fuck!
