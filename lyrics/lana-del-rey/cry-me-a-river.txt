Now you say you’re lonely
You cried the long night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you


Now you say you’re sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me
Out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and

Now you say, you say you love me
Well, just to prove that you do
Come on, boy, cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you’re lonely
You cried the long night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you’re sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you
