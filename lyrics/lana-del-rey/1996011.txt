Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out
What’s your address?


I’m your National Anthem
God, you’re so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons
Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance ‘em
Reckless abandon
Hold me for ransom
Upper echelon

He says to be cool but
I don’t know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said: Can we party later on?
He said: Yes, yes, yes

Tell me I’m your National Anthem
Booyah baby bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I’m your National Anthem
Sugar sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue’s in the skies
Summer’s in the air
And baby, heaven’s in your eyes
I’m your National Anthem

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it’s a fact
Kiss, kiss

I sing the National Anthem
While I’m standing
Over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can’t keep your hands off me
Or your pants on
See what you’ve done to me
King of Chevron

You said to be cool but
I’m already coolest
I said to get real
Don’t you know who you’re dealing with?
Uhm, do you think you’ll buy me lots of diamonds?

Tell me I’m your National Anthem
Booyah baby bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I’m your National Anthem
Sugar sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue’s in the skies
Summer’s in the air
And baby, heaven’s in your eyes
I’m your National Anthem

It’s a love story for the new age
For the six page
We’re on a quick sick rampage
Wining and dining
Drinking and driving
Excessive buying
Overdose and dying

On our drugs and our love
And our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I’m your National Anthem
Boy put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy you have landed, baby
In the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon

Tell me I’m your National Anthem
Booyah baby bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I’m your National Anthem
Sugar sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue’s in the skies
Summer’s in the air
And baby, heaven’s in your eyes
I’m your National Anthem

Money is the anthem
God, you’re so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

Money is the anthem
God, you’re so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

Money is the anthem
God, you’re so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

Money is the anthem
God, you’re so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
