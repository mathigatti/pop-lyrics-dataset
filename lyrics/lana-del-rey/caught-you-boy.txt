Everything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancing in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I’m your baby, right?


My, my, apple in my eye
Looking really hot while I’m making cherry pie
Show me what you got, got the sparkle in your eye
You’re so high

I’m loose and I’m free and I’m fun
I’m wild as can be, and I want
I want you, boy, I want you, boy
I’m cool and I’m calm with danger
This army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holding me too tight
I know we’ll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight

My, my, looking really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I’m so high

I’m loose and I’m free and I’m fun
I’m wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I’m cool and I’m calm with danger
This army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have my one true love tonight
Will you be mine?
Oh hi, look at daddy shy
Cause the way you put your hands on me
While I, I can barely breathe
Baby boy, you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh

I’m loose and I’m free and I’m fun
I’m wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I’m cool and I’m calm with danger
This army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
Baby, don’t be scared, come on, honey, smile
Everything is fine now, everything is fine

My, my, talking all night
Laughing really hard and it makes me wanna cry
I love our playing house, love our dressing up nice
Drinks on ice

I’m loose and I’m free and I’m fun
I’m wild as can be, and I want
I want you, I want you
I’m cool and I’m calm with danger
This army of one and I caught
Caught you, I caught you

I caught you, boy
I caught you, boy
I caught you
I caught you

I caught you, boy
I caught you, boy
I caught you
I caught you
