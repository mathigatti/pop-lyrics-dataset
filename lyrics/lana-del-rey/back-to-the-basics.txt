C'mon

Baby we could go
Back to the basics
Trailer park love
Wearing them asics
And gold


I can speak Spanish
You can sing for the neighbours
You've been pretty stupid
Ever since you got famous

Uh-oh, uh-oh, wrong side
Of the tracks, boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, if only
We'd go back, boy

'Cause nobody does it like you
I like the way that you move
That's why I never go through
With leaving you

Everybody's sayin' that
You're not good for me
Your friends all swear
That you've changed but
I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder
Of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on
Sing our song

And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted
I know you'll see

Baby we could go
Back to the basics, (c'mon)
We were best friends
Crazy and shameless in love

You can mow the lawn for money
I can make you playlists
You bought me dime packs
Felt like we were famous

Uh-oh, uh-oh, best I
Ever had boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, can you
Remember that, boy?

Nobody knew what we knew
We had it figured out too
Us against the world just
Me and you (ooh-ooh)!

Everybody's sayin' that
You're not good for me
Your friends all swear
That you've changed but
I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder
Of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on
Sing our song

And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted
I know you'll see

We could drive forever, my baby
We could leave it all and never look back
If you wanted heaven, baby
Sit back in my pink Cadillac

Everybody's sayin' that
You're not good for me
Your friends all swear
That you've changed but
I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder
Of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on
Sing our song

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Everybody's sayin' that
You're not good for me
Your friends all swear
That you've changed but
I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder
Of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on
Sing our song

And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted
I know you'll see
