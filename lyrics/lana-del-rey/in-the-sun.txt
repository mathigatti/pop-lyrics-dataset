Everybody said they wasn't loved

I was done
I was getting high on your sugar rush
For too long
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall


Of you and her together, what the hell?
We were in heaven then we fell
I believed you, said I'd never leave you

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the Sun, in the Sun

You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

Everybody said: Careful of that guy
Baby, couldn't stop, it was suicide
Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide
You were feigning love by holding tight
But I need you, don't want to, but need to

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the Sun, in the Sun

You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

You've been messing 'round with my beating heart
You should be ashamed
Boy, you never loved me from the start
Such a wicked game
I told you I needed somebody
I never used you for love or for money, boy
I feel like I can't trust nobody
Beat on my heart and you left it all bloody, now

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the Sun, in the Sun

You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun
