Well, I must be stupid, for feeling so happy
I must be crazy, for calling you mine
My life's like a movie, but I just let it move me
So slow like a two-step, you hold me real tight


All my friends say my life’s
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say: I know, but I like to sing along
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

They think I'm crazy, but I keep laughing
They think I'm funny, for wearing a smile
But it’s just in my nature, and it's just how you move me
You're slow like a movie, and I wanna rewind

All my friends say my life's
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say: I know, but I like to sing along
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

Ah, la, la
Ah, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want
