I'm on the fire but what can I do
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you
I'll be outside pick me up after school baby blue, baby blue


Pour me up a bit of that liquid courage
Lookin so good, like an Axl Rose
Cuttin' school listenin' to the techno music
Will we ever do right? God knows
Me and Claudeen at the Seven Eleven
Smokin in the back, in our mini skirts
Take us back to class, so we look like heaven
You say I'm so fine that it hurts

I'm on the fire but what can I do
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you
I'll be outside pick me up after school
In your thunder black, baby blue
Thunder black, baby blue
Baby blue

Baby if you want to join our entourage
Paint your face on it here we go
Letting on keepin' on so dangerous
Keeping it cool yeah god knows
Riding around town blue and leather
Walking them streets like the queen of hearts
Laughing at nothin' be alone together
Have starts

I'm on the fire but what can I do
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you
I'll be outside pick me up after school
In your thunder black, baby blue
Thunder black, baby blue
Baby blue

Anything to have me
I know you'd do anything to love me
Cuz I'm a bad girl and Ia got a good plan
Bank across the street I'm a dangerous man
Ask you who sweet you tell em i am, baby blue, baby blue

I'm on the fire but what can I do
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you
I'll be outside pick me up after school
In your thunder black, baby blue
Thunder black, baby blue
Baby blue
