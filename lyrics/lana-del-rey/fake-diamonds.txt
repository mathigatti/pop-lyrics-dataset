You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling when the lights are on
But when the night time comes
And all the lights go off
You turn off with them
Where do you go
When the lights turn low, boy?


You're like an old film reel
Kissing me when the crowd can watch
But when the velvet falls
And the projector coughs
I can be sure you're gone
You say it's not true
But I know how you do boy

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
Feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling in the moon and sun
You shine like the only one
But when the darkness comes
Baby you're on the run
Where do you go
When the lights turn low, boy?

You're like my ex-boyfriend
Kissing me when the camera's on
I'm candy for your arm
Look like a debutante
But I'm not what you want

You say it's not true
But I know how you do boy

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
Feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
Feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

You say it's not true
But I know how you do boy

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
Feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
Feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
