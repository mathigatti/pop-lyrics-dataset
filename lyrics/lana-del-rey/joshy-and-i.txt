When you play the bass, I get this feeling
Just like the way, just like I'm dreaming
Out on the way, another babe
How do I do it?


When you play the bass, I get this feeling
Baby
Never mind

You play the bass, I get this feeling
Sick from the wave, so hard to reel in
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

You play the bass, I get this feeling
Sick from the wave, so hard to reel in
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

When you play the bass, I get this feeling
My heart starts to race
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

So pretty

You play the bass
Don't say no, just let me go
Baby
I don't know
Lie me down
When you play the bass
I get this feeling
Heart starts to race
