You know how to whistle don’t ya?
Just put your lips together
(Just put your lips together)
And blow (and blow)


You can be a cool princess
Put you in a party dress
You can make it so hot, wind
You can party up all night

And you can take it just galore
I ain’t going up in more
You strike me as the type of clan
Just to know what he’s looking for
You said you’re a gangster
And that the whole world’s against ya
I can be your liaison to all things fun

If you wanna win
Let me in, let me in
Everybody knows I’m a lucky nice, lucky one
If you want me back
Just put your lips together and blow

You know how to whistle don’t ya?
Just blow
Just blow

You know how to whistle don’t ya?
You know who’s the most fun don’t ya?
It’s me baby
Just put your lips together and blow

I can be a dirty bitch, bitch
I can be your only wish
Don’t you think it’s time to switch?
Switch it up, baby please
Cause if you’re doing the same thing you’ll get the same thing
Don’t you want better?
You was a smart boy
Don’t you want heaven?
Don’t you want heaven here on earth?

If you wanna win
Let me in, let me in
If you want me back
All you have to do is sin
Put your lips together
Put your lips together
You know how to whistle don’t ya?
Put your lips together won’t ya?
And blow
And blow

You know how to whistle don’t ya?
You know who’s the most fun don’t ya?

Put your lips together
Put your lips together

Ha ha, don’t stop

You baby, you baby
Ah ah, oh oh
Club hot hot, don’t stop stop stop
It’s all I really want
Don’t let anyone
It’s you

You know how to whistle don’t ya?
You know who’s the most fun don’t ya?
Don’t ya know baby?
Just put your lips together and blow

If you wanna win
