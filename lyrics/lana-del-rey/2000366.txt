My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart


Swimming pool glimmering, darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples, you
Sitting sipping on your black cristal, yeah

Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins, gimme them coins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again on Rikers Island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me
Every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat broke down life
In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rolling stone

Likes to watch me in the glass room
Bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress, putting on my make up
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you want me, gimme them coins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again on Rikers Island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight
And I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you but I'm going down

God I'm so crazy baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, scarlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'till the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when he may, if he may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you

You're lyin' with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said
Hun, you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man

And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set the gate is down
And now we're going in
To Las Vegas, chaos
Casino oasis
Honey it's time to spin

Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
