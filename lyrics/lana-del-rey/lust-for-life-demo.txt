Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes


They say only the good die young
That just ain't us
Plus you're having too much fun
You're not in a rush

But it's funny how some things just change in a day
Or even in an hour
​I'm like a wild caged animal
Lying by the swimming pool losing all my power
It's funny how my life just stopped
And shifted from meeting you as a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal
Lying by the swimming pool trying to avoid danger

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes

They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight

But it's funny how some things just change in a day
Or even in an hour
​Now I'm like a wild caged animal
Sitting by the swimming pool losing all my power
It's funny how life can change
Or be shaped passing by a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal
Lying by the swimming pool trying to avoid danger

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

It's funny how some things just change in a day
Or even in an hour
​I'm like a wild caged animal
Sitting by the swimming pool losing all my power
It's funny how life can change
Or be shaped passing by a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal
Lying by the swimming pool trying to avoid danger

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

Ooh
Ahh
Ahh
