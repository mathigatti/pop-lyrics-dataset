Play house, put my favourite record on
Get down, get your crystal method on


You were like tall, tan, driving ’round the city
Flirtin’ with the girls like you’re so pretty
Springsteen is the king don’t ya think
I was like: Hell yeah that guy can sing

Like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

You make me crazy, you make wild
Just like a baby, spin me round like a child
Your skin so gold and brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American

Drive fast, I can almost taste it now
L. A, I don’t even have to fake it now

You were like so sick, everybody said it
You were way ahead of the trend, get get it
Elvis is the best, hell yes
Honey put on that party dress

Like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

You make me crazy, you make wild
Just like a baby, spin me round like a child
Your skin so gold and brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American

Everybody wants to go fast, but they can’t compare
I don’t really want the rest, only you can take me there
I don’t even know what I’m saying, but I’m praying for you

You make me crazy, you make wild
Just like a baby, spin me round like a child
Your skin so gold and brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
