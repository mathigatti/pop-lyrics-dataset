You've seen someone that jumps like a lemur at any party
You've seen someone that dance madly like glider fly
I've see a someone that'll glide as vishneva and vomit tears


I'm flying and i will sing a gliding the dance hall
I will dance, i will glide while flying through the air
I'll fly and sing with the secular ballet look twinkle

Because we are us and anyone else
Each in its place where it should be
So we will be a humanity without air
Without air (air, air, air - air)

Beauty, good, truth: this is what i express
Beauty, good, truth: the whole accent
And this change is all that prime

In a three themes, a broad movement.
Beauty, good, truth: alone and once
We live together in one being now

Beautify you with your truth and well-being has now
Because be beauty isn't and was never the hope
But the truth is that we're beings benign always

Because we are us and anyone else
Each in its place where it should be
So we will be a humanity without air
Without air, without (air, air - air)

Do not call my love of idolatry
It is now and always love my gallant
Unchanged in great excellence
So my rhyme is so constant
Without flying, gliding, singing or dancing
And even without being: beauty, truth, good

We are a humanity without air
Without air (air, air, air - air)
But we can change a humanity with air
