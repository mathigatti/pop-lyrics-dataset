Jimmy pulls up in his blue chevy nova
I have been dying for him to come over
I'm in my party dress
He says: You're such a mess
I am the New Jersey dance queen
He is a gangster at Saint King
He knows that I've be selling my body
Humming the best
'Cause he knows what's up
He knows it's a big bad world
He's knows that I'm a good girl
He understands of sale of silk
'Cause cash comes quicker when looks can kill


A hundred dollar bill
A hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Yeya
Twenty of them wrapped up tight in silk

J. Is a romantic roller coaster
He don't anything he supposed to
I like them tough and mean
And jim is the worst that I've ever seen
I am a trailer park darling
He is the one-time come-back king
He knows that I be
Looking to die
He says baby pray
Respect to the high
He knows it's a big bad world
He's knows that I'm a good girl
He understands of sale of silk
'Cause cash comes quicker when looks can kill

A hundred dollar bill
A hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Yeya
Twenty of them wrapped up tight in silk

I like your ultraviolent swing
I like it when you treat me mean
You turn my mood from back to blue, woo
You turn my mood from back to blue, woo
Twenty of them wrapped up tight in

A hundred dollar bill
A hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Yeya
Twenty of them wrapped up tight in silk

I need you, Jim
I need your love and, oh, yeah
