Pretty baby if you don’t like the way
That I touch you
Then I won’t touch you no more yeah


Pretty baby if you don’t like the way
That I love you
Then throw my love on the floor

My mean daddy, my bad baby
Don’t you want me
I don’t believe you, when you say you
Want to leave

Darling, honey, if you don’t think
That you gonna want me
Then honey let me know
Listen honey, I don’t wanna keep thinking
You love me
Just to find out you don’t

My mean daddy, my bad baby
Don’t you want me
I don’t believe you, when you say you
Want to leave

Won’t you gonna miss me?
Honey I’ll miss you
I just wanna kiss you, tonight

Pretty baby if you don’t like the way
That I hold you
Then honey let me go

Pretty baby, if you don’t like the way
That I told you
Then baby tell me so

My mean daddy, my bad baby
Don’t you want me
I don’t believe you, when you say you
Want to leave
