Hi ya honey, what you doing?
I've been hula-hooping
Waiting for you, oh ah


Woah, haters, fakers, mass manipulators
Don't know what you're trying to prove

I'm the New York city queen, queen
You should hear me sing, sing
Baby, I'm the real thing check, 1, 2
Stop looking at my trainwreck life
And start listening to the way I sing the blues

You know, I know what they say about me
I know they think I'm danger
So what if it makes me happy, happy, happy

It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit till the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots
Making out in parking lots with any little boy I spot
Baby, you can't stop me, stop me no
When I'm hot, I'm hot

Hi ya honey, how's it going?
Saw you skipping rope on TV
Looking blue, oh ah

You're shaking, making music and you're famous
Deep down you're the same girl I knew

She said: I know what they say about you
I know that they think you're crazy
I know that they are mistaken, baby, baby

It doesn't really matter what they say
Cause I ain't gonna quit till the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots
Making out in parking lots with any little boy I spot
Baby, you can't stop me, stop me no
When I'm hot, I'm hot

Singing for the gangsters
Chasing all that paper
Living life so dangerously
And there's nothing for my anchor
Money is my savior
I can be whatever I think
It's like heaven, heaven
Living on the edge
Never knowing where I'm going to be
And I'm dreading ever
Settling down that's when
Dying is beginning to gleam

It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna change till the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots
Making out in parking lots with any little boy I spot
Honey, you can't stop me, stop me no
When I'm hot, I'm hot

Ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh
