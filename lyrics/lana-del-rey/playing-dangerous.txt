Everybody knows that I'm a good girl, officer
No, I wouldn't do a thing like that
That's for sure


The house was already on fire
I swear, I'm not a liar
Well, I'm a little shaken
But I'm fine, thanks for asking

Tell me do you always work alone so late?
Gosh, I don't mind if I'm staying here in my night gown
Do you really have to put those tight handcuffs on?
Looking at me, then suddenly

I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane
Hurricane, hurricane

Let's get in the back of your cop car, officer
You can ask me anything you want
Anything, anything

Do you have a girl?
I don't see a ring on your finger
Well that's interesting
Have you ever thought of dating a singer?

The flames are getting higher
So is my desire
It's kind of exciting, don't you think?
Then suddenly, he's uncuffing me

I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane
Hurricane, hurricane

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire
Boy, love is strange, sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you down

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire
Boy, love is strange, sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you down

I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane
Hurricane, hurricane
