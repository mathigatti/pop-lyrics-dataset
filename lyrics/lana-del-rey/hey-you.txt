Do, do
Ah, ah
I said


Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong
But no one can save me

He’s walked with the past
Life of the fast
Girls in the fast lane
His knuckles are brass
A heart like a horse
Love of the games, gold in his veins

Met him at the club
Singing my songs
He says: Are you famous?
I was once
A b-movie movie actress
Has been, that never was
He knows that it's love

He saw me on stage
Pointed my way
The look of desire, all on his face
I gave him the eye
And took my place
I could tell he'll be mine by daytime

Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can’t stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong
But no one can save me

He's a man with a cast
The cane in the glass
Rim full of champagne, looking for class
A mind like a steel cage
Soul full of rage
Tactical nature, so they call him insane

Met him at club
And from that night on
He called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it’s wrong
But no one can save me

No one can save me
Oh, do, do, woah
When did I ever fear
What they said about our love, my baby
My baby, blue-oh

Yo, our friends think it’s sad
Living so bad
I'm always crying
He’s always mad
Our life is a mess, always a shame
What did they see in each other?, they say

I met him at the club
And from that night on
Called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself ’cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong
But no one can save me

Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong
But no one can save me

No one can save me
No one can save me
