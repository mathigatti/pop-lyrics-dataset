So I heard you wanna go to rio baby
Yes, I've seen page six lately, ahh
I told you both them broads was crazy
Hacking in your phone and shit


Diamonds and pearls, your little girl
She's got the best, sparklin' like a hollywood movie, ahhh

If you got the cash, lock it down tight
I got the looks, you got my heart right
And you love me, 'cause I'm just like neon
Lighting up your night

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you my king

I thought that you wanted a real girl, baby
You lured me in with all your gold
Catch and release and you're so cold
Are you crazy?

You didn't know what kinda fish you caught
Cause I am a shark, beware of my bark
I'll eat you up like the center of a tootsie pop

'Cause we were a match in heaven high
Only one catch, frank was the boss right
And it's so sad, 'cause the only way
That you know how to love is fight

Hive it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you, my king

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
