Uh, what? Star, star
Lana del rey, lana del rey
Sing it to me, sing it to me


You're so easy to love
You make me coo, coo like a turtle dove
So hot that I cant get enough, enough of you

Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurt so good, when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry

(Sing it to me baby)
Cuz you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(You love that?)
(Sing it to me, dawg)

Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a talk, talk bout the time of our lives
He selling souls on the boulevard
Of broken dreams, and city queens

Live young like we oughta die fast
'Cause hes been breaking the law, and hes not going back
I love him finally all through the night
And yes its true, I live for you

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause your my beautiful player (sing it to me?)
You're a beautiful player baby
(Aw ya love that?)

L is for the love you that gave and took away
O is for the only one I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant, valiant baby
E is x that we took with champagne

I don't wanna leave (No)
I just wanna breathe (Yes)
I drive 'em crazy, baby girl, just being me (Me)
I'm not selfish (No)
I can't help it (I can't)
I'm just playing the cards I was dealt-ed (Uh)
The name's Starz, gotta a lot of love to give (Yeah)
Riding down Broke Dream Boulevard in the Benz (Uh)
How you love that? I think too much
A thin line between insanity and true love

Hit me and it felt like kiss
Baby, if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true loves more than he can give

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause he's my beautiful player
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(Aw you love that?)
(Sing it to me baby)
Cuz he's beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(Aw you love that?)
