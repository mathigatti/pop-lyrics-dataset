Everything is fine now
Let sleeping when dogs lay
All our minds made up now
All our beds are made
No one's out of time, no
Chips fall wherever they may
Leave it all behind
Let the ocean wash it away


It never was about the money or the drugs
For you, there's only love
For you, there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you, there's only love

'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray
Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

Everything is bright now
No more cloudy days
Even when the storms come
In the eye we'll stay
No need to survive now
All we do is play
All I hear is music
Like Lay Lady Lay

It never was about the money or the drugs
With you, there's only love
With you, there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you, there's only love

'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray
Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray
Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love
