He’s my drugstore cowboy, italian alloy
Classical American
And I’m america’s sweetheart, cheap, delicious, sweet-tart
Sippin' on my diet coke
Singin’ in the trailer park


He likes my jeans tight (yeah)
He likes me mean, right? (right)
He likes my long hair, corset, heels high

I’m born to kill, stripped for success
I’m his sweet mess
Do you love me? Yes, yes!
Hell, yes!

Baby, I’m a four-alarm fire
And I’m what you desire
Like a siren in the night (goin' nero, nero)
Baby is a man on a wire
Riskin' all that you’ve got
For the love of your life (you're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

He’s the get-rich-quick type, mafiosi-hit type
Girl, I’m gonna marry him
I'm the bad girl next door, baby's always wantin' more
Buyin’ diamond jewelry
Take me to the jersey shore

He like my mink white (white)
We go out all night (night)
We’re livin' off the grid, shinin' in the crime light

We're born to kill, best of the best
The new wild west
Honey put on that party dress
Hell, yes!

Baby, I’m a four-alarm fire
And I’m what you desire
Like a siren in the night (goin' nero, nero)
Baby is a man on a wire
Riskin' all that you’ve got
For the love of your life (you're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

Me and my baby plannin' world domination
Together takin' over our fair nation

‘Cause we’re born to kill, keepin’ it fresh
Gold chain, white mesh
Fame is the name of the game
Yes yes

Baby, I’m a four-alarm fire
And I’m what you desire
Like a siren in the night goin' nero, nero
Baby is a man on a wire
Riskin' all that you’ve got
For the love of your life you're my hero, hero

Baby, I’m a four-alarm fire
And I’m what you desire
Like a siren in the night (goin' nero, nero)
Baby is a man on a wire
Riskin' all that you’ve got
For the love of your life (you're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

Baby, I’m a four-alarm fire
And I’m what you desire
Like a siren in the night (goin' nero, nero)
Baby is a man on a wire
Riskin' all that you’ve got
For the love of your life (you're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
