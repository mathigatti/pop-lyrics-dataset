Well
I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright
With letting nice things go


Well I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Gold and made of flowers dangling
And I almost
Cried as I sold them

And I don't mind
Living on bread and oranges
No no
But I gotta get to and from
Where I come
And it's gonna take money to go

Oh no
Oh oh
Oh oh

In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said
It's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather
Know what God knows

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

I can do this
Once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born

Well
I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright
With letting nice things go
