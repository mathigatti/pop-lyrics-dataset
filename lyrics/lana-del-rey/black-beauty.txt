I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
'Cause you like your women Spanish
Dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make a nighttime all today
So it'd suit the mood with your soul


Oh, what can I do?
Nothing
My sparrow blue

Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful
But you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
That magnificence
It don't make sense to you

Black beauty, oh

I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather too
You have no room for light
Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
To seem like cherries in the spring
Darling, you can't let everything
Seem so dark blue

But, oh, what can I do
To turn you on
Or get through you?

Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful
But you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
That magnificence
It don't make sense to you

Black beauty, oh
