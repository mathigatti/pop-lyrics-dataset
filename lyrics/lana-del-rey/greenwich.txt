Hey, backin' me up, baby, come on

Are you back in Greenwich dropping acid?
Are you at The Archive watching television?
Did you leave for battery with your weed
And your leather lookin' like Greg Kinnear?
Are you still the king of rock 'n' roll, babe?


Bet you miss hearing me sing, calling me Lana
And did you take your run today
Along that west side highway?
Do you miss your baby mama?
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never come back to me?

Does it feel like yesterday to you yet?
How quickly you forget how I made you smile?
I remember everything
The diamond horseshoe
Wedding ring and the tire light (ah, oh)
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never return to me?
