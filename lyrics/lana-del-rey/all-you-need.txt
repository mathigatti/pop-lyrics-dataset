You have a right to live your life
Like no one else does
Like no one else might
If you have visions
Come on and live them out


All you need is some peace
While you are here
Just let go 'till you are home, dear

I had a dream when I was young
I dreamt our lives were going to be fun
We were always waiting to live

All you need is some peace
While you are here
Just let go off it all, dear

You have a choice to hear the noise
Or hear the sweet sound
Of your sweet voice
I know I've heard it
I heard it in my sleep

All you need is some peace
While you are here
Just let go, don't say no, dear

Wake up each night at the same time
Pull up the blind and look outside
And in the orange light, the fog is rising

This is life, this still night
Peace in the quiet
Happiness is the sky
