In a land of gods and monsters
I was an angel
Living in the garden of evil


Screwed up, scared
Doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon

You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love
Give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist
Do it softly
Me and God, we don’t get along
So now I sing

No one’s gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel, sprees, sprees
And I’m singing

Fuck, yeah, give it to me
This is heaven
What I truly want
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost

In a land of gods and monsters
I was an angel
Lookin' to get fucked hard

Like a groupie incognito posing
As a real singer
Life imitates art

You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up
Straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said
Baby, that's alright with me

No one’s gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel, sprees, sprees
And I’m singing

Fuck, yeah, give it to me
This is heaven
What I truly want
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost

When you talk it's like a movie
And you're makin' me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier
Can I be your baby?
You tell me
Life isn't that hard

No one’s gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel, sprees, sprees
And I’m singing

Fuck, yeah, give it to me
This is heaven
What I truly want
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost
