Topanga is hot tonight
The city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores
And soft decay
The rumbling from distant shores
Sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can sometimes
Make it hard to dream


Life rocked me like Mötley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me, ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
How I gave you everything
And took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
I hoped you come back again
And tell me everything's okay
Eh, ba-be

Topanga's hot today
Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone
Cause they still feel him here
I want to leave
I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave
When absolutely nothing's clear

Life rocked me like Mötley
Bad beginning to my new year
Life rocked me, ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
And how I gave you everything
And took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's okay
Ba-be, yeah

It's fucking hot, hot
Winter in the city
Something 'bout this weather
Made these kids go crazy
It's hot even for February
Something 'bout this sun
Has made these kids get scary

Writing in blood on my walls
And shit
Like oh my God
Dripping off from the walls into the ducts
And shit

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it
Lead me, baby
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about marzipan
Taking all my medicine
To take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane
Leaving my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I really changed
Ba-be

It's hot, hot
Something 'bout the city
Don't know what it is
And make's my head get crazy

Oh, makes me feel like I can change
Oh, all of my evil ways and shit
Oh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it
