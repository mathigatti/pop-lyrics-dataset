You smell like a million roses bathed in rock n roll
Ours was the greatest love story ever told
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold
That’s my baby


He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall
A heart that would beat like a bass for his baby doll
One in a million, inimitable soul
That’s my baby

Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

You’ve got a way like JFK
When you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you’ve got a soul like no one I know
You’re so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy

He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall
A heart like a bass that would beat for his baby doll
Mind like a diamond, an unimitable song
That’s my baby

Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

You’ve got a way like JFK
When you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you’ve got a soul like no one I know
You’re so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy

It drives me crazy

You’ve got it and I want it
Late summer nights in July, flaunt it
You know that you can always come home to the one who gave you your name
‘Cause I see a light in your eyes
It’s so bright and the skies, they open wide for you
So come to me, my baby

You’ve got a way like JFK
When you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you’ve got a soul like no one I know
You’re so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy

It drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
Crazy
