She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box
for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could leach your cancer when you turn black


Hey, wait, I've got a new complain
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I've got a new complain
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I've got a new complain
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

Meat eating orchids forgive no-one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of your highness I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

Hey, wait, I've got a new complain
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Forever in debt to your priceless advice
