Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh


What cruel world is this?
Nectar of the gods
Heroin gold in my veins
You in my thoughts
I'm on the freeway racing at a million
And I just canâ€™t stop
I call you up twice, hang up the phone
Call again, I wanna talk

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like you never knew
Knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like the color blue
Ooh, ooh, ooh

What sweet world is this?
Honey on the vine
School kid dreams came true
Then passed in the night
I used to dream about people like you
Now I don't know why
I used to sing about people like you
Now I just get high

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like you never knew
Knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like the color blue
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like you never knew
Knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like the color blue
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Californ-i-a, homeland of the gods
Once I found my way, but now I'm lost
