I was born with lightning in my heels
Sewed a spur onto my ankle
Bit a horse under the steel
And I lost hope when I was still so young
Had an angel on my shoulder
But the devil always won


And oh, I lost all when I got here
And I can feel you even now
Breakin' horses in the sky
I can taste you in my rage
And in the sweat upon my brow

And I went home
Chasing twisters in the canyon
My cathedral is the badlands
Dust and devils on my conscience
Come back to me darlin'

So kiss me now
This whiskey on my breath
Feel the lives that I have taken
What little soul that I have left
And oh, my God
I'll take you to the grave
The only love I've ever known
The only soul I've ever saved

And I went home
Chasing twisters in the canyon
My cathedral is the badlands
Dust and devils on my conscience
Come back to me darlin'

And I've been waiting for so long now
I can feel you in the hollow
And every cloud on the horizon
Come back to me darlin'

Don't know you I dream about you
Run, run
Don't know you I dream about you
Run, run
Don't know you I dream about you
Run, run
Don't know you I dream about you

And I went home
Chasing twisters in the canyon
My cathedral is the badlands
Dust and devils on my conscience
Come back to me darlin'

And I've been waiting for so long now
I can feel you in the hollow
And every cloud on the horizon
Come back to me darlin'

Come back to me darlin'
