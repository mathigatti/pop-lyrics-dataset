You know it
And I know it
Gonna be a star
You won't, you won't
Get me very far
Don't say hello
It's already time to go
Oh, the wind is carrying me home
Me home
Me home, again


We all know it
And I know it
Gonna be a star
You won't, you won't
Get me very far
You saw life
Back in the countryside
Ah

Oh, my soul, rise up and go
Beyond, beyond
To what you know
