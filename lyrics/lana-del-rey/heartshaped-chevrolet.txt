You’re bigger than Elvis and cooler than B. I. G
You’re smashing my dishes, you’re billy the kid
You’re very american, sugar
Marry me, dick, I love you


We’re on the road to the jersey shore
One stop and then we’ll stop no more
Pulling over at the 7/11 and you buy
Me pie because I’m sweeter than heaven

You say you love everything I am
Love my lips and my golden tan

You love my heartshaped sunglasses
Love my heartshaped sunglasses
Love my heartshaped sunglasses

Spin me around, kiss me in your chevrolet
Top down, heaven like crazy
You let me drive, I’ll let you go all the way
I’ll never ever, ever, ever let you get away, away
