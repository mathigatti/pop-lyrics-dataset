Take me as I am
Take me, baby, in stride
Only you can save me tonight
There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
You let me in
Don't leave me out
Or leave me dry


Even when I'm alone
I'm not lonely
I hear the sweetest melodies
On the fire escapes of the city
Sounds like I am free
It's got me singing

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
May you stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America

Take me as I am
Don't see me for what I'm not
Only you can hear me tonight
Keep your light on, baby
I might be standing outside
You let me in
Don't leave me out
Or leave me dry

Even walking alone
I'm not worried
I feel your arms all around me
In the air on the streets of the city
Feels like I am free
It's got me thinking

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
May you stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America

Even with you Iâ€™ve got no one to lose
So you'd better believe
That nobody can make me feel lonely
Because I hear sweetest melodies
Even when you talk that talk
With the lights on
I still somehow know that
I'll never feel, never feel lonely
I have no fear
It's got me thinking

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful people in it
May you stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America
And all the beautiful people in it

And all the beautiful people in it
