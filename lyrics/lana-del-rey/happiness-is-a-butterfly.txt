Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer


Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said: Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

Baby, I just wanna dance (dance)
With you (dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (dance)
With you

Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah

Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said: Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

Baby, I just wanna dance (dance)
With you (dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (dance)
With you
