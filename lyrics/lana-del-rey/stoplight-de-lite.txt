I had a man; he was sweet as pie
I met him as I walked right by him
He said: Baby you so fine that when you walk
Even the stoplights stop to talk about you
I saw you and I had to make you mine
Cause you ultimately the most fine
You know a man like me
Gotta have a woman that's killer
She's got a be killer, killer, killer, baby


Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face

The way you talk, well, you make me smile
And I'm lookin' down cause I'm kinda shy
You know you're so fine that when you talk
Even the roses get up to walk to you
You're crazy but I knew that at the time
I just cannot resist your golden grill
And your stupid pickup line

Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face

There's something about you when you say
Come on, come on with me babe
And I don't know why but I know
Wherever you go, I'm gonna follow

Fly body, don't mean a thing
Fly body, don't mean a thing
Fly body, dope in the face

You're gonna be the, you're gonna be the
You're gonna be the death of me
(Yes you are, you are)

You so fly, you so dope, babe
You so fly, you so dope, babe

Fly like a bird
