A-M-E-R-I-C-A
Come when you call me


Just say you want another one
Just like the silence of the night

I do whatever I want
You can do whatever you
This is like I always wanted
Just like I always knew

Ridin' right down, back
How you know I like
Hand to hand, gun to gun
Now we're gonna have some fun

Come when you call me
Just say you want another one
Just like the silence of the night

Ridin' right down
How you know I like

I know what you've been looking for
I think I've got a lot and more
I think I know what you've been trying to say
Everybody wants a little yeah

Come when you call me
That's why I want to know why
Just like the silence of the night

A-M-E-R-I-C-A

I do whatever I want
You can do whatever you
This is like I always wanted
Just like I always knew

Tell me your story daddy
Come when you call me

A-M-E-R-I-C-A

You can say whatever you wanna say about me (A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
Stay in your room, get in your bed
Maybe then you get me inside your head
Tell me your story daddy
