Hey blue baby, put that Hank Williams on
It's your little blue baby calling for her favorite song
Get off that whiskey, boy
Right quickly put them hallway lights on
I hope one day you can remember
I loved you while it all went wrong


Well the only stars we saw were in the sky on the boulevard
And the only thing we wanted was to be free
And the only girl you had eyes for
Played downtown at the local bar
That was me
She was me

Hey blue baby, get that old pick-up gone
Turn it once, twice, three times if you love me 
Get on that dirt-bike
Handle that turn-pike
Do what you have to do
Just know your baby's right here waiting
Just know she thinks you're really cool

And the only stars we saw were in the sky on the boulevard
And the only thing we needed is to be free
And the only girl you had eyes for
Played downtown at the local bar
That was me
She was me

I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of waiting, tired of crying
Tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of yelling, tired of hollering
You're making me blue, you're making me blue
You're making me blue
Just do what you do

The only stars we need are in the sky on the boulevard
And the only thing we want is to be free
And the only girl you had eyes for
Played downtown at the local bar
Yeah, she's me
Yeah, she's me
