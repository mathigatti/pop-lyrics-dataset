I'm the other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
You you, la la la
You you, la la la


Who else knows you're not a stand up guy?
Trouble in paradise, they can see it in your eyes
Living double lives, yeah your living double lives
He says he loves me, I don't believe him
If I'm so angry, why don't I leave him?
But he knows that I, I really need him
I'm tired of being, tired of being

The other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman

Chase that high, chase that high
Is there nothing that will satisfy?
There's trouble inside your mind
And you're desperate for the fire
Addicted to surprise, addicted to the lies

He says he wants me, why can't I see him?
Only at late nights, not on the weekend
I know it's tough but, I know his girlfriend
I'm tired of hearing, hearing he's leaving

That other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman

At the supermarket, waiting in line
Hair done, nails on, gold design
She walks up and whispered from behind
Everyone knows your little secret

I'm the other woman
Everyone's bridesmaid, nobody's bride
Everyone's mistress, nobody's wife
But we knew when you moved
That you were the troubled type
You the kinda girl who, you the kinda girls

That other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
