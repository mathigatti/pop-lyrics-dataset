The greatest lie in history
Baby, it’s not you, it’s me
What you think I’m dumb, dumb babydoll?
I’m big enough and bad enough
And I can tell when things get rough
Now nothing that you say can break my fall


Oh-oh-oh-oh
Stop right there
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you really care
Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough baby
I don’t wanna hear you saying it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re gone with the dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby you said it all
There’s nothing you say can break my fall

Greatest lie in history
Baby it’s not you, it’s me
Do you really think I’ll buy your bullshit, boy?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Give a girl her self respect
You haven’t gone and hurt me yet
But you know that I’ll crumble if you call

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Stop right there
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you really care

Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough, baby
I don’t wanna hear you saying it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re gone with the dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby, you said it all
There’s nothing you say can break my fall
Break my fall

I’m not gonna let you become a martyr
I’m not gonna let you pickup the gun
I’m gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won’t make it easy for you to run
I’m not gonna let you become a martyr
I’m not gonna let you ṗickup the gun
I’m gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won’t make it easy for you to run

Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough, baby
I don’t wanna hear you saying it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re gone with the dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby, you said it all
There’s nothing you say can break my fall

Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough, baby
I don’t wanna hear you saying it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s good in my hands, you should let me know
If you’re gone with the dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby, you said it all
There’s nothing you say can break my fall
