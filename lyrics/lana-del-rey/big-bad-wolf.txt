I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn’t any good
I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn’t any good


I’ll take the wrong path
I think I’ll go a little off track
And now there’s no way back
You took all the apples that I had
But I heart you and I wanna be your girl
I heart you and I know you’ll rock my world
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
(I told you not to go into the woods)

Big, bad, naughty rock star
Your claws are shining bright in the dark
Lifting up my little red skirt
I know you’ll leave me here in the dirt
But I heart you, and I wanna be your girl
I heart you, so come back and rock my world!
Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
(I told you not to go into the woods)

Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play, just for fun, just for fun
Yeah, we take nothing seriously, nothing’s wrong, make me run, all night long
Hide and seek is how you play with me
Oh, you’re tempting me, just for fun, just for fun
I hear you calling me over city streets, through the trees, mess with me, then you’ll leave
Oh, be still my heart, escaping in your cherry red car

‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
