I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like: Maybe  I'll do it differently


So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby‚ wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly

(Fuck it, I love you) I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
(Fuck it, I love you) it turns out everywhere you go you take yourself, that's not a lie
(Fuck it, I love you) wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
(I really do) it’s killing me slowly

(Fuck it, I love you) California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you) drugs is in my vein, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you) California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do) Drugs is in my vein, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you) California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you) drugs is in my vein, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you) California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do) drugs is in my vein, running out of time

I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis's last stop before Kokomo

Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

And I'm wasted
Don't leave‚ I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all

I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends‚ we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When, baby, I was doing nothing the most of all

The culture is lit and if this is it, I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

I'm wasted
Don't leave‚ I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
But guess that I'm burned out after all

If this is it, I'm signing off
Miss doing nothing, the most of all
Hawaii just missed a fireball
LA is in flames‚ it's getting hot
Kanye West is blond and gone
Life on Mars ain't just a song
Oh, the livestream's almost on
