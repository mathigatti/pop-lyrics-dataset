Everything I want, I have
Money, notoriety and rivieras
I even think I found God
In the flash bulbs of the pretty cameras
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras
Am I glamorous?
Tell me, am I glamorous?


Hello, hello
C-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you want to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope
Your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful
They all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights
Mean nothing without you

Summertime is nice and hot
And my life is sweet like vanilla is
Gold and silver lined my heart
But burned into my brain these stolen images
Stolen images, baby, stolen images
Can you picture it, babe
That life we could've lived?

Hello, hello
C-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope
Your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful
They all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights
Mean nothing without you

We were two kids, just tryin' to get out
Lived on the dark side of the American dream
We would dance all night, play our music loud
When we grew up, nothing was what it seemed

Hello, hello
C-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope
Your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful
They think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights
Mean nothing without you

Hello, hello
C-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope
Your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful
They think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights
Mean nothing without you

All my dreams and all the lights
Mean nothing if I can't have you
