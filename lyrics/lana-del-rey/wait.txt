Wait a little longer kid
What you wanna grow up so fast for? Why you doin' like I did?
Didn't you say I got what I asked for?


But you're afraid to find out like me and climb out
But you're always close to me
You got a different story
It's the same damn thing
Got a long way
Rest your feet
I know you can do anything

You are such a handsome boy
Don't you give up your glory
Why you wanna hit them streets?
Didn't you never hear my story?

And it's fine to waste time
But you've got a beautiful mind
And you're always close to me
You're a different kid
But it's the same damn thing
And it's a long way,
You better rest your feet
I know that you want everything
That's what you told me

I still believe you
I still see it's true
I need you
And I know you, dear
But if you've gotta make it
Then I can take it from here

Wait a little longer kid
Didn't I never say I would miss you?
Don't go until I come home
Please don't go until I kiss you
And it's hard to grow up
But we all know it's tough

Yeah, you're always close to me
You'll have a different story
It's the same damn thing
You got a long way,
Come on, rest your feet
I know you can do anything
