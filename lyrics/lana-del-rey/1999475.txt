You said I was the most exotic flower
Hold me tight in our final hour


I don't know how you convince them and get them, but
I don't know what you do, it's unbelievable
I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready, to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up, and brilliant
Look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

You've got the world, but baby at what price?
Something so strange, hard to define

It isn't that hard boy, to like you or love you
I'd follow you down, down, down
You're unbelievable
If you're going crazy just grab me, take me
I would follow you down, down, down, anywhere, anywhere

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready, to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up, and brilliant
Look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready, to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up, and brilliant
Look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

I don't know
You're screwed up, and brilliant
Look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?
