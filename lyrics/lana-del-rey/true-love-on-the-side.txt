I only put you down cause I want you so much
I only put you in a box, cause you’re giving me a head rush
I only want your love, I want your love, want your love
I’m a lion in a party dress, I won’t stop until I get the best
Yeah-yea-yea-yeah


Everybody knows they call me broken baby
Everyone wants your love on the side,
(Love on the side, love on the side)
Everybody knows that I’m a trouble baby
One of these come from the white trash sun
(White trash sun, white trash sun)
I’m everything you want but it’s hard to decide,
'Cause everybody wants true love on the side
(Love on the side, love on the side)

I only put you down cause I want you so much
I only put you in a box, cause you’re giving me a head rush
I only want your love, I want your love, want your love
I’m a lion in a party dress, I won’t stop until I get the best
Yeah-yea-yea-yeah

Everybody knows they call me broken baby
Everyone wants your love on the side,
(Love on the side, love on the side)
Everybody knows I’m american baby
Everyone wants your love on the side,
(Love on the side, love on the side)
I’m everything you want but it’s hard to decide,
'Cause everybody wants true love on the side
(Love on the side, love on the side)
Yeah-yea-yea-yeah
