I like ‘em bad-bad, baby, you could be the one
And if you wanna get trashed and have fun
Throw me holy in the sky like a pizza pie
(Are you crazy?)


You take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right
Throw it in the air and whoop like dynamite
Throw me in the sky like a pizza pie

You know I like ‘em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy
You know I like ‘em bad boy, like you
(Like you, you know what I do)

I like a man who can’t kick it
So come around and hit me, oh
No other man can hit me like you
(Like you, you know what I do)

Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
But I’m not gonna do it, baby
No way

Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Only shout a little, but you give me more
We are, we are, we are
Behind closed doors
(No one can see us)
(I know you like me)

I see my best friends kissin', touchin' all the time
But I don't need no jet
To ride it in the sky
See it in his eyes
I'm his cherry pie

You know I like 'em bad, boy
They think you make me sad, boy, oh
The best l ever had, boy
It's you
(Like you, you know what I do)

I want a man that's hot, yeah
To come around and rock me, yeah
No one can dirty talk me, like you
(Like you, you know what I do)

Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
But I’m not gonna do it, baby
No way

Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Only shout a little, but you give me more
We are, we are, we are
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

Everybody's at the park tonight
Everbody's at the store
Everybody's on the street tonight
What the hell would we do that for?

Everybody's at the park tonight
But we got fireworks galore
Behind close doors
Behind close doors

Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
But I’m not gonna do it, baby
No way

Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Only shout a little, but you give me more
We are, we are, we are
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
