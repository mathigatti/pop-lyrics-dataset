I be BBMing you, telling you
All the things I'm gonna do to you
When you get home, baby
Making up, then yellin' oo
Nothing I would rather do
Then flirtin', talkin' dirty
You love me, hate me


It's like it's your job to work me up
Treating me nice and then treating me rough
And I don't know why but I can't get enough
I like it, I like it

I know that I'm making you nuts
Middle of night and when I'm waking up
I don't know why but you can't get enough
You like it, you like it

Be my BBM baby
Middle of the night
Waking up to write
Be my BBM baby
I don't want to fight
You're the one I like

Yeah, yeah, always on my mind
Yeah, yeah, when will you be mine?

I be BBMing you, letting you
Love me in your letters oo
The way that you write is crazy
Your typing is poetical
Red roses in your message, oh
I think I met my match in you
Text me chase me

It's like it's your job to work me up
Treating me nice and then treating me rough
And I don't know why but I can't get enough
I like it, I like it

He signs XO, hugs, hey
I know it's true love cause my heart goes yay

Be my BBM baby
Middle of the night
Waking up to write
Be my BBM baby

Yeah, yeah, when will you be mine?

He signs XO, hugs, hey

'Cause my heart goes yay
He signs XX, kiss, babe

In the middle of the night
He writes that he's outside
I left my window open, baby
You can come inside
Call me when you get here
I'll be ready, boy
'Cause I heart you
You're the one I adore
