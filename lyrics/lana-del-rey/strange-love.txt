Hey, stranger
My strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you’re dreaming of?
Hey, stranger
My strange love
What makes you shy?
What makes you fall in love?


It’s strange the way we met
A desert road and then
My car had stopped and you pulled up
On your black motorcycle

You rode me to the bar
We danced all night under
The Christmas lights in the dark black night
With the lightning and the thunder

Hey, stranger
My strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you’re dreaming of?
Hey, stranger
My strange love
What makes you shy?
What makes you fall in love?

You took me to the edge
A town, that’s where you slept
You like it best when no one else
Could find you or could bother

You poured us mint juleps
And kissed me on the lips
You held me tight in the TV light
And you said you never loved her

You have a dark heart, like mine
Things that you’ve seen and dark time
Let me love you, let me touch you
Let me show you you’ll be fine

Hey, stranger
My strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you’re dreaming of?
Hey, stranger
My strange love
What makes you shy?
What makes you fall in love?
