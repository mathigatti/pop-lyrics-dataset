What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost tall, tan like milk and honey
You're very brave and you're very free


So swing it high, cherry blossom
On your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Swing it high like Jesus, baby

Little ghost so fair like lemonade tea
Swing it high like Jesus, wild and free
Dandelions in your head, baby
You're very brave and there's much to see

I push you high, cherry blossom
On your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

And when you're scared, I'll be right here
You feel afraid, hold me and stay
It's a cruel, cruel world
But we don't care
Cause what we've got, we've got to share

What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost, blonde hair with lemonade tea
There's much to learn and so much to see
I push you high, and you lean on
On your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
