You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you


And anywhere you go, I'll will follow
Even if it's only in spirit baby
But honey you should go, by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

Leave while you still can
Before I take you down
Take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now
Get out now

You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you

And anywhere you go, I'll will follow
Even if it's only in spirit baby
But honey you should go, by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, get out now
