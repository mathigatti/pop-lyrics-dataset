You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my
I love you but I don’t know why


You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

He had a cigarette with his number on it
He gave it over to me: Do you want it?
I knew it was wrong but I palmed it
I saved it, I waited, I called it
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on your lips makes you dangerous
I knew it was wrong, I’m beyond it
I tried to be strong but I lost it

You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

He has a white Corvette like I want it
A fire in his eyes, no, I saw it
He’s bleeding from his brain and his wallet
He’s sick and he’s taken but honest
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on his lips I just can’t resist
As close as I’ll get to the darkness
He tells me to: Shut up, I got this

You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

I need you, I need you babe
Like I never needed anyone
You’re wrong but you’re so much fun
You say you treat 'em mean to keep 'em keen, you're not that nice

But you taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop
