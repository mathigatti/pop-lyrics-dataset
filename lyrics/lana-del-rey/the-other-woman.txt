The other woman
Has time to manicure her nails
The other woman
Is perfect where her rival fails
And she’s never seen with pin curls
In her hair, anywhere


The other woman
Enchantes her clothes with french perfume
The other woman
Keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys thats scattered everywhere

And when her man comes to call
Hell find her waiting like a lonesome queen
‘Cause to be by her side
It’s such a change from old routine

The other woman
Will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman
Will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by
The other woman
Will spend her life alone
Alone

Alone
