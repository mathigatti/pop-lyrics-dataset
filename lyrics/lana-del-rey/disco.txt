Disco gogo dancer so rare
Move down &amp; up slow n' prostitute stare
I do what I like I just don't care


I am my only God I am my only God
I am my only God
Now

Black eyes short dress lets break it down
You shoot and I pose polaroid frown
I'll do what you like I wont make a sound

I am my only God I am my only God
I am my only God
Now

Icon young star heroin fiend
Just sit n' I'll sing I'll be yr queen
You know how I like that celebrity type
Poor me

I am my only God I am my only God
I am my only God
Now
