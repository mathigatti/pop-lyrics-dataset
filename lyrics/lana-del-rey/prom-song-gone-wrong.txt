Boy, it’s late, walk me home
Put your hand in mine
At the gates, stop and say
Be my Valentine


You are by far the brightest star
I’ve ever seen
And I never dreamed
I’d be so happy that I could die

Used to say that I was beautiful
Like Cleopatra
But you the king too so I would say
Back at’cha!

I flip my hair and make you stare
And put my makeup on
And make up stories ‘bout my life
And put on Very Cherry Bomb

And even then I knew that we were
Something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts
Of Radio Two serials

I’d see you in the hall like
Hello, hello
Up against the wall like
Let’s go, let’s go!

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing till dawn, staying forever young
Let’s get out of this place
‘Cause you’re starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don’t get me out of this place
Now, baby, I’m not crazy
I’m leaving, are you coming with me?

If you’re lonely, baby, hold me
You’re my only one
Watching television, kissin’
Till we see the sun

So far, we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I’d be the queen
And I’d be so happy that I could die

You used to call yourself The Don
And me Queen Diana
You always make me blush I say
Shut up, boy, you bananas

You pull my hair and push me down
And chase me, make me run
You play me Biggie Smalls
And then my first Nirvana song

So even then when no one’s friends
Were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way
You looked in second period

I’d see you in the hall like
Hello, hello
Up against the wall like
Let’s go, let’s go!

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing till dawn, staying forever young
Let’s get out of this place
‘Cause you’re starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don’t get me out of this place
Now, baby, I’m not crazy
I’m leaving, are you coming with me?

I know that they say
That all I want is to have fun
And get away for rainy days

I know that they think I’ve come undone
But I’m in love
I wanna run, run, run away

I’m leaving, are you coming with me?

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing till dawn, staying forever young
Let’s get out of this place
‘Cause you’re starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don’t get me out of this place
Now, baby, I’m not crazy
I’m leaving, are you coming with me?
