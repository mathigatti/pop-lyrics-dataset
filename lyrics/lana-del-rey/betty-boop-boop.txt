Yes, I can make you that cherry pie
You can call me liberty
I'm your number one girl
You give me everything, I'm gonna save the world


Oh how I like the way you say my name
Do you like the way I say yours too?
Okay, you like the games I play
Roller coaster, Coca-cola
Crystal methamphetamine

You can call me liberty
I'm your number one girl
You give me everything
I'm gonna save the world
