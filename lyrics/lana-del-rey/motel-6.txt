Motel six, sloe gin fizz
Swingin' in the lobby
To the sunset twist
I can do it, you can do it
Move them hips
Everybody, let's get dangerous

Fellas, if you wanna
Get the invite quicker
Pack up the pick up
Pick up the liquor
Go on use your charm
Right, come on gonna get her
Gonna tell you

Ladies if you really
Wanna reign them suckers
Line up your lips
Plump up your pluckers
It's about the only way
To get them other fuckers
What to do, what you want?

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

Baby, if you really
Wanna know my secret
Come a little closer
Kitty, promise you'll keep it
Come a little nearer, dear
You gonna need it
Gonna tell you

Men like a woman
Who just don't need 'em
Sweeter than cherry pie
But we'll treat 'em
Meaner than dirt
They deserve to be hurt
Do they realise what
You're worth?

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

Baby, we can go down
To seven-eleven
Drive down the drag in
Your pontiac heaven
Baby, you can buy me
Diet mountain dew
And we'll get right down to it
Me and you

Layin' on your hood
Like a flatbed truck
In the spotlight we see
Jim and Chuck
We saw that car from a mile
Away and it's slowin'
They say there's a motel dance
Let's get going

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-come on

Motel six, sloe gin fizz
Swingin' in the lobby
To the sunset twist
I can do it, you can do it
Move them hips
Everybody, let's get dangerous
