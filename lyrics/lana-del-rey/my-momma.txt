My momma wouldn’t say you were a nice guy
But you’re under 40 and you have a job
My momma wouldn’t say you was a good boy
But you’re making money
And you’re working hard so
I’m gonna take you out
I don’t feel like it’s wrong
Me and my momma, we don’t get along


My momma she would tell your hair was too long
But your hair exactly’s what I like the best
And my momma sure would tell you was a
But I don’t know that
And you don’t pass the test
I’m gonna take you out
I don’t feel like it’s wrong
Me and my momma, we don’t get along

Oh, baby, I’m standing so close, I can’t back down
You’re smiling and I know I’m over and done now
I am done now

My momma say that it was wrong to see you
I lie just to meet you, I lie to get in
My momma sure would say that I, you
But that’s the only way I knew how to begin

So maybe you got your own problems
Who doesn’t?
I’m crazy, you’re addicted, we’re all of a sudden

My momma she would love you like I love you
If she ever met you, if she ever knew
My momma sure would fall right on top of you
If she’d ever saw you, she’d be smitten too
I’ll never take you home, I want you all for my own
Don’t let my momma hear your pretty song
I’m gonna take you out
I don’t feel like it’s wrong
Me and my momma, we don’t get along
