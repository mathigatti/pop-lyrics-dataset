Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah


Walking is an art
So is my body
Papi is a workaholic
I'm his little party

I'm miss parlor-tricks
Sips above the cardi
I can make you dope, sick
From the naughtiness

He says who's the best?
You is

I'm glamorous! Famous!
Notorious! Dangerous!
But you're crazy!
(Ah) I'm gonna leave you
He said you're not a real girl
You're like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck
Good luck!
May all the stars in the sky
Bow down to you
We're through

You gotta be smart
And I'm a little smarty
Papi is a gangsta
I'm his little dolly

Party favour favourite
Of them all he says
Baby dolly's so sick
Sick off your naughtiness

Let's go to vegas
He say who's the best?
He said she is, she is
But, yo, she crazy like in
Every single way

Like a hurricane
You gotta get out of the way
But she's hot, and she's cold
And she's cool and she's golden
She's full of rage like me
And I like the game, yo

'Cause I'm glamorous! I'm famous!
Notorious! Dangerous!
But I'm crazy, yo
Glamorous! Dangerous!
Notorious! But famous!
But I'm crazy

He's gonna leave me
He wants a real girl
I'm like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck
He said we're through
