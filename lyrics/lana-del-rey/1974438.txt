Rai-, rai-
(Rai-, rai-, rai-, raise me up)
(Rai-, rai-, rai-, raise me up)
(I don't have to talk)
(Rai-, raise me up, rai-, raise)


Just like you said, it's all been done before
I don't have to talk pretty for them no more
It's like you said, it's all been done before
I don't have to talk pretty for them no more

I can talk what I want how I wanna
I can talk what I want how I wanna
I can talk what I want how I wanna
I don't have to talk taste for your mama
No, no, no, say no-oh, oh

Rai-rai-rai-raise me up
Rai-rai-rai-raise me up
Rai-raise me up, rai-raise

It's the voodoo Mississippi south
Sixty-nine million stars
Birds are flyin' out of my mouth
Spirits creepin' in my yard

Hold my head, it's tiltin' back
Something dancin' me around
Puttin' crystals on my neck
Liftin' my feet off the ground, the ground

Rai-rai-rai-raise me up
Rai-rai-rai-raise me up
Rai-raise me up
Rai-raise me up, me up

Oh, see? Look what you done now
Oh, me, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Oh, me, look what you done now
Oh, me, it's what I'm talkin' 'bout
It's what I'm talkin' 'bout
It's what I'm talkin' about

Pick me up in a pick-up truck
Roll it down, you got it going on
Let me talk on your C.B., what?
Let me play with your new shotgun, shotgun

Rai-rai-rai-raise me up
Rai-rai-rai-raise me up
Rai-raise me up
Rai-raise me up

Rai-rai-rai-raise me up
Rai-rai-rai-raise me up
(Shot)
Rai-raise me up
(Shot)
Rai-raise me up
(Shotgun)

Rai-rai-rai-raise me up
(Shot)

I can talk what I want how I wanna
I can talk what I want how I wanna
I can talk what I want how I wanna
(Rai-rai-rai-raise me up)
I don't have to talk taste for your mama, no
(Rai-rai-rai-raise me up)

Rai-rai-rai-raise me up
Rai-rai-rai-raise me up
