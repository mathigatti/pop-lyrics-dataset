Is the sun in your eyes, easy rider?
Do the flame colored skies light your fire?
We are heavy metal lions
They will never understand
The kind of people you and I am
Bow your heads and take your hands


They were angels forever
Forever angels
They were angels forever
Forever angels

Does the ocean inspire you, easy rider?
Do the stars and the wind take you higher?
You are California proud
You are angels of the night
Rock n' Roll guardians now
The last keepers of the light

They were angels forever
Forever angels
They were angels forever
Forever angels

Paradise is a hell colored flame sky
Is it nice to feel free and wild?
Paradise is the game of the do or die
I just ride

They were angels forever
Forever angels
They were angels forever
Forever angels

They were angels forever
Forever angels
They were angels forever
Forever angels
