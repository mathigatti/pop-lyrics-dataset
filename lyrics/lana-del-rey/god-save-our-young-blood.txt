Damn, look at the sunrise
Glowing finish line, made it in record time
Hey, baby, we made it
My head's faded, headlights dilated


Spinnin'
Spinnin' and I can't sit still
Spinnin'
Spinnin' and we can't sit still

Baptized in blue skies
Roll the window down, reach out, feel around for new life
Damn, you and those green eyes
We can never stop movin', we see nothin' but the green lights

Spinnin'
Spinnin' and we can't sit still
Spinnin'
Spinnin' and we can't sit still

God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Hot pavement, hot pavement, hot wheels in the sun
God save our young blood
God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Warm waves, warm waves on the coast where we love
God save our young blood

Climbed up the tree of life, kicked out of paradise
Living good, doing evil is the toss of the dice
Couple of wild eyes, cup full of high life
She's an angel and a devil of her own device

She's got me spinnin' (spinnin')
Spinnin' and I can't sit still (you know I can't sit still)
Oh, spinnin'
Spinnin' and we can't sit still

God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Hot pavement, hot pavement, hot wheels in the sun
God save our young blood
God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Warm waves, warm waves, on the coast where we love
God save our young blood

God save the ocean, God save the breeze
Save the words from my lips, save the birds, save the bees
Baby save me one last sip while you strip on the beach
I'll save you in the waves if you swim too deep
God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young blood

God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Hot pavement, hot pavement, hot wheels in the sun
God save our young blood
God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Warm waves, warm waves, on the coast where we love
God save our young blood

On the coast where we love
God save our young blood
On the coast where we love
God save our young blood
