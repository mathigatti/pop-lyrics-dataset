Met you in front of the diner and you had blue hair
You were so nice
You were ? but you were all there
You were alright
So many people say you have it together
But i think you’re a nice guy
And i think we could be birds of a feather


Met you in front of the diner and you were so sweet
Made my heart beat
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my
I met you with your mother and she had green shoes
She was so cool
It was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
So many people say you have it together
But i think you’re a nice guy
And i think we could be birds of a feather
Oh feather, oh, birds

You were sorting pictures and you gave me one
Of a nun who was playing the drums
She was crazy her name was katie
I think you’re so fun
So many people say you have it together
But i think you’re a nice guy
And i think we could be birds of a feather

You don’t think i’m that strange, you’re so weird
That’s cause you’re so queer
But who’s not these days
You wear purple socks and you still like purple haze
So many people say you have it together
But they don’t see you crying in the shower
Bet i can make you better
Cause you make me better
Now you make me better,
Yeah you make me better
