Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright, bright as ever
The red is strong, the blue is pure
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time


Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
I think about you often, often
I won't forget the things we did
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

It's funny, but it's true
And it's true, but it's not funny
Time comes and goes
All of the while I still think of you
Some things last a long time

Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright, bright as ever
The things we did, I can't forget
Some things last a lifetime
Some things last a lifetime
Some things last a lifetime
