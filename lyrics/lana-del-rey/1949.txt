Carry me up them stairs, put my white socks on
And my pretty song, you like my blue nail polish
What is all this? You said: The Miss Upstairs, don't be scared


Daddy dearest, you know how I like to take trips
Pops for stop at the K-mart, buy me my peach lipgloss
Cigarettes and lolipops, Mad magazines, the white socks
All in your car for our trip across the USA

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
It's a motel flower nation, day and night on our last vacation
We're gonna see it all before we say goodbye

Dad likes blackpool, pleasure beach and roadstops
Baby there's a swizz up souvenir giftshop
Late night, midnight, radio show talks
Daddy, baby, big jail break

Ponytail and lolipops
Dinerettes and sodapops
New blue bathing suite
Ruched tops and cadillacs
Lake car to dance
Hop skotch, shit talk
Alabama hard knocks
Motel dresslocks

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac year from July to July
It's a motel flower nation, daylight on our last vacation
We're gonna see it all before you says goodbye
