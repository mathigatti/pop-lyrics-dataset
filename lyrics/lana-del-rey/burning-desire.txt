Every saturday night I get dressed up
To ride for you, baby
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine
For you, baby


I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push you to the limits 'cause I just don't care
You ask me where I've been
I've been everywhere
But I don't wanna be nowhere but here
(Come on, tell me, boy)

I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on tell me, boy)

I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push you to the limits 'cause I just don't care

I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on tell me, boy)

Every saturday night I seem to come alive
For you, baby
Santa Monica, I'm racing in the lights
For you, baby

I drive fast, radio blast
Have to touch myself to pretend you're there
Your hands are on my hips
Your name is on my lips
Over, over again like my only prayer
(Come on tell me, boy)

I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on, tell me, boy)

I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push you to the limits 'cause I just don't care

I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on, tell me, boy)

I'm driving fast, flash
Everyone knows it
I'm try'na get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it

I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on, tell me, boy)

I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push you to the limits 'cause I just don't care

I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on, tell me, boy)
