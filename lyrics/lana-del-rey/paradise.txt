Ooh, ooh-ooh, what?
Ooh, ooh-ooh, that's dope
Ooh, ooh-ooh, what?
Ooh, ooh-ooh


Love you like I never loved anyone
Keep me burning hot like the red red Sun
Want you like I never wanted anyone
You give it to me fast like free and fun

Everytime with you
Feels like I'm in summer
I don't know why
Maybe 'cause you're so cool
And keep it down on the real
Like sugar, sugar, fly

Oh, you're sweet like sugar cane
Make me feel alive again

I'm goin' down, down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
Lo, love, lick you like
Vanilla ice, (pack you up)
(And make you crazy)

Shot, hot, give me what you got
You can ride my hot supersonic rod
Goin' down, down, take you
Down to paradise

Want you like I've never wanted anyone
Got a face like God and a bod' like John
Kiss you like I never kissed anyone
Guess you'll keep it really rough like oh my God

Everytime with you
I can tell it's forever
I don't know how
And even if it's not
You know I couldn't stop
You make my heart go pow

Coming down like pouring rain
Make me feel alive again

I'm goin' down, down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
Lo, love, lick you like
Vanilla ice, (pack you up)
(And make you crazy)

(Shot, shot, shot, shot)
Shot, hot, give me what you got
You can ride my hot supersonic rod
Goin' down, down, take you
Down to paradise

How do you like that, baby?

(Down, down, take you down to paradise)
(Down, down, take you down to paradise)
(Down, down, take you down to paradise)

Ooh, ooh-ooh, dope!
Ooh, ooh-ooh, that's sick!
Ooh, ooh-ooh, dope!
Ooh, ooh-ooh, that's sick!

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Shot, hot, give me what you got
You can ride my hot supersonic rod

I'm goin' down, down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
Lo, love, lick you like
Vanilla ice, (pack you up)
(And make you crazy)

Shot, hot, give me what you got
You can ride my hot supersonic plot
Goin' down, down, take you
Down to paradise
