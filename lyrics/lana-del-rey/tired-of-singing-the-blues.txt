You know sometimes I think God
Is playing a little game with me
Looking down from heaven, laughing
Tryina see how much I can take
Because the way things go, it's like a joke
Nobody's had more shots at the moon
And missed than me


It's like I got my life stuck, stuck on rewind
Trying to makes something of myself
Life's got something else in mind
I'm fighting a losing game and I'm biding my time
You won't be my man, do I understand?
No, stop
I don't want to hear another word
About your 'why not's'
I bought your bullshit it all before
Now you trying to sell me more, babe

Man who makes a beast out of himself
Got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago
Nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

I'm walking down the streets
You wouldn't know what I was thinking
It's just another white girl day, hey
Ribbons in my hair, and I am sinking down
A double life, a sordid past, and I am drinking now
I want to be bad
You say you were glad to see me shut up
I don't want to know another thing
You think you know about me
I'm not who you think I am
Smiling but I ain't happy

Man who makes a beast out of himself
Got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago
Nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

Oh, my soul forgot
I can't turn off my mind
It's like a ticking time bomb
Trying to kill me from inside
I mean day and night
Is there no remedy for memory?

I've felt this way before
I've known the depths of all thatdesperation
My boyfriend says I'm like an old movie star
With loneliness as my occupation
I know that he's right but I don't care tonight
I want to be bad, I want to be bad
I can't stop
I keep running around the same town
Knocking you down, I'm fucked
How can I get out when there's nowhere
To go for miles around?

Man who makes a beast out of himself
Got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago
Nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired
