I always  said to you 
lie is the beginning of the end
But you not heard me 
Now my dear , it's the time 
Time of you suffer
Yeah , you will suffer !


I thought of was different of others 
but you showed not
you did alls same things like him 
now , you're like  him 
you're my ex , like him

I thought you loved me 
But you showed not
You cried when I broke up with you 
But now , you should still be cheering for yours girls
You're losing me ..
You're lost me , idiot
