I was watching
with one eye on the other side
I had fifteen people telling me to move
I got moving on my mind
I found shelter
In some thoughts turning wheels around
I said 39 times that I love you
to the beauty I had found


[Chorous]
Well it's 1 2 3 4
take the elevator
at the hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
all they got inside is vacancy

I been thinking
of a little place down by the lake
they got a dirty little road leading up to the house
I wonder how long it will take till we're alone
sitting on the front porch of that home
stomping our feet on the wooden boards
never gonna worry about locking the door

And is 1 2 3 4
take the elevator
at the hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
all they got inside is vacancy

It might sound silly
for me to think childish thoughts like these
but i'm so tired of acting tough
and i'm gonna to what i please
lets get married
in a big cathedral by a priest
cause if i'm the man that you love the most
you could say i do at least

Well its 1 2 3 4
take the elevator
at the hotel yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
all they got inside is vacancy

And its 4 5 6 7 grab your umbrella
grab hold of me
cause I'm your favorite fella
all they got inside is vacancy
