Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too but there's
Just so much that I don't know about you


Jack give me some money to pay my bills
All the dough I give you Holly
You been using on a pain pills
Jack will you call me if you're able?
I got your phone number written
In the back of my bible

Jack I think your pulling my leg
And I think maybe I better ask Meg
Meg do you think Jack really loves me?

You know, I don't care cause
Jack really bugs me
Why don't you ask him now?
Well I would but Meg
I really just don't know how

Just say 'Jack , do you adore me?'
Well I would Holly but love really bores me
Then i guess we should just be friends
I'm just kidding Holly
You know that I'll love you until the end

Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too but there's
Just so much that I don't know about you

Holly give me some of your English love
If I did that Jack I'd have one in the oven
Why don't you go off and love yourself
If I did that Holly there won't be anything
Left for anybody else

Jack it's too bad about the way that you look
You know I gave that horse a carrot
So he break your foot
Will the two of you cut it out
And tell them what it's really all about

Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too but there's
Just so much that I don't know about you
