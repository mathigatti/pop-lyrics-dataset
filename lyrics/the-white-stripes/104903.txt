When problems overwhelm us
And sadness smothers us
Where do we find the will and the courage to continue?
Well, the answer may come in the carrying voice of a friend
A chance encounter with a book
Or from a personal faith
For janette help came from her faith
But it also came from a squirrel


Shortly after her divorce
Janette lost her father
Then she lost her job
She had mounthing money problems
But Janette not only survived
She worked her way out of despondency and now she says

"Life is good again"
How could this happen?
She told me that late one autumn day when she was at her lowest
She watched a squirrel storing up nuts for the winter
One at a time he would take them to the nest
And she thought, "If that squirrel can take care
of himself with the harsh winter coming on
So can I
Once I broke my problems into small pieces
I was able to carry them
Just like those acorns
One at a time"

Jack White:
Take all your problems
And rip 'em apart
Carry them off
In a shopping cart

And another thing
You should've known from the start
The problems in hand
Are lighter than at heart

Be like the squirrel, girl
Be like the squirrel
Give it a whirl, girl
Be like the squirrel

And another thing
You have to know in this world
Cut up your hair
Straighten your curls

Well, your problems
Hide in your curls
