Little Cream Soda 


Well every highway that I go down 
Seems to be longer than the last one i knew about 
Oh Well 


And every girl that I walk around 
Seems to be more of an illusion than the last one that I found 
Oh Well 

And this old man in front of me 
Holding canes and ruby rings 
Is like containing an explosion when he sings 
But with every chance to set himself on fire 
He just ends up doing the same thing 

Well every beautiful think i come across 
Tells me to stop moving and shake this riddle off 
Oh Well 

And there was a time when all I wanted was my 
Ice cream colder, and a little cream soad 
Oh Well, Oh Well 

And a wooden box, and an alley full of rocks 
was all i had to care about 
Oh Well, Oh Well, Oh Well 

But now my mind is filled with rubber tires 
and forest fires 
an whether i'm a liar 
and lots of other situations where I don't know 
what to do at which time god screams to me 
"there's nothing left for me to tell you" 

Oh Well, Oh Well, Oh Well
