I took my girl to go bowling downtown at the red door
After an argument I started
Cause I thought she didn't like me anymore
I can't help it sometimes I feel pitiful
And of course she's so young and beautiful


I bought us two glasses of coke
That's her favorite and I wanted to make up for earlier
But I dropped her glass and it broke
So I just gave my glass to her

She laughed and so did I in our lane
And then she went to a vending machine
To buy a candy cane
But right next to that was a boy I knew
With a spring in his hand
Playing a country pinball machine
Called 'stand by your man'
I saw him talk to her
But I stayed in my lane
And played my game steady
And was thinking of a day
When I'd be too old to throw a ball this heavy

But I guess I'm young now
So it's easier to knock 'em all down
Then I looked and saw her say to him
'You're really hittin' that ball around'
And he's lookin' at her the way I did
When I first met her
I could see in his face
White flowers
And cups of coffee
And love letters

I was sorry to interrupt their game
But I went and did it anyway
I dropped my red bowling ball
Through the glass of his machine
I said 'are you quick enough to hit this ball, mr. Clean?'
I was scared to lose her
So I couldn't help being mean

And that ended both of our games
I said I was sorry
But my girl left with him just the same
I thought how much I hate when love makes me act this way
I was bent over a broken pinball machine
In a bowling alley and I threw it all away

Well, isn't it all just a big game?
