I saw you standing in the corner
On the edge of a burning light
I saw you standing in the corner
Come to me again,
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
You make me feel a little older,
Like a full grown woman might
But when youre gone i grow colder,
Come to me again
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
I hear you walking by my front door
I hear the creaking of the kitchen floor
I don't care what other people say
I'm going to love you, anyway
Come to me again
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night


I can't stand it any longer
I need the fuel to make my fire bright
So don't fight it any longer
Come to me again,
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
And i know that you feel it too,
When my skin turns into glue,
You will know that it's warm inside
And you'll come run to me,
In the cold, cold, night
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
