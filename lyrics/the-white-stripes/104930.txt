Oh yeah you're pretty good looking for a girl
But your back is so broken
And this feeling's still gonna linger on
Until the year 2525 now


Yeah you're pretty good looking for a girl
Your eyes are wide open
And your thoughts have been stolen by the boys
Who took you out and bought you everything you
Want now

Yeah you're pretty good looking
Oh yeah
You're pretty good looking
Yes you're pretty good looking
Oh yeah
For a girl

Lots of people in this world
But I want to be your boy
To me that thought is sounding so absurd
And I don't wanna be your toy
Cause you're pretty good looking for a girl
My future's wide open
But this feeling's still gonna linger on
Until I know everything I need to know now

Yeah you're pretty good looking
Oh yeah
You're pretty good looking
Yes you're pretty good looking
Oh yeah
For a girl
