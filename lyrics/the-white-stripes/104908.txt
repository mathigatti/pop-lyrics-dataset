Well, if you've been a married woman
And things didn't seem to work out
Divorce is the key to being loose and free
But you are gonna be talked about


Everybody knows that you've loved once
They think you'll love again
You can't have a male friend
When you're a has been or a woman, you're rated x

And if you're rated X you are some kind of goal
That even men turned civil try to make
But I think it's wrong to judge every picture
If a cheap camera makes a mistake

So if your best friend's husband says to you
That you started looking good
You should've known he would and he would if he could
And he will if you're rated X

Well nobody knows where you are going
But they sure know where you've been
All they're thinking of is your experience in love
Well, their minds fill up with sin

The women all look at you like you're bad
The men all hope you are
But if you go too far
You're gonna wear the scar of a woman rated x

And if you're rated X you are some kind of goal
That even men turned civil try to make
But I think it's wrong to judge every picture
If a cheap camera makes a mistake

So if your best friend's husband come says to you
That you started looking good
You should've known he would and he would if he could
And he will if you're rated X, hey
