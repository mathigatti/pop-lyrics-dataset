Jumble jumble
all at my house
come on over
sleep on the couch
can't even see ya
look like a mouse


Crumble crumble
the bag is brown
rip up the paper
to hear a sound
pick up the pieces
up off the ground

tumble tumble
on to the floor
roll over
until your poor
wave to me
I'm at the door

Why can't you be nicer to me?
somebody's screaming 
looking at the ceiling 
everything's so funny 
i don't have any money 
people don't even know me 
but they know how to show me 

why can't you be nicer to me? 

my pride is dying 
i think i'm all done lying 
nobody's sharing 
so i stop caring 
all alone and walking 
nobody's talking 

why can't you be nicer to me? 

well the wind is blowing 
where am i going 
off a bridge and falling 
nobody's calling 
on the ground and laying 
nobody's praying 

why can't you be nicer to me?
