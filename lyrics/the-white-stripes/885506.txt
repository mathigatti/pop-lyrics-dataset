Ain't she lookin' good
Ain't she lookin' fine
Ain't she lookin' fine
And she takes her time
Don't you walk away


Sweet potato pie
Sweet sugar plum
Sweet sugar plum
But look what you done
Don't you walk away

Ain't she lookin' good
Ain't she lookin' fine
Ain't she lookin' fine
And she takes her time
Don't you walk away

Sweet potato pie
Sweet sugar plum
Sweet sugar plum
But look what you done
Don't you walk away

Oh, no, oh

Ain't she lookin' good
Ain't she lookin' fine
Ain't she lookin' fine
And she takes her time
Don't you walk away

Sweet potato pie
Sweet sugar plum
Sweet sugar plum
But look what you done
Don't you walk away

Yeah! yeah!
