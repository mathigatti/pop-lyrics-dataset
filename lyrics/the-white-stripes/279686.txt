Well somebody walked up to me
But I didnt know what to do
And then somebody said hello to me
But I didnt know what to do
Because I think that my words could get
Twisted so I bend my back over take a
Gulp be funny cause I know theres nothing I can do
Then my mother tried to pick me up
When I was sittin down on the ground
Something forced my little eyes come open
But I couldnt make out the sound
It doesnt matter cause my eyes are lying
And they dont have emotion
Dont wanna be social, cant take it when they hate me
But I know theres nothing I can do
When my thoughts start to feel like mine
Theyre taken from me it seems to happen
All the time (every time)
And the feelings that are fine for you
Theres somebody there
Who doesnt think they are true
So think of something new
Theres nothing left to do
And then my idols walk next to me
I look up at them they fade away
Its a destruction of a mystery
The more I listen to what they say
So does that mean that theres no more doin
And theres no more thinkin
And theres no more feeling
Cause theres no right opinion
So can you tell me what im supposed to do
