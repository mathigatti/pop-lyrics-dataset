In some respects
I suspect you've got a respectable side.
When pushed and pulled and pressured,
you seldom run and hide.
But it's for someone else's benefit
not for what you want to do
and Until I realize that you've realized
I'm going to say these words to you:


(Chorus)
You dont know what love is,
you do as you're told
Just as a child of ten might act
but you're far too old
You're not hopeless, or helpless, and I hate to sound cold
But you dont know what love is,
you just do as you're told

I can see your man can't help but win
Any problems that might arise
but in his mind there can be no sin if you never criticize
you just keep on repeating those empty " I love you"'s
Until you see that you deserve better
I'm gonna lay right into you

(Chorus)
You dont know what love is,
you just do as you're told
Just as a child of ten might act
but you're far too old
You're not hopeless, or helpless, and I hate to sound cold
But you dont know what love is,
no you dont know what love is,
no you dont know what love is...
You just do as you're told
Yeah,you do as you're told
