when the stiff wind blows
the flag don't wiggle
in the party of special things to do
I met the ace of love
she took me to her plantation
for the love without separation
in the party of special things to do
it could happen to me
it could happen to you
I met the ace of love
she said I want you to go
to the party of special things to do
and when you're through
I'll be right here waiting for you
here take these sparks
so my distant cousins can get along with you
watch out for the mirror man
and elixir sue
when I got to the party of special things to do
it wasn't hard to find Elixir Sue
I met all the cards
the wild cards
the one-eye jill
the red queen
she turned her head
you know what I mean
she turned it back and said
