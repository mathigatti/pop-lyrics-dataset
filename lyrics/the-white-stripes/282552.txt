Was all the summer, and all the fall,
Just trying to find my little all in all
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Lord I'm sitting on top of the world


Was in the spring, one summer day
Just when she left me, she's gone to stay
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Oh I'm sitting on top of the world

An' you come runnin', holdin' up your hand
Can't get me a woman, quick as you can get a man
But now you're gone, and now I don't worry
Lord I'm sitting on top of the world

Have been days, I didn't know your name
Why should I worry or cry in vain
But now she's gone, now I don't worry
Lord I'm sitting on top of the world

Went to the station, down in the yard
Gone get me a freight train, worked on your hard
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Oh I'm sitting on top of the world

The lonesome days, they have gone by
Why should you beg me oh say goodbye
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Oh cause I'm sitting on top of the world
