Well we're back in school again
And I don't really know anyone
I really want to be your friend
Cause I don't really know anyone


And the bus is pulling
Up to your house
I wish you could be sitting here
Next to me

I didn't see you at summer school
But I saw you at the corner store
And I don't want to break the rules
Cause I've broken them all before

But every time I see you
I wonder why
I don't break a couple rules
So that you'll notice me

Sister do you know my name?
I've heard it before but I want you to know

I got a funny feeling
That it's gonna work out
Cause now I see you sitting here
Next to me
