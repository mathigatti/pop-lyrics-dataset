There's a story
I would like to tell
My problem it'
It's one you know too well
It's one you know too well


Me Suzy Lee
The one i'm speaking of
The question is
Is she the one I love ?
Is she the one I love ?

(all right)
Is she the one I love ?
Is she the one I love

She'll send me flowers
With her tears bored inside
And you know what i'd do
I would run and hide
I would run and hide

And the paper
On it was my name
With the question
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

To end this tale
The one i'm speaking of
I wish i have an answer (but i don't know)
Is this really love?
Is this really love?

Is this really love?
Is this really love?
