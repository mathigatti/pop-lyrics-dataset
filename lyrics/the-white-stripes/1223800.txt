You've got her in your pocket
And there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'cause it's at home sweet home


Nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way
To trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way
And you'll be there if she ever feels blue
And you'll be there when she finds someone new
What to do
Well you know

You keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in a safe a lock it
'cause it's home sweet home

The smile on your face made her think she had the right one
Then she thought she was sure
By the way you two could have fun
But now she might leave
Like she's threatened before
Grab hold of her fast
Before her feet leave the floor
And she's out the door
'cause you want

To keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in a safe a lock it
'cause it's home sweet home

And in your own mind
You know you're lucky just to know her
And in the beginning all you wanted was to show her
But now you're scared
You think she's running away
You search in your hand for something clever to say
Don't go away
'cause I want

To keep you in my pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in a safe a lock it
'cause it's home sweet home
Home sweet home
