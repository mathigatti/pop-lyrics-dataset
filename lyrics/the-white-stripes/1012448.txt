If you're looking for hot water 
Don't be shocked when you get 
Burned a little bit 


If you're trying to get into some 
Hot water 
I can help you find it 

If they Catch me arount you 
Playing 'Rock the Boat' 
I'm gonna Cacth Hell 

And if you're throwing your voice 
In bed singing a note 
I'm gonna Cacth Hell 

Guess What' 
Try and Catch Hell 

If you're getting tricky 
Lying to yourself 
You're gonna cacth Hell 

And if You're testing god 
And lying to his face 
You're gonna Catch Hell 

I know it...
