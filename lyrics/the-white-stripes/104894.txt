I wish we
Were stuck up a tree
Then we'd know
It's nicer below


I don't know any lullabys
I don't know how to make you mine
But I can learn
In lonely days long ago
I saw lovers put on a show
Well, now it's my turn

Drive you home
Then wait by the phone
For that call
And a walk in the fall

No harm will come of this
One little midnight kiss
It will not burn
So many lonely days
I feel like a throw away
Well, now it's my turn

Falling down
Is no longer around
Feeling sun
I'm no longer one
Well, isn't this fun?
