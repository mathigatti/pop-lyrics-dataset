Broken Bricks

Have you been to the broken bricks girl
Snuck down through the cyclone fence
Past the caution tape
And the security gate
Back way to the breakroom bench


Well there's a little corner where you first got kissed
And felt your boyfriends fist and made the company list
And there's a little spot where your dad ate lunch
And your brother landed his first punch yeah,yeah,yeah

Well have you been to the broken bricks girl
Seen the barrels that they left behind
Seen the machine that cut aluminium clean
And got tape from the caution sign

And broke into the window panes
Just a rusty colored rain that drives a man insane
You try to jump over water but you land in oil
Climb the ladder up a broken crane yeah,yeah,yeah

Don't go to the broken bricks girl
It's not a place that you want to be
Think of the spot your father spent his life
Demolition calls it Building C
Demolition calls it Building C now
Demolition calls it Building C now
