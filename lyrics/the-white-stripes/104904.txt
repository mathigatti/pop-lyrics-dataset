I got a little bird 
i'm gonna take her home 
put her in a cage 
and disconnect the phone 


if you give me a look 
i'm gonna get the book 
i'm gonna preach the word 
i wanna preach to birds 
as i walk the floor 
yeah this i know 

when i get you home 
this is how it goes 
i got nothing to lose 
i'll never let you go
