She was sixteen and six feet tall 
in a crowd of teenagers comin' out of the zoo 
She stumbled started to slip and fall 
teeter-tottered on the top of patent leather shoes 
I happened to catch her and said, 
"maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you" 


Maybe for you, now 

But not as shaky as I must have seemed 
talkin' junk through her giggle -- little teenage dream 
And on the phone I could not compete 
my dumb-love fake competence was getting weak 
For a sec' I thought I sounded sweet 
but sure 'nough in a gruff, faint voice 
I heard myself speak 

I could stay a while 
but sooner or later I'll break your smile 
And I can tell a joke 
but one of these days I'm bound to choke 
And we could share a kiss 
but I feel like I can't go through with this 
And I bet we could build a home 
but I know the right thing for me to do 
Is to leave you alone 

Leave you alone, now 

I'm beginning to like you 
so you probably won't get what I'm going to do 
I'm walkin' away from you 
it probably don't make much sense to you 
But I'm trying to save you 
from all of the things that I'll probably say or do 

Probably do 

I could stay a while 
but sooner or later I'll break your smile 
And I can tell a joke 
but one of these days I'm bound to choke 
And we might share a kiss 
but I feel like a can't go through with this 
And I bet we could build a home 
but I know the right thing for me to do 
Is to leave you alone 

Leave you alone, now 

You probably call me a fool 
and say I'm doin' exactly what a coward would do 
And I'm beginning to like you 
it's a shame; what a lame way to live 
But what can I co 
I hope you appreciate what I do 

On my martyr for my love for you 
A martyr for my love for you, now 
A martyr for my love for you 
A martyr for my love for you
