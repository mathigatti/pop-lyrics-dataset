I Think I Smell A Rat
all you little kids seem to think you know just where it's at
Oh I think I smell a rat
walking down the street carrying a baseball bat
Oh I think I smell a rat


Oh I think I smell a rat
Oh I think I smell a rat
all you little kids seem to think you know just where is at
Oh I think I smell a rat
using your mother and father for a welcome mat
Oh I think I smell a rat
