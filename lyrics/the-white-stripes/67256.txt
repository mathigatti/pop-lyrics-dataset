Youve got her in your pocket
And theres no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause its home sweet home
Nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way
To trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way
And youll be there if she ever feels blue
And youll be there when she finds someone new
What to do?
Well you know
You keep her in your pocket
Where theres no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause its home sweet home
The smile on your face made her think
She had the right one
Then she thought she was sure
By the way you two could have fun
But now she might leave
Like shes threatened before
Grab hold of her fast
Before her feet leave the floor
And shes out the door
'Cause you want
To keep her in your pocket
Where theres no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause its home sweet home
And in your own mind
You know youre lucky just to know her
And in the beginning all you wanted
Was to show her
But now youre scared
You think shes running away
You search in your hand for something clever to say
Dont go away
'Cause I want
To keep you in my pocket
