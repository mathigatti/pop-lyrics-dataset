I got a letter this morning
what do you reckon it read?
It said the guy you love is dead
I got a letter this morning
what do you reckon it read?
Said, hurry hurry
because the guy you love is dead.


Well I packed up my suitcase
Took off down the road
When I got there she was
laying on the cooling board
I packed up my suitcase
and I took off down the road
When I got there she was
laying on the cooling board.

It looked like ten thousand people
standing around the burying ground
I didn't know I loved her
til they began to let her down
Looked like ten thousand
people standing on the burying ground
Well didn't know that I loved her
til they began to let her down.

You know it's so hard to love
someone that don't love you
Won't get satisfaction
don't care what you do
So hard to love
well someone that don't love you
Don't look like satisfaction
well I don't care what you do.

Well I got up this morning
the break of day
Just hugging the pillows
where she used to lay
Got up this morning
believe the break of day
Just hugging the pillows
where my baby used to lay.
