I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when ya gonna ring it
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when ya gonna ring it
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when ya gonna ring it
yeah, I been thinkin' about my doorbell


Oh, well

Well, women and children need kisses
Not the man in my life I know
And I been going to mystery misses
I respect the art of the show
Take back what you said little girl
And while you're at it take yourself back too
I'm tired of the sitting and the waiting
Wondering whatcha gonna do now, whatcha gonna do about it

I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when ya gonna ring it
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when ya gonna ring it oh
I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when ya gonna ring it
Yeah, I been thinkin' about my doorbell

Oh, yeah

You don't seem to come around
Point your finger and make a sound
You don't seem to come around
Not since I said you knocked it down?

Oh, well

Make a sound and I'll make you feel right
Right at home, yeah
Yeah, right at home, yeah

Nobody got me waitin' in pain
But how come it's so easy to you?
You don't strike me as the type to be callous
But your words seem so obtuse
But then again I know you feel guilty
And you tell me you want me again
But I don't need any of your pity
I got plenty of my own friends
They're all above me

And I've been thinkin' about my doorbell
When they gonna ring it, when they gonna ring it
Yeah, I've been thinkin' about the doorbell
When they gonna ring it, when they gonna ring it oh
I've been thinkin' about the doorbell
When they gonna ring it, when they gonna ring it
Yeah, I been thinkin' about the doorbell

Oh, well

They don't seem to come around
Push the finger and make a sound
They don't seem to come around
Maybe they they'll knock 'em down

Oh, well

Make a sound and I'll make you feel right
Right at home
Right at home

I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when ya gonna ring it
I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when ya gonna ring it
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when ya gonna ring it
Yeah, I been thinkin' about my doorbell
And when you're gonna ring it, when you're gonna ring it

I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when ya gonna ring it
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about my doorbell

Oh, oh well
