Sugar never tasted so good
Sugar never tasted so good
Sugar never tasted good to me
Yeah


Until her eyes crossed over
Until her mind crossed over
Until her soul fell next to me

Now 
If the wrinkle that is in your brain 
Has given you quite a steam
Your fingers have become a crane
Pulling on these puppet strings

Yeah

What a feeling that's begun
What a feeling that's begun

What a feeling that's begun
What a feeling that's begun

I felt just like a baby
Until I held a baby
What a mood this boy can be

Yeah

And her thougths like a daisy
How my mind gets lazy
I must've been crazy not to see

Alright

If the wrinkle that is in your brain
Has given you quite a steam
Your fingers have become a crane
Your fingers have become a crane
Your fingers have become a crane
Pulling on these puppet strings

Water never tasted so good
Water never tasted so good
Water never tasted good to me
