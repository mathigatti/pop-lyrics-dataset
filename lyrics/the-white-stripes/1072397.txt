Theres a storm
It's comin' around
And the snow is fallin'
It's covering the ground


Don't you walk away
With my love
Don't you walk away now
I'm on my own
I'm asking you to hear
My pleads I need the shelter of your arms
Wanting to spend me days
Need the Shelter of your arms

Theres a sadness
It's feeling my heart
And the silence is tearin' me apart

Don't you walk away with my love
Don't you walk away now I'm on my own
I'm asking you to hear my pleads I need the
Shelter of your arms
Wanting to spend my days
In the Shelter of your arms
Shelter of your arms
Shelter of your arms
Shelter of your arms

I need the Shelter of Your Arms
Shelter of your arms
Shelter of your arms
Shelter of your arms
I need the Shelter of Your Arms
