This battle is in the air
I'm looking upwards
Where are the angels?
I'm not in my home


St. andrew don't forsake me
St. andrew
Don't forsake me

Who is here to greet me?
The children are kind
I'm not in my home
I travel backwards in ecstacy
Where are the angels?
Don't forget me

St. andrew
I've been true
What do I need to say?
What do I need to say?
