I've thought about it for a while
and I've thought about the many miles
but I think it's time that I've gone away
the feelings that you have for me
have gone away it's plain to see
and it looks to me that your pulling away


I'm gonna pick it up
I'm gonna pick it up today
I'm bound pack it up
I'm bound pack it up and go away

I've found it hard to say to you
that this is what I have to do
but there is no way that I'm gonna stay
there are so many things you need to know
and I wanna tell you before I go
but it's hard to think of just what to say

I'm gonna pick it up
I'm gonna pick it up today
I'm bound pack it up
I'm bound pack it up and go away

I'm sorry to leave you all alone
you're sitting silent by the phone
but we'd always known there would come a day
the bus is warm and softly lit 
and a hundred people ride in it
I guess I'm just another runaway

I'm gonna pick it up
I'm gonna pick it up today
I'm bound pack it up
I'm bound pack it up and go away
