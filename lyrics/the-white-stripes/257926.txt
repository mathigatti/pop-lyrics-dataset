Who's to say that I'm unhappy 'cause I don't really smile
Sittin', hopin', dreamin', waitin' for my ship to sail


Who's to say this time I've wasted, someday won't get used
Maybe if you come around I'll start to get enthused

Who's to say?
Who's to say?

Who's to say that I'm obsessed with everything you do
Just because it seems my schedule seems to shadow you

Who's to say that tired clean shave is more fish in the sea
And I don't mind treading water 'cause you're the one for me

You say that by now I should know you'll never love me
But who's to say that what has never been will never be
What has been will never be

Who's to say in time I wouldn't learn how to relax
You'd forget about my clammy hands and my nervous laugh

Who's to say the way you look at him is truly love
Maybe they should realize I fit you like a glove

You say that by now I should know you'll never love me
But who's to say that what has never been will never be
What has been will never be
