Walking home to you
Walking home to you
I'm talking through my wounds that I'm bleeding out for you
Talking through my wounds
Walking home to you


I listen when I can
I listen when I can
To this picture of you I carry in my hand
Lets me hear you say
You're never far away

And the dirt beneath my heels in the road
Obeys command to me and serves me as I go
And though it help to know you're never far away
I can't help wondering how you might feel about me today

Ada let me know
Ada let me know
Will you want me back or is it better if I go
Will you want me back
Ada let me know

That Carolina wind
That Carolina Wind
It blows in my eyes and makes me realize
The trouble that I'm in
That Carolina Wind

And the dirt beneath my heels in the road
Obeys command to me and serves me as I go
And though it help to know you're never far away
I can't help wondering how you might feel about me today

You'll see me in a dream
You'll see me in a dream
You'll see me in a dream across a mountain stream
And you will hear me say
You're never far away
Never far away
Never far away
