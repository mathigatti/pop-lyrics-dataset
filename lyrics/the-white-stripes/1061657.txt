Her eyes were blue, her hair was auburn
Her smile was like an angel fair
She was her daddy's only daughter
On the Tennessee Border


CHORUS
One night I took a ride just across the line
I picked her up in a pickup truck
And she broke this heart of mine
Her mama said: "No, she's my only daughter,"
But we got married on the Tennessee Border.

The roses were bloomin' there on the Border
The moon was shinin' there
Her personality made me want her
On the Tennessee Border.

CHORUS
