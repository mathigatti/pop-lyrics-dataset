Christmas time will soon be over,
Christmas time will soon be over,
Christmas time will soon be over
Then we'll join the band.


Wake up gals, let's go to the river,
Wake up gals, let's go to the river,
Wake up gals, let's go to the river,
Then we'll join the band.

Get up gals, don't be bitter
Get up gals, don't be bitter
Get up gals, don't be bitter
Then we'll join the band.

Mess with me, I'll pull the trigger
Mess with me, I'll pull the trigger
Mess with me, I'll pull the trigger
Then we'll join the band.
