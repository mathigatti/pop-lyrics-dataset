Though I hear you calling, I will not answer
Though I hear you calling, I will not answer

And the sun may shine right through your tooth, dear
And the wind may blow right through my ear

Though I hear you calling, I will not answer
Oh, I hear you calling, no I will not answer

I broke your code
And I broke your code

Come on hit me…Yeah, yeah (6X)
…I will not answer, yeah
Though I hear you calling, no I will not answer

The sun may shine out to your mouth, dear
And the wind may blow right through my ear

Though I hear you calling, oh, I will not answer
Though I hear you calling, but I will not answer

Calling… and I broke your code
I will not answer (7X)

Though I hear you calling, I will not answer (echoing)
Though I hear you calling, but I will not answer (echoing)
And I will not answer and I broke your code
Uhmmm… Broke your code
Yeah… uhmmm
Though I hear you calling... And the sun is shining
I will not answer ...Right through your tooth, dear
