Look closer you can see
How I been running it
I got a dollar bill in the cockpit
Surprised being white is a black hole?
I got another job at the liquor store.
Damn, I'm Bone Broke


They got a white pony in a stable
and ride him when the doggie isn't able
But he don't really care, cause they pay him.
But still a black suit
Is gonna shake him down.
Oh Well
I'm Bone Broke

(Broke as I'll ever be)

Look another way girl i'm telling ya
God gave seven minutes right to ya
and your mother put her money into platinum
so that you wouldn't have to pay
attention
do you?

I'm leaning on a brick with my nails
I'm telling 'em the money's in the mail
Keep showing that my bones
Never fake it
But still a brick bank is gonna break it down
Oh Well
I'm Bone Broke

Look another way girl i'm telling ya
God gave seven minutes right to ya
and your mother put her money into platinum
so that you wouldn't have to pay
attention
right?
