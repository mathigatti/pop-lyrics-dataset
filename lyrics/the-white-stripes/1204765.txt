Oh! I meant - Ah!

No, I didn't mean that at all

Here in the streets of American nights
Rise to the bottom of the meaning of life
Studied all the rules, and I want no part
But I let you in just to break this heart
Even though it was only one night
It was fuckin' strange


Nina's in the bedroom
She says, "Time to go now"
But leavin' it ain't easy

I've got to let go
Oh, I've got to let go

And the hours they went to slow
I said every night
She just can't stop sayin':
"New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart"

Kill me now 'cause I'll let you down
I swear one day we're gonna leave this town
"Stop"

Yes, I'm leaving 'cause this just won't work
They act like Romans, but they dress like Turks
Soft time in your prime
See me, I like the summertime
But...hey

Nina's in the bedroom
She says, "Time to go now"
But leaving it ain't easy

Oh, I've got to let go
I've got to let go

Oh, trapped in an apartment
She would not let them get her
She wrote it in a letter,:
"I've got to come clean
The authorities, they've seen
Darling, I'm somewhere in between"

I said every night
She just can't stop sayin':
"New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
They ain't too smart"
