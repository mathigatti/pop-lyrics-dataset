got a cop down at

whoo!
what's that she said
what's that she said
what's that she said 
with her fingers turning blue 
and her face was turning red
whoo!
was that her dad
was that her dad
was that her dad
with the magic marker
writing little angel on her head

la la la la la la la la la la la la 
la la la la la la la la la la la la 

whoo!
she must be dead
well she must be dead
she must be dead
if the only sound I hear
are the devils by her bed

oh
oh well
[cough
cough]
whoo!
what's that she said
what's that she said
what's that she said
with her fingers turning blue
and her face was turning red
la la la la la la
