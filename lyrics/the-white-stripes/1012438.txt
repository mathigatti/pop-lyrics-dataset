Meg: I saw some stuff in here, are you gunna give it to us?
Jack: Oh Meg, don't be rude
Meg: Or not..
Jack: They might need it
If you don't want it we'll take it
If you don't wanna give it to us we'll keep walkin by
Keep goin we ain't tired but we got plenty of places to go
Lots of homes we ain't been to yet
On the westside, southwest side, middle east, rich house
Dog house, out house, old folks house, house for unwed mothers
Halfway homes, caddacombs, twilight zones, lookin for technics
Turntables to Gramaphones.
So take a last lick of your ice cream cone
And lock up what you still wanna own
But please be kind
Meg: Take your time
Jack: And don't rewind
