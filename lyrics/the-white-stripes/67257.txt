It's quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
It's quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
And right now you could care less about me
But soon enough you will care by the time I'm done


Let's have a ball and a biscuit, sugar
And take our sweet time about it
Let's have a ball, girl
And take our sweet little time about it

Tell everyone in the place to just get out
We'll get clean together
And I'll find me a soapbox
Where I can shout it

Read it in the newspaper
Ask your girlfriends and see if they know
Read it in the newspaper
Ask your girlfriends and see if they know
That my strength is ten fold girl
I'll let you see it if you want to before you go

Let's have a ball and a biscuit, sugar
And take our sweet time about it
Let's have a ball, girl
And take our sweet little time about it

Tell everyone in the place to just get out
We'll get clean together
And I'll find me a soapbox
Where I can shout it

I'ts quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But its a fact that I'm the seventh son
It was the other two which made me your third
But it was my mother who made me the seventh son
And right now you could care less about me
But soon enough you will care by the time I'm done
