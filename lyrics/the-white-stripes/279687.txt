Got an 84 ford to get me home
I get in, start up, and go
it's not a vintage cadillac
but it'll always get me there and back
Always be...Good to me
Always be...Good to me
Always be...Good to meeeee


I got a beat up cruddy amp
I plug it in and it sounds like a champ
It's not a Fender Tweed Deluxe
It only cost me a couple of bucks

And it'll...always sound...good to me.
...always sound...good to me...
always sound...good to me...
...always sound...good to meee.

I got a girl and she's so true
no other kinda girl will do
she's not like the girls from the past
And I knew none of them would last

always be good to me(x7)
