Dead leaves and the dirty ground
When I know youre not around
Shiny tops and soda pops
When I hear your lips make a sound (when I hear your lips make a sound)


Thirty notes in the mailbox
Will tell you that I'm coming home
And I think I'm gonna stick around
For a while so your'e not alone (for a while so you're not alone)

If you can hear a piano fall
You can hear me coming down the hall
If I could just hear your pretty voice
I dont think I need to see at all (dont think I need to see at all)

Soft hair and a velvet tongue
I want to give you what you give to me
And every breath that is in your lungs
Is a tiny little gift to me (is a tiny little gift to me)

I didnt feel so bad till the sun went down
Then I come home
No one to wrap my arms around (wrap my arms around)

Well any man with a microphone
Can tell you what he loves the most
And you know why you love at all
If youre thinking of the holy ghost (if youre thinking of the holy ghost)
