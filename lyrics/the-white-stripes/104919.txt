I can't walk the streets now
To convulate my mind
Some pretty mama, she starts
Breakin' down - stop breakin' down!
Whoo! Stop breakin' down!


The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out
Well, it'll make you lose your mind

You saturday night women, you love to
Ape and clown
You won't do nothin' but tear a good man's
Reputation down - stop breakin' down!
Whoo! Stop breakin' down!

The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out
Well, it'll make you lose your mind

I gave my baby
The ninety-ninth degree
She jumped up and throwed a pistol down on me
Stop breakin' down!
Whoo! Stop breakin' down!

The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out
Well, it'll make you lose your mind
