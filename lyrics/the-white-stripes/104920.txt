Oh, Koko
Well Folks, I'm goin' down to St. James Infirmary,
To see my little lady there
She's stretched out on a long, white table,
She's so sweet, so cold, so fair.


Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
You may search this whole wide world over
But you'll never find another sweetheart like me
Yeah,

Take apart your bones and put 'em back together
Tell your mama that you're somebody new
Feel the breeze blowin', tell 'em all, "Look out, here it comes!"
Now, I can say whatever I feel like to you

Then give me six crap-shootin' pallbearers
Let a chorus girl sing me a song
Put a red-hot jazz band, we raise
Hallelujah as we go along

Well, folks, now that you have heard my story
Say, boy, hand me another shot of that rye
And if anyone should ask you
Just tell 'em I got some of those St. James Infirmary blues
