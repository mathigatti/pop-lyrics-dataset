Screwdriver

Tuesday morning now
I gotta have somewhere to go
I call up tommy now 
I call him on the telephone 
Won't you wake up and come with me now 
I'm going to the pawn and loan 
Walking down thirty three 
Walking on thirty o 


Well what am i supposed to think 
I drop a nickel in the sink 
I love people like a brother now 
But i'm not gonna be their mother now 
What if someone walked up to me 
And like an apple cut right through me 
I'm not the one who's sinnin 

Screwdriver 
Now that you have heard my story now 
I've got a little ending to it now 
Whenever you go out alone 
Take a little dog a bone 
Think about your little sister 
Then you got to drive it home 
With a screwdriver 

I got a little feeling goin' now 
I got a little feeling goin' now
