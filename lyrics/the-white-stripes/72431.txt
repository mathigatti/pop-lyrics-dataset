I can't wait 'till you
Try to come back girl
When things they don't
Work out for you


Who do you think you're
Messing with girl?
What do you think
You're trying to do?
Do you really think I gonna be one of that girl?
Who do you think
You're trying to fool?

First you said I was blind
And it's gonna be different this time
I thought you made up your mind

So many times I've gotten
Used to this
This old idea
Of being all alone
Tell me how I'm supposed to
Get through with this?
I wish this house felt like a home

First you said I was blind
You certainly took your time
I thought you made up your mind
