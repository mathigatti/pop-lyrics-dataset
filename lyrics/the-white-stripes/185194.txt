The nurse should not be the one who puts salt in your wounds
But it's always with trust that the poison is fed with a spoon
When you're helpless with no one to turn to alone in your room
You would swear that the one who would care for you never would leave
She promised and said, "you will always be safe here with me"
But promises open the door to be broken to me


No i'm never, no i'm never, no i'm never gonna let you down now
No i'm never, no i'm never, no i'm never gonna let you down
No i'm never, no i'm never, no i'm never gonna let you down now
No i'm never, no i'm never, no i'm never gonna let you down

The maid that you've hired could never conspire to kill
She's to mother, not quietly smother you when you're most ill
The one that you're trusting suspiciously dusting the sill

No i'm never, no i'm never, no i'm never gonna let you down now
No i'm never, no i'm never, no i'm never gonna let you down
No i'm never, no i'm never, no i'm never gonna let you down now
No i'm never, no i'm never, no i'm never gonna let you down
