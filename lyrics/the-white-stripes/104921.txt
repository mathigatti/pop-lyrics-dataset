you're lookin' at me
nowhere to go
what they're sayin'
I just don't know
a floor below me
ceiling above
and I'm in the middle
with nobody to love
nobody to love
nobody to love
nobody to love
yeah
well lookin' at me
nowhere to go
know what they're sayin'
I just [don't know?]
a floor below me
a ceiling up above
and I'm in the middle
with nobody to love
nobody to love
yeah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
