Fell in love with a girl
Fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes these feelings
Can be so misleading
She turns and says: Are you alright?
I said: I must be fine cause my heart's still beating
Come and kiss me by the riverside
Bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating now


Red hair with a curl
Mellow roll for the flavor
And the eyes for peeping
Can't keep away from the girl
These two sides of my brain
Need to have a meeting
Can't think anything to do
Yeah, my left brain knows that
All love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
And I said it once before
But it bears repeating now

Ohh, ohh,ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh

Can't think of anything to do
Yeah, my left brain knows that
All love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
And I said it once before
But it bears repeating now
