Yah-hee, icky thump
Who'd-a thunk?
Sittin' drunk
On a wagon to Mexico


Oh hell, what a chump
And my head
Got a bump
When I hit it on the radio

Red-head señorita
Lookin' dead
Came and said
Need a bed? en español

I said: give me a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar
Well, I don't need a microphone

Icky thump, with the lump
In my throat
Grab my coat
And now it's reckon
I was ready to go

Yeah, I swam beside the hair
She had one white eye
One black stare
Lookin' up, lyin' there

On a stand in her hair
Was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane
Dry eye, somethin' strange!

La la, la la la la la la la la la laaa laaa laaa

Well, Americans
What, nothin' better to do?
Why don't you kick yourself out?
You're an immigrant too

Who's usin' who?
What should we do?
Well you can't be a pimp
And a prostitute too

Icky thump, handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind
Looked around
And there was nobody else

Left alone
I hit myself with a stone
Went home
And learned how to clean up after myself
