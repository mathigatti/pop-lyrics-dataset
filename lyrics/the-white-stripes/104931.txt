Now, lookie here momma let me explain ya this
If ya wanna get crooked I'll even give ya my fist
Ya might read from revelation back to genesis
Ya keep forget your southern can belongs to me


So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me
Your southern can is mine in the mornin'
Your southern can belongs to me

Ya might go uptown, have me arrested, put in jail
Some hotshots got money, gonna pull my bail
Soon as I get out, hit the ground
Your southern can is worth a thousand, half a pound

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, talkin' about it
Your southern can belongs to me

Ya might take it from the south, baby, hide it up north
Understand ya can't rule me or be my boss
Take it from the east, hide in the west
But when I get ya momma your can'll see no rest

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, I'm screamin'
Your southern can belongs to me

Now baby, ashes to ashes, sand to sand
When I hit ya momma then ya feel my hand
Give ya punch through that barbed wire fence
When I hit ya baby, ya know I make no sence

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, I know it
Your southern can belongs to me

Now look here woman, don't get hot
I'm gettin' me a brick outta my backyard

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, I'm talkin' about it
Your southern can belongs to me

Well, if I catch you momma down in the heart of town
I'm gonna grab me a brick and tear your can on down

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, I know it
Your southern can belongs to me

You may be deathbed sickness, baby, graveyard bound
I'm gonna make you moan like a graveyard hound

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me
Your southern can is mine, I'm screamin'
Your southern can belongs to me
