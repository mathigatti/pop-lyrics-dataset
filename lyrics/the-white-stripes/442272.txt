you can talk about the latest
the latest of your own
these boll weevils 
they will rob you of a home
they are looking for a home
they are looking for a home


the first time I seen a boll weevil
he was sitting on the square
the next time I seen a boll weevil
he had his whole family there
they are looking for a home
they were looking for a home

they are looking for a home
they are looking for a home
they are looking for a home
they was looking for a home

the farmer he took the boll weevil
put him on the sand
the boll weevil says to the farmer
you treat me just like a man
and I will have a home
I will have a home

the old man said to the old lady
what do you think of that
these boll weevils got into my brand new stetson hat
and it's full of holes
yeah it's full of holes

alright, yeah it's full of holes
well it's full of holes
yeah it's full of holes
well it's full of holes

alright now this next verse is about myself
and when I'm done I hope you'll sing along with me on
"he's looking for a home" OK?
I said if anybody asks you people
who sang you this song
you tell 'em it's jackie white
he's done been here and gone
and he's looking for a home

he's looking for a home
he's looking for a home
he's looking for a home
he's looking for a home
he's looking for a home
he's looking for a home
he's looking for a home
he's looking for a home
he's looking for a home
