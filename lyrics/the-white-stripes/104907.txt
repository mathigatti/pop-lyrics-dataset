well pay attention
attention to my words
I love you
I don't know what you heard
and this fire
has got to go for sure
red bowling ball
red bowling ball ruth
well that's something
then I shall know the truth
I said you roll it
and then it breaks your tooth
[?]
[?] the wrong town
I love this girl
so hell shall come around
and you leavin'
will be the only sound
