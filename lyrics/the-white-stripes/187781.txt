I want to hypnotize you baby
On the telephone
So many times I called your house
Just to hear the tone
And though I knew you weren't home
I didn't mind so much 'cause I'm so alone
I want to hypnotize you baby
On the telephone


I want to spin my little watch
Right before your eyes
You're the kind of girl a guy like me
Could hypnotize
And if this comes as a surprise
Just think of all those guys
Who would tell you lies
I want to spin my little watch
Right before your eyes

I want to hold your little hand
If I can be so bold
And be your right hand man
'til your hands get old
And then when all the feeling's gone
Just decide if you want to keep holding on
I want to hold your little hand
If I can be so bold
If I can be so bold
If I can be so bold
