Effect And Cause 

I guess you have to have a problem if you want to vent a contraption 
But you cause a train wreck, then you put me in traction 
Well first came an action, then a reaction 
But you can switch around for your own satisfaction 
Well you burnt my house down then got mad at my reaction 
Well in every complicated situation of the Human Relation 
Makin sense of it all takes a whole lot of concentration 
Well you can't blame a baby for her pregnant ma 
And if theres one of these unavoidable laws 
It's that you just can't take the effect and make it the cause (no!) 


Well you can't take the effect and make it the cause 
I didn't rob a bank because you made up the law 
Blame me for robbin' Peter, but don't you blame Paul 
Can't take the effect and make it the cause 

I aint the reason that you gave me no reason to return your calls 
You built a house of cards and got shocked when you saw them fall 
Well I aint sayin' I'm innocent, in fact the reverse 
But if you're headed to the grave, you don't blame the hearse 
You're like a little girl yelling at her bother cause you lost his ball 

Well you keep blaming me for what you did, and that aint all 
The way you clean up a wreck is enough to give one pause 
Well you seem to forget just how this all started 
I'm reactin to you because you left me broken hearted 
See you just can't take the effect and make it the cause 

Well you can't take the effect and make it the cause 
I didn't rob a bank because you made up the law 
Blame me for robbin' Peter, but don't you blame Paul 
Can't take the effect and make it the cause
