Hey little apple blossom
What seems to be the problem
All the ones you tell your troubles to
They don't really care for you


Come and tell me what you're thinking
Cause just when the boat is sinking
A little light is blinking
And I will come and rescue you

Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
For someone to tell your troubles to

Come and sit with me and talk awhile
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort them out for you
I'll fall in love with you
I think I'll marry you
