There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
x2


I'd like to think that all of this constant interaction
Is just the kind to make you drive yourself away
Each simple gesture done by me is counteracted
And leaves me standing here with nothing else to say
Completely baffled by a backward indication
That an inspired word will come across your tongue
Hands moving upward to propel the situation
Have simply halted
And now the conversations done

There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
x2

I'm only waiting for the proper time to tell you
That its impossible to get along with you
It's hard to look you in the face when we are talking
So it helps to have a mirror in the room
I've not been really looking forward to the performance
But theres my cue and theres a question on your face
Fortunately I have come across an answer
Which is go away
And do not leave a trace

There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
x2

Waking up for breakfast
Burning matches
Talking quickly
Breaking baubles
Throwing garbage
Drinking soda
Looking happy
Taking pictures
So completely stupid
Just go away

There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
x2
