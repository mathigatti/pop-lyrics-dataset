Outside
My door
Unlocked
I'm lookin'
At this sound
That chime out of nowhere
Yeah, nowhere
Whoo
Wheels turnin'
Scratchin'
And burnin'
Yeah
I fought guns
Tanks
Cannon
Cannon
Yeah
Tell me who's that writin'
John the revelator
Tell me who's that writin'
John the revelator
Tell me who's that writin'
John the revelator
Wrote the book on the seven seals
Christ went down on easter mornin'
Mary mother went down to see it
Gotta tell my disciples to meet me in galilee
Who's writin'
John the revelator
Tell me who's that writin'
John the revelator
Tell me who's that writin'
John the revelator
Wrote the book on the seven seals
Hey

I command
I've been evil
Evil
Yeah
EVIL
