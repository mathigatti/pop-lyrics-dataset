Somebody's screaming
looking at the ceilling
everything's so funny
I don't have the money
people don't even know me
but they know how to show me


Why can't you be nicer to me?

My pride is dying
I think I'm all done lying
nobody's sharing
so I stop caring
all alone and walking
nobody's talking

Why can't you be nicer to me?

Well the wind is blowing
where am I going
off a bridge and falling
nobody's calling
on the ground and laying
nobody's praying

Why can't you be nicer to me?
