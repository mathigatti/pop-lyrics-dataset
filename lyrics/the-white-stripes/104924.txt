You fell down, of course, and then you
Got up, of course, and started over
Forgot my name of course
Then you started to remember


Pretty tough to think about
The beginning of december
Pretty tough to think about
Pretty tough to think about
Yeah yeah
Pretty tough to think about

You're looking down again
And then you look me over
We're laying down again
On a blanket in the clover
The same boy you've always known
Well I guess I haven't grown
The same boy you've always known
Same boy you've always known

Think of what the past did
It could've lasted, did it?
So put it in your basket
I hope you know a strong man
Who can lend you a hand
Lowering my casket

I thought this is just today
And soon you'd been returning
The coldest blue ocean water
Cannot stop my heart and mind
From burning
Everyone who's in the know says
That's exactly how it goes
And if there's anything good about me
I'm the only one who knows
