you used me for an ashtray heart
right from the start
case of the punks
I feel like a glass shrimp
make invalids out of supermen
call in a shrink
And pick you up
in a girdle
you used me like an ashtray heart
right from the start
case of the punks
another day, another way
somebody's had too much to think
open up another case of the punks
you hid behind the curtain
waited for me to go out
a man on a porcupine fence
each pillow is touted like a rock
the mother father figure
somebody's had too much to think
send your mother home your navel
case of the punks
you picked me out like an ashtray heart
hid behind the curtain
waited for me to go out
used me like an ashtray heart
a man on a porcupine fence
hit me where the lover hangs out
while they crushed me out
you used me for an ashtray heart
look behind the curtain
you looked in the window when I went out
you used me like an ashtray heart
brush me off
while I was burning outThe White Stripes Lyrics Index
