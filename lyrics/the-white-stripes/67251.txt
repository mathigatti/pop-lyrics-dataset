Don't you think that I'm bound to react now?
Well, my fingers definitely turning to black now
Yeah, maybe I'll put my love on ice
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice
My books are sitting at the top of the stack now
The longer words are really breaking my back now
Maybe I'll learn to understand,
Drawing a square with a pencil in hand, yeah


Mathematically turning the page
Unequivocally showing my age
Im practically center stage
Undeniably earning your wage
well, maybe I'll put my love on ice
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice, yeah

Listen master can you answer a question?
Is it the fingers, or the brain
that you're teaching the lesson?
I can't tell you how proud I am
about that things that I don't understand
Maybe I'll put my love on ice
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice
