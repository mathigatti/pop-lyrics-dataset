I'm walkin' through streets that are dead
Walkin' with you in my head


My feet are so tired
And my brain is so wired
And the clouds are weepin'

Did I hear someone tell a lie
Did I hear some long distant cry

I spoke like a child
And it struck me with a smile
But I was sleepin'

Well, I'm sick of love but I'm in the thick of it
I'm sick of love, well, I'm lovesick

I see, I see lovers in the meadow
I see, I see silhouettes in the window

I watched where they're goin'
But they keep me hangin' on
To their shadow

well I'm sick of love, I wish I've never met you
This kind of love, oh, I'm trying to forget you

Just don't know what to do
I'd give anything to be with you
