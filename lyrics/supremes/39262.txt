I've been crying (boo-hoo)
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned (to tears)
But tears won't wash away the fears


That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns
It keeps me crying, baby, for you,
Keeps me sighing, baby, for you

So won't you hurry?
Come on, boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby
(Come see about me)

I've given up my friends just (for you)
My friends are gone and you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back and be mine

No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway
Keep on crying, baby, for you
I'm gonna keep sighing, baby, for you

So come on, hurry
Come on and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby
(Come see about me)

Sometimes up (up, mm-hmm)
Sometimes down (down, mm-hmm)
My life's so uncertain (mm-hmm)
With you not around (mm-hmm)

From my arms you may be out of reach
But my heart says you're here for to keep
It keeps me crying, baby, for you
Keep on, keep on crying, baby, for you

So won't you hurry?
Come on, boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby
(Come see about me)

You know I'm so lonely
(Come see about me)
I love you only
(Come see about me)
See about your baby
(Come see about me)
Hurry, hurry
