Oh, baby doll, baby doll
He's my baby doll
He's good to me
So true to me
He's all right for me


You know I'm gonna love him forever
And give my life to him completely
I belong to my baby doll
He's my baby doll

He's so sweet
So handsome all the girls they envy me
Talking about my baby doll
When they see me holding his arm
Walking down the street

You should see me hold my head up high
It's a feeling I can't explain
Just proud to be walking with my baby doll

He's sugar to my taste
He's got sweet kisses
And a warm embrace
He's my baby doll, ooh baby doll

Please say he'll always be mine
From this day please tell me you'll love me
'Till the end of time

You know I'm gonna love him forever
And give my life to him completely
I belong to my baby doll

He's my baby doll, yeah
He's so right for me, yeah
The girls, they envy me, yeah
Ooh, baby doll
