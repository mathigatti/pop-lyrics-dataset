Darling, just relax
You melt me like hot candle wax
One touch and my whole body melts
Yet you say, you say you can't express yourself


Ohhhhhhhh
Just keep doin' what you're doin'
Fancy words would only ruin it
Touch, that very special touch
If I satisfy you, ooh, baby
How you satisfy me

(Oh, baby!)
Don't worry, don't worry about cries
These are tears of love in my eyes
I feel this love flowin' through
Like a river, boy, straight through me to you

Oh, your touch says more than words
In any language ever heard (oh, baby)
Touch, oh, honey (that very special touch)
I need your touch
Every brand new day (every day)
I wake up wanting you the same way
Hey hey hey!
(Ooh!) (Oh, baby!)

(Touch)
Your touch says more than words (oh!)
In any language ever heard
Keep on doin' what you're doin' (ooh!)
Fancy words would only ruin it

Touch (ooh!), groove me with your touch, hey!
Touch, you move me with your touch

(Touch, talk to me, talk to me, touch)
Groove me, groove me, groove me, groove me,
Groove me, groove me, groove me,
Groove me with your touch
Touch me, touch me, your touch express so much

(Somebody touch)
Just keep doin' what you're doin'
Fancy words would only ruin it
(Touch me, touch me, touch)
