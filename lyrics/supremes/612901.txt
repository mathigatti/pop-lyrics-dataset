It's the same routine of getting up every morning
And putting on a smile
But underneath there's another person
Who can't find a reason to make living worthwhile


Ah, another day to get through
Without the love that once was mine
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again
Like wanting you and like having you
I'll never get used to

I've gotten used to not listing
For familiar sounds you used to make
Now I'm trying to get out of the habit
Of calling your name first thing when I awake
Look here !

It's like a child's first step
I have to learn to walk all, all over again
'Cause you were always there if I should fall
And now there's nobody else that I can call
It's like wanting you and not having you
I'll never get used to

Lost in a cloud
I think I caught a glimpse of you
Blindly I rush to touch your hand, huh!
To discover it's my mind
Playing tricks on me again
Tricks on me again

Some things you never get used to
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again
Like wanting you and like having you
I'll never get used to
It's wanting you and like having you
I'll never get used to
Look here !
Like wanting you and like having you
I'll never get used to
