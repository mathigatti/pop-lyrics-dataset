As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion


What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

Maybe, 
The fruits of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows, searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and prayin' for someone to care
Always movin' and goin' nowhere

What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me, please

I'm searching though I don't succeed
for someones love
There's a growing need
all is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere 
Just to find someone to care

I'll be looking everyday
I know I've got to find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere
