Sweet thing, you make my heart sing
You turn darkness into light
You make everything alright
Sweet thing, you make the bells ring
Ding dong, and sweet and true
Attaching me to you.


(Sweeter than the taste of sugar cane)
No sugar cane could be
As sweet as you are to me
(Sweeter than whatever you can name)
Like candy, cake or honey
Wouldn't give you up for love or money.

Sweet thing, you are my everything
You're all I need and more 
Than my heart a-bargained for
Sweet thing, you are what's happening
You're just a bundle of love
Happiness and love.

Sweeter than the taste of honey dew
A honey-dew male is sweet, it's true
But it just ain't quite as sweet as you
Sweeping is the way to measure you
I look at the scale and it's a shame
I have more sweetness inch to inch
I have more sweetness pound to pound
Than any other sweet thing I have found.

Sweet thing, sweet, sweet thing
Sweet thing, sweet, sweet thing.

Sweeter than the taste of honey dew
A honey-dew male is sweet, it's true
But it just ain't quite as sweet as you
Sweeping is the way to measure you
I look at the scale and it's a shame
I have more sweetness inch to inch
I have more sweetness pound to pound
Than any other sweet thing I have found.

Sweet thing, you are what's happening
You're just a bundle of love
Happiness and love
Say it, sweet thing, you are my everything
You're all I need and more 
Than my heart a-bargained for
Sweet thing, you make my heart sing
You turn darkness into light
You make everything alright
Sweet thing, you make the bells ring
Ding dong, and sweet and true
Attaching me to you.
