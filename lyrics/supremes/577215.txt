Baby, it's all your fault
You made me love you
You made me need you


Baby, it's all your fault
I keep tellin' myself
I need you and no one else

'Cause your lips
Has the kiss of fire
That takes hold to my
My every desire
When you take me in your arms
And hold me close
My heart tells me
It's you I need the most

Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh my baby

Sweet words you speak
Is like a melody
They go on and on
Like an old sweet song
Just echoing
All through my heart
Just makes you a part
A part of me, sweetheart

Baby, it's all your fault
You made me love you
You made me need you

You've got me in your power
And there I'll remain
'Cause in my heart I know
I don't want to change

And baby, it's all your fault
I can't help myself
Oh no, I can't help myself
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh my baby
