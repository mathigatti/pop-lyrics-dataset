Keep an eye
Keep an eye
Keep an eye
On your close friend


Keep an eye
Keep an eye
Keep an eye
On your close friend

'Cause what you got that'll make you lose
And then turn around and step in your shoes
I say they'll turn around
And step in your shoes

Like the day I stood there numb
Watchin' my friend walk away
With my love on her arm
No, what she left me was
The memory of the moment when she said
"I'm sorry for what I have to do
But you see I love him just as much as you"

Keep an eye
Keep an eye
On your close friend

Keep an eye
Keep an eye
You better watch out
For your close friend

The devil's workshop is a busy place
On top of evil there's an innocent face
Oh, on top of evil he puts an innocent face
She was just like a spider
Only twice as smart

Kindness was the thread
She used to weave our world apart
It used to be three of us seen all over town
Now there's only two
Someone's missing guess who

Now I see how she schemed and finally
Worked her way in between
She planted seeds of mistrust here and there
Causin' us to fight unaware
Her comforting way when I would cry
Shadowed the look of triumph in her eye
Just like a snake on a limb of a tree
A friend is an enemy you can see

'Cause what you got that'll make you lose
And then turn around and step in your shoes
They'll turn around
And step in your shoes

So you better keep an eye on your close friend
You better watch out for your close friend
Don't trust nobody
Don't trust nobody
Keep an eye on your close friend
You better watch out for your close friend
