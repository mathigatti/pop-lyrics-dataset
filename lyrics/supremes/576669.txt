How long has that evening train been gone
I wanna know
How long has that evening train been gone


I have a babe that was standing at the station
Waiting for a train
I ran to the door with my heart in my hand
(Heart in my hand)
And all my future plans
I've gotta catch him if I can
Is that express Mr. Station man
I woke up this mornin'
With a smile on my face
Feelin' that the world
The world was a beautiful place

How long has that evening train been gone
I want to know
How long has that evening train been gone

On a scrap of paper was the
Train arriving information
His room was empty and his closet's bare
And not a single shirt was hangin' there

How could the guy just up and leave me
What did I do that was so displeasing
Only yesterday he helped me type
He told me everything
Everything's gonna be alright

Oh, he said he loved me and he cried
Oh yeah, he said he loved me and he cried
Oh, yes he did now

There must be an explanation
Come on and move out the station
Can't you see that he's taking my world
And making me a sad sad girl
That's why I can't let go
That's why I gotta know

How long has that evening train been gone
I wanna know how long
Has the train been gone
Oh yeah, has that evening train been gone
Right now
Can't wait a minute longer
How long has that evening train been gone
Right now
