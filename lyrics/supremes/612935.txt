Ooo, this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away I fear you're gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that go
Bringin' you back again, hurtin' more and more.


Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
Cause each day that passes by 
You got me never knowin' if I'm comin' or goin'
But I, I love you, this old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes I do.

These old arms of mine miss havin' you around
Makes these tears inside start fallin' down
Always with half a kiss you remind me of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start feelin' cause my head starts spinnin'.

Cause I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do.

Ooo, I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're here for a day, gone for the week now.

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
I'll tell the world about it.

Cause I, I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do
I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you
I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you.
