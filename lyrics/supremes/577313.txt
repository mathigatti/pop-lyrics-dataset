It makes no difference now
What kind of life fate hands me
I'll get along without you
Now that's plain to see


I don't care what happens next
But I'll get by somehow
And I don't worry 'cause
It makes no difference now

Now that we have really parted
I can't believe we're through
And I don't blame myself
And I'm sure I can't blame you

I know something had to happen
And it happened somehow
And I don't worry 'cause
It makes no difference now

After all is said and done
I'll soon forget you
Although I know it will be so hard to do
Let things happen as they will
I'll get by somehow

I don't worry 'cause
It makes no difference now
Not now

Let things happen as they will
I'll get by somehow
I don't worry 'cause
It makes no difference now
