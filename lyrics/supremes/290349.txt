Winds may blow over icy sea
I'll take with me the warmth of thee
A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter, sweeter than wine.


I will return, I'll return
Oh, I'll come back for the honey and you
Now baby, hey.

I'll leave behind my heart to wear
And may it ever remind you of
A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter than wine.

I will return, I'll return
I'll come back for the honey and you.

He never came back to his love so fair
And so she died dreaming of his kiss
His kiss was honey
A taste much bitter than wine
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

I'll return (come on back)
I'm coming back (come on back)
I'll be back now baby (come on back)
I'll be back, ooohI'll come back for the honey
And you, baby (honey!)
You, baby (honey!), you, baby
I'm coming back now baby (come on back).
