Yesterday,
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday


Suddenly,
I'm not half the girl I used to be
There's a shadow hangin' over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why he had to go
I don't know
He wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Why he had to go
I don't know
He wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Mm mm mm mm
