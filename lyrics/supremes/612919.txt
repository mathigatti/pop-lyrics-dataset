There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And God I know I'm one


My mother was a tailor
Sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
The only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh, mother tell your children
Not to do what we have done
Spend your lives in chear misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor girl
And God I know I'm one
