John Henry was born
At the crack of dawn
His mama named Henry
And a daddy named John
His daddy predicted that
While John was growin'
He would be wild
Like the wind that was blowin'


That morn he was born
Was a hurricane
Thunder and lightning
And pouring rain
He's exciting to see
Like the storm he was born in
He took my heart and soul
Without a warning

So treat me nice
Don't be mean, John Henry
Make the girl's faces green with envy
And I'm gonna give you
All the love that's in me
John Henry, John Henry

Oh, rock of a man
You're thrillin' me
I'll take your hand
So willingly
Ready to go
Wherever you lead me
Long as I know
You'll always need me

Oh, Johnny, you are my hero
Without you my life is a zero
So whether I'm happy or in misery
In your arms is where I have to be now

So treat me nice
Don't be mean, John Henry
Make the girl's faces green with envy
And I'm gonna give you
All the love that's in me
John Henry, John Henry

Henry, you know
You've got me goin'
My love for you
Keeps growing and a growing

Treat me nice
Don't be mean, John Henry
Make the girl's faces green with envy
And I'm gonna give you
All the love that's in me
John Henry, John Henry

Treat me nice
Don't be mean, John Henry
