You told me that you love me
You said we'd never part
You took all my love
Then you broke my heart


Never again
Never again will I fall in love

I did everything you wanted me to
'Cause I thought your love was true
But I was blind
And I couldn't see
Why did you do this to me

But I still love you
And I always will
I still thrill to your kiss
But I'll never come back to you
Lying over this

Never again
Will I fall in love
Never again
Never again
