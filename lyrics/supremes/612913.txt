Stop whatever you're doing
Hold it right there
Drop whatever you're doing
There's not a minute to spare
Time is flying, grab it
Break that nowhere habit


TCB And TCB

TCB do it now

Don't sit around and wonder when to
Now is the time for all good men to
You know the way to start today to TCB do it now

Break that routine that's got ya strung out
Come sing a song before you sung
Better begin and jump right in and TCB what you're doing now

Whats the good of living safe and sound
With your head in the sand
Pull it out and look around
Take a stand

There's so much more to life than livin'
Taking is easy, now try givin'
Give up that easy life and make that break
And you'll be TCB
Ya you'll be
TCB

Miss Diana now the stage is yours 
And the lovely Supremes
Thanks to each and everyone of you
You are dreams
No, Diana we're The Temptations
(Dreams are an altitude)
All the formalities are done now
Let's loosen up and have some fun now
Ladies it's time for you to do your thing
Swing out and TCB
Swing out and TCB
Show them you're
Taking Care of Business
Taking Care of Business
Taking Care of Business
