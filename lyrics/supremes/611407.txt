Sometimes we walk hand in hand by the sea
And we breathe in the cool salty air
You turn to me with a kiss in your eyes
And my heart feels a thrill beyond compare


Then your lips cling to mine
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

Sometimes we stand on the top of a hill
And we gaze at the earth and stars
I turn to you and melt in your arms
There we are, darling, only you and I

What a moment to share
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

The world is filled with wond'rous things, it's true
But they wouldn't have much meaning without you

Some quiet evening I sit by your side
And we're lost in a world of our own
I feel the glow of your unspoken love
I'm aware of the treasure that I own

And I say to myself
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love
And I say to myself
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love
