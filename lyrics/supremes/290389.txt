You're slipping away from me
How can I make you see
The warmth has left your heart
It's throwing us apart


Don't let true love die
Don't let it pass us by
Open your heart to me
Make things as they used to be

Our love is falling
And it's hard to hold
It's a flaming fire
I can't control

How can I find the words to say
To keep our love from burning away
Please help me hold on to our love
Love me and I'll make you oh so happy

Don't let true love die
Don't let it pass us by
Anything you ask I'll give
As long as we shall live

I'll do anything forget my pride
'Cause desperation's building up inside
Your heart has turned
To hard cold stone
That I can't touch or leave alone
Why break this aching heart of mine
Come and hold me and tenderly console me

Do anything for you
Anything you ask me too
All of my love I'll give
Just give us a chance to live

Don't let true love die
Don't let it pass us by
Open your heart to me
Let things be as they used to be

Don't let true love die
Don't let it pass us by
Anything you ask I'll give
As long as we shall live

Don't let true love die
Don't let it pass us by
