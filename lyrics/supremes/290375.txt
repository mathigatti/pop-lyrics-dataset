You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much


At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just to good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak

But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just to good to be true
And my baby
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh, baby baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I found you, stay
Let me love you, baby
Let me love you, baby

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
And I wanna hold so much

At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just to good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh, pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I found you, stay
