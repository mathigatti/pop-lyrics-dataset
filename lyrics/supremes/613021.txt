She's alright
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby


I don't want you,
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need you
Oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend 
Another day here
Oh, I want to split now
I can quit now
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
