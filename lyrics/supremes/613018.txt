I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will
You've made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me


I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So what's the use
You've cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near

Here am I with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near

Here am I with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me
You took advantage of me
