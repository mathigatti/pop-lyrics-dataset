Mr. Blues
You are my only companion
Since my baby's gone


Hey, Mr. Blues
You are my lonely companion
Since my baby's gone

How I wish you would go
Away and leave me
Oh, yeah
But I know if you do
I'll be all alone

'Cause you're the only guy
In this whole wide world
That I can call my own

Hey, Mr. Blues
Why did I take you and stay with me
But you've been here every day with me
Since my baby's gone

Oh, Mr. Blues
Although I don't want to hurt you
I know I have to desert you
If my baby comes
If my baby comes
If my baby comes

Hey, Mr. Blues
