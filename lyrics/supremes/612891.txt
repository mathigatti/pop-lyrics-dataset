Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon
Croon a tune
From the heart of Dixie


Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine
Right on the Mason-Dixon line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee, with all the love that's in ya!

Weep no more my lady
Won't you sing that song again, for me
And sing it slow
Just as though you had me on your knee

A Million baby kisses I'll deliver
The minute that you sing the Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby
With a Dixie melody

Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon
Croon a tune
From the heart of Dixie

Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine
Right on the Mason-Dixon line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee, with all the love that's in ya!

Weep no more my lady
Won't you sing that song again, for me
And sing it slow
Just as though you had me on your knee

A Million baby kisses I'll deliver
The minute that you sing the Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby
With a Dixie melody
