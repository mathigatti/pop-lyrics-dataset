In the land of make believe
Each boy and girl receive
A bag of wishes and a star


In the world of fantasy
Your heart stays young and free
And no one cares how old you are
Every girl's a princess
All her skies are blue
Every boy Prince Charming
All their dreams come true

And in the land of make believe
Your heart remains naive
And no one ever says goodbye
So if somewhere you've misplaced
Those rainbows you once chased
Believe and close your eyes
And you'll find the land of make believe

In the land of make believe
Each boy and girl receive
A bag of wishes and a star

In the world of fantasy
Your heart stays young and free
And no one cares how old you are

Every girl's a princess
All her skies are blue
Every boy Prince Charming
All their dreams come true

And in the land of make believe
Your heart remains naive
And no one ever says goodbye

So if somewhere you've misplaced
Those rainbows you once chased
Believe and close your eyes
And you'll find the land of make believe

In the land of make believe
Close your eyes
In the land of make believe
In the land of make believe
Close your eyes
