I am woman, you are man
I am smaller so you can be taller than
I am softer to the touch
It's a feeling I like feeling very much


You are someone whom I admire
Still our friendship leaves something to be desired

Does it take more explanation than this?
I am woman you are man
I am woman you are man
Let's kiss

I am woman, you are man
I am gentle so you can be barbarian
I'm all pleats and pins and rouge
Mostly sham but ma'am
I love the subterfuge

Im am fiction I hope you are fact
Contradiction's what makes it a perfect act

Does it take more explanation than this?
I am woman you are man
I am woman you are man
Let's kiss
