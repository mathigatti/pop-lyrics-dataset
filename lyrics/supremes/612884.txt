If I go a million miles away
I write a letter each and every day
'Cause honey, nothin', 
Nothin' can ever change this love 
I have for you


Ooh, make me weep, 
You can make me cry
See me comin'
And you can pass me by
I know that nothin', 
nothin' can ever change this love 
I have for you

Oh, you're the apple of my eye
You're cherrie pie
Oh you're cake and ice cream
You're sugar and spice
And everything nice
You're the boy of my, my, my dreams

If you wanted to leave me
And roam
When you get back
I'd just say
Welcome home, 
I know that nothin', 
Nothin' can ever change the love 
I have for you

I know that nothin', 
Nothin' can ever change the love 
I have for you
