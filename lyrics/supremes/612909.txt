Sunset, sunset
It's sunset, it's sunset


You went and left happy
You're all alone
You turned and walked away
About this time of day
It was always sunset

Sunset
I didn't want you to see me cry
So I turned my head
To hide the tears in my eyes
I turned when evening shadows fall
That's when I miss you most of all

And oh, it's sunset
Oh, sunset
