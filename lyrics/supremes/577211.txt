I've got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret, or make me frown
I had strings but now I'm free
There are no strings on me


I've got no strings so I have fun
And I'm not tied to anyone
How I love my liberty
There are no strings on me

Hi-ho the me-ri-o
I'm as happy as can be
And I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me

I've got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret, or make me frown
I had strings but now I'm free
There are no strings on me

Why does the gay little dicky bird sing
What put the zing in a butterfly's wing
What's the reason for the smile of a troubadour?

Why does the breeze have a barrel of fun?
Even the bee who's a son of a gun
All because they're free
And stringless the same as me

I've got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret, or make me frown
I had strings but now I'm free
There are no strings on me

I'm as happy as can be
Nothing ever worries me

I've got no strings so I have fun
And I'm not tied to anyone
How I love my liberty
There are no strings on me

There ain't no strings on me
There are no strings on me
