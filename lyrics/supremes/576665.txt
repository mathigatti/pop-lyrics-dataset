I am the beautiful reflection of my love's affection
A walking illustration of his adoration
His love makes you beautiful,
So beautiful, so beautiful
I ask my looking glass
What is it makes me so exquisite?
The answer to my query comes back:
"Dearie, his love makes you beautiful,
So beautiful, so beautiful
And woman loved is woman glorified!"
I'll make a beautiful, beautiful,
Beautiful, beautiful bride!


Oh, his love makes me beautiful,

So beautiful (beautiful)

Oh, woman loved is glorified
I'm gonna make a beautiful bride.
