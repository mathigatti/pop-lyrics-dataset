Little Me
I Have A LOVELY LIGHT
I'm The Star
Upon Your Tree
That makes your christmas bright
Twinkle Twinkle Little me
I left the milky way
Just so I could COME AND be with you on Christmas day


ANGELS brought me where you are
and heaven gave me LIGHT
I'm that friendly little star
you wish upon each night

Twinkle Twinkle
Oh, Twinkle twinkle little me
I have a present too
If you give unshelfishly
and make a wish come true
I'll always shine on you

Twinkle tWINKLE little me
Twinkle twinkle little me
Ooh, Christmas brought me where you are
and heaven gave me LIGHT
I'm that friendly star
you wish upon each night

Twinkle twinkle little me
I have a present too
If you give unshelfishly
and make a wish come true
I'll always shine for you

Twinkle Little me 
I'll always shine for you
Twinkle little me

FADE

I'll always shine for you
