Hi Berry,
This is Diane, this is Mary, Florence
And on behalf of everyone at Motown
We also wish to extend our congratulations


We couldn't get along without you
Just couldn't feel the song without you
Without your hand to guide our way
We'd all be lost somewhere in yesterday
We need your strength
We need your courage too
We need your constant faith to see us through

We couldn't get along without you
Just couldn't feel the song without you
You gave us hope when all our hope was gone
With wise and patient hands you kept hangin' on
When things were dark, You brought us shining light
Words cannot express the way we feel tonight

Berry, on behalf of the people at home
And the people all over this country
To whom you are a shining example
Our deepest congratulations
And of course our deepest love
We need you now more than before
Success is one thing, but you taught us much more

We couldn't get along without you
Just couldn't feel the song without you
The world should know the man inside
Who worked with courage and a deep sense of pride
Your strong and guiding hand has shown us the way
From those who love you most we just want to say

We couldn't get along without you
Just couldn't feel the song without you...
