Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own


Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms would ever hold
I heared somebody whisper 
"Please, adore me"
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

And then there's suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms would ever hold
I heared somebody whisper 
"Please, adore me"
And when I looked 
The moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
