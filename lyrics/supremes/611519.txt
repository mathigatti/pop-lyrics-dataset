Hey life look at me, I can see the reality
Cause when you shook me, took me out of my world
I woke up, suddenly I just woke up to the happening.


When you find that you left the future behind
Cause when you got a tender love you don-t
Take care of, then you better beware of the happening.

One day you-re up, then you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me and it can happen to you.

I was sure, I felt secure, until love took a detour
Yeah, riding high on top of the world
It happened, suddenly it just happened.

I saw my dreams fall apart, when love walked away from my heart
And when you lose that precious love you need to guide you
Something happens inside you, the happening.

Now I see life for what it is
It-s not all dreams, it-s not all bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you
Once!

Ooo, and then it happened
Ooo, and then it happened
Ooo, and then it happened
Ooo, and then it happened.

Is it real, is it fake, is this game of life a mistake
Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine
For certain, suddenly I started hurting.

I saw the light too late, when that fickle finger of fate
Yeah came and broke my pretty balloon
I woke up, suddenly I just walked up to the happening.

So sure, I felt secure, until love took a detour
Cause when you got a tender love you don-t
Take care of, then you better beware of the happening.
