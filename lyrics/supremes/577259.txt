I've got a boy
Sweet as honey
Penny pincher
But they tease him
Penny pincher
'Cause he doesn't spend his money
A penny pincher
That's what they say
So from him
Other girls shy away


But I love him
For what he is
All his love
He truly gives

He may not drive a car
But I love
Those walks through the park
A penny pincher
He may be
But oh, he means
He means the world to me

I don't care
If he won't spend a dime
Just as long
As I know he's mine

Let them tease him
Call him cheap
But in my book
He can't be beat
I love him for
What is within
A tender loving
Trusting friend

I don't care
If he won't spend a dime
Just as long
As I know he's mine

A penny pincher
He may be
But his love
Means the world to me
A penny pincher
He may be
