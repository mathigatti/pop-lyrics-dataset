You were the sunshine baby
Whenever you smile
But I call you Stormy today
All of a sudden that old rains fallin' down
And my world is cloudy and gray
You've gone away


Stormy, ooh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day

Yesterday's love was like the warm summer breeze
But like the weather, you change
Now things are dreary baby
And it's windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain
Calling your name

Ooh Stormy, ooh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day
Bring 'em back, bring 'em back

Ooh Stormy, ooh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day
Bring 'em back, bring 'em back
Bring back that sunny day
Stormy, stormy
