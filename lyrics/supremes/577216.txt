Johnny could only sing one note
And the note he sang was this:
Ah


Poor Johnny one note sang out with gusto
And just overloaded the place
Poor Johnny one note he yelled willy-nilly
Until he was blue in the face
For holding one not was his ace

Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class
By himself, by gum

Poor Johnny one note got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note
Howled like the North Wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned round in his grave!

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Everyone was mute
Johnny stood alone

Sing Johnny one note
Sing out with gusto and just overwhelm all the crowd

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Everyone was mute
Johnny stood alone

Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class
By himself, by gum

Sing Johnny one note
Sing out with gusto and just overwhelm all the crowd
