I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that girl again
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that


Well it's the second time I've caught you talking to her
And it's the second time I've caught you being unfair
I think I'll let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I can't help this feeling I'll go out of my mind
You know I'll let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that, oh

Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I can't help this feeling I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that
