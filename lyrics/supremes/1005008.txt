There's a small hotel
With a wishing well
I wish that we were there together


There's a bridal suite
One room, bright and neat
Complete for us to share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who needs people

When the steeple bell
Says goodnight sleep well
We'll wish that wishing well
Bring that steeple bell
We'll thank that small hotel together

Not a sign of people who needs people

When the steeple bell
Says goodnight sleep well
We'll wish that wishing well
Bring that steeple bell
Thank that small hotel together
