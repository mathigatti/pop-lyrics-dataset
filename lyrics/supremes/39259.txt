Girls, gather 'round me and hear the news
He finally kissed me, oh, happy days
My heart's gotta shout it
I'll get my diary and write about it


(Well, as your friends, we wanna say
He'll break your heart one day
So you better run, run, run, run, run, run
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh, but he's such a quiet kind of guy
How he thrills me, my oh my
Maybe it isn't true
What they say about him

(Don't be fooled by the shyness in his eyes) His eyes
(And don't you know he's just a devil in disguise
So you better run, run, run, run, run, run
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Ooooooh, ooooooh

(Well, as your friends, we wanna say
He'll make a fool of you one day
So you better run, run, run, run, run, run
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

No, no, no, but how can I run away
When I love him more each day
So with him, I'm gonna stay
I'll take my chances along the way

He won my heart from the start
From him, I will never never part
I love him so, love him so
Never let him go

Every time he gets nearer
My love gets dearer, so much dearer
Oh no no no noooo
