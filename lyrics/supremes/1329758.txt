Oh, little town of Bethlehem 
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless 
Sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in they dark streets shineth 
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all 
The years are met in thee tonight


For Christ is born of Mary 
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep 
The angels keep 
Their watch of wondering love
Oh, morning stars together
Proclaim the Holy birth
And praises sing 
To God the King 
And peace to men on Earth

How silently, how silently 
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts 
The blessings of his heaven
No ear may hear his coming 
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls 
Will receive him still 
The dear Christ enters in

Oh, holy child of Bethlehem 
Descend to us we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in 
Be born in us today
We hear the christmas angels 
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us 
Our Lord Emanuel
