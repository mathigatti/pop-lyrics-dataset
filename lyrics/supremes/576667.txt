He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy.


Sweet kisses are his claim to fame
In my heart he'll always remain
True fine loving is his game
Honey boy is his name
He's sugar, he's spice
He's everything that's nice.

He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy.

I'd rather have a minute of his time
Than all the gold in the Fort Knox mine
My whole he inspired
Loving him is my desire
Always near when I need him most
That's why I love the boss.

He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy.

If you see me in my prettiest dress
It's for him I look my best
Nobody can take him from me
Because he has everlasting loyalty
He's sugar, he's spice
He's everything that's nice.

He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
He's my honey boy, my ever loving pride and joy
Yes indeed.
