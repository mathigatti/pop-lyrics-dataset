Joy to the world
The lord is come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing


Joy to the world
The savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness
The wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders, and wonders
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders, and wonders
Of his love
