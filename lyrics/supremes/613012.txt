You think you're so wayout
And you get all the action
But still you can't find no satisfaction


You specialize in playing the field
But now that the game
Has lost its appeal

Baby, try me
I'll make you see
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', babe
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall, you ain't livin' at all
At all

You like to kiss and run
And think that's where it is
'Cause somebody told you
Love was heartache and tears
You won't take a chance
On nobody else
You think you can make it
All by yourself

Baby, try me
And I'll make you see
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', babe
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall, you ain't livin' at all
At all

To be in love
I know it's not your ambition
So before you go
Think about my proposition

You may conquer the world
And be king of your throne
But you still ain't nobody, babe
When you're sittin' all alone

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', babe
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
ooh, until you fall, you ain't livin' at all
At all

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', babe
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin'
Ooh, try me
You ain't livin'
Ooh, I'll make you see
You ain't livin'
Oh, yeah how sweet
You ain't livin'
