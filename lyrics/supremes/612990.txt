Would you like to ride
In my beautiful balloon ?
Would you like to glide
In my beautiful balloon ?
We could flow among the stars
Together you and I
For we can fly
For we can fly


Up and away
In my beautiful
My beautiful balloon

The world's a nicer place
In my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face
In my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song
And sail along the silversky
For we can fly
For we can fly

Up and away
In my beautiful
My beautiful balloon

Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the sky for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hide us
Keep the moon beside us

Love is waiting there
In my beautiful balloon
Way up in the air
In ly beautiful balloon
If you'll hold my hand
We'll chase your dream across the sky
For we can fly
For we can fly

Up and away
In my beautiful
My beautiful balloon

Up, up and away
Up, up and away
Up, up and away
Up, up and away
Up, up and away
