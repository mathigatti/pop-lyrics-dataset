Let the music play
Just a little longer
Just a little longer
Let me hold him in my arms
A little longer


Make the music play
Just a little slower
Just a little slower
Let me hear his tender sighs
A little longer

Make the music play
Keep this magic going
Keep those trumpets blowing
All through the night

Don't ever skip a beat for
He may slip away
And if we were parted
I'd be broken hearted
Till he's in my arms to stay
Please let the music play

Make the music play
Just a little slower
Till he's in my arms to stay
Please let the music play

Let the music play
Keep this magic going
Keep those trumpets blowing
All through the night

Don't ever skip a beat for
He may slip away
And if we were parted
I'd be broken hearted
Till he's in my arms to stay
Please let the music play

Let the music play
Just a little longer
Let the music play
Just a little longer
Let the music play
Just a little longer
Let the music play
