Too much a little too soon
That's how I let myself go
Too much a little too soon
But how was I to know


You would flirt and win my love
And then you'd hurt me
Take my heart and tear it apart
And then desert me

All my friends tried to tell me
I should hesitate
But I was blind and couldn't see
Why I should have to wait

I gave you all the love that I had
But now I know why I'm so sad
'Cause I gave you

Too much a little too soon
That's how I gave you my love
Too much a little too soon
'Cause you were not worthy of

All the efforts I put forth
To keep you satisfied
The excuses I accepted
All the times you lied

The way that I loved you
Was the only way I could
I gave you my all and all
But that's not always good

I thought you were really okay
So I let you steal my heart away
I really gave you

Too much a little too soon
I should have kept some reserve
Too much a little too soon
That much you did not deserve

I thought you were really okay
So I let you steal my heart away
I really gave you

Too much a little too soon
I should have kept some reserve
Too much a little too soon
One more time
That much you did not deserve

Too much a little too soon
I should have kept some reserve
Too much a little too soon
Yeah, yeah, yeah
