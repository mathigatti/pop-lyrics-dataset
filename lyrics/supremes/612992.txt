You won't believe it
You can't conceive it
You won't believe your eyes


Wait till you see him
See how he looks
Wait till you see him laugh
Painters of paintings
Writers of books
Never could tell the half

Wait till you feel the warmth of his glance
Pensive and sweet and wise
All of it lovely
All of it thrilling
I'll never be willing to free him
When you see him
You won't believe your eyes

Painters of paintings

Wait till you feel the warmth of his glance
Pensive and sweet and wise
All of it lovely
All of it thrilling
I'll never be willing to free him

You won't believe your eyes
