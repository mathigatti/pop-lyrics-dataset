It's times like this, love
When my heart is filled with heavenly bliss
And you've given me a tender kiss
I begin to realize I'm so thankful that you're mine
'Cause I'm glad, so glad
Glad, glad I got somebody like you around


My heart grows fonder, baby, of you each and every day
Can't you hear it's singing praises, baby
To you in its own sweet way
Let you know sure I'm glad I got you
I don't think I could make it without you
'Cause I'm glad, so glad
Glad, glad I got somebody like you around

Glad, glad, glad, glad I got you
Glad, glad, glad, glad I got you

You better believe I'm having the time of my life
I'd be so proud if you'd ask me to be your wife
I hope and pray that it might be real soon
Like early in the morning or right this afternoon
'Cause I'm glad, so glad
I'm glad, glad I got somebody like you around

I remember all the tears, love
You washed away through childhood years
You were always very near, love
When I needed somebody, when I needed somebody
When I needed somebody like you around
When I needed somebody, when I needed somebody
When I needed somebody like you around
'Cause I'm glad, glad I got you
I'm glad, glad, glad, glad I got you.
