We'll laugh 'till the tears start falling
Love 'till a new love's calling
Talk 'till it seems we've said it all before


But when my words no longer reach you
When I've nothing left to teach you
I'll let a little breeze blow me out the door

We'll kiss away each others sorrow
Live as though there's no tomorrow
It would we can give until there's nothing more
But when I ask and you refuse me
'Cause you don't care if you should lose me
I'll let a little breeze blow me out the door

You know that I'll never leave you
While I know that I still please you
And perhaps our love will last forever more

But if there are tears I must cry them
And you no longer want to dry them
I'll let a little breeze blow me out the door
I'll let a little breeze blow me out the door
