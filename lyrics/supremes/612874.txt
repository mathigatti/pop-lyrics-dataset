When he was born long ago on Christmas night
Above his head a little star was shining bright
The wise men followed that light above.


Little bright star lead us today to his love
Little church bells keep ringing
Little church bells keep ringing.

Little church bells ringing out at Christmas time
Reminding us that the star of love still shines
Not just at Christmas but every day.

Little bright star, you're there to show us the way
Little bright star keep shining
Little bright star keep shining.

Oh little star shining over every land
Just keep on glowing so the world can understand
The joy of Christmas comes from within.

Little bright star, please keep on shining for all means
Keep on shining, keep on shining
Little bright star keep shining
Keep on shining, keep on shining.
