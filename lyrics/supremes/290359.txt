You said you loved me
We'd never part
Now you're breaking
Yes you are breaking my heart
Baby don't go, don't go, don't go, baby don't go
Stay and tell me I'm still your baby


You found another love
But it can't be true
Because you love me
And I'll always love you
Baby don't go, don't go, don't go, baby don't go
Stay and tell me I'm still your baby

True love is hard to find
But you'll never never never find a love like mine
Darling, yes, my darling
Yes, stay stay by my side
Baby don't go, don't go, baby don't go Don't go, don't go, baby don't go
Stay and tell me I'm still your baby
Stay and tell me I'm still your baby
I wanna be, I wanna be your baby Come on...
