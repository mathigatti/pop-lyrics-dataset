Take your love from me
I'll turn to stone
Turn to stone


If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone
Turn to stone

I need your love in every way
It's your love I cling to
When things slip away
Take your love away
I'll be lost and alone
No reason for living
All purpose would be gone

Without you there
For my eyes to behold
My life would be empty
My heart would grow old

If you take your love from me
I'll turn to stone
Turn to stone

If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone
Turn to stone

When I think of love
I think of me and you
When I think of happiness
I think of us too

You're my yesterdays
And all my tomorrows
You're the air I breathe
Everything I need

If from my life
You were ever gone
I'd fall to pieces
You I depend on

If you take your love from me
I'll turn to stone
Turn to stone

If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone
Turn to stone

Picture me without you
You see someone searching
A figure of sadness
Who's heart won't stop hurting

Sorrow would be written
On my face
By the pen of loneliness
Time couldn't erase
I'd be like a statue in a park
Cold and alone
A girl with no heart

If you take your love from me
I'll turn to stone
Turn to stone

If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone
Turn to stone

Turn to stone
Turn to stone
Just turn to stone, turn to stone
If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone
Turn to stone
