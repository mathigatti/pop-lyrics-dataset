When the moon is in the seventh house
And Jupiter aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars


This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
Age of Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius

Harmony and understanding
Sympathy and trust abounding
No more lies and no derisions
Golden living dreams of visions
Mystic crystal revelation
And the mind's true liberation
Aquarius
Aquarius

Let the sunshine
Let the sunshine in
The sunshine in

Let the sunshine
Let the sunshine in
The sunshine in

Let the sunshine
Let the sunshine in
The sunshine in
