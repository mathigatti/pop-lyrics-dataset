Baby, I know all about you
I heard long ago about you
They say you're mighty fast
You've got a wicked past
Ooo, all I know about you.


You'll never get my heart
Won't be upsetting my heart
I'll never treat you, won't
I'm just too well in bond
Ooo, all I know about you.

And if you think that you
can steal my heart a word
Why don't you try, I dare you to try
If you play you're gonna lose the game
'Cause I will never take my guard away
Come on and try
Though I'm nice I'll be cold as ice
Cause I know all about you.

Baby, I know all about you
There's nothing slow about you
Kiss me and then you'll see
Wonder within of me
Ooo, all I know about you.

Baby, I'm mad about you
I'm so glad about you
One little kiss and wow
I'm a believer now
Ooo, all I know about you, babe.

I'm so wild about you
I feel like a child about you
It felt like this before
I wanna kiss ya more
Ooo, all I know about you, babe.

I know all about you
And I like what I know about you
One little kiss and wow
I'm a believer now
Ooo, all I know about you.
