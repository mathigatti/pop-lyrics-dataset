When I had you here
I treated you bad
And wrong my dear
And since
Oh, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
And I wonder
Who is loving you


Life without love
Don't you know it's oh so lonely
I don't think
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Well my life
All my love I devote to you only
Come on and take it
Come on and take it

Because all
All I can do
All I can do since you've been gone is cry
And since, boy, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
And I wonder, who is loving you
Wonder who is loving you
