If he'd just take one look at me
Or maybe touch my hand
I'd bow down and tell him
His every wish is my command


My nights are so lonely
I'm thinking of him only
Oh how can I make him see
He means the world to me

My friends all tell me that I'm silly
That my love for him he'll never see
But I, I can't help it
He means the world to me

He means the world to me
World to me
My friends say I'm silly, silly, silly
But I really care
I'm here to tell you
That he means the world
I really care
