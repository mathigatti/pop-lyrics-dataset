Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful hurt I feel inside


Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Live through the loneliness
The endless emptiness
I go through

And when you lose a little sleep at night
Cause you ain't been treated right
Then you know heartaches are sad
Sitting by the telephone
Being left all alone
Then you know why I'm feeling bad
Put yourself in my place

And when you're just about to go insane
Cause it hurts to love in vain
Ask a girl who's been in love
I believed your evil line
Now I'm left alone and crying
Alone to count the stars above

Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful emptiness
I feel inside
Put yourself in my place

Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it baby

Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
Why don't you, why don't you
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it baby

Put yourself in my place
