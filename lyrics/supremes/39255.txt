I want a guy to love me
One who will love me completely
Not like the last
Who's in the past
Who broke my heart and made me cry


I wish that he would come and kiss me
And tell me that he misses me
I know someday
He'll come my way
And I'll never be lonely again

I don't need riches like diamond rings
As long as he loves me, that's everything
As long as he holds me tight
As long as he treats me right
I'll never let him out of my sight

I want a guy with a love that's true
One that I can tell my troubles to
He'll be my guy
And stay by my side
I'd be so glad if I only had

A guy, a guy
Why can't I have a guy?
A guy
