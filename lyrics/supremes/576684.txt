A girl wants a man to do
Oh, baby (Oh, baby)

I know you'll never get tired of me
Oh, baby (Oh, baby)
And I'm gonna use every trick in the book
I'll try my best to get you hooked
Hey, baby (Hey, baby)

And every night, every day

I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you
Look out boy, 'cause I'm gonna get you

I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will
Yes I will
And I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will
You know I will

Every breathe I take
And each and every step I make
Brings me closer, baby
Closer to you

And with each beat of my heart
For every day we're apart
I'll hunger for every wasted hour

And I...
Every night
And every day
I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you
Look out, 'cause I'm gonna get you

I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will
Yes I will
I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will
Yes I will

I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will
Yes I will
I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will
