Sing a simple song
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
I'm talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking in my sleep
I'm walking, walking, walking, walking, walking in the street
Time is passing, I grow older, things are happening fast
All I have to hold on to is a simple song at last.


Let me hear you say ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Let me hear you say ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Sing a simple song, you gotta try a little
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, oh yeah, oh yeah.

I'm living, living, living life with all its ups and downs (you too?)
I'm giving, giving, giving love and smiling at the frowns (me too!)
You're in trouble when you find it's hard for you to smile
A simple song will make it better for a little while.

Let me hear you say ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Let me hear you girls: yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm talking, talking, talking, talking
I'm walking, walking, walking, walking
I'm living, living, living, living
I'm giving love and so much love
Everybody sing together
Ya, ya, ya ya, ya, oooo
Let me hear you say ya, ya, ya ya, ya
Time for you ladies to do your thing.
