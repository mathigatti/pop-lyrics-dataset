Stay with me, baby
Till Johnny comes
He'll come one day, I know it
But he's having fun


He's out painting the world scarlet red
And he's left me alone to be blue
One day he'll come to take me away
From this love I've been sharing with you

Stay with me, baby
Please, stay
Till Johnny comes

Stay with me, baby
And hold me near
Just the way Johnny used to hold me
When he was here

'Cause when last he was here, we were kissing
And I thrilled to the way he spoke my name
When he thinks of the true love he's been missing
He'll be coming back to stake his claim

Stay with me, baby
Please, stay
Till Johnny comes

Since Johnny's been gone
You have dried all of the tears I have cried
Won't you stay here by my side
Till Johnny shows
And I'll tell Johnny he's come too late
Just how long did he think I would wait

And then stay with me forever
Won't you stay with me forever
After Johnny goes

Stay with me, baby
Forever and ever and ever and ever
Stay with me, baby
