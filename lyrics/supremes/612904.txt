There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us somewhere


There's a time for us
Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn, time to care

Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving somewhere

Yes, there's a place for each of us
A place of peace and quiet
And we must try to persue this place
Where love is like a passion that burns like a fire
And also fulfillment of two hearts' desire
Let our efforts be as determined as that of a little stream
That saunters down the hillside seeking its level
Only to become a huge river destined to the sea

Yes, there's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Hold my hand and were halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow, someday
Somewhere

Hold my hand and were halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow, someday
Somewhere
