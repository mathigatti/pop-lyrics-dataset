Whenever I'm with him
Something inside starts to burnin'
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be a devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?


It's like a heat wave
Burnin' in my heart
I can't keep from cryin'
It's tearin' me apart

Whenever he calls my name
Soft, low, sweet and plain
I feel, right there
I feel that burnin' flame
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?

It's like a heat wave
Burnin' in my heart
I can't keep from cryin'
It's tearin' me apart

Sometimes I stare in space
Tears all over my face
I can't explain it
Don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before
Now this funny feelin' has me amazed
I don't know what to do
My head's in a haze

It's like a heat wave

I feel it 
Burnin', right here in my heart
It's like a heat wave
