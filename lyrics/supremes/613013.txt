I thought that I had forgotten you
That you were just something of my yesterdays
But now that I see you standing here
All that I can say


Is let me tell you that
You bring back memories
Of all the days gone by
Apologies all of the times you lied
I recall when I used to be your girl
You used to be my guy
I thought that I had forgotten all these days
Think about these days

But let me tell you
You don't know how many memories
That you bring
Bringing back memories

Just a look at you
You don't know what you make me want to do
I want to take you in my arms and then kiss you once again 
And then I'd like to ask you
Where have you been
I never thought that I would think about
These things

But let me tell you
You don't know how many memories
That you bring
Bringing back memories

Let me tell you
Let me tell you
Let me tell you I thought that I had forgotten of things
About how you looked at me
Just a look at you brings back the memories

You bring back memories
About the love we knew
D'ya think I was still in love with you
But that ain't true
I love you just like I used to do
I thought that I had forgotten all of these things

But let me tell you
You don't know how many memories
That you bring
Bringing back memories
Sweet, sweet, sweet memories
Memories
Sweet, sweet, sweet memories
Bringing back memories
