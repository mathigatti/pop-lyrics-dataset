Spoken intro by Mary Wilson:
Share what you've got
To keep what you need.
Right? Wrong!
Because I need all of you
I may share many things in life
But I will never share my man...


Everytime you love you love me
The way I like it, yeah
Everytime it's something different
I wouldn't share you if I could
You make me feel light as a breeze
Flying like an eagle
Touching life with ease
See the glow you excite within me
Ooh, the love is bursting, bursting in me

ALL:
High...High Energy
High...High Energy

You make me feel light as a breeze
Flying like an eagle
Touching life with ease
See the glow you excite within me
Ooh, the love is bursting, bursting in me

ALL:
High...High Energy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
High...High Energy
High...High Energy
High...High Energy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh...Wow!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
