Come on, come on
Come on to the beach ball with me
Come on, come on
Come on to the beach ball with me


The surf band is playing loud 
They swim and they jerk for the swinging crowd
And if you get the notion
You can go and surf the ocean
Gonna have a fun loving time
Gonna play in the sunshine

So come on, come on 
Come on to the beach ball with me
Come on, come on
Come on to the beach ball with me

You bring your guy, I'll bring mine
Everybody's gonna have a good time
Splishin' and splashin' fun everlasting
Hurry up, everyone, time is passing
So come on, gang, and let's have a ball 
All for one and one for all

So come on, come on 
Come on to the beach ball with me
Come on, come on
Come on to the beach ball with me
Come on, come on
Come on to the beach ball with me

Hand in hand walking through the sand
Watching the surfers
Take a chance
If sidewalk surfing is not your style
Come on, dance the jerk a while

You can go and surf the ocean
Gonna have a fun loving time
Gonna play in the sunshine

So come on, come on 
Come on to the beach ball with me
Come on, come on
Come on to the beach ball with me
Come on, come on
Come on to the beach ball with me
