I never met a boy who makes me feel
The way that you do (You're alright)
Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real
I say that you do (You're outta sight)
So fee fi fo fum
Look out baby
'Cause here I come


And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready
Get ready
I'm gonna try to make love to you
So get ready
Get ready, here I come
I'm on my way

If you wanna play hide and seek with love
Let me remind you (It's alright)
The loving you're gonna miss and the time
It takes to find you (It's outta sight)
So fiddleleedee fiddlelee dum
Look out baby
'Cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready
Get ready
I'm gonna try to make love to you
So get ready
Get ready, here I come
I'm on my way

All my friends shouldn't want me to
I understand it (We'll be alright)
I hope I'll get to you before they do
The way I find you (Be outta sight)
So twiddledeedee twiddleddedum

Look out baby
'Cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready
Get ready
I'm gonna try to make love to you
So get ready
Get ready, here I come
I'm on my way
