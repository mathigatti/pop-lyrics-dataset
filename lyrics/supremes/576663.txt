Oh, Western Union man
Send a telegram to my baby
Send a telegram, send a telegram, oh
Send a telegram to my baby
This is all I want you to say.


(I want you to)
Tell her that I'm all alone
I tried to call her on the phone
Tell her I'm in misery
Think she's avoiding me
If a telegram won't do
Send a box of candy too
Maybe some flowers
Tell her that I miss her for hours and hours
Send a telegram, send a telegram, oh
Send a telegram, oh, to my baby
Do you hear what I say?

Oh, Western Union man, send a telegram!
Oh, send a telegram to my baby
Western Union man, send a telegram!
Send a telegram, send a telegram, oh
Send a telegram, man, to my baby
This is what I want you to do:

Listen, tell'er
Have you got a boy you can send
This is what I want him to do
Put him on his bike right away
See if he can get a message through
Maybe tomorrow, mail it right away
Want the girl to know that I miss her
Something like yesterday
Send a telegram, send a telegram, oh
Send a telegram, man! To my baby.

Western Union man, send a telegram
Send a telegram to my baby
Western Union man, send a telegram, oh
Send a telegram, send a telegram, send it
Send a telegram, oh, to my baby
Do you hear what I say?

Hey Western Union man, send a telegram, oh
Send a telegram to my baby
Western Union man, send a telegram
Send it, man, send it to my baby (send it, send it)
To my baby, send it right away.

Western Union man, send a telegram
Oh, send a telegram to my baby
Western Union man, hey, send a telegram.
