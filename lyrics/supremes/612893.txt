You're building a private heaven
You're reaching out so far
When you reach your goal
With joys untold
At least
Save me star


When you finish
Your private heaven
Think of me
Wherever you are
Remember how true
I was to you

And at least won't you
Save me star

Though I'd hate to see you go
A kiss for luck and fame
But if you should stumble
And your heaven tumble
I'll welcome you home again

When you finish your private heaven
Though it be near or far
Once again I'll call to say
At least won't you
Save me a star
Oh, save me a star
