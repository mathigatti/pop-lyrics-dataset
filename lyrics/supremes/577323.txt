When I was down
And life was filled with emptiness
You gave me love
A tender love to take the loneliness away


Oh, happy days
That lifted darkness from my eyes
And made me see
The dawn of happiness arrive and bring to me
A special love

Just your touch
I feel such joy and ecstasy
Life is gay
Instead of pity and sympathy
You gave me love
Wonderful love
Sweet, sweet love

Like a child
I was helpless and alone
And so I cried
But you came and held me close
And dried my eyes

I'm satisfied
I feel content to know the
Heavens made you mine
'Cause here on earth
I never thought that I could find
Such a tender love

Like a toy
I just sat there on the shelf
Till the day that you came
To take me for yourself
And gave me love

Wonderful love
Thank you darling
Thank you honey

You gave me love
Bless the name
That I took with no regrets
For the years have come and gone
It's just like when first we've met

You gave me love
Wonderful love
Sweet, sweet love
I bless the day you came my way
You gave me love
Thank you baby
Bless you honey
Sweet baby
Wonderful love
Tender love
I'm satisfied yeah
I'm satisfied yeah
