When the work begins to pile up
And your temper starts to rile up
That's the time a fellow needs a song


Doctor, banker, butcher, baker
You can be a merry maker
If you keep on singing all day long
If you're hanging in suspense from eight 'till five
And you wanna keep the sense of humour alive

Just whistle while you work
Put on that grin and start right in
To whistle loud and long

Just hum a merry tune
Do your best, then take a rest
And sing yourself a song

When there's too much to do
Don't let it bother you
Forget your troubles
Try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee
And whistle while you work
Come on get smart, tune up and startin' whistle while you work

Hey Mary, come on, you look a little tired
I want you to try this
OK
Golly, I'm chewin' bubblegum?

Hey Flo, come on it's your turn
Don't, come on
No, darling, I'm too busy digging this drummer

When there's too much to do
Don't let it bother you
Forget your troubles
Try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee

Hey, whistle while you work
Come on get smart, tune up and start to whistle while you

Hey Flo come on your turn
Mary?
Come on Florence, I'll teach you
