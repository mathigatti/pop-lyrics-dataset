When day is done and you come home
You shouldn't spend your nights alone
That's when you need me baby


To always know that someone cares
And love like mine should be shared
We'll see you'll need me baby

We'll build up dreams and memories
And maybe raise a family
So give your love to one who yearns
I'll promise true love in return
How can you be so blind
Can't you see you need me

If you should disappoint me
And refuse my love
I know my heart would die
'Cause you are my reason for living
My heart and soul I'm giving
Darling hear my cry
You need me

To me my love's sacred thrill
It's all for you and you alone
You see you need me baby
Though you may find another who
Might take your love and be untrue
You see you need me baby

Have you experienced in the past
One sided love affairs don't last
No need to take a chance at all
When I'm just waiting for your call

How can you be so blind
Can't you see you need me
You need me, you need me
