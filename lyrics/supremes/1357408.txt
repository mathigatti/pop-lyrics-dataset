And whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles 
And warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages 
Tied up with strings
These are a few 
Of my favorite things


Cream colored ponies 
And crisp apple streudeles
Doorbells and sleigh bells 
And schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly 
With the moon 
On their wings
These are a few 
Of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses 
With blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay 
On my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters 
That melt into springs
These are a few 
Of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember 
My favorite things
And then I 
Don't feel so bad

Raindrops on roses 
And whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles 
And warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages 
Tied up with strings
These are a few 
Of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses 
With blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay 
On my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters 
That melt into springs
These are a few 
Of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember 
My favorite things
I simply remember 
My favorite things
And then I 
Don't feel so bad
