Whisper you love me boy
Say the words you seldom say
You love me more 
Each passing day
Whisper you love me boy
Just the way you used to do
When our love was true
It's been so long 
Since you held me in your arms
Ooh, the joy it brings 
Hearing you say sweet things


Whisper you love me boy
Make it sound soft and dear
Tender and sincere
Whisper you love me boy
Say it in your sweet way
The things I seldom hear you say
You used to say 
You love me the most
But now you hardly ever hold me close

Whisper you love me boy
Whisper, whisper
