Up every day at six
Bacon and eggs to fix
Four kids from one to four
Pretty soon there'll be one more


I got old floors to wax and scrub
Dirty old ring in the tub
I'll get a maid someday
But till then I'm queen of the house

No time to fix my hair
I need a new wig to wear
Old clothes will have to do
'Cause the kids all need new shoes

I got bridge club on Tuesday night
He goes out with the boys and gets tight
Its the day it makes me glad I'm
Queen of the house

I know the milk man
Ice man is coming today
They give me chips on the horses to play
And when I get some time to spare
I sit and wish that I had met a rich millionaire

Up every day at six
Bacon and eggs to fix
Four kids from one two three four
Pretty soon there'll be one more

But Sundays I'm mighty glad
I send the kids to his mum and dad
Its the day that makes me glad I'm
Queen of the house

Up every day at six
Bacon and eggs to fix
Four kids from one to four
Pretty soon there'll be one more

Sundays I'm mighty glad
I send the kids to his mum and dad
It's the day that makes me glad I'm
Queen of the house
