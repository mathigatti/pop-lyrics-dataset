Telling me that he was on his way
And he wants me to meet him at the station

In the letter he told me he still loved me
Ain't that good news
Yeah, ain't that news
In the letter he told me he loved me

Found out he don't want nobody else
He said he wants me all to himself now

Where we can finally be alone
Disconnect my telephone now
