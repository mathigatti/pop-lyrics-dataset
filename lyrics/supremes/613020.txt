I believe in everything you do
My heart and soul goes out to you
This world was made for boys like you
You never made me cry
You never told me a lie


You've been wonderful to me
Ooh, so wonderful to me
Oh, yes you have
Wonderful, wonderful

You're wonderful and kind
You're forever gently on my mind
Even in my sleep I have wonderful dreams
You're always there speaking sofly it seems
Telling me how much I mean to you
Oh, darling you're my dream come true

You're wonderful to me
So wonderful to me
Oh, yes you are

Some day I'll find the words to say
To let you know how much I appreciate
Your being true and loving me the way you do
There's a smile upon my heart
Knowing you'll never say you'll part

You've been so wonderful to me
So wonderful to me
Oh, yes you have
Wonderful
Wonderful to me
Wonderful
Oh, yes you have
Wonderful
You've been so wonderful
Wonderful
Oh, yes you have
