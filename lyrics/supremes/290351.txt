If you need me
call me
no matter where you are
no matter how far


Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry

No wind (no wind)
no rain (no rain)
No winter's cold
can stop me
Babe (Oh Babe)
Baby (Baby)
If you're not cold

Oh

No wind
No rain
Can stop me baby if you are gone

I know
I know you must follow the sun
wherever it leads
But remember
if you should fall short of your desires
remember life holds for you one guarantee
you'll always have me

And if you should miss my lovin'
One of these old (days)
If you should ever miss the arms that use(d) to hold you so close
Or the lips that use(d) to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember
what I told you the day I set you free

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me, keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (one more time)
Ain't no river wide enough (say it again)
To keep me from you

Repeat to fade
