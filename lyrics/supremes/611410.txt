He was born on a mountain top in Tennessee
Greenest state in the Land of the Free
Raised in the woods so he knew every tree
Killed himself a bear when he was only three
Davy, Davy Crocket
King of the wild fronteer


He was a cardfan man
His life was worthy
He had love in his hands
And his hands were dirty
And the sky turned to fire
On the day of his birth

Now he lost his love and his grief was gall
In his heart he wanted to leave it all
And lose himself in the forest tall
But answered instead his country's call
Davy, Davy Crocket
King of the Wild Fronteer

He was a mighty big man
In a mighty big land
Had a mighty big heart
And mighty big hand
When his country called
He met the demand

Fought single-handed through the Injun War
Till the creeks was swept and peace was in store
And while he was handlin this risky chore
Made himself a legend forevermore
Davy, Davy Crocket
King of the Wild Fronteer

At night he walked to the woods alone
Winding his beard
Way back home
A hero's curse, a man alone

Looking for a place where the air smells clean
Where the tree is tall and the grass is green
Where the fish is fat in an untouched stream
And teemin' woods is a hunter's dream
Hey, Davy, Davy Crocket
King of the Wild Fronteer

He was a big, big man
Davy, Davy Crocket
King of the Wild Fronteer
He sure loved those woods
Davy, Davy Crocket
King of the Wild Fronteer
Mmm, Davy!
