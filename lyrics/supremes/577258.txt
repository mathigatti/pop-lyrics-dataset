He was only sixteen
Only sixteen
I loved him so
But he was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know


We'd laughed at sixteen
And do little things
That makes my heart glow
But he was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

Now, why did I give my heart so fast
It will never happen again
But I was a mere girl of sixteen
I've aged a year since then

He was only sixteen
Only sixteen
With eyes that would glow
But he was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

Why did he give your heart so fast
It never will happen again
But you was a mere girl of sixteen
I've aged a year since then

He was only sixteen
Only sixteen
I loved him so
But he was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

He was only sixteen
Only sixteen
I loved him so
But he was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

Only sixteen
Only sixteen
I loved him so...
