I know where you've been
As surely as you stand there
You're seeing her again
Don't say you haven't been there


It's in your eyes
There's no misunderstanding
I've seen that look before
The last time you left me stranded

Oh no my love,
Don't go my love
You know I how try to satisfy
You can't deny that I've been good to you

Can't you see
It's me who loves you babe
Can't you see
It's me who needs you babe

I'm the one you can always depend on
I'm the one who's always here

Does she give you something
That I just don't possess
Are my kisses not as sweet
Is she better than my best

I can't fight the shadow
Of some girl I never see
But her love is no greater
Than the love for you and me

Oh no my love
Don't go my love
Why can't I make you understand
I've got all the love you need

Can't you see
It's me who loves you babe
Can't you see
It's me who needs you babe

I'm the one
You can always depend on
I'm the one
Who's always here

Can't you see it's me
Oh baby
Can't you see it's me
Open up your eyes
Can't you see it's me
Oh baby
Can't you see me

You must be blind if you can't see
How much I love you babe
You must be blind if you can't see
How much I need you babe

Open up your eyes
Can't you see me
Oh baby
Can't you see
Can't you see me
