Come on and see me, baby
Come on and see me, baby
Come on and see me


If you need a lover
Truer than any other
Come on and see me
If you need a heart
That will never tear apart
Come on and see me
'Cause I've got a true love
Just for you, love

And it can be yours eternally
If you want it
You better come and get it
I say if you want it bad
Come and get it

If you need a lover
That'll stick right by you, brother
Come on and see me
I'll stand by your side
I'll dry your weeping eyes
Come on and see me
'Cause I've got joy, love
For some boy, love

And it can be yours eternally
If you want it
You better come and get it
I say if you want it bad
Come and get it

Baby, come on and see me now
Sugar, come on and see me now
Honey, come on and see me now
Baby, come on

I've got joy, love
For some boy, love
And it can be yours eternally
If you want it
Come and get it
Baby, come on and see me now
If you want it bad come and get it
Sugar, come on and see me now
If you want it bad come and get it
Honey, come on and see me now
If you want it bad come and get it
Darling, come on and see me now
