We are having a party
Dancing to the music
Played by the D.J.
On the radio


The cokes are in the ice box
Popcorn's on the table
Me and my baby
We're out here on the floor

So mister, mister D.J.
Keep those records playing
'Cause we're having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

Havin' a party
Everybody's swinging, dancing to the music
On the radio

We are havin' a party
Everybody's swinging, dancing to the music
On the radio

So mister, mister D.J.
Keep those records playing
'Cause we're having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

Sally's doing that twist
If you take requests
I've got a few for you
Play that song called "Shot gun"
Play that one called "My girl"
Don't forget them
No other song will do
