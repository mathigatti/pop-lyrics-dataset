Rich man and poor, beggar and thief
Searching in the darkness
For a light to show the way
Each seeking his identity


Protect me from my brother please
They pray
Afraid and so alone
Tell me where have all the loving people gone

They're lying here with you and me
Buried in the shadows of society

Young mothers' faces filled with shame
It's not enough to give her baby life, they say
Each child must have a proper name
Or they'll never be allowed to see the light of day

Wrong, right or wrong
Tell me where has understanding gone

Where have all the loving people gone
Where has understanding gone
Here they are with you and me
Buried in the shadows of society

Once someone said
'Let there be light'
What good is light
If we've forgotten how to see

It's gone
The light is gone
Where is the light of love
To lead us on

As I rush through the shadows
Seeking me
May the torch of love
Light my way

Where have all the loving people gone
Where has understanding gone

Once someone said
'Let there be light'
What good is light
If we've forgotten how to see

It's gone
The light is gone
Where is the light of love
To lead us on

As I rush through the shadows
Seeking me
May the torch of love
Light my way
