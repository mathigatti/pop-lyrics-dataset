Now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Ooh, you're doing just fine, fine, fine


Take away your good looks
And all your fancy clothes
I bet you want to try it baby
And you'll see
That nobody loves you but me
Now what do you think about that?

Hey, Melvin
Now you tell me that you so busy
Ooh, baby you ain't got much time
Oh, how will I remember, babe
When all your time was mine, mine, mine

Well move on back cross the track
Yeah, where you came from
Yeah, why don't you just try it baby
And you'll see
Nobody loves you but me
Yeah, nobody but me
Try it

If you think I'm lying
Try it
Try it baby

Ooh, well move on back cross the track, baby
Yeah, where you came from
Come on and try, try it honey, try it baby, try it sweet
And you'll see
Nobody loves you but me
Nobody loves you but me

Listen, I really want to hold you, pretty baby
In my arms again
But I can't get close to you
For all your love afraid
But take your name from the bad list
And tear me your arms through
Come on and try it baby
I'm gonna try it sweetheart
Try it honey
You'll see, nobody loves you but me
Nobody but me
