Oh babe, ooo babe
Hidden here behind four walls, a new night passes by
I'm just a soul deprived of love, I've yet to reason why
I've got so much to give someone, so many dreams to share
And a promise of a faithful love if someone would only care.
Discover me and you'll discover happiness
Discover me and you'll discover love, sweet love.


The day begins and disappears, I go my lonely way
Oh, thinking that tomorrow's gonna be my lucky day
An unrequired love can be a hurting thing, it's true
But I can bear a hurting thing
Baby, until you discover me and you'll discover happiness
Discover me and you'll discover love, sweet love.

Could it be I'm placing all my values much too high
Saving all my loving for that very special guy
And I yell out for that someone who belongs to me alone
An unforeseen lover
Discover me and you'll discover happiness
Discover me if you need loving
Discover me, babe, oh baby, if you need loving
Discover me, discover me, discover me babe
Oh babe if you need loving discover me
Discover me oh babe.
