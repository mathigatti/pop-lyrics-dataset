Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
Will she turn her back on me
Or accept me as I am


And what about your dad
Did you think of what he'll say
Will he be understanding
Or does he think the usual way

Maybe I shouldn't worry
But I've been through this before
And I'd like to get things straight
Before I'm knocking on your door

Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
If she says forget about me
Do you think you'll understand

And what about your friends
Do you care what people say
Will you accept the burdens
I know will surely come your way

Maybe I shouldn't worry
But I've been through this before
And I'd like to get things straight
Before I'm knocking on your door

Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
Will she turn her back on me
Or accept me as I am

Oh, we've got to stand tall
Tumble or crawl
We've got to be strong
For a love that's so right
Can't be wrong
And everyday I see it grow
I don't wanna let it go
That's why I gotta know

Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
