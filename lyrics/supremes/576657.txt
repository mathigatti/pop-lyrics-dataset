Say what you will about him
You'll never make me doubt him
He means the world to me
His love is all I need
Wealth he doesn't have
But he holds his own


Say what you will about him
But I can't live without him
It makes my life worthwhile
Watching his tender smile

Handsome he may not be
But he holds his own
He holds his own

Say what you will about him
You'll never make me doubt him
Though he's a soft spoken guy
A little quiet, a little shy
He has qualities
'Cause he holds his own
He holds his own
He holds his own

Say what you will about him
He holds his own
You'll never make me doubt him
He holds his own
