Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing ?
Oh, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long now
But it seems like only yesterday


Gee, ain't it funny
How time slips away

How's your new love ?
I hope that she's doing fine
I heard you told her
That you'd love her 'till the end of time
Now that's the same thing
You told me
Seems like the other day

Gee, ain't it funny
How time slips away

Well it's been nice seeing you
Gotta go now
Guess I'll see you around
Don't know when tho'
Never know when I'll be back in town
But remember
What I tell you
In time you're gonna pay

Gee, ain't it funny
How time slips away
