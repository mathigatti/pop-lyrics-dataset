When you're weary feeling small when tears are in your eyes I will dry them all
I'm on your side oh when times get rough and friends just can't be found
Oh like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down
Oh like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down


When you're down and out when you're on the street
When evening falls so hard I will comfort you
I'll take your part when oh darkness comes and pain is all around
Yeah like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down
Oh like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down

Sail on silver girl sail on by your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine oh if you need a friend I'm sailing right out behind
Yeah like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind
