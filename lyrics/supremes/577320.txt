In our mountain greenery
Where God paints the scenery
Just three crazy people together.
Ooo, while you love your lover
Let blue skies be your coverlet
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.


And if you're good
I'll search for wood
So you can cook
While I stand a-looking.

Ooo, beans could get no
keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home.

In the mountain greenery
(Where God) Where God paints the scenery
(Just us three) Just three crazy people together
(How) How we love sequestering
(Where no) Where no pests are pestering
(Pestering) No man holds us in a tether.

Mosquitoes here won't bite your ear
I'll let them sting me on my finger

We could find no cleaner retreat from life's machinery
Than our mountain greenery with its mountain scenery
Bless our montain greenery home
