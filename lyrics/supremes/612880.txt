It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got
It's my man.


Cold and wet
Tired, you bet
But all that I soon forget
With my man.

He's not much for looks
And no hero out of books
Is my man.

Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him.

I don't know why I should.
He isn't good.
He isn't true.
He beats me too.
What can I do?

Oh, my man I love him so.
He'll never know.
All my life is just despair,
But I don't care.
When he takes me in his arms
The world is right, all right.

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is
I am his forever more.
