Don't run so fast, love
Slow down and let me catch you baby


I've got a story to tell
About a girl I know well
She loved this guy
Heaven knows why
How could she love him

Everytime this guy she'd see
With another girl he'd be
He didn't even notice
She was crying

Don't run so fast, love 
Slow down and let me catch you baby

She'd choose her clothes with care
She'd curl and set her hair
And hope someday, that he'd look her way
He was too busy

He was always on the run
Breaking hearts and havin' fun
He couldn't see she was the one that needed him

Each night she'd cry in fear
That he would never hear
Her heart and soul cry out
I know it's love beyond a doubt

By now you all must see
This girl I know is me
Though I feel like crying
I won't stop trying to make him love me

I've shown you a part of my soul
But many things I've left untold
Until he's mine to have and hold
Forever

Don't run so fast, love
Slow down and let me catch you baby
I need your arms around me tight, baby
Slow down
Slow down, baby
