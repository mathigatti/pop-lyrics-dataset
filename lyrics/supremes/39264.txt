Being hurt by the one you love
It's a feeling that's hard to hide
But you don't seem to understand why
When I'm alone, I sit and cry


Ask any girl who's often left alone all by herself
Neglectfully pushed aside, set aside like a doll on a shelf
Just ask any girl, ooh, and you'll understand why
I sit and cry

Ask any girl who knows the fear of losing someone dear
And she'll say the same thing, it hurts you deep, makes it hardto sleep
Don't take my word, ask any girl, then you'll understand why
I sit and cry

(La la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la, la la la)

Ask any girl who receives no loving affection
And she'll feel as I feel, it's heartaches by the number
Many nights without slumber
Ask any girl, ooh, and then you'll know why
I sit and cry
I sit and cry
