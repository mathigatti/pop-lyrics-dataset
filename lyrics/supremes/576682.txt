Goodbye my love
Happy life my love
I'm tired and I just can't take no more
Tired of being tough
'Cause enough is enough
This time I'm really headed for the door
You better believe


I'm gonna let my heart do the walking
(Whoo-oo, oo-oo)
Walk me in to something good
(So good, so good)
I'm gonna let my heart do the walking
(Do the walking)
Oh, it ain't no make believin'
My heart's set on leaving

You take my very best
And give me less
I'm tired and I just can't take no more
Your love is unstable
Darling, while I'm able
Gonna ease on out the door
You better believe

I'm gonna let my heart do the walking
(Whoo-oo, oo-oo)
Walk me in to something good
(So good, so good)
I'm gonna let my heart do the walking
(Do the walking)
Oh, I never thought I could
But I'm leaving for good

Gonna let it do the walking, baby
(Do the walking)
Ooh, I'm gonna let it do the walking, baby
(Do the walking)
Oh, oh, oh, oh-ooo

Walk on heart, walk on
Walk on heart, tip on out the door
Walk on heart, walk on
Walk on heart, tip on out the door
Walk on heart, walk on
Walk on heart
Walk on out the door with your bad self

I'm gonna let my heart do the walking
(Whoo-oo, oo-oo)
Walk me in to something good
(So good, so good)
I'm gonna let my heart do the walking
(Do the walking)
Oh, I never thought I could
But I'm leaving for good

I'll let my heart do the walking, baby
I'm gonna let it do the walking, yes I am
I'm gonna let it do the walking, baby
Oh, hey, hey
I'm gonna let, let, let my heart do the walking, yeah
Walk me in to something good
Let my heart do the walking
