Falling in love with love
Is falling for make believe
Falling in love with love
Is playing the fool


Caring too much
Is such a juvenile fancy
Learning to trust
Is just for children in school

I fell in love with love
One night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see

I fell in love with love
With love everlasting
But love fell out with me!

Falling in love with love
Is falling for make believe
Falling in love with love
Is playing the fool

Caring too much
Is such a juvenile fancy
Learning to trust
Is just for children in school

I fell in love with love
One night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see

I fell in love with love
With love everlasting
But love fell out with me!

Falling in love with love
Falling in love with love
Falling in love with love
