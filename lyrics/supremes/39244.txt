[Diana Ross]
Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me


Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Try in a world that's
A distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories
Through the mirror of my mind
Through each tear that I've cried
Reflects the hurt I can't control

'Cause although you're gone
I keep holdin' on
To the happy times
Ooh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain

[Supremes]
All the love
[Diana]
All the love that I've wasted
[Supremes]
All those tears
[Diana]
All the tears that I've tasted
All in vain

[Diana]
Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused
Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
And right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone on wept
Just a handfull of promises
Are all that's left, of loving you

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me
In you I put, all my faith and trust
And right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust
