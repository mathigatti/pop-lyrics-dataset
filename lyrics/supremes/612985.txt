Within the magic kingdom
There's a lot of wonderful and beautiful places
But the most beautiful and exciting of them all
Is where the little ones find their greatest happiness
In toyland
Toyland


Ooh, toyland, toyland
Dear little girl and boyland
While you dwell within it
You are ever happy then

Childhood's toyland
Wonderful world of joyland 
Wouldn't it be fine
If we could stay there forever more

Toyland, toyland
We're on our way to toyland

Toyland, toyland
We're on our way to toyland
Don't know when we'll get there
But we know there's fun in store

Ooh, toyland, toyland
Wonderful girl and boyland
Once you leave it's borders 
You can never return again
