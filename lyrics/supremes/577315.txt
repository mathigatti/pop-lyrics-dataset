OK, it's all right
It's the wrong time and the wrong place
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not his face, but such a charming face
That it's alright with me


It's the wrong song with the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not his smile, but such a lovely smile
That it's alright with me

You can't know how happy I am that we met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm longing so hard to forget
Don't you wanna forget someone too

It's the wrong game with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not his lips, but they're such tempting lips
That it's all right with me
Say it's all right,
It's all right
It's all right with me

It's not his face
But such a charming face
That it's alright with me

It's not his smile
But such a lovely smile
That it's alright with me

You can't know how happy I am that we met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm longing so hard to forget
Don't you wanna forget someone too

It's the wrong game with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not his lips, but they're such tempting lips
That it's all right with me
Say it's all right,
It's all right
It's all right with me
