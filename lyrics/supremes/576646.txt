When you're alone and in a corner
Your only mourner is the face that
Appears in the nearest mirror
You gotta get it going and somehow knowing you
You're gonna have it better than you ever had it
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody's got the right to love


If you could give in for a minute
And put your soul in it
We could get it on together and forever love it
so what's the use of running
You know there ain't no fun in running
And boy you need somebody, somebody to love you
Cause everybody needs somebody
Everybody's got the right to love

You can have all the things that you desire
But without love you just can't survive
You need love to warm your heart at night
When you're all alone and no comfort's in sight
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody's got the right to love
