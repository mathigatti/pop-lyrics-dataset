I'm dreaming of a white christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow


Ooh, I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white

Ooh, white christmas
Sleigh bells in the snow

Ooh, I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white
