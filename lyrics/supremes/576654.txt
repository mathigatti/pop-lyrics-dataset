Save me! Save me, save me!
Save me! Save me, save me!


I'm going down, down for the third time
I'm going down, down for the third time
Drowning in tears from my heart that's hurting
Drowning in tears from a love that's uncertain.

I'm lost in a world without love, a sea of emptyness
The love we knew is being washed away
Don't think I can last, my heart is sinking fast.

I'm going down, down for the third time
Trying to hold on to a love that's mine
Drowning in the love that keeps me grieving
Drowning in the fear that my arms you're leaving.

Bring back that love we knew
Darling let me live again
A little tenderness to me start showing
Fill my heart with love till it's overflowing.

I'm going down, down for the third time
Trying to hold on to a love that's gone
I'm going down, down for the third time
So won't you save this heart of mine.

Going down, down for the third time
Going down, down for the third time
I'm like a ship all alone on a raging sea
You got me tossing and a-turning
And I can't get free.

Reach out your hand for me
Darling, save what's left of our love
I'll forgive your lies and alibies
If you'll wipe my crying eyes.

I'm going down, down for the third time
So won't you save this heart of hime
I've loved too long, I love too strong
Now little boy you know you're doing me wrong
Come on and save me
Come on and save me
Come on and save me
I'm going down, down for the third time.
