I don't want to love you
But I do
And I just can't help it


You bring me happiness
And then pain
Are these nights I spend
Crying over you really worth it
Really worth it
Or am I shedding tears in vain

You know every girl has to have
Someone she can depend on
Someone to trust in
And I depend on you day by day
It's always been that way

When you kiss me
Tears of joy I shed
Makes me wonder
Makes me wonder
Wonder am I shedding tears in vain

Darling I wonder
Are all these tears in vain
