It's hurting me, it's hurting me
This doubt is hurting me.


So remove this doubt
From my heart, little boy
And let me live my life
Knowing you care.

Remove this doubt
From my mind, little boy
And let me breathe again
Feeling my love you share.

Each time we meet
You make me feel so incomplete
There's no joy in the air
I just don't think you care.

Close the door of doubt forever more
And may it never more make me unsure
Turn the key and lock away this doubt in me
Keep it in the dark, not in my heart
Be more tender
Completely surrender your love to me
Be sweet and not discreet.

Remove this doubt
From my mind, little boy
And let me breathe again
Feeling my love you share.

Each time we meet
You make me feel so incomplete
There's no joy in the air
I just don't think you care.

Remove this doubt in our hearts
Remove this doubt from my heart.
