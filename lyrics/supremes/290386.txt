This time we almost made the pieces fit
Didn't we
This time we almost made some sense of it
Didn't we
This time I had the answer right here in my hand
And I touched it and it had turned to sand


This time we almost sang our song in tune
Didn't we
This time we almost made it to that moon
Didn't we
This time we almost made our poem rhyme
This time we almost made that long, hard climb
Didn't we almost make it this time?
