Our day will come
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy
Falling in love can bring
No one can tell me that I'm to young to know
Young to know
I love you so (love you so)
And you love me


Our day will come
If we just wait a while
No tears for us
Face life and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic because 
We'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come

Our day will come
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy
Falling in love can bring
No one can tell me that I'm to young to know
(Young to know)
I love you so (love you so)
And you love me

Our day will come
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy
Falling in love can bring
Our dreams have magic because 
We'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come
Our day will come
Our day will come
