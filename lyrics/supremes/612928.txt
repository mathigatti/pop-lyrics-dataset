Here they come
Looking so alive
They're here for business
But it's all none of your jive


Brighter tomorrows are in their eyes
You'd better make way for the young folks
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah

They say yes and you say no
They ask you why and you close the door
My old friend I thought you knew by now
You can't do that to the young folks
Oh, no no no no

You might not like it but I've got to tell you
Gotta tell you
You'd better make way for the young folks
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah

They're marching with signs
They're standing in lines (yeah)
Protesting your right to turn out the light
In their lives

Here's the deal
Accept it if you will
They're coming on strong
It's their time to live
My old friend I thought you knew by now
You gotta make way for the young folks
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah

You may not like it but I've got to tell you
Gotta tell you
Woh 

You'd better make way
You gotta make way
You'd better make way
For the young folks
(oh yeah)

You may not like it but I've got to tell you
Gotta tell you
Woh 

You'd better make way
You gotta make way
You'd better make way
For the young's folks

(oh, oh yeah)
