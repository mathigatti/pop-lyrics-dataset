Come on boy
My eyes are calling you
Come on boy
Can't you feel that my love is true
Don't make me lose my pride
Don't you know I wanna be dignified
Come on boy, and take your heart
And bring it on to me


Come on boy
You mean the world to me
Come on boy
I love you secretly
I dream each night
That you are gonna hold me tight

Come on boy, come on boy
And take your heart
And bring it on to me

Come on boy
The first move is up to you
Come on boy
This is something a girl can't do
Make the first move you see
Then baby leave it up to me

Come on boy, come on boy
And take your heart
And bring it on to me

Come on boy, come on boy
And bring it on to me
Boy, boy
And bring it on to me
Boy, hey boy
