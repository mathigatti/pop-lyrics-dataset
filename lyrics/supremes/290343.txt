I was born by the river 
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been running ever since


It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it is 

It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
I don't know what's up there beyond the sky

It's been a long, long time coming 
But I know a change gonna come
Oh yes it will

Then I go to my brother 
I say brother help me please
But he winds up knocking me 
Back down on my knees

There's been times that I thought 
I wouldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh, yes it will
