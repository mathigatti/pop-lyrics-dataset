Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?


I've been falsely accused
Of being untrue to him
And it's not so
But it's the way he's misjudged me
That really hurts me so
When I've been nothing but good to him
Forsaking all others
Giving my love to him
Who could ever doubt my love?

A victim of circumstance I have been
But what really hurts is
Instead of believing me
He believed his friends
When l've been nothing but good to him

Rearrange my life to please only him
Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?

I've been cast aside
Because he believed someone's lies
After I've done the best I could
Still I've been so misunderstood
After I've been good to him
Good to him, so good to him

Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?
