Take my hand
I'm a stranger in Paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in Paradise


If I stand starry-eyed
That's a danger in Paradise
For mortals who stand beside
An angel like you

I saw your face
And I ascended
Out of the commonplace
Into the rare

Somewhere in space
I hang suspended
Until I know
There's a chance that you care

Won't you answer that fervent prayer
Of a stranger in Paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for

But open your angel arms
To a stranger in Paradise
And tell her that she need be
A stranger no more
