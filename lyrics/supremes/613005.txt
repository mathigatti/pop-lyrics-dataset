Good morning world
How will today greet me
A single girl who needs a man 
To love sweetly


A man to wrap his loving arms around me
Let me know that he's glad he's found me
I'll be his joy

Come on heart
Let's search for the boy
He's out there waiting somewhere
Tell me will this be the day
He'll come my way

You know, I comb my hair
While I run my bath
And I wonder where
Will he cross my path

Will I see him at the corner bus stop
The art museum or the market where I shop
He'll catch my eye

Come on heart
Let's go find the guy
He's out there waiting somewhere
Tell me will this be the day
Love will say

Now is the time
Here is the place
This is the hand
Here is the face
This is the man
Who set the pace
Your heart is beating

By and by and by
I know my day will dawn
That day when I will know before it's gone
Hey, what it means to have found that someone
Who can make up two hearts become one
Love can be found

Come on heart
Let's go look around
He's out there waiting somewhere
Tell me will this be the day
He'll come my way

Tell me that this is the day
I hope and pray
I hope and pray
That this will be the day
He'll come my way
