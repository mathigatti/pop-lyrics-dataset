Do you love me?
I can really move
Do you love me?
I'm in the groove
Now, do you love me?
Do you love me?
Now that I can dance?


Watch me now (work it out)
Shake it, shake it baby
Work it out baby
Oh, shake it, shake it down now
Work it out now
Just a little bit of soul now

Oh, I can mash potatoes
I can do the twist
Now tell me baby
Do you like it like this
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
Now that I can dance?

Watch me now (work it out)
Get it, get it, baby
Work it out
You're driving me crazy
Work it out
Just a little bit of soul now

Oh, I can mash potatoes
I can do the twist
Well, now tell me baby
Do you like it like this
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
Now that I can dance?

Do you love me?
I can really move
Do you love me?
I'm in the groove
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Now that I can dance?

Watch me now (work it out)
Shake it, shake it baby
Work it out
Oh, shake it, shake it down now
Work it out now
Just a little bit of soul now
