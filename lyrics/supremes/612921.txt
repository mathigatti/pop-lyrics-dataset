I get too hungry for dinner at eight
I like the theatre but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp


I like the crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like that cool fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's oke!
Hate california
It's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
