I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need


Open up your arms
And let me walk on in
Open up your heart
And let me live again

When you left you left with me
A dream no longer reality
I live the shadows of our past
With this love that's born to last

I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need

The only time I'm happy
Is when you're on my mind
Every day I live
All my love I give

I've been a thousand places
Seen your smile on a thousand faces
No matter what I try to do
I'm always dreaming of you

I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need

Every boy that passes by
I see your sparkle in his eye
Right away I stop and stare
Close my eyes and see you there

Whenever I feel almost free
Memories take hold of me
I love you now so much more
Than I ever did before

I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you
