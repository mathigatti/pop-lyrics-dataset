Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories


Here's your old friendship ring
I can't wear it no more
Here's your old love letters
I can't read them any more

Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Here's that old teddy bear 
That you won from me at the state fair
Here's some old valentine cards
Give it to your new sweetheart

Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Come and get'em, come and get'em

Here's our old favorite record
I can't stand to hear it anymore
Here's some old lingering love
It's in my heart and it's tearing it apart

Because of these memories
I never think of anybody but you
So, come on and get'em
'Cause I found somebody new
Come and get these memories
Since you've gone out of my life
Come and get these memories
Since you've gone out of my life
Come and get these memories
Since you've gone out of my life
Come and get these memories
Since you've gone out of my life
