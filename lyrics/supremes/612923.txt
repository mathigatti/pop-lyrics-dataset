Come, they told me, pa rum pa pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pa pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pa pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pa pum pum
Rum a pum pum, rum pa pum pum
So to honor him, pa rum pa pum pum
When we come 


Little baby, pa rum pa pum pum
I am a poor boy, too, pa rum pa pum pum
I have no gift to bring, pa rum pa pum pum
That's fit to give a king, pa rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum
Shall I play for you pa rum pa pum pum
On my drum

Yoi da adash, pa rum pa pum pum
The ass and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum rum pa pum pum
Then he smiled at me pa rum pa pum pum
Me and my drum
