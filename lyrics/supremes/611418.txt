See them tumbling down 
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds


Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

I know when night has gone
That new world's born at dawn
I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart there's a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart there's a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
