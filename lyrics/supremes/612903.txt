Someday we'll be together
Say, say, say it again
Someday we'll be together
Oh, yeah, oh yeah


You're far away
From me my love
And just as sure my, my baby
As there are stars above
I wanna say, I wanna say, I wanna say

Someday we'll be together
Yes we will, yes we will
Say, someday (some sweet day) we'll be together
I know, I know, I know, I know

My love is yours, baby
Oh, right from the stars
You, you, you posses my soul now honey
And I know, I know you own my heart
And I wanna say

Someday we'll be together
Some sweet day we'll be together
Yes we will, yes we will
Someday (tell everybody) we'll be together
Yes we will, yes we will

Long time ago
My, my sweet thing
I made a big mistake, honey
I said, I said goodbye
Oh, oh baby
Ever, ever, ever since that day
Now, now all I wanna do is cry, cry

Hey, hey, hey
I long for you every night
Just to kiss your sweet, sweet lips
Hold you ever, ever so tight
And I wanna say

Someday we'll be together
Yes we will, yes we will
