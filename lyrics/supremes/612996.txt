I'm gonna take your empty heart
And fill it with love until it's higher and higher


And when it's to the top still I won't stop, I won't stop
Giving you love (giving you love)
Oh, baby when it's to the top still I won't stop, I won't stop
Giving you love (giving you love, giving you love, giving you love).

Ooh, love brought you to me
You were in search of your destiny
A hurt deep in your empty heart
Walking along, your life torn apart
Reaching out, so full of doubt
Hoping someone would show the way.

So here's my hand
I'm searching too so I understand
You need someone to come and be the one
To take all your hurt away
So let me start to fill your heart
With all of the love you need

And when it's to the top still I won't stop, I won't stop
Giving you love (giving you love)
Hey baby, and when it's to the top still I won't stop, I won't stop
Giving you love (giving you love, giving you love, giving you love).
Oh can't you feel it growing
Knowing it's going right to the top.

Oh, strong and true
Will be the love that I'll share with you
Rising so high up to the sky
Standing so tall it'll never fall
Soon you'll feel a love so real
Rush into your empty heart.

So walk with me
To the land of love eternally
There love will grow and we will know
We'll be in love forever more
Soon I'll show how love will grow
Inside of your empty heart

And when it's to the top still I won't stop, I won't stop
Giving you love (giving you love)
Darling, darling when it's to the top
Still I won't stop, I won't stop giving you love
Giving you love (giving you love, giving you love).
