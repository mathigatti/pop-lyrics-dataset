Listen while I talk to you
Tell you what we're gonna do
There's a new dance going around
And I tell you that we're putting you down
Just move your body all around


Shake, oh mama shake
Shake, I said that's the way to do it
Shake, come on you're looking good now

Shake it like a bowl of soup
Make your body loop de loop
Put your hands on your hip
You kinda let your back bone slip

Just move your body like a whip
And just shake, oh mama
Shake, I said that's the way to do it
Shake, come on now girls

Dingelingeling, honey shakin' is the latest thing
And if you wanna swing
Just loosen up your shoulders

And if you wanna really roll
You got to do the thing with soul
Shake it, shake it with all your might
And now if you do it, do it right

Just move your body loose tonight
And just shake, oh mama
Shake, come on honey 
Shake, I said that's the way to do it

Loosen up your shoulders
And if you wanna really roll
You gotta do the thing with soul
Shake it, shake with all your might
And now if you do it, do it right

Just make your body loose tonight
And just shake, oh mama
Shake, I say that's the way to do it
Shake, come on now girls

Shake, come on now Florence
Shake, I say that's the way to do it
Shake, come on now Mary
Shake, come on now Supremes
And shake, I say that's the way to do it
Shake, come on now mama
Shake, I say that's the way to do it
Shake?
