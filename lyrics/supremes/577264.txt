Send me no flowers
Send me no flowers
Just want your arms around me
Your ever loving arms around me


You sent me flowers and a "get well" card
After you had broken my heart
Violets that were blue
Reminded me you'd never be true

So send me no flowers
Don't need any flowers
Because your kissing, baby
Is what I'm missing, baby

When I'm at home, all alone
You don't ever bother, bother to phone
A little affection sometimes
Will soothe this heart of mine
But you send me flowers
To ease my lonely hours

Send me no flowers. baby
Don't need any flowers
Just need your kissing, baby
and I don't mean maybe, baby

Send me no flowers, baby
Don't need any flowers, baby
I need affection sometimes
To soothe this heart of mine

Send me no flowers, baby
Don't need any flowers, baby
I need affection sometimes
To soothe this heart of mine
