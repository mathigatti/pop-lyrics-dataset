All day long I hear my telephone ring
Friends calling giving their advice
From the boy I love
I should break away
'Cause heartaches he'll bring one day


I lost him once through friends advice
But it's not gonna happen twice
'Cause all advice ever's gotten me
Was many long and sleepless nights

Ooh! But now
He's back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied

It's easy for friends to say
Let him go
But I'm the one
Who needs him so
It's his love that makes me strong
Without him I can't go on
This time I'll live my life at ease
Being happy lovin' whom I please
And each time we make romance
I'll be thankfull for a second chance

Ooh! Cause
He's back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied

How can Mary tell me what to do
When she lost her love so true?
And Flo, she don't know
'Cause the boy she loves is a Romeo
I listened once to my friends advice
But it's not gonna happen twice
'Cause all advice ever's gotten me
Was many long and sleepless nights

Ooh! I got him
Back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied

Ooh! I'm satisfied yeah
So satisfied
