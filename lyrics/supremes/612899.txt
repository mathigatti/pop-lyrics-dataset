Sleep walk
Instead of dreaming
I sleep walk
'Cause I lost you
And now what am I to do
What to do
Can't believe that we're through
I don't care how much you tell me


Sleep talk
'Cause I miss you
I sleep talk
While the memory of you
Lingers like a song
Darling, I was so wrong
But I'll be right someday

The night
Fills my lonely place
I see your face
Spinning through my brain
I know
I miss you so
I still love you
And it drives me insane

Sleep walk
Every night
I just sleep walk
And when you
Walk inside the door
I will sleep walk no more

Sleep walk
Every night
I just sleep walk
And when you
Walk inside the door
I will sleep walk no more

I will sleep walk no more
I will sleep walk no more
