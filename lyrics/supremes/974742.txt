ALL:
You gotta have love in your heart
You gotta have a song on your lips
You gotta let freedom roll
Then you`ll feel good
Yes you will


JEAN:
I look out my window
And what do I see
I see a world that`s full of confusion
And I know just what it needs

ALL:
It needs to have a little love in its heart
It`s gotta have a song you can sing
It`s gotta let freedom roll
Then you`ll feel good
Yes you will

LEVI:
I look in my mirror
And what do I see, yeah
I see a man
Who`s lost and is wandering
And I know just what he needs

ALL:
He needs to have a little love in his heart
He`s gotta have a song on his lips
He`s gotta let freedom roll
Then he`ll feel good
Yes he will

(Call and response) JEAN/Chorus:
Don`t you wanna feel good
Yes I do
Ooh, you should feel good
Yes I do
You`ve gotta feel good, oh yeah
Yes I do

ALL:
You gotta have a little love in your heart
You gotta have a song on your lips
You gotta let freedom roll
Then you`ll feel good
Yes you will
You gotta have a little love in your heart
You gotta have a song on your lips
You gotta let freedom roll
Then you`ll feel good
Yes you will

JEAN:
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love--
Yeah people
And I`m talking to you
And you-ooh-ooh-ooh--, yeah
Say it, say it again
Ooh, ooh, ooh...Oh yeah
You sound so good
