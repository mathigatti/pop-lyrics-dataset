The door to my heart was open
Open wide much wider than wide
(I said the door was open)
And I had been praying and hoping
That your love would come walking inside


I should have locked my heart
I should have thrown away the key
Instead I let you walk on through
I thought your love was true
But it was misery

Ooh, heartaches, heartbreaks
That's all I've known
Misery makes my heart its home

(I said the door was open, it was wide open)
My heart had room inside
And to fill it with love I was willing
I wanted it to be occupied
By a love that was strong and fulfilling

I should have shut you out
Detained you with a strong defence
Instead my heart gave shelter to
A love I felt was true
In every sense
Don't you know that

Heartaches, heartbreaks
That's all I've known
Misery makes my heart its home

(My heart had room inside now, it had room inside)
Now I've cried a river
No it's more like a sea
Tears flow by the thousand
Since my heart is housing this misery
Misery

Let me tell you about
Heartaches, heartbreaks
That's all I've known
Misery makes my heart its home

Heartaches, heartbreaks
That's all I've known
Misery makes my heart its home

Heartbreaks
That's all I've known
Misery makes my heart its home
