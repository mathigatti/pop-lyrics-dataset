I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Since you left me and you said goodbye
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
All I do is sit and cry
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
You went away and you left me misery
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
And that's the way it'll always be


I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
You said you loved me and you'd always be mine
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
We'll be together till the end of time
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Now you say it was just a game
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
But all you're doin' is leavin' me pain

Time goes by and goes so slow
oh, yeah
It just doesn't seem true
Only just a few days ago
You said you'd love me, and you never make me blue

I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Now you've gone and I'm all alone
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
And you're still way up there on your throne
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
But nothin' seems to ever go right
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
'Cause night is day and day is night
