Why don't you stay in my, my lonely arms
Darling, stay in my, my lonely arms.


You are so thrilling and my arms, ooo, are so willing
I can't help revealing the way I'm feeling
I need it so

Stay in my lonely arms
Darling, stay, stay in my, in my lonely arms.

Holding you close is so heavenly
I can feel the love glow deep inside of me
Please, don't go.

Darling, stay, stay in my lonely arms
Stay in my lonely arms.

Each kiss makes love just a little stronger
Ooo, makes me wanna hold you, oh, just a little longer
Please, don't go.

Stay in my, in my lonely arms
Why don't you stay, stay in my, in my lonely arms
Stay, darling, stay in my lonely arms
Why don't you stay, ooo, stay in my lonely arms
You are so thrilling, my arms are willing
I can't help revealing the way I'm feeling
Why don't you stay, stay in my, in my lonely arms
Stay in my lonely arms.
