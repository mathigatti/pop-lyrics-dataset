This can't be love 
Because I feel so well
No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs


This can't be love
I get no dizzy spells
My head is not in the skies
My heart does not stand still
Just hear it beat
This is too sweet to be love

This can't be love
Because I feel so well
I love to look in your eyes
I love to look in your eyes

This can't be love 
Because I feel so well
No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs

This can't be love
I get no dizzy spells
My head is not in the skies
My heart does not stand still
Just hear it beat
This is too sweet to be love

This can't be love
Because I feel so well
I love to look in your eyes
I love to look in your eyes
