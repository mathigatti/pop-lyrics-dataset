Through a shadowed world
I drift in emptiness and doubt
Because I push aside the love 
I just can't live without


Please won't you give my crying eye
Just one more chance to see
That look upon your face
That promised love to me

Am I asking too much
Or is this love we had
Lost beyond recall
Am I asking too much
Can we start again and rise above it all

Kiss my ears with gentle words I need to hear
(Baby I love you)
Let your arms reach out and
Tell me that you need me dear
(Baby I need you)
'Cause if you need me darling
Baby, you'll forgive
(Forgive me dear)
You'll forgive me says the breath of air
I need to live

Am I asking too much
Even though I hurt you so
Don't say we're through
Am I asking too much
Won't you let me try 
And make it up to you

All the precious hours we've wasted
All the bitter tears we've tasted
I need your love inside of me
Make me the girl I used to be

In your heart is there no longer room for me to live
When all I did was take, all you did was give
All the tears I made you cry
Turned your heart to stone
Has loneliness made up your mind
To live alone

Am I asking too much
Or is this love we had
Lost beyond recall
Am I asking too much
Can we start again and rise above it all

Am I asking too much
Won't you let me try 
And make it up to you
Am I asking too much
Even though I hurt you so
Don't say were through

Am I asking too much
Or is this love we had
Lost beyond recall
