Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletidecarols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows, a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright


Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mothers child is gonna spy
To see if reindeers really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry christmas, merry christmas
Merry christmas to you
