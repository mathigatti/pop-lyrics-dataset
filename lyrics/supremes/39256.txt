CHORUS:
My baby likes
(Buttered popcorn) Uh-huh
(Buttered popcorn) Oh-hoh
(Buttered popcorn) Oh, yeah
He likes it greasy and sticky and gooey and salty
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like (buttered popcorn)


He took me to a show (buttered popcorn)
He said he wanted some more (buttered popcorn)
I said kiss me please (buttered popcorn)
He said after I eat (buttered popcorn)
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like (buttered popcorn)

For breakfast, lunch, and dinner too
He eats (buttered popcorn)
Well, it worries me so
I don't know what to do
When I asked him what was happenin' in the world today,
He said more butter, more butter, more butter, more

CHORUS

For breakfast, lunch, and dinner too
He eats (buttered popcorn)
Well, it worries me so
I don't know what to do
When I asked him what was happenin' in the world today,
He said more butter, more butter, more butter, more

CHORUS

Uh-huh!
