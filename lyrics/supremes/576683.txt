I'm gonna make it, I will wait for you
I'm gonna make it, I will wait for you.


When you went away
There's nothing I could say
But now I feel the hurt's coming over me
Wishing you were here, thinking 'bout you, dear
Every night and day the way it used to be
Although it's been so long since you were by my side
I'll keep holding on and won't let this love die.

I'm gonna make it, I will wait for you
I'm gonna make it, I will wait for you.

Every girl has a dream of happiness
But all I dream of you's your sweet caress
I just can't tell you how I miss you so
But all my love I won't let go, oh.

I'm gonna make it, I will wait for you
I'm gonna make it, I will wait for you.

Everywhere I go the tears begin to flow
Cause I pass by every place we used to meet
And when I'm home alone
My friends call me on the phone
They all say that you will not return to me
I know you're gone without me
Although I don't know where
I know you're thinking bout me, I feel it in the air.

I'm trying not to let another take your place
Even though the loneliness is on my face
You can't let someone take what they don't own
Baby, I'm yours, so please come home.

I'm gonna make it, I will wait for you
I'm gonna make it, I will wait for you.
