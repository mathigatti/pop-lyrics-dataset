Silver bells, silver bells
It's christmas time in the city
Ringeling
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day


City side walks, busy side walks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas

Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Hear them ring
Ringeling
Soon it will be Christmas day

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ringeling
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
