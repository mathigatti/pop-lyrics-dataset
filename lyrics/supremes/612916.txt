We'll have a blue room
A new room, for two room
Where every day's a holiday
Because you're married to me


Not like a ballroom
A small room, a hall room
Where you can smoke your pipe away
With my wee head upon your knee

We will thrive on, keep alive on
Just nothing but kisses
With Mister and Misses
On little blue chairs

I'll wear my trouseau
And Robinson Crusoe
Is not so far from worldly cares
As our blue room far away upstairs

We will thrive on, keep alive on
Just nothing but kisses
With Mister and Misses
On little blue chairs

I'll wear my trouseau
And Robinson Crusoe
Is not so far from worldly cares
As our blue room far away upstairs
