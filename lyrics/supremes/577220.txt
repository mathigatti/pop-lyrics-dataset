Lazybones, sleepin' in the sun
How you 'spect to get your day's work done?
Never get your day's work done
I'm sleepin' in this noon day sun


Lazybones, lyin' in the shade
How you 'spect to get your cornmeal made?
Never get your cornmeal made
I'm sleepin' in this evening shade

When taters need sprayin', I bet you keep prayin'
The bugs fall off of the vine
And when you go fishin' I bet you keep wishin'
The the fish don't grab at your line

Lazybones, loafin' all the day
How you gonna' make a dime that way
Never make a dime that way
Never hear a word I say
