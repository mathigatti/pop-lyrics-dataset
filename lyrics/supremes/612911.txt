I need your sweet, sweet inspiration
I need you here on my mind every hour of the day
Without your sweet, sweet inspiration
The lonely hours of the day just don't go my way.


A woman in love needs sweet inspiration
And honey that's all I ask
You know that's all I ask from you
I gotta have your sweet inspiration, yeah
You know there just ain't no telling
What a satisfied woman might do.

When you call "Baby", baby
Is such a sweet inspiration
And when you call me "Darling", darling
Sets my heart a-skating
And if I'm out in the rain, baby
And in a bad situation
You know I just reach back in my mind
And there I find your sweet, sweet inspiration.

Inspiration, yeah, oh, what a power
And I got the power every hour of the day
I need your sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet inspiration, yeah
To go on living, to keep on giving this way.

I need your sweet, sweet inspiration
And I got the power every hour of the day
I need your sweet, sweet inspiration
To go on living, to keep on giving this way.
