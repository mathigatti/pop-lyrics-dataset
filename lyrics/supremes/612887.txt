People
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world


We're children needing other children
And yet, letting our grown up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

People
God's children
Were born to be free
To love
All people have a dream
For peace, for security
Let the world fall in love again
Please, please, let our lies not be in vain

Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person
One very special person
A feeling deep in your soul says
You were half, now you're whole

No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
