You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You might be king
You might possess
The world and all its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness
When you're growing old


The world is still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love

You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You might be king
You might possess
The world and all its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness
When you're growing old

The world is still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love

The world is the same and you'll never remain the same
