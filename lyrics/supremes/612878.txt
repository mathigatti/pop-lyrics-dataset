More than the greatest love the world has known
This is the love I give to you alone
More than the simple words I try to say
I'll only live to love you more each day


More than you'll ever know my arms long to hold you so
Until I'll be in your keeping, waiting, sleeping, laughing, weeping

Longer than always is a long, long time
But far beyond forever you'll be mine
I know I'll never live before
And my heart is very sure 
No one else will love you more

And more than you'll ever know my arms long to hold you so
Until no one else will love you more

Longer than always is a long, long time
But far beyond forever you'll be mine
I know I'll never live before
And my heart is very sure 
No one else will love you more
