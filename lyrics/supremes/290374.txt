I'm into something
I can't shake it loose
I'm into something
I can't shake it loose


Stay away from him
Are the words I did not heed
Oh no, no, no
He's not just the one
He's an absolute need

Oh yeah yeah
I ignored the warnin'
That his kisses is a habit formin'
And ooh, I have no excuse

I'm into something
I can't shake it loose
I'm into something
I can't shake it loose

So good is his love
I can't do without, oh no
His sweet tender kiss has got me strung out
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah

But I love him in such a way
I'll never gonna try to get away
And oh, it just ain't no use

I'm into something
I can't shake it loose
I'm into something
I can't shake it loose
Yeah

But I love him in such a way
I'll never try to get away
And ooh, it just ain't no use

I'm into something
I can't shake it loose
I'm into something
I can't shake it loose

So good is his love
So sweet is his kiss
I just can't shake loose
