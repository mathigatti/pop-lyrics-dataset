So sweet you are
Like a shining star
You brighten my whole world
It brings me joy being your girl


'Cause everything's good about you
I couldn't live without you
You're so sweet, you're so fine
I'm so thankful that you're mine

Full of clover
Bustin' out all over
You're the summer in the park
You're the candle in the dark
And I love you, so true
Yes, I do

You're the love of my life
You're a pure delight
The short time I've been with you
You must've come from heaven above
You're the poets meaning of love

You're tender touch means oh so much
You're the sunshine after the storm
When I'm cold you make me warm
And I love you, so true
Yes, I do

It's a lonely day and night
And things will be alright
Together just you and me
Just living in pure ecstacy

'Cause everything's good about you
I couldn't live without you
You are my guiding light
When things go wrong
You make them right
This heart inside's bursting with pride
Please let your heart surround me
And always stay around me
I love you, so true
Yes, I do, yeah
