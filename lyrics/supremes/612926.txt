You got a smile so bright
You know you could've been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could've been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
The way you smell so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume


Well you could've been anything
That you wanted to and I can tell
The way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do

You made my life so rich
You know could've been some money
And baby you're so sweet
You know could've been some honey

Well you could've been anything
That you wanted to and I can tell
The way you do the things you do
