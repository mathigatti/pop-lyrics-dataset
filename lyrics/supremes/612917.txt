Oh, how I love him
But he just doesn't see


Tall and tan and young and handsome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes
Each girl he passes goes - ah

When he walks
He's like a samba 
That swings so cool and sways so gentle 
That when he passes each girl
He passes goes - ah

Ooh, but I watch him so sadly 
How can I tell him I love him
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day
When he walks to the sea 
He looks straight ahead, not at me 

Tall, and tan, and young and handsome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking 
And when he passes goes - ah

I smile - but he doesn't see (doesn't see)
He just doesn't see, he never sees me
