Right now, I'm in school
But as soon as the homebell rings
I'm gonna run to my locker
And gather up all my things
Then out the door


Running home I'll go
Faster than a new jet plane

And then turn on my radio
I'm gonna listen to those D.J. shows
I'm gonna be diggin' that rock 'n' roll
If I don't I'll go insane

Mamma said, "Go to bed
And turn off all those lights
And please turn off that radio
'Cause you listen to it day and night"
So I'll go to bed
And cover up my head
So nobody can complain

And then turn on my radio
I'm gonna listen to those D.J. shows
I'm gonna be diggin' that rock 'n' roll
If I don't I'll go insane

Well there may come a time in my lifetime
When I won't like to dance and sing
When I won't like to go to the parties no more
And I won't like to do a thing
Well bless my soul
When I get so old
Till have to walk around with a cane

And then turn on my radio
I'm gonna listen to those D.J. shows
I'm gonna be diggin' that rock 'n' roll
If I don't I'll go insane

I'm gonna listen to those D.J. shows
'Cause that's all I like to do
Those D.J. shows
Every day those D.J. shows
I dig the records that they play
Those D.J. shows
Every day those D.J. shows
