If you ever change your mind about leaving
Leaving me behind
Oh, oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving 
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah


You know I laughed when you left
But you know I only hurt myself
Bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

I'll give you jewelery and money too
But that's not all I'd do for you
Bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

I know I'll always be your slave
'Til I'm buried, buried in my grave
Oh bring, bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah
