It's a cold girl
To hurt her fellow
And watch him walk away cryin'
When all along
She knows she's wrong
To be so hard on a fellow that's tryin'
I was so unkind to hurt you so
Goin' out of my mind
I just gotta let you know
I remember you said
You will always care
Till death should we do part
Then it surely must be
My destiny
To die the death of a broken heart
So before I become a wonderin' rover
Let's go together
Talk this things over now


That's all it is, yeah, yeah

We've been lovin' so long
That it just seems wrong
That our love could never be
You could be anywhere
Baby, I wouldn't care
If I thought that you needed me
All the chains in the world
Couldn't hold me, couldn't hold me
Like a robot your love
Controls me, controls me

Baby, please don't go
I realize I love you so
Our love surely can be mended
It's just a little misunderstanding
