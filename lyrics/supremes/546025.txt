Does he love me?
I wanna know
How can I tell if he loves me so?


(Is it in his eyes?) 
Oh no, you'll be deceived
(Is it in his eyes?) 
Oh no, he'll make believe
If you wanna know
If he loves you so
It's in his kiss

(Or is it in his face?) 
Oh no, it's just his charm
(In his warm embrace?) 
Oh no, that's just his arms
If you wanna know
If he loves you so
It's in his kiss
Oh, oh, it´s in hos kiss

Oh-oh, Kiss him and squeeze him tight
And find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss

(About the way he acts?) 
Oh no, that's not the way
And you're not listening
To all I say
If you wanna know
If he loves you so
It's in his kiss
(that´s what it is)
