How many roads
Must a man walk down
Before they call him a man?
How many seas
Must a white dove sail
Before she can sleep in the sand?
And how many times
Must the cannonballs fly
Before they're ever banned?


The answer, my friend
Is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many years
Must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
And how many years
Can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times
Can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer, my friend
Is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many times
Must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears
Must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
And how many deaths
Will it takes 'till he knows
That too many people have died?

The answer, my friend
Is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

The answer, my friend
Is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
