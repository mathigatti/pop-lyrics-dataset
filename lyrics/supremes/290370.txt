The babe that was born of Mary
One cold and wintry night
He laid in the manger lonely
A star that shined so bright


Noël, Noël, how the angels sing
Noël, Noël, how did heavens ring
The babe that was born of Mary
One cold and wintry night

The shepherds abiding in the fields
Were watching over their sheep
And then in the town of Bethlehem
Mary sang her darling to sleep

The earth was filled with the precious love
Of the holy child sent from up above
The shepherds abiding in the fields
Were watching over their sheep.

And out of the East three wise men came
To see the promised king
The knelt down before this holy child
And then all three 

They praised this one who had come to earth
And the glories of this wond'rous birth
And out of the East three wise men came
To see the promised king.

Born of Mary.
