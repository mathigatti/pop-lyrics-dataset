Ho Ha Ho Ha
I hear someon sayin'
Ho Ha Ho Ha
Ho Ha Ho Ha


Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang

All day long they're saying
Ho Ha Ho Ha
Ho Ha Ho Ha

Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang

All day long they work so hard
'Till the sun is going down, down
Workin' on the highways and byways and wearing
Wearing a frown
You hear them moaning
Their lives away
Then you hear somebody say

That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang

They're saying...
I'm going home one of these days
I'm going home
See my woman whom I love so dear
Mean while
I have to work right here

Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang

All they long they're saying...
My, my, my work is so hard
Give me water
I'm thirsty
My work is so hard
