You're doing me wrong
Leading me on
I can see there's no need for me
So I'm gonna have to set you free


I'm giving you your freedom
To find somebody new
There's no sense in both of us
Making each other blue

Every time I wanted you around
You were nowhere to be found
The price I pay to love you
Is too much to bear
And it's unfair when you don't really care

I'm giving you your freedom
To find somebody new
There's no sense in both of us
Making each other blue

I tried so hard to make you happy with me
But now I see our love could never be
I can't deny I'm still in love with you
But this is it, I'm callin' it quits

I'm giving you your freedom
To find somebody new
There's no sense in both of us
Making each other blue

There's no sense in the both of us
Making each other blue
There's no sense in the both of us
Making each other blue
