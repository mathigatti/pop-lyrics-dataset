You send me (Send me)
I know you send me (Send me)
Darling, you send me (Send me)
Honest you do
Honest you do

Ooh, you thrill me (Thrill me)
I know you thrill me (Thrill me)
Darling, you thrill me (Thrill me)
Honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But, ooh, it lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you
And take you home

Woo,
You send me (Send me)
I know you send me (Send me)
Darling, you send me (Send me)
Honest you do
Honest you do
Honest you do

Oh, whenever I'm with you
I know, I know, I know that I need you
You thrill me
Honest you do
Honest you do
Honest you do

I know, I know, I know you're with me
I know, I know, I know whenever I need you
You send me
Honest you do
Honest you do
Honest you do
