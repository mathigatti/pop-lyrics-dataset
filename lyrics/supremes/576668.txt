How do you do what you do to me
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you


How do you do what you do to me
I'm feeling blue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven't a clue

You give me a feeling in my heart
Like an arrow passing through it
Suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it

How do you do what you do to me
If I only knew
Then perhaps you'll fall for me
Like I fell for you

You give me a feeling in my heart
Like an arrow passing through it
Suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it

How do you do what you do to me
If I only knew
Then perhaps you'll fall for me
Like I fell for you
When I do it to you
