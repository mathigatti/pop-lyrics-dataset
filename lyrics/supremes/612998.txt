It seems we stood and talked
like this before
We looked at each other 
In the same way then
But I can't remember where or when


The clothes you're wearing 
Are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling 
You were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Somethings that happen 
For the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before 
But who knows where or when

Somethings that happen 
For the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before 
But who knows where or when
