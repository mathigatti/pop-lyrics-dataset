For so long we share each other's lives
Gave up everything to keep love satisfied
Baby, the air that I breathe you will take when you leave
All because of something small
Like the day I missed your call
I tried to get in touch with you
When I finally did, you said we're through.


Why must we fall in love to find out how to cry?
Build up trust, then tear it down, oh tell me why
When it takes so long to make it
And no time at all to break it off.

Then you walked away I just stood there numb
I had nothing to say
Into the night you walked away with my life
And feeling almost half my size
I looked up and the heaven's eyes
Smile was gone we used to see
She knew that you were standing there with me.

Why must we fall in love to find out how to cry?
Build up trust, then tear it down, oh tell me why
When it takes so long to make it
And no time at all to break it off.

One day up, then the next day down
Love will keep you going like a merry go round
(To keep you hurting, hurting)
You both tried night and day from the start
To keep your love from falling apart
(To keep you hurting, hurting)
Then all at once you left one out
And love walks out the door
You're searching baby, for something else
You'll never find that thing you have before

Why must we fall in love to find out how to cry?
Build up trust, then tear it down, oh tell me why
When it takes so long to make it
And no time at all

Why must we fall in love to find out how to cry?
Build up trust, then tear it down oh tell me why
Why must we fall in love to find out how to cry?
Build up trust, then tear it down oh tell me why
