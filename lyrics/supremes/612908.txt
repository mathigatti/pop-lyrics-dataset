Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing it for me fellows, now
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


I try to put my arms around you
All because I wanna hold you tight
But everytime I reach for you, baby, try to kiss you
You just jump clean out of sight.

And oh I've got news for you
Baby, now I'll make place for two
I guess you're just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you.

Everybody say it
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, say yeah, yeah, yeah
One more time
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm gonna love you in every way
(Gonna love you, gonna love you, in every way)
I say I'm gonna love, girl, you in every way
(Gonna love you, gonna love you, in every way)

Now, other girls are falling
And I'm waiting for the moment
But I need you to stay by my side
I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me
Baby, please let me explain
I have kissed a few (baby, baby)
Many a few have kissed me too
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you
(Love you, love you)

Everybody say
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, say yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, sing it everybody now
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, say yeah, yeah, yeah.
