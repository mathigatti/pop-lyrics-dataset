Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the thinker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah


There is a blue one, who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo
We got to live together

I am no better and neither are you
We are the same whatever we do
You love me, you hate me you load me and then
You can't figure out what bag I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah

There is a long hair, who doesn't like the short hair
For being such a rich one, that will not help the poor one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo
We got to live together

There is a yellow one, who doesn't like the black one
Who won't accept the red one, who won't accept the white one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo
I am everyday people

'Cause there is a blue one, who can't accept the green one
For living with the fat one, trying to be a skinny one
There is a long hair, who doesn't like the short hair
For being such a rich one, that doesn't help the poor one
I am everyday people

'Cause there is a yellow one, who don't accept the black one
Who won't accept the red one, who won't accept the white one
I am everyday people
