Goodbye loneliness, going on to happiness
Along I faced your frowning face
And held your false embrace
My sighs, my longing nights
Baby my doubts and fears
Then love just came in on me
And wiped away my tears


And it won't stop, won't stop at just hugging
And it won't stop, won't stop at just kissing
And it won't stop, won't stop at just squeezing
Going all the way to true, true love, ooh real true love

And day by day you watched me wait on my lonely cloud
But it was just a matter of faith
It's love, it's no mistake
For things that have passed, honey, our things to come
When faith took my broken heart and mended it with love

And it won't stop, won't stop at just hugging
And it won't stop, won't stop at just kissing
And it won't stop, won't stop at just squeezing
Going all the way to true, true love, ooh real true love soulful love

So long empty room, no more night with gloom
For now a precious love I share with tender love and care
What lips I have missed, what arms I've waited for
But no more loneliness, it's happiness for sure

And it won't stop, won't stop at just hugging
And it won't stop, won't stop at just kissing
And it won't stop, won't stop at just squeezing
Going all the way to true, true love, ooh real true love
Hey now, it's going all the way to true, true love
