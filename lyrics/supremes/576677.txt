Oh, baby life could be something wonderful
Wonderful


You keep me satisfied
I need you by my side
But you wanna leave today
Don't throw it all away

The tender love we knew
The tender love so true
The happiness we shared
Just knowin' someone cared

You're gonna need me
Like you needed me before
Need me, baby
Come back and close the door
Can't cool all my emotion
Can't cool all my devotion
Life could be something wonderful

I'll set you free
Something wonderful
I'll set you free
In your sweet caress
It's better than livin' a life of loneliness

Ooh I'm givin' you all I had to give
Each day made me proud to live
You took the best of me
If you don't want the rest of me

I'll set you free
Fine fine
I'll set you free
Fine fine
I don't want nobody who don't want me, ooh

You're gonna miss the love I've been givin'
You're gonna miss the life you've been livin'
You're gonna need me I know it
You're gonna want me

But I'll set you free, I'll set you free
Ooh, I'll set you free, I'll set you free
You don't care about me
Ooh, life could be something wonderful

Something wonderful
Here's a sweet caress
It's better than livin' a life of loneliness
You're gonna be lonely boy

Ooh I'm givin' you all I had to give
Each day made me proud to live
You took the best of me
If you don't want the rest of me

I'll set you free
I'll set you free
I'll set you free
Don't want nobody who don't want me
Yeah, you're gonna be lonely

You're gonna miss the love I've been givin'
You're gonna miss the life you've been livin'
You're gonna want me, baby I know it
You're gonna want me, but I'll set you free

I could be, oh baby, I could be
Oh baby, I could be
Anything I wanna be
As long as I know you're here with me
