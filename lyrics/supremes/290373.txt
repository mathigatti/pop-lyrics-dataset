I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything my friend,
If it makes you feel alright


For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
What I got
I'll give to you

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love

Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No no no no,
Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love

Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No no no no,
Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Can't buy me love
