Lover of mine
Gone to a far-away land
Serving your country
On some far-away sand
If you should get lonely,
Remember that your heart belongs to me


I'm sending you a picture
To carry with you all the time
So when you're feeling lonely
It's something to remind you
I'm thinking of you constantly
Remember that your heart belongs to me
(your heart belongs to me)

If a pretty girl should pass you by
I won't mind if you give her the eye
Or even if you give her a smile sometimes
But keep your heart because your heart is mine
Your heart is mine
Your heart is mine

Lover of mine
If I could tell you how I yearn
For the day to come
When you will return
From far across the sea
So remember that your heart belongs to me
Remember your heart belongs to me
You're far across the sea
But your heart, it belongs, it belongs to only me
Lover of mine
