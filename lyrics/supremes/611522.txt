Now I wanna tell ya--of a great love--ohh
It will light up
It will surely light up--darkened worlds
If you just believe...


Stoned Love, Mmm..
Oh yeah
A love for each other will bring fighting to an end
Forgiving one another 
Time after time doubt creeps in
But like the sun lights up the sky with a message from above
Oh yeah, I find no other greater symbol of love--

Yeah, don't ya hear the wind blowing
MMmmhmm
Stoned Love
Oh yeah, I tell ya I ain't got no other

Woo, woo, Mmmmh
Stoned Love 
Aww yeah

Life is so short 
Put the present time at hand
Aww yeah--and if you're young at heart 
Rise up and take your stand
And to the man
On whose shoulder 
The world must depend
I pray for peace and love--Amen

Oooh--can't ya feel it--mmm hmm
Stoned Love
I tell ya I ain't got no other 
Ahh haa
Stoned Love
Aww yeah

If the war 'tween our nations passed--oh yeah
Will the love 'tween our brothers and sisters last? 
On and on and on and on and....

Stoned Love
Aw yeah--
I tell ya I ain't got no other

Mmm hmm
Stoned Love

Can't ya, can't ya, can't ya, can't ya, can't ya feel it
Woo, woo, mmm hmm
Stoned Love
Aw yeah stoned, stoned, stoned, stoned

Woo, woo, mmm hmm
Stoned Love
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Woo, woo, ah ha 
Stoned Love
Aw yeah, yeah, ah, ah, ah

Woo, woo
Mmm hmm 
Stoned Love
