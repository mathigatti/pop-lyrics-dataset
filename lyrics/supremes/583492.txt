Please don't ever break these chains of love
You've wrapped around me
'Cause I've been so happy darling
Ever since the day you've bound me


So tighter, pull 'em tighter
Till I feel love's sweet pain
'Cause these chains of love
Keep me from going insane

Love, oh love sweet love
Comes but once in a lifetime
The only love I need is yours
And oh, darling, I hope you need mine

So tighter, pull 'em tighter
Till I feel love's sweet pain
'Cause these chains of love
Keep me from going insane

I felt so sure I could resist you
My mistake was the first time I kissed you
Now I'm caught in a web of my own making

My heart's full of love and it's yours for the taking
Ooh, take it, baby don't break it
Just like a thief in the night
You stole my heart away
But now that you stolen it darling
I've only got one thing to say

Tighter, pull 'em tighter
Till I feel love's sweet pain
'Cause these chains of love
Keep me from going insane

These chains of love
Tighter, tighter, tighter these chains
Chains of love
Baby, baby, baby these chains
Chains of love
Lock 'em up, lock 'em up, lock 'em up
Chains
