Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight


I'm a poorman's son from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye

When we go out stepping on the town
For a while my money's low and my suit's out of style
But it`s all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight

Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl
I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks
She was born and raised
In a great big old house full of butlers and maids
She says give her the things
That money can buy but I'll never
Never never make my baby cry
And it's all right
What if I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everytÂ¬hing is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight

No one is better than I
I know I'm just an average guy
No footfall hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets
You see I'm a poor man's son
