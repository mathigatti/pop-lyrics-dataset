I pulled in to Nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past dead
I just need some place where I could lay my head
Hey mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?
He just grinned and shook my hand
'No' was all he said


Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
And you put the load right on me

I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said 'Hey Carmen, come on, let's go downtown'
She said 'I gotta go but my friend can stick around'

Take a load off, Fanny 
Take a load for free 
Take a load off, Fanny 
And you put the load right on me

Go down Miss Moses, there's nothing that you can say 
It's just old Luke, waiting on the judgement day 
'Well, Luke my friend, what about young Anna-Lee?'
He said 'Do me a favour son, won't you stay and keep Anna-Lee company?'

Take a load off, Fanny 
Take a load for free 
Take a load off, Fanny 
And you put the load right on me

Catch a cannonball now to take me down the line 
My bag is sinking low and I do believe it's time 
To get back to Miss Fanny, I know she's the only one 
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

Take a load off, Fanny 
Take a load for free 
Take a load off, Fanny 
And you put the load right on me

Take a load off, Fanny 
Take a load for free 
Take a load off, Fanny 
Put the weight on me

Take a load off, Fanny 
Put the weight on me
