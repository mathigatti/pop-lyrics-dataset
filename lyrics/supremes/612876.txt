Lovin' you, baby
Is better than ever
The stronger the thought
Of you that never ceases


The longer our loving
The more it increases
But 'you' is where my everlasting peace is
Keep me here
Hold me close, hold me near

I said
I wanna see you
The sooner, the better
I want all your time I can beg steal or borrow
Today only makes me anticipate tomorrow

You are the ship of love
And I'm the cargo
Set your sail
And though it storms
We'll never fail

Lovin' you is better than ever
Lovin' you is better than ever

You and I have been blessed
With love that's better than best
Love that withstood the test of time
You know that I'm proud that I can say
Seems like day by day

Lovin' you baby
Is better than ever
Lovin' you baby
Is better than ever
