There's no stopping us now
Now that we found our way
There's no stopping us now
Our love is here to stay
Follishly we've been apart
Breaking each other's heart
Stubborness and foolish pride
Caused us to push love aside
The loneliness from being apart
Opened up our eyes
To the love that was always there
Deep inside


Now that we've faced the unknown
And we can't make it alone
We're closer together more now then ever
For now that we've found love
We've got tp hold on love

There's no stopping us now
This time love's here to stay
There's no stopping us now
Now we have found our way
The precious hours we have lost
We'll never regain
But together we'll fill the hours that remain
The loneliness we have known
We'll push behind
Together forever
We'll make up for all lost time

Now we're in each other's arms
Nothing can do us harm
Nothing can shake us,
Nothing can brak us
We'll be together
Forever and ever

There's no stopping us now
This time love's here to stay
There's no stopping us now
Together we've found the way
Never again shall foolish pride keep us apart
Never again shall stubborness break our hearts
There's no stopping us now
Now that we've found our way
Would you believe?
There's no stopping us now
Now that love's here to stay
There's no stopping us now
Now that we've...
