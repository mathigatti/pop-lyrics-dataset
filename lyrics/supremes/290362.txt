Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-bah-bah
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-bah-bah.


You don't hold me in your arms the way you did
When you were so much in love with me
I recall the time when you were all mine
And I didn't have to share your love with anyone.

And when I feel I wanna be with you
And I can't right then, it almost drives me insane
'Cause you're the only one who can easy my mind
'Cause you're the reason of all of my hurt and all of my pain.

When I guess my world was made believe
'Cause I thought I can have your love all to myself
And there's nothing I can do 'cause you're gonna do
What you wanna do anyhow, anyway.

But loving you is blinding me so
I still hold on to every hope and every dream
While deep inside I feel the tide is about to turn
And you won't find me hanging around you anymore.

But keep this in mind for the end of time
You're gonna want me more than I want you now
Ooo, it's gonna be a shame, hate to see you that way
I know how it feels 'cause I'm on that cloud today.
