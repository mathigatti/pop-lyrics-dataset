Thou swell, thou witty
Thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty ?
Wouldst hold my hand ?


Both thine eyes are cute too
What they do to me
Hear me holler I choose a 
Sweet lolla paloosa in thee

I'd feel so rich 
In a hut for two
Two rooms and kitchen 
I'm sure would do

Give me just a plot of
Not a lot of land
Thou swell, thou witty
Thou swell, thou witty
Thou swell, thou witty
Thou grand

I'd feel so rich 
In a hut for two
Two rooms and kitchen 
I'm sure will do

Give me just a plot of
Not a lot of land
Thou swell, thou witty
Thou swell, thou witty
Thou swell, thou witty
Thou grand
