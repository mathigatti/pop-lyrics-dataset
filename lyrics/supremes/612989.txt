Oh, my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time


Time goes by
So slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine

I need your love
I need your love
God, speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea
To the sea
To the open arms of the sea

Lonely river sigh
Wait for me
Wait for me
I'll be coming home
Wait for me

Oh, my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time

And time goes by
So slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine

I need your love
I need your love
God, speed your love to me
