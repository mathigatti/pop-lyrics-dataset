Play a sad song
For a girl with a broken heart
With a broken heart


Play a sad song
Let him know that I'm still crying
Let him know I'm slowly dieing, slowly dieing, slowly dieing
So play a sad, sad song
For a girl with a broken heart
With a broken heart

I don't know why he left
We were doing so fine
He was mine, all mine
He must have found another love
He must have found another love
And put me down
So play a sad, sad, sad, sad song
For a girl with a broken heart

I gave him all the love
All the loving I had
Now he's driving me mad
He knows I've never been a cheat
I tried to make my kisses sweet
He said I made his life complete
Now he's gone
So play a sad, sad, sad song
For a girl with a broken heart
So play a sad, sad song
For a girl with a broken heart
