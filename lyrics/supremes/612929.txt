If Columbus never sailed the sea
]If Longfellow never wrote a rhyme
If leaves have never grown upon a tree
And if the sands have never told the time
Then I guess I don't love you
Love you like I do
Then I guess I'll have to find me someone new
Then I guess this love I feel couldn't possibly be real


If Beethoven never wrote a song
And if Shakespeare never wrote a play
If a man has never done a wrong
And if night has never followed day
Then I guess I don't love you
Love you like I do
Then I guess I'll have to find me someone new
Then I guess this love for you couldn't possibly be true

If high is low
And up is down
And if love is not considered an emotion
If yes is no
And square is round
And if waves had never rode across the ocean

If Michaelangelo could never paint 
And if Jezebel was a saint 
Then I guess I don't love you
Love you like I do
Then I guess I'll have to find me someone new
Then I guess this love is wrong couldn't possibly be strong

Then I don't love you
Love you like I do
Then I guess I'll have to find me someone new
Then I guess this love I feel...
