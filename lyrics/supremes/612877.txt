Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One gal you're everything to


Fame, if you win it
It comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to?
Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you've found him
He tried to build your world around him
Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy too

Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy too
