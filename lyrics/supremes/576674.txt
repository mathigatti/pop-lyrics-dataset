I guess I'll miss the man
Explain it, if you can
His face was far from fine
But still I'll miss his face
And wonder if he's missing mine


He never smiled enough
But though his words were gruff
I liked his shy, sad glance
I never told him so
But then, I never got the chance

Some men are heroes
Some men outshine the sun
Some men are simple, good men
This man wasn't one

Ooh

This man--
Wasn't one

And I won't miss his moods
His gloomy solitudes
His blunt and thoughtless style (thoughtless style)
But please don't get me wrong
He was the best to come along
In a long, long while
