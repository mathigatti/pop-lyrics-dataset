Love came through my window and right out the door
Leaving me alone and hurt forever more
Suddenly you came, you saw, you captured my heart
So tenderly you came to rescue in time this heart of mine.


Now no more by myself, no more hurt to be felt
And no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again
And no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again

Once in heartbreak I believed always in heartache
Lost in sorrow with little hope for tomorrow
Instantly when you smiled at me my heart stood still
All the emptiness I had inside you lovingly fulfilled.

I then felt born again and it feels so grand
And no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again
Now no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again
Now no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again.
