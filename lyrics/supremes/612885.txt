Ooowee baby
Honey baby, talk is cheap
So if you want my love to keep
Come and show me that you really care


Ooowee baby
Baby, come and kiss me quick
Come and smear all my lipstick
If you really want my love to share
Ooowee baby

Just one kiss from you is worth
All the talk there in on Earth
A million words don't equal just one touch
Ooowee baby
If your love is really real
Don't just tell me how you feel
If you really love me oh so much
Ooowee baby

You need more than words
In this situation
A kiss can do as much
To make communication
Cuddle me closer
And be real good conversation
So hold me tight, tonight's the night
Fill my heart with pure delight

Ooowee baby
Ooowee baby, ooowee baby

The words "I love you" just don't do
As much for me as just a few
Hugs and kisses every now and then
Ooowee baby
Now that I am in your reach
You don't have to make a speech
Just open up your arms and close me in
Ooowee baby
Ooowee baby
