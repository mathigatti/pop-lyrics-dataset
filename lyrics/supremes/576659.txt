You're a girl that hates to see others happy
Unless you're happy too
So you've told the boy I love
A lot of things that ain't true


And its' wringing my heart
Cos it's making us drift apart
So humbly I ask of you
To undo the wrong that you've done

Please go to him, tell him
Before he finds someone new
Cos if I ever lose him
I don't know what I'll do

Cos he's all I got
Built my world around him
Since the day I found him

Girl your selfishness causes unhappiness
But why make it hard for me?
Since you been unhappy in love
I guess misery loves company

For once in your life
Consider another's feelings
Confess the truth
That you've been concealing

Please go to him, tell him
Before he finds someone new
Cos if I ever lose him
I don't know what I'll do

Cos he's all I got
Built my world around him
Since the day found him

I would gladly go to him
Instead of asking you
But there might be a shadow of a doubt
Your gossip might have been true

So tearfully I ask of you
Please undo the wrong that you've done
Cos without his love
I know, I know I can't go on

Please go to him, tell him
Before he finds someone new
Cos if I ever lose him
I don't know what I'll do

Cos he's all I got
Built my world around him
Since the day found him
Can't bear to lose him
