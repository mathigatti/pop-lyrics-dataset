Why is it we can't be
The way we used to be
Problems we would work it out
Whenever there was any doubt
You use to trust in me
But now you're leaving me to suffer
Oh, oh, oh yeah a-yeah
If you give love a chance
I'll do the best I can
We can work it out in time
And mend the pieces of our lives
Please believe in me
Every day is looking darker--


Think I'm gonna run into bad weather
Skies are gray
Cause our love just ain't together
Think I'm gonna run into bad weather
Cause our love just ain't together

Ooh,
All the things we used to do
Together me and you
Think of the fun we had
And how our love's suppose to last
Mistakes were not all you
I know I made some too, sugar, ooh baby, baby
Open up your eyes and see
That you're the one for me
Let's fix it there's still time
We can love, love sunshine
Baby won't you please
Stop it, don't make me suffer--

Think I'm gonna run into bad weather
Ooh look at the rain
Cause our love just ain't together, no-o
Think I'm gonna run into bad weather
Cause our stuff just ain't together--

Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now--

Ooh

Yeah, yeah

LYNDA:
Ah!

Think I'm gonna run into bad weather
Cause our love just ain't together, oh no

LYNDA:
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

Think I'm gonna run into bad weather
Look at the rain--
Cause our stuff just ain't together
Hey, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Bad weather, bad weather, bad weather
Our love just ain't together
(It ain't together, no)
(Run into bad weather)
Gonna run, gonna run, I'm gonna run, I'm gonna run
You got me running, you got me running, hey, yeah
