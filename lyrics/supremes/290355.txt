Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through
I've got an aching heart
Makes me cry sometimes
I've got an aching heart
Makes me cry sometimes


For every aching heart
Some tears must fall
'Cause when you lose the one you love
You lose your all and all

Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through
Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through

The way I miss your loving
Makes me cry sometimes
The way I miss your loving
Makes me cry sometimes

I gave you my love
In you I had no doubts
But as soon as love walked in
You walked right out

Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through
Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through

The way you hesitate to kiss me
Makes me cry sometimes
The way you never seem to miss me
Makes me cry sometimes
But I never bother
To wipe the tears from my face
'Cause I know another tear
Will fall in it's place

Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through
Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through
