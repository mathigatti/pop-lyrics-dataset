Oh baby let's take life's highway
It's automatically yours
And my way no road is too rough to travel
We'll walk barefoot on life's gravel together
Whatever we express now
Automatically means success now
Whatever mystery life's about
There's no doubt we'll work it out


Cause you're mine and I'm yours
So who cares if when it rains it pours
I'm yours and you're mine
It's automatically sunshine
Oh baby, baby

Ooh baby until you find you automatically
I'm behind you so do your thing and always know
Where you go I'm gonna follow
Don't you worry when you're set back
Home you'll hurry and then you'll get back
All the courage my love can give
For all our lives long as we give
(repeat chorus)
