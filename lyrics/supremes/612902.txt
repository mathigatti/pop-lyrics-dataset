Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper "I love you"
And steal a kiss or two


Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams
Come true

Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know him the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to

Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams
Come true

Some day my prince will come
Somewhere waiting for me
There's someone I'm longing to see
Some day my prince will come
