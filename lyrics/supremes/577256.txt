Nothing you could say
Could tear me away from my guy (My guy)
Nothing you could do
'Cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy
I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter
Like birds of a feather
We stick together
I'm telling you from the start
I can't be torn apart from my guy


I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you say
What in the world will make me feel this way?
My girl, talking 'bout my girl

No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy

I've got so much, so much, so much honey
That the bees envy me
I guess you say
What in the world will make me feel this way?

There's not a man today
Who could take me away from my guy (My guy)

I don't need money, fortune or fame

There's nothing you can buy
Could make me tell a lie to my guy
There's nothing you can do
Could make me untrue to my guy

I guess you say
What in the world will make me feel this way?

There's not a man today
Who could take me away from my guy (My guy)
Nothing you can say could tear me away from my guy
