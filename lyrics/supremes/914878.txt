You just can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
I don't deserve it: I've been too good to you
You just can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
There's too many things I've done for you


I wish you'd make up your mind. What cha gonna do?
Are you gonna leave me, or return the love I give to you?
Take your time: think about it, you got one more chance
Cause if you decide to leave me, you can't come back again.
I love you boy, but I'm a woman, I'm not a toy. You just can't

Keep runnin in and out of my life
I don't deserve it, I've been to good to you.
You just can't keep runnin in and out of my
It hurts too much, it's got to stop now.

All the time that you're gone,
My whole world, my world is wrong
When you come back again
It's the livin in that you're hurting me, you're destoying me.

(Runnin in and out, ooo hoo) in and out of my life
(Runnin in and out, ooo hoo) no no no no

I love you more than words can ever say
But I need you, all of each and every day
So if you love me, let me be, but....

You just can't keep runnin in and out of my life
I don't deserve it, I've been too good to you
You just can't keep runnin in and out of my life
There's too many things I've done for you
You just can't keep runnin in', and runnin' out, ohhh
It hurts too much, it's got to stop now
You just can't keep runnin in and out of my life
(and fade)
