Listen everybody, especially you guys
Is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?
I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
But I believe, I believe
A man should loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see him treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere tell him it's unfair


Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Somebody
I want a witness

Is it right to be treated so bad
When you've given everything you had?
Even tossin' in my sleep
'Cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now, you girls do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear, let me hear you say yeah, yeah

Up early in the morning with him on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been cryin'
But I believe a man's a woman's best friend
So I'm gonna stick by him till the very end
But he causes so much misery I forget how
Love is supposed to be
Somebody, somewhere, tell him it ain't fair

Can I get a witness?
I want a witness

Everybody knows, especially you girls
Love can be bad
But I have a love that's twice as bad
Now you girls do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear, let me hear you say yeah, yeah

Can I get a witness
