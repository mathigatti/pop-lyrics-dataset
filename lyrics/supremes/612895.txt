All through this long and sleepless night
I hear my neighbors talking
Saying that out of my life into another's arms
You'll soon be walking


Somebody shake me, wake me when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreaming 
And wake me when it's over

They say our love ain't what it used to be
And everyone knows but me
I close my ears not wanting to hear 
But the words are loud and clear

Through these walls so thin
I hear my neighbors when they say
"He don't love her"
They say my heart's in danger
'Cause you're leaving me 
For the love of a stranger

Somebody shake me, wake me when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreaming 
And wake me when it's over

Boy, you're what my heart desires
My whole world you've inspired
I can't bear to be losing you
'Cause I've loved you my whole life through

Restlessly
I pace the floor
listening to my neighbors criticize
What a fool I am not to realize
You don't want me by your side
As the tears stream down my face
I can't believe I've been replaced
If I ever had a dream before
Somebody tell me I'm dreaming now

And then shake me, wake me 
Somebody when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreaming 
And wake me when it's over
