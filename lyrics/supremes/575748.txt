Maybe you'll wanna give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
And maybe you'll go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all
Oh, little girl!


In that case I don't want no part
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
So, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Maybe you think that love would tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around
Or maybe you think that love was made for fools
And so it makes you wise to break the rules
Oh, little girl!

In that case I don't want no part
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
So, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Oh, little girl
In that case I don't want no part
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
So, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Oh, little girl
I second that emotion
