Diana Ross: Love is here,
Supremes: Love is here
Diana: Oh my darlin' now you're gone
Supremes: Now you're gone
Diana: Love is here,
Supremes: Love is here
Diana : And oh my darlin' now you're gone
Supremes: Now you're gone


Diana: You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms, I felt so unaware
Of loneliness, that was waiting there

Supremes: Look at what you've done
Look at what you've done
Diana:(talking during background vocals)
You took my heart
And turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Diana: Love is here,
Supremes: Love is here
Diana: And oh my darlin' now you're gone
Supremes: Now you're gone
Diana: Love is here,
Supremes: Love is here
Diana: And oh my darlin' now you're gone
Supremes: Now you're gone

You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day,
But as soon as love
Came into my heart
You turned,
And you walked, just walked away

Supremes: Look what you have done
Look what you have done
Diana:(talking during background vocals)
You stripped me of my dreams
Then gave me faith, but took my hope
Look at me now

Diana: Look at me,
See what lovin' you has done to me
Supremes: Done to me
Diana: Look at my face,
Supremes: Look at my face
Diana: See how cryin' has left it's trace
Supremes: Left it's trace
Diana: And after you made me all your own,
Supremes: Made me all your own
Diana: Then left me all alone
Supremes: Left me all alone
Diana: You made your words
Sound so sweet
Knowing, that your love
I couldn't keep

Supremes: Look what you have done
Look what you have done
Diana:(talking during backgroud vocals)
My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there,
And the lonely cry fades the air

Diana: Love is here,
Supremes: Love is here
Diana: Oh my darlin' now you're gone
Supremes: Now you're gone
Diana: Love is here,
Supremes: Love is here
Diana: And oh my darlin' now you're gone
Supremes: Now you're gone
Diana: You made me love you
Supremes: You made me love you
Diana: Oh my darlin' now you're gone
Supremes: Now you're gone
Diana: You made me love you
Supremes: You made me love you
Diana: Ooh uh, oh my darlin' now you're gone
Supremes: Now you're gone
