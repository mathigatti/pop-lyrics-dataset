Tender words of love
That once came easy
Now seems strained and insincere
Could this be the beginning
The beginning of the end


You don't tell me that you love me
And your kisses seem untrue
Could this be the beginning
The beginning of the end

My heart oh, my love
My everything has always
Been just for you
Now I pray every day
Each and every day
This coldness I find is only in my mind

Now you swear
You still love me
I longer feel you need me near
Could this be the beginning
I believe it's the beginning of the end
The beginning
The beginning of the end
