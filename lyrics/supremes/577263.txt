Look out, Santa's coming
Look out, Santa's coming


You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He knows when you're asleep
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

Look out, Santa's coming
Look out, Santa's coming
Santa Claus is coming to town

Look out, Santa's coming
Look out, Santa's coming
Santa Claus is coming to town

He knows when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out
You better not pout
You better not cry
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
