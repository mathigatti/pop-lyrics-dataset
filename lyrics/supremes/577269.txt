You're my driving wheel
Feels good, baby
You take me farther
Ooh!
Than I've been before
Ride, ride, ride, ride
You're my driving wheel
Feels so good , baby!
Just one touch
Ow!/Ooh!
Opens up my door


You're the engine that keeps me running
You're the motor that keeps me coming:
To the road that keeps on winding
Coming to the love
I keep on finding
Every time you touch me

Starts my motor running
I like the way you keep it humming
Keeps my motor running
I like the way you keep it humming,
Hey!
You're my driving wheel
You better believe it, baby
You take me farther
Whoo!

Than I've been before
Than I've been before, yeah
You're my driving wheel
My driving wheel, baby
Just one touch--Ow!

Opens up my door
Opens up my door
Ain't a road in life
I can't travel
As long as I know you're there
Ain't no map I can't unravel
As long as I know you care
Every time you touch me

Starts my motor running
I like the way you keep it humming
Keeps my motor running
I like the way you keep it humming, Oh!

You're my driving wheel
I can't hear you now
You take me farther

Uh huh

Than I've been before

Than I've been before-

You're my driving wheel
Just one touch
Opens up my door

Uh huh:
Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh huh,
Uh huh, Uh huh huh, Uh huh
Uh huh, huh, huh

You're my driving wheel

Driving wheel, baby
You take me farther
Ooh!

Than I've been before
Than I've been before
You're my driving wheel
Drive me crazy, baby!
Just one touch
Opens up my door
Opens up my door, yeah
You're my driving wheel
My driving wheel, baby
You take me farther
Than I've been before
Yeah, yeah, ooh!
You're my driving wheel
You're my driving wheel, baby
Just one touch
Just one touch
Opens up my door
Opens up my door, yeah
You're my driving wheel
You keep me moving, baby

You take me farther
Than I've been before
Than I've been before
You're my driving wheel
You keep me groovin', baby
