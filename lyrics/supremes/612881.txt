My romance doesn't have 
To have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need 
A blue lagoon standing by


No month of May
No twinkling stars
No hide away
No soft guitars

My romance doesn't need 
A castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly 
Surprising refrain
Wide awake
I can make my most 
Fantastic dreams come true

My romance doesn't need 
A thing but you

My romance doesn't have 
To have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need 
A blue lagoon standing by

No month of May
No twinkling stars
No hide away
No soft guitars

My romance doesn't need 
A castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly 
Surprising refrain
Wide awake
I can make my most 
Fantastic dreams come true

My romance doesn't need 
A thing but you
