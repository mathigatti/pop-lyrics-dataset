We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the Zoo


It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charmes us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers in the wilds
And starve together, dear in Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat bologny on a roll
In Central Park, we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy
