Please lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness


I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

Birds sing out of tune
And rain outside hide the moon
I'm OK, here I'll stay
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love's smile
He may come, I know not when
When he does I lose
So baby until then

Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say 
I won't stay in a world without love

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love's smile
He may come, I know not when
When he does I know
So baby until then

Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love
