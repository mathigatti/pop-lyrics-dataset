Surfer boy, surfer boy
Surfer boy, surfer boy
Look at the way, the way he rides
He rides, he rides oh so high
Look at the way, the way he rides
He rides, he rides oh so high


My surfer boy
Riding waves just for joy
What are you taking chances for
Is it a matter of pride
Riding waves so high
Seems to touch the sky
Waves that rock and sway
Ooh takes my breath away

Surfers all around
Cheering you as you ride down
Each day I feel as before
So afraid till you're safe to shore
In my arms once more
The way he rides, oh so high

The cheering crowd nearby
Watch you surf the waves so high
Wild as the wind, you surf the sea
Like a man on a flying trapeze

My surfer boy
I'm so afraid for you
Though thrilling it must be, my love
Be safe for me, my love
Ooh oh so high
The way he rides, oh so high

My surfer boy
Riding waves just for joy
What are you taking chances for
Is it a matter of pride
Riding waves so high
Seems to touch the sky
Waves that rock and sway
Ooh takes my breath away

Surfer boy, surfer boy, surfer boy
