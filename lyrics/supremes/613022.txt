When you first gave it to me
Your sweet kiss of fire
The burning flame of love
Started mounting higher
Till it consumed my heart and soul
And like King Midas loved his gold
I wanted you alone to hold
And your kiss of fire
Your sweet kiss of fire
Your sweet kiss of fire


And then you took it away
Your sweet kiss of fire
Taking the thrill out of love
Killing my desire
I'm like a leaf without a tree
Like a fish without the sea
I'm as cold as cold can be
Without your kiss of fire
Your sweet kiss of fire
Your sweet kiss of fire

Please don't forsake me
After showing me the way to love
Just come on and make me
Warm as the sun that shines above

Bring it, bring it to me
Your sweet kiss of fire
Stop this hurt within me
Bring back my desire
It's you that I adore
I'll do anything you implore
If you'll just give to me once more
Your sweet kiss of fire
Your sweet kiss of fire
Fire, fire
