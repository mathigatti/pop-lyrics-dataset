Funny how time changes
Rearranges everything


For instance how could I have known
That you'd be the only one for me
When you wanted me I didn't want you

And time changes things its true
'Cause now I want you
I want you

When you used to speak to me
I didn't give you a second look
'Cause I already had many guys
In my telephone book
But one day my heart spoke your name
My heart spoke your name

And time changes things its true
'Cause now I want you
I want you

Funny how times turns the tables
And left me yearning, my heart burning
For instance you just past me by passed me by
You didn't speak and I wanted to die
Now that I want you
You don't want me

And time changes things, it's true
You know I need you
And time changes things, it's true
I keep repeating, now
And time changes things, it's true
'Cause now I want you

It's so funny
Funny how time changes
Funny how time rearranges
It's so funny
It's so funny how I want you
