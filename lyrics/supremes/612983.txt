It hurt me so bad
To see you cross the floor
Kissing her


You didn't see me
But I saw you and
It hurt me so

It hurt me so bad
When I tried to cry
To ease my hurt inside
But I tried in vain
'Cause the tears never came

I'm too hurt to cry
And too much in love to say goodbye

I tried telling myself
That you loved me and no one else
But each time I look across the floor
I'm just not sure

When I saw you hold her tight
With all my mind I tried to cry
To ease this hurt
This hurt inside

But I'm too hurt to cry
And too much in love to say goodbye

Although you hurt me so
I love you too much to let you go
And when you take me home
You'll never know
I saw you kissing her

I'll go on like nothing has happened instead
Some things are better unsaid
But if could cry
I wouldn't feel so sad

But I'm too hurt to cry
And too much in love to say goodbye
But I'm too hurt to cry
And too much in love to say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
