Although you're never near
You're voice I often hear
Another day, another night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely
Yes, I'm lonely
Let my heart beats for you only


Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving

Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a girl to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I been losing sleep

Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving

Empty nights echo your name
Sometimes I wonder will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah!
When you see me smile
You know things has gotten worse
Any smile you might see 
Has all been rehearsed

Darling, I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me, darling
Makes me feel half alive

"Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
