Honey bee keep on stingin' me
Honey bee keep on stingin' me


When I first saw you standin' there
Temptation filled your smile
I had to hold on to my heart
But you were so persistent
You wore down my resistance, now

Honey bee you're such a part of me
Honey bee you stung the heart of me
Honey bee keep on stingin' me
Mmm

You started a fever burnin' deep inside of me
Since you stung me with your sweet love
My whole life is rearranged
My heart looks like love has changed

Honey bee you're such a part of me
Honey bee you stung the heart of me
Honey bee keep on stingin' me

Into my life like a breath of spring
Came your love like the sunshine
To stop the rain
Dried all my tears

Darlin' I've been blessed
With your honey sweet love
And I must confess
Our love's dear
Ooh baby

Honey bee keep on stingin' me
Honey bee keep on stingin' me

This taste of honey you're givin' me
Has sweetened all my bitterness
And finally pushed my fears aside
In return I'll send in your direction
All my sweet lovin' affection

Honey bee you're such a part of me
Honey bee you stung the heart of me
Honey bee keep on stingin' me
Honey bee you're such a part of me
Honey bee keep on stingin' me
Honey bee you stung the heart of me
