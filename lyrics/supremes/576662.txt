Oh Mary, Cindy...
Listen, isn't that Diane?
Hey Mary, Cindy...
It is Diane.
Where are you, where are you?
Over here.
Where...?
Over here, in the magic kingdom.
Come on, come on in.
Yeah, let's go to the magic kingdom.
Right through here.


Heigh ho, heigh ho
To have some fun we go
We'll keep on singing all day long
Heigh ho, heigh ho

Heigh ho, heigh ho, heigh ho
For if you're feeling low
You positively can't go wrong
With a heigh, heigh ho

We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig in our mine the whole day through
To dig dig dig dig dig dig dig is what we like to do
And while we dig we always sing
And when we dig there ain't a better thing
Than a tune, than a tune, you can whistle or can croon

So we dig dig dig dig dig dig dig in our mine the whole day through
To dig dig dig dig dig dig dig until it's time to quit
And then we warble down the scale
As we go marching down the trail
Right along, right along
To the rhythm of this song

Here we are!
Wow, here we are in the magic kingdom

Heigh ho, heigh ho
To make your troubles go
Just keep on singing
All day long, heigh ho

Heigh ho, heigh ho, heigh ho
For if you're feeling low
You positively can't go wrong
With a heigh ho, heigh ho

Heigh ho, heigh ho
To make your troubles go
Just keep on singing
All day long, heigh ho

Heigh ho, heigh ho, heigh ho
To keep from feeling low
You positively can't go wrong
With a heigh ho, heigh ho

Heigh ho, heigh ho
To make your troubles go
Just keep on singing
All day long, heigh ho

Heigh ho, heigh ho, heigh ho
To keep from feeling low
You positively can't go wrong
With a heigh ho, heigh ho
