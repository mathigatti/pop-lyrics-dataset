You've given me a true love
and every day I thank you love
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting, so exciting


Whenever you're near
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer
Closer to your arms

Then suddenly, I hear a symphony
Ooh, your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine
'Till I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world
Made for you and me

Whenever you're near
I hear a symphony
Play sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine now baby

Baby, baby
You bring much joy within
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on
Now baby, baby
Those tears that fill my eyes
I cry not for myself
But for those who never felt the joy we felt

Whenever you're near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rapsody of love now

Baby, baby
As you stand holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air

Now baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
Ooh, so close to me, baby, baby
Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
