I'll admit that you've been
Playing with my heart
Just like it was a toy
And I've been playing along
And letting you treat me wrong
Because it seems to give you joy


Are you sure love is the name of this game
Are you sure love is the name of this game

For days on end you just stay away
Waitin' for my heart to weaken
It's like we're playing hide and seek
And I'm the one who's always seeking

Are you sure love is the name of this game
I wanna know
Are you sure L-O-V-E love is the name of this game

Well if everything's right
And uptight
How come the heartaches keep repeating
With every beat my heart is beating
Now can it be that you've been cheating
Cheating on me

Now how come you keep on
Telling me lies
Filling my life with sorrow
Don't know what to expect
From your affection
It's here today and gone tomorrow

Are you sure love, love, love is the name of this game
I wanna know
Are you sure L-O-V-E love is the name of this game
