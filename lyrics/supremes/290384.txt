Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me


Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now I don't mean to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a guy who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix

So, Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me

Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, Cupid, if your arrow makes his love strong for me
I promise I will love him until eternity
I know between the two of us his heart we can steal
Help me if you will

So, Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me

Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, Cupid, don't you hear me calling
Cupid
