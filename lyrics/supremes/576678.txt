I will build you a castle with a tower so high
Till it reaches the moon
I'll gather melodies from birdies that fly
And compose you a tune
Give you lovin' as warm as Mama's oven
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new
I'll try something new


I will take you away with me as far as I can
To Venus or Mars
There we will love with your hand in my hand
You'll be king of the stars
Every day we can play on the Milky Way
And if that don't do
I'll have to try something new
I'll try something new

I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea
To wear in your hair
(Thank you)
I'll do anything and every little thing to make you happy, boy
To show you that I care
I'll pretend I'm jealous of all the fellas
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new
I'll try something new
