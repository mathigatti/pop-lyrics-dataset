You keep saying
You got something for me
something' you call love
But confess


You've been messin'
Where you shouldn't have been messin'
And now someone else
Is getting all your best

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

You keep lying'
When you oughta be truthing
You keep losing
When you oughta not bet

You keep 'same-in'
When you oughta be changing
Now, what's right is right
But you ain't been right yet

My boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

You keep playing
When you shouldn't be playing
you keep thinking
You'll never get burned
I just found me
A brand new box of matches
And what he knows now
You ain't got time to learn

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

Are you ready boots?
Try to walk
