Have you heard on the news
Another let off madman
Another screw on the loose
Is it the judge or the badman


What's the matter these days
No one has the courage to put them away
Nobody has any faith
'Cause there's a breakdown of justice and order

Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace

When I remember back the memories of yesteryear
With all the friends and all the times
When people were carefree
And walking down the street
When everyone knew everyone
And all the houses doors were open
No had to care, those days are gone
Those days are gone

I long for the times when you could
Wander down the street unharmed
When people didn't have much money
But didn't seem to care
It must be the cynic in me
But I don't really like things now
The violence, the attitudes
Aggression that you see everyday
A sick society looks the other way
