at a point below zero
there's no place left to go
six hundred unknown heroes
killed like sleeping buffalo


Through the devil's canyon
across the battlefield
Death has no companion
the spirit's lost

There goes the bandolero
through the hole in the wire
he's a coward but he doesn't care
doesn't care if he lives or if he dies

the general commanding
defending what we feel
the troops they are depending
on reinforcements from the rear

(1:52 - solo: Adrian Smith)

If God is in this heaven
how come there's no heaven here?
In God's name they use weapons
for the massacre

at a point below zero
the sun can see the land
six hundred unknown heroes
lay dead beneath the sand
