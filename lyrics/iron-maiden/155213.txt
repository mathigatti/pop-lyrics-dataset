I've been trying, trying so hard
I've been crying, crying in the dark
don't forsake me, the time of mine is near
Don't ever break me and the world that brought me here


sick and lonely, waiting for the dawn
sick and lonely, wondering what to do
can you hear me, when I say to you
You gime your hand, I'll give mine to you

When the king of twilight shows me 
I will take ten steps to see 
Forty leaves I pay for freedom 

For a chance to be free
For a chance to be free

When the king of twilight calls you 
Take a step and you will see
We all need a quick solution

For a chance to be free
For a chance to be free
 
When the king of twilight shows me 
I will take ten steps to see 
Forty leaves I pay for freedom

For a chance to be free
For a chance to be...FREE!
