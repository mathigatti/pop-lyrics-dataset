Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me.


Oh...I've never felt so strange
But...I'm not going insane.

I've no doubt that you think I'm off my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do.

Oh...they drain my strength away
Oh...they're asking me to stay.

Nightmares...spirits calling me
Nightmares...they won't leave me be.

All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool.

Now...I feel they are so near
I...begin to see them clear

Nightmares...coming all the time
Nightmares...Will give me peace of mind.

Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too.

Oh...we'll drown together
It...will be forever.

Nightmares...forever calling me
Nightmares...Now we rest in peace.
