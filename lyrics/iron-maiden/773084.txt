It's the same in every country
When you say you're leaving
Left behind the loved ones
Waiting silent in the hall
Where you're going lies adventure
Others only dream of
Red and green light this is real
And so you go to war


For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
what's the difference, all the same

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our father before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war

There is no one that will save you
Going down in flames
No surrender certain death you
You look in the eye
On the shores of tyranny you
Crashed a human wave
Paying for my freedom with your
lonely unmarked graves

For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
what's the difference, all the same

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our father before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war
