Giving a swish with your arse in the air, don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find, don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air, don't you hear all the laughter?


Charlotte the Harlot show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot let me see love

Taking so many men to your room, don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a fiver, It's only for starters
And ten for the main course
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law with the service you're giving.

Charlotte the Harlot show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot let me see love

There was a time when you left me standing there
Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well Charlotte you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well Charlotte you told me you love me true
Picking up pieces of love yesterday
Well Charlotte you're draws are off color too
'Cause you're making love all day
'Cause you make it!
(oh, 'cause you make it!)

Giving a swish with your arse in the air, don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find, don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air, don't you hear all the laughter?

Charlotte the Harlot show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot let me see love
