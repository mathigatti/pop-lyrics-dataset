Let me tell you about my life
Let me tell you about my dreams
Let me tell you about the things that happened
Always real to me


Let me tell you of my hope
Of my need to reach the sky
Let me take you on an awkward journey
Let me tell you why
Let me tell you why

Why should these curses be laid upon me
I won't be forgiven 'til I can break free
What did I do to deserve all this guilt?
Pay for my sins for the sale of my soul
Demons are trapped all inside of my head
My hopes are gone reach for Heaven from Hell

My sins are many
My guilt is too heavy
The pressure of knowing of hiding what I know
I'm able to see things
Things I don't want to see
The lives of a thousand souls
Weigh Heaven down on me

I know they're crying for help reaching out
The burden of them will take me down as well
The sin of a thousand souls not died in vain
Reincarnate still in me live again

Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation, to exorcise this Hell

Someone to save me
Something to save me from my Hell
A destination, away from this nightmare

Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation, to exorcise this Hell
