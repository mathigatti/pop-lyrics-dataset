Now I'm here can you see me
'Cos I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold tell me
You can feel me
'Cos I'm here


Here I am, can you see me
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to only in my
Dreams before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'Cos you can count your
Real true friends on one hand

Through life

There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would
Die for you
Thought not

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
So they say

In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one
Right now

In a room full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall
Do you sometimes feel like you're
On the outside
Looking in?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power
If you want to
It's true

You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
It does

Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what
Happens when we die
Wouldn't it?

There are some who are wise
There are some who are born naive
I believe that there are some that must
Have lived before
Don't you?

As for me, well I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not an
Open and shut case

Extrasensory perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on and travel through
Space and time?

You know I feel so elated
'Cos I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
To fill you in

You don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around
It's me
And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your friends
Might say
We'll meet up again someplace
Some way
One day
