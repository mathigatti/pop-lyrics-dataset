I'm an educated fool
So I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do
About this awkward situation
That's been forced down right upon me


As I'm walking down into
On my own into the valley of life
Got a lifetime of experience
Yeah I've got so much to give

Open the page at chapter one
Could this just be
That life's just begun
Forever within
Your darker thoughts
Reflecting on everything you've been taught

Never felt this way before
Seems that somebody's' just opened the door
To the book of life or is it death
Is there ever anyway out

Someone's looking down on me
To the very inner core of my soul
They won't tell me what they see
But I really want to know

I want to leave my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires
I want to go and see the fire burn
I want to see and feel my world turn
I want to know what more there's to learn
I want to pass the point of no return

Do you really wanna be
Just another one statistic or feel
That you really should aspire
That you really do deserve more

Do you ever really feel
That you have so much potential inside
What you really have to give
Could be realised so much more

I want to leave my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires
I want to go and see the fire burn
I want to see and feel my world turn
I want to know what more there's to learn
I want to pass the point of no return

Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow

I want to feel what life's like respond
I want to meet my father beyond
I want to walk right into the light
I want to feel no fear but delight

Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow
