Lights out!
We live in a world of darkness
No doubt!
Everything's up for sale
We sleep!
All of the world is burning
We pray!
To God for a better deal
Nothing is sacred
Back then or now
Everything's wasted
Is that all there is? Can I go now?


Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

Fight wars!
Die in a blaze of glory
Come home!
Meat in a plastic sack
Fall down!
Better pray to your God for mercy
So kneel!
And help the blade cut clean
Nothing is sacred
Back then or now
Everyone wasted
Is that all there is? Is that it now?

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

I live in the black I have no guiding light
I'm whispering in your dreams...

Judas my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas my guide

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide
