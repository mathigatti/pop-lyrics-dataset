I can't see my feelings
Open my eyes
I can't see my feelings
Open a pair of eyes


I can't see my feelings
Keep them behind
I just keep on reeling
Running back down the line

Oh, I can't stand that screaming
Don't even try
Music fans some feelings
It'll be tell me why

I can't stop that feeling
Showing me why
Man I love that feeling
Yeah, blowin' me right through the sky

Oh hey hey hey hey hey hey
Oh, listen to what she says
If it's good, it's nice
