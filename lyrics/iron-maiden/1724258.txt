Sitting waiting in the falling rain
Getting ready to begin again


Wounded lying crying
Bodies moving dying
All around there is the smell
Of death and fire

Here the planes are coming
Hear the soldiers running
Killing on a scale to comprehend

Why are we here
In this place...here to kill
Please God forgive us
For what we have done

I always thought I was doing right
As of now I'm not feeling so sure

I'm at a place of where
I give no grace
I'm a soldier of war

I sit waiting for my darkest hour to come
I cannot think about the things that I have done
It shouldn't take a fool to see that I believe
Accept the consequence, repent for what I've done

You tell me what is certain
But I'll tell you what is true
You tell me what is honesty
When all around is death and cruelty

The making of a man is fire
Not giving into our desires
Within the truth that lies
Within the only thing

Mother of mercy
Angel of death desire
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy
Angel of pain
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath

Some say you are a lost cause
Some say you're a saint
Just being here's an act
Of suffering and restraint

Walk down the long dark road
To ruin and panic not
I'll die a lonely death
Of that I'm certain of

Rivers flow with blood
There's nowhere left to hide
It's hard to comprehend
There's anyone left alive

Sick of all the killing
And the reek of death
Will God tell me
What religion is to man

I don't hold with bad religion
Understand what's underneath it
Now I come to think of it
I just don't hold at all you know it

You say you are a holy man
But what is it you do
From where I stand is nothing
But a hollow man I see

Mother of mercy
Angel of death desire
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy
Angel of pain
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath

Mother of mercy
Angel of death desire
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath, of fire
Mother of mercy
Angel of pain
Mother of mercy
Drawing my last breath

I'm just a lonely soldier fighting
In a bloody hopeless war
Don't know what I'm fighting
Who it is or what I'm fighting for

Thought it was for money
Make my fortune, now I'm not so sure
Seem to just have lost my way
