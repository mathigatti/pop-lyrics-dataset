There's a madman in the corner of your eye
He likes to pry - into your sunlight
He wants to burst into the street with you and I
A world of shadows and of rain
He's seen what love is
He wants to pay you back with guilt...


He lies to you - he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still
till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
He´s got your chains of misery

There's a prophet in the gutter in the street
He says "you're damned!" -
And you believe him...
He's got a vision but it shines out through your
eyes
A world of hatred and fear...
He felt what love means
He wants to pay you back with pain

He lies to you - he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still
till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
He´s got your chains of misery
(repeat)

It's only lovethat holds the key to our hearts....
It's only love...

He lies to you - he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still
till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
He´s got your chains of misery

He lies to you - he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still
till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
He´s got your chains of misery
