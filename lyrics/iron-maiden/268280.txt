There are no marks upon a man
That can say he's good or bad
No label and no tell tale sign
That can show he's full of lies


By your deeds, you will be known
Time will tell, truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all got closer to our death

What will you say
What will you say
On judgement day
On judgement day

When you look into their eyes
You don't know what they hide
No label and no tell tale sign
That can show he's full of lies

Ignorance is bliss, is that the reason
We can not read another's mind
If we knew what thoughts were dancing
Through each others heads
Would we all be driven mad
Would we all be dead
