Now the contracts out
They've put the word about
I'm coming after you


It's not the money I make
It's the thrill of the chase
And I'm coming after you

I watch your every move
Study the things you do
And the pattern of your ways

I watch the way you walk
I hear your telephone talk
I want to understand the way you think

Chorus
Better watch out,cos I'm the assassin (Better watch out)
cos I'm the assassin
Better watch out,better watch out

Better watch out,cos I'm the assassin (Better watch out)
cos I'm the assassin
Better watch out,better watch out

ASSASSIN!!!ASSASSIN!!!ASSASSIN!!!ASSASSIN!!!
(hahahaha)

SOLO

I'm in a cold cold sweat
I taste the smell of death
I know the moment's getting closer

And as you walk to the light
I feel my hands go tight
Excitement running through my veins

I've got you in my sights
I've got you dead to rights
The triggers waiting for my finger

I feel adrenalin rush
It's just the final touch
You can kiss your arse goodbye

Better watch out,cos I'm the assassin (Better watch out)
cos I'm the assassin
Better watch out,better watch out

Better watch out,cos I'm the assassin (Better watch out)
cos I'm the assassin
Better watch out,better watch out

ASSASSIN!!!
