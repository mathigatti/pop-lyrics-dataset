Listen to me, Lamia
Listen to what I've got to say
I've got these feelings
And they won't go away
I've got these fears inside
That'll bring me to my knees
Oh, help me Lamia
Or I'm not sure
I'll die, oh, please
I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong
I've messed around with mystic things
And magic for far too long
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me
The devil's got a hold on my soul
And he just won't let me be
I'm on my knees, oh, help me, please
Oh, Lamia, please, try to help me
The devil's got a hold on my soul
And he won't let me be
Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold on my soul
And it's driving me mad.
