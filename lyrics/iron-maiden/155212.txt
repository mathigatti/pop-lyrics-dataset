If you're looking for something that you can keep
Well, baby, pass me by
And if you wanted something that's twenty years deep
Baby, don't even try


And if you wanted someone to take your soul
Maybe I'll lift you up little bit higher
I've got the fire
I've got the fire

So you think I'm skinny, don't you sell me cheap
Cause I'm as wide as a country-mile
Some like it wide, I like it deep
Guess which one is my style
You think you can beat me by my own game
Maybe I call you a liar

I've got the fire
I've got the fire
