When you start to take a look within
Do you feel at ease with what you see
Do you think you can have peace of mind
And have self belief or be satisfied


Do you think you even like yourself
Or really think you could be someone else
Is there something that you'd rather be
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see

All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away

Feel the paranoia creeping in
Like a cancer eating at the skin
Do you feel you've lost your self-esteem
And your self respect, what can you expect

All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away

All my life... I've run away
Let my faith... slip away
All my life... I've run away
Allowed my faith... to drift away

Are you scared to look inside your mind
Are you worried just at what you'll find
Do you really want to face the truth
Does it matter now, what have you got to lose

Try to release the anger from within
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins
Do you really care what people think
Are you strong enough to release the guilt

All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away

All my life... I've run away
Let my faith... slip away
All my life... I've run away
Allowed my faith... to drift away
