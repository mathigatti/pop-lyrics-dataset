Sometimes, when I feel the anger
Sometimes, when I'm all alone
Sometimes, when I feel surrounded
Like all the doors are closed
I feel like I've been a prisoner
I feel like I've been a tool
Let people try to judge me
When they're not in my shoes


I've lived on my knees
Trying to please
It's time to change

Some people are only happy
When they can watch you fail
And to them every day is
Another coffin nail
I think that I've found the answer
I think that at last I know
We've only got one lifetime
I'll make my life my own

To live my own way
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
