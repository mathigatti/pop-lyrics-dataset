As the Sun breaks, above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still


His eyes are ablazed
See the madman in his gaze

Fly, on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the Sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly touch the Sun

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave

Fly, on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the Sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly touch the Sun
