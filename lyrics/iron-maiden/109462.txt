Remember that song called kill me, from Victim's last LP
Too much of a risk for a golden disc, the price he paid for money
Ce soir, ce soir, assassination d'un rock'n'roll star
Ce soir, ce soir, assassination d'un rock'n'roll star


Sing your song, you can't go wrong, tempted his business advisor
No need for alarm, you'll come to no harm, he didn't mention the sniper
Ce soir, ce soir, assassination d'un rock'n'roll star
Ce soir, ce soir, assassination d'un rock'n'roll star

The news is read, the need is fed, one yawn, two yawn, and back to bed
Turn off the light, and hold me tight, c'mon, maman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song, fini, belle vie, bonne nuit
Remember that song called kill me, a lecture on political chicanery
Of peoples rape, recorded on tape, brought shame to the presidency

Tonight, tonight, one more point for human rights
Tonight, tonight, one more point for human rights
Remember that song kill me, once used by a man from Gallilee
He had nothing to lose, he was King of the Jews, secured his place in History

Ce soir, ce soir, assassination d'un provocateur
Ce soir, ce soir, assassination d'un provocateur
The news is read, the poison's spread, one yawn, two yawn, and back to bed
Turn off the light, and hold me tight, c'mon, maman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song, fini, belle vie
Turn off the light and hold me tight, come on

Vick played his part with all his heart, he wasn't prepared for the shock
When hollow lead bit into his head, a new martyr for the book of rock
When hollow lead bit into his head, a new martyr for the book of rock

Ce soir, assassination d'un rock'n'roll star
Ce soir, ce soir, assassination d'un rock'n'roll star
Ce soir, assassination d'un rock'n'roll provocateur
Ce soir, ce soir, ce soir, assassination d'un rock'n'roll star
