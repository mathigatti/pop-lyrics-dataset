Yeah! Another prophet of disaster
Who says the ship is lost
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost
Taunting us with visions
Afflicting us with fear
Predicting war for millions
In the hope that one appears


No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
'cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die
'cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, just stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die

In 13, the Beast is rising
The Frenchman did surmise
Through earthquakes and starvation
The warlord will arise
Terror, Death, Destruction
Pour from the Eastern Sands
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands

No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
'cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die
'cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, just stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die

They died with their boots on, yes, they diiieeeed...
The day they die with their boots on, we dieeeeeeeeeee
WE DIE!
WE DIE!
WE DIE!
WE DIE!
WE DIE!

No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
'cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die
'cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, just stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
