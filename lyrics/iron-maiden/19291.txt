Into the Abyss I'll fall-the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night-watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows-
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again


Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid to waste
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death

When I was living this lie-Fear was my game
People would worship and fall-
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and red wine
For the one to succeed me
For he is a man and a God-
And He will die too

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid to waste
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death

Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned-
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man God preserved-
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my Hell-
I will strike from the grave

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death
