Tough of the track
With the wind
And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more till the sound
Is ringing in your head
With every step you tread
And every breath you take
Determination makes
You run
Never stop
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop
Keep the pace
Hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there but the miles
Just never seem to end
As if you're in a dream
Not getting anywhere
It seems so futile


Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on

Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer but do
You want the glory that goes
You reach the final stretch
Ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner
