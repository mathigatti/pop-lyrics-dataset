Who would be a poor man, a beggar man?
A thief if he had a rich man in his hand?
Who would steal the candy?
From a laughing baby's mouth
If he could take it from the money man?


Cross-eyed Mary, goes jumping in again
She signs no contract but she always plays the game
She dines in Hampstead Village
On expense accounted gruel
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school

Laughing in the playground
Gets no kicks from little boys
Would rather make it with a latching gray
Or maybe her attention is drawn by
Aqualung, who watches
Through the railings as they play

Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along
She's a poor man's rich girl
And she'll do it for a song
She's a rich man's stealer
But her favor's good and strong
She's the Robin Hood of High Gate
Helps the poor man get along

Laughing in the playground
Gets no kicks from little boys
Would rather make it with a latching gray
Or maybe her attention is drawn by
Aqualung, who watches
Through the railings as they play

Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again
She signs no contract but she always plays the game
She dines in Hampstead Village
On expense accounted gruel
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school

Cross-eyed Mary
Eyed Mary
Cross-eyed Mary
