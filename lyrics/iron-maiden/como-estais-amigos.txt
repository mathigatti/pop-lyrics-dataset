Como esta amigo
For the death of those we don't know
Shall we kneel and say a prayer
They will never know we care
Shall we keep the fires burning
Shall we keep the flames alight
Should we try to remember
What is wrong and what is right


No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears

(Ohooo, ohooo)

If we do forget them and
The sacrifice they made
Will the wickedness and
Sadness come to visit us again

Shall we dance the dance in sunlight
Shall we drink the wine of peace
Shall our tears be of joy
Shall we keep at bay the beast

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears

(Ohooo, ohooo, ohooo)

Inside the scream is silent
Inside it must remain
No victory, no vanquished
Only horror, only pain

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears

(Ohooo, ohooo, ohooo, ohooo)
