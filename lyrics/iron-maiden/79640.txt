When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?


When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?

'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel Deja vu

Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before

Ever had a conversation
That you realise you've had before
Isn't it strange?

Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next?
It feels pre-arranged

'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel Deja vu

Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
