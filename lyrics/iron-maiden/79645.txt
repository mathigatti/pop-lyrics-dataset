The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time it waits for no man


My future, it is revealed
Time it waits for no man
My fate is sealed
If I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets, I mock your morality plays

The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an end game
One more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?

Do the undead live within us?
And look through our eyes?
Walking on water
Are miracles all you can trust?

Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?
So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So, until the next time
Have a good sin

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven bloody paths to hell
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloody hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven are your desires
