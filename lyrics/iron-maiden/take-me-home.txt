Welcome back home
It's been so long, we've missed you
Been searching for honor and glory
Out in the dark I have fought for survival
As thunder and gunfire were roaring


Back home, the time and the place of
My own my future is calling I know
I do believe there is no other place I can go

I must return from my deadly sleep
The only chance I've been given - my destiny
Take me home, take me home

Black as a hole is the soil I was walking
As black as the troops were before me
Relentless attack as my eyes started bleeding
Get razed to the ground by the soaring

It's time, you better be leading me home
Our future is calling I know
I am the answer to all the remaining unknown

I must return from my deadly sleep
The only choice I've been given, - my destiny
Take me home

Roaring, embracing the thunder
Twisting and turning around
Locked in I will not go under
Save me before I will drown

I must return
Take me home - take me home
Take me home - take me home
Take me home - take me home
Let me go - let me go
Back to my home, back to the people I know
Out in the cold but where can I go I don't know
Where can I go I don't know
Come and take me home
