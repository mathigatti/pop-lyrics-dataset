As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're st. George or you're david and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly
And you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet


You'll die as you lived
In the flash of a blade
In a corner forgotten by no-one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honour

The smell of resined leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the
Fencing master's call
He taught you all he never knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil men

You'll die as you lived
In the flash of a blade
In a corner forgotten by no-one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honour

You'll die as you lived
In the flash of a blade
In a corner forgotten by no-one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honour
