Thinking of an age old dream,
Places I have never seen.
Fantasies lived times before,
I split my brain, melt through the floor.


Over clouds my mind will fly,
Forever now I can't think why,
My body tries to leave my soul,
Is it me? I just don't know.

Memories rising from the past,
The future shadows overcast.
Something's clutching at my head,
Through the darkness I'll be led.

Oh another time, another place,
Oh well another smile on another face.
When you see me floating up beside you,
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you.

CHORUS

Please take me away,
Take me away,
So far away.

Repeat.
