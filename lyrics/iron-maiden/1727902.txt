Take my eyes the things I've seen
In this world coming to an end
My reflection fades, I'm weary
Of these earthly bones and skin


You may pass through me and
Leave no trace I have
No mortal face
Solar winds are whispering
You may hear me call

We can shed our skins and swim
Into the darkened void beyond
We will dance among the world
That orbit stars that aren't our sun

All the oxygen that trapped us in
A carbon spider's web
Solar winds are whispering you
May hear the sirens of the dead
Let the elders to their parley
Meant to satisfy our lust
Leaving damacles still hanging
Over all their promised trust

Walk away from freedoms offered
By the jailors in their cage
Step into the light startripping
Over mortals in their rage

Starblind with sun the
Stars are one
We are the light that brings
The end of night
Starblind with sun the
Stars are one
We are with the goddess
Of the sun tonight

The preacher loses face
With christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hollow bones
Make pacts of love but die alone
The crucible of pain will forge the
Blanks of sin begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose

Virgins in the teeth of god are
Meat and drink to feed the damned
You may pass through me and I
Will feel the life that you live less
Step into my light startripping
We will rage against the night

Walk away from comfort offered
By your citizens of death

Starblind with sun the
The stars are one
We are the light that brings
The end of night
Starblind with sun the
Stars are one
We're one with the goddess
Of the sun tonight

Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose whatever
Life to live or life to lose

Whatever god you know
He knows you better than you
Believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived

Look into our face reflected in the
Moonglow in your eyes
Remember you can choose
To look but not to see and
Waste your hours

You believe you have the time
But I tell you your time is short
See your past and future all the
Same and it cannot be bought

Starblind with sun the
Stars are one
We are the light that brings
The end of night
Starblind with sun the
Stars are one
We're one with the goddess
Of the sun tonight

Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose whatever
Life to live or life to lose
Whatever god you know
He knows you better than you
Believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived

The preacher loses face
With christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hollow bones
Make pacts of love but die alone
The crucible of pain will forge the
Blanks of sin begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose
