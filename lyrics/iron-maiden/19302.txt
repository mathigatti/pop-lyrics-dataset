When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any cost
At what price a life is lost?


At what point do we begin
Fighter spirit a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to
Choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame
On society, these things
But what kind of good or bad
A new generation brings?

Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what, will never change

I will hope
My soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die
My soul will fly
I will live forever

Just a few small tears between
Someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between
Being a genius or insane

At what age begin to learn
Of which way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road
And the trail is there to burn

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to
Choose the path that he takes

I will hope
My soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die
My soul will fly
And I will live forever

I will hope
My soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die
My soul will fly
And I will live forever

The thin line between love and hate

The thin line between love and hate
