Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me the sense to wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength, to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key, to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place


Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked and he laughed at me!
Can I play with madness?
He said: You're blind, too blind to see!

I screamed aloud to the old man
I said: Don't lie, don't say you don't know!
I say: You'll pay for your mischief in this world, or the next!
Oh, then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hellfires raged in his eyes
He said: Do you want to know the truth son?
I'll tell you the truth! Your soul's gonna burn, in a lake of fire!
