The words she said turned out why
desperation fills her eyes
Hold her in your arms don't let go


When you taste defeat,
when you loose again
Fight and win, never give in
Hold her in your arms don't let go

That girl you need
Gonna knock you off your feet
That girl, you know
She'll never let you go

That girl, That girl, That girl you need

Can you hear her call, call out your name
Think about you, cry without you
Hold her in your arms, don't let go

Can you taste defeat,
when you loose again
Fight and win, never give in
Hold her in your arms don't let go

That girl, That girl, That girl you need

You need!
