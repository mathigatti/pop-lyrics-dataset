Oh God of Earth and Altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
But take away our pride


Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The Secret of the Hangman, the smile on his lips
The light of the Blind, you'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are opening, you'll see

She came to me with a serpents kiss
As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched and I waited for the Dawn

The light of the Blind you'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are opening, you'll see

Bind us all together
Ablaze with Hope and Free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat, you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain
For the one who will be King
Is the watcher in the Ring
It is You
