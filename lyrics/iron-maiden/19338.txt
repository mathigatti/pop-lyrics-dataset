Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making you money from slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers.


You got to watch them, be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven, the thief in your head
You've got to watch them, be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven, the thief in your head

Be quick or be dead, be quick or be dead

See... What's ruling all our lives
See... Who's pulling the strings
See... What's ruling all our lives
See... Who's pulling the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place

The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says you must vote for what you want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright
So pull yourself stupid and rob yourself blind

You got to watch them, be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven, the thief in your head
You've got to watch them, be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven, the thief in your head

Be quick or be dead, be quick or be dead

You got to watch them, be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven, the thief in your head
You've got to watch them, be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven, the thief in your head

Be quick or be dead, be quick
