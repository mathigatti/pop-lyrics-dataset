I see the enemy, I know he can’t see me
Combat red in tooth and claw
Ready now for one more score
Took a bullet in my brain
Inside, I’m the king of pain
Outside, you will fear my name
I ride a blood red triplane


Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong

Death or glory, it’s all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I’m in the game of
Death or glory, a one way train

I watch you spiral down
Dead before you hit the ground
Bullet got you in the back
Deflection shooting beam attack
I shoot the gunner first
I kill to quench my thirst
I hunt the weakest prey
Live to fly another day

Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong

Death or glory, it’s all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I’m in the game of
Death or glory, a one way train

Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong

Death or glory, it’s all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I’m in the game of
Death or glory, a one way train

Death or glory, it’s all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I’m in the game of
Death or glory, a one way train
