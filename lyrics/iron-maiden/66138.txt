My life is so empty
Nothing to live for
My mind is all confusion
'Cos I defied the law


When you weren't there to help me
I lost my mind and ran
I never had no trouble
Before this all began

My life is so empty
Nothing to live for
My mind is all confusion
'Cos I defied the law

When you weren't there to help me
I lost my mind and ran
I never had no trouble
Before this all began

I'm running away
Nowhere to go
I'm lost and tired
And I just don't know

They say I killed a woman
They know it isn't true
They're just trying to frame me
And all because of you

Lord, I'm running
