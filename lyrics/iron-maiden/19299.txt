Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat
From my brow
But it's not the fear 'cos
I'd rather go now


Trying to visualize the horrors that
Will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground

When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die

God let us go now and finish what's
To be done
Thy kingdom come
Thy shall be done on earth

Trying to justify to ourselves the
Reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgive

But how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down there's
No other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
