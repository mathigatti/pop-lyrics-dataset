The convoy lights are dead ahead
The merchantmen lay in their bed
The thump of diesels hammers down
In the oily sea-the killing ground
His knuckles white his eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chickens lair
A hound of hell and the devil don't care


chorus:
Running silent,running deep,we are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep,a merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting, for all of you below
Running silent,running deep,sink into your silent sleep

Chill the hearts of fighting men
In open ocean wondering when?
The lethal silver fish will fly
The boat will shiver-men will die
A cast of millions-a part to play
Killer? victim? or fool for a day
Obeying an order-men have to die
Us or them - a well rehearsed lie

chorus

The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn
The tar black smell of burning oil
On the way down to Davy Jones
Every man for himself - you're on your own
The wolf eyes watch the crosswire
'Stern tubes ready','aim and fire'
They can pin some medal on your chest
But in two more weeks - dead like the rest

chorus
