When I was wandering in the desert and was searching for the truth
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
I turned my face towards the barren sun


And I know, of the pain, that you feel the same as me
And I dream, of the rain, as it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks, in our lives, like a cracks upon the ground
They are sealed, and are now, washed away

You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears

And I know, of the pain, that you feel the same as me
And I dream, of the rain, as it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks, in the ground, like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed, and are now, far away

You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears

You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears

And I know, of the pain, that you feel the same as me
And I dream, of the rain, as it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks, in the ground, like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed, and are now, far away
