Sometimes it makes me wonder
Sometimes it makes me question
Sometimes it makes me saddened
Always it makes me angry but...


When you can see it happening
The madness that's all around you
Nobody seems to worry
The world seems to powerless to act...

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day a new toll

Another assassination
The same day a new creation
But what are they coming into
Security of a world that brings...

One day another killing
Somewhere there's someone starying
Another a savage raping
Meanwhile there's someone laughing at us

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day it goes on

Brutality and aggression
Tomorrow another lesson
Expecting another air raid
Praying for a geaserfire

They say things are getting better
No need to be complacent
There's chaos across the border
And one day it could be happening to us

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
It's our epitaph
It's out of control
Someone should know
Blood on the world's hands
