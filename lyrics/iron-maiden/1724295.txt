I can hear them floating on the wind
Immortal souls their weeping saddens me
Mother earth you know your time is near
Awaken lust the seed is sown and reaped


Through the western isle I hear the dead awaken
Rising slowly to the court of Avalon
The cauldron of the head of Annwyn laced with envy
Dark around its edge with pearl and destiny

All my days I've waited for the sign
The one that brings me closer to isle of Avalon
I can feel the power flowing through my veins
My heart is beating louder, close to Avalon

I can hear you, can you hear me?
I can feel you, can't you feel me?
Fertility Mother Goddess
Celebration, sow the seeds of the born
The fruit of her body laden
Through the corn doll
You will pray for them all

The image of Mother Goddess
Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
The sheaf of the corn is broken
End the harvest
Throw the dead of the pyre

I hear her crying the tears of an angel
The voices I hear in my head
Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth
Mother earth holy blood of the dead

[guitar solo]

Mother earth I can hear you
Sacrifice, now united

Rising levels of the tidal lakes protect them
Keepers of the goddess in the underworld
Holding powers of the mystics, deep inside them
nineteen maidens, guardians of the otherworld
Mortal conflict born of Celtic legend
That apart from seven, non-returned from Avalon

Mother earth I can feel you
My rebirth now completed

Fertility mother goddess
Celebration, sow the seeds of the born
The fruits of her body laden
Through the corn doll
You will pray for them all
The image of mother goddess
Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
The sheaf of the corn is broken
End the harvest, throw the dead on the pyre

To have the belief of others
Looking for the Isle to
Show them a sign
Fertility of all mothers
Stood in silence
Waiting now for their turn

The gateway to Avalon
The island where the souls
Of dead are reborn
Brought here to die and be
Transferred into the earth
And then for rebirth

I hear her crying the tears of an Angel
The voices I hear in my head
Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth
Mother earth holy blood of the dead

The water in rivers and rhymes rises quickly
Are flowing and flooding the land
The sea shall return once again just to hide them
Lost souls on the Isle of the dead
