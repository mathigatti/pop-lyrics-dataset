Roll of the dice
Take a spin of the wheel
Out of your hands now
So how do you feel
But you're not gonna win
You'd better go back again


Do you feel lucky
Or do you feel scared
Take what luck brings
And be Devil may care
But you're down on your luck
And what will the next day bring

Adrift on the ocean
Afloat in a daydream
Or lost in the maze
Or blind in the haze

So what does it matter
So why don't you answer
So why did you send
An angel to mend

Best make decisions
Before it's too late
Take all your chances
Take hold of the reins
A roll of the dice
Ahead of the game again

Nothing to lose
But so much to gain
A little danger
It goes without saying
But what do you care
You're gonna go in the end

Gate open to Heaven
Is ready and waiting
Or straight down to hell
Can go there as well

I'll suffer my craving
My soul's not worth saving
So why don't you go
Just leave whell alone


Don't you think I'm a saviour
Don't you think I could save you (14X)
Don't you think I could save your life

There's like a hunger
That knocks on your door
You've had a taste of it
Still you want more
You've made your mistakes
Won't play it the same again

You have been warned
But still you plunge in
You play high stakes
But there's nothing to win
You`ve only one life
And so many things to learn

The Angel on one side
The Devil the other
Which path do you take
Decisions to make

Arrive at the crossroads
You know where you're going
And what if you wait
it maybe too late

Don't you think I'm a saviour
Don't you think I could save you (9x)
Don't you think I could save your life
