My eyes have seen the future
And now I'm waiting on the day
For you to come over the mountain
To spread your amazing grace.


People live in an hourglass
It cracks, shatters, and breaks.
Swept in from mankind
Is she blind, or ???

Superman where are you?
Are you coming to save the day?
Superman where are you?
Look in the sky.
Is it a bird?
Is it a plane?

Tied to the rails that bind you
Want a one way ticket to pain
Only time will tell us
Are you real or just in our brains?

Jump on this ???
The fat lady's about to sing.
When will you come help us?
?????????

Superman where are you?
Are you coming to save the day?
Superman where are you?
Look in the sky.
Is it a bird?
Is it a plane?

Superman where are you?
Are you coming to save the day?
Superman where are you?
Look in the sky.
Is it a bird?
Is it a plane?

Superman where are you?
Are you coming to save the day?
Superman where are you?
Are you coming to save the day?
Superman where are you?
Are you coming to save the day?
Superman where are you?
Look in the sky.
Is it a bird?
Is it a plane?

Superman where are you?
Superman where are you?.
