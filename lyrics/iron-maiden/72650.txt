There's a darkened sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a last horizon
But no regrets from me


Maybe I'll be back some other day
To live again just who can say
In what shape or form that I might be
Just another chance for me

A hurried time no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all my life away
No-one can stop me now

Time is up it couldnt last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Someday maybe I'll wait till then

No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies

They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just dont know it yet

So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dream
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you

The clock is fast the hour is near
Eventful past is everclear
My life is set the time is here
I think I'm coming home

No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies

A hurried time no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusions
And wishing all your life away
No-one can stop me now

Time is up it couldnt last
But there's more things I have to do
I'm coming back to try again
Don't tell me back this is the end

No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
