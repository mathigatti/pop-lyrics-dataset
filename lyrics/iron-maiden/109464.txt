I was born by the river, just like this river, I've been moving ever since
Ain't got nobody to call my own, you know I've been moving since the day I was born
Life is a game just made for fun, you know I don't love nobody, I don't love no one


Yes, I'm a mover, baby

Following the footsteps; one fine day
When I asked the wise man which was the way
He said: "Follow your heart and look for yourself
And come back and tell me what you have learned"

Yes, I'm a mover, baby

Went back and told him, I found me a wife
Eleven children and a real good life
Told him of love and there's a happy home
But I need to return to that long winding road

Yes, I'm a mover, baby

I've got to move on down

Move on!
