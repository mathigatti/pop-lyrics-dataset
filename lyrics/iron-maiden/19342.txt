Maybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up 'till now I'm doing the best I can
Long roads, long days, of sunrise to sunset
Sunrise to sunset


Dream on, brothers, while you can
Dream on, sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives covered up quickly
By the tides of time

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights

Dream on, brothers, while you can
Dream on, sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives covered up quickly
By the tides of time

Sands are flowing and the lines
Are in your hand
In your eyes, I see the hunger
And the desperate cry that tears the night

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
