In the heat of the morning 
When your day is still dawning 
And your bird, she's singing 
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away 


Packed your bags in a hurry 
Because your mind's in a worry 
Mark my words 
You're gonna be sorry if you ever fly away 

Sweet little girl with the saint da vinci-smile 
Stares at me with sadness in her eyes 
I'm not sure if she's really real or make-believe 
Maybe she's a vision that comes to only me 

Cause I'm so tired 
Yes I'm so tired 
So tired 
Yes I'm so tired
