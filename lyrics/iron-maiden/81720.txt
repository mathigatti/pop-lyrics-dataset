I got the keys to view at number 22 
Behind my green door there's nothing to see 
Is that a creature? What kind of creature 
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me 
Stone cold sober, sitting in silence, laid back looking for symphaty 
I like a girl who knows where she's bound 
I don't like girls who've been hanging around 


Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling 
For that well hung feeling 
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I 
Got the hooks screwed in 

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling 
For that well hung feeling 
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I 
Got the hooks screwed in 

She's tied up she can't come to the phone 
You must have got your wires crossed she ain't home 
Knock on wood - you know I like that sound 
She never could keep her feet on the ground 

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling 
For that well hung feeling 
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I 
Got the hooks screwed in 

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling 
For that well hung feeling 
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I 
Got the hooks screwed in 

Hooks in you, I've got those hooks in you 
Hooks in you, in you 
Hooks in you, I've got those hooks in you 
Hooks in you, in you 

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yow! 

Right on the money got it wrapped up tight 
Got new ideas for the decor tonight 
Make this house a preservation zone 
Gonna set her in concrete set her up on her own 

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling 
For that well hung feeling 
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I 
Got the hooks screwed in 

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling 
For that well hung feeling 
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I 
Got the hooks screwed in 

Hooks in you, I've got those hooks in you 
Hooks in you 
Hooks in you, I've got those hooks in you 
Hooks in you, I've got those 
Hooks in you
