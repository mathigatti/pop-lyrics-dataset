"We shall go on to the end
We shall fight in France
We shall fightover the seas and oceans.
we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be
we shall fight on beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds
we shall fight in the fields and in the streets
we shall fight on the hills.
We shall never surrender."


There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks, there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late

Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Going in again
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving

Run
Live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you
Run, live to fly, fly to live
Aces high

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again

Bandits at 8 o'clock are moving behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning, our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving
Going in again
Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving

Run
Live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you
Run, live to fly, fly to live
Aces high
