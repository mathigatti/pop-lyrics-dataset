I feel the breeze on my face in expectance
Not very long before the storm reaches here
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again
Feel something strong as the power draws near


Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you
Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear
But all I know as
I sit in the corner alone
It takes me back to my childhood again

And as I wait and I look for an answer
To all the things going round in my head
I ask myself could it be a disaster and when
It's maybe threatening to happen again

As the ominous light draws near
There's a lone dog howls in the park
All the people hurry inside
As a lightning flash lights dark
The storm is nearly here
Only God will know

You're sitting alone you watch
As the wind is blowing treetops
And the swaying rustling of leaves
Plenty of time to perceive
As you wait for rain to fall
Only God knows
The whole sky glows

Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
