You walk through the subway,
His eyes burn a hole in your back.
A footstep behind you,
He lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy,
He laughs as he's watching you bleed.
Killer behind you,
His blood lust defies all his needs


My innocent victims
Are slaughtered with wrath and despise,
The mocking religion of hatred
That burns in the night
I have no-one,
I'm bound to destroy
All this greed.
A voice inside me,
Compelling to satisfy me

I can see,
What a knife's meant to be.
You'll never know,
How I came to foresee.
My faith in believing is stronger
Than lifelines and ties,
With the glimmer of metal
My moment is ready to strike.

The death call arises,
A scream breaks the still of the night.
Another tomorrow
Remember to walk in the light.

I have found you,
And now there is no place to run.
Excitement shakes me,
Oh God help me what have I done.

Yeah I've done it again!

He walks through the subway
My eyes burn a hole through your back.
A footstep behind you
He lunges prepared for attack.

Scream for mercy,
He laughs as he's watching you bleed.
Killer behind you,
My blood lust defies all my needs
Look out I'm coming for you!
