A lonely cry for help reaching out for help to anyone
A silent prayer to God to help you on your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when I was happy
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
The hardest part is to get on with your life


You're searching in the dark
Clutching at straws to find a way
You take the Tarot cards and throw them to the wind

Your questions your beliefs,
your inner thoughts, your whole existence
And if there is a God then answer if you will
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace

If you could live your life again
Would you change a thing or leave all the same
If you had the chance again
Would you change a thing at all
When you look back at your past
Can you say that you are proud of what we've done
Are there times when you believe
That the right you thought was wrong

All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
