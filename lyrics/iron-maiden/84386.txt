So you think you can own me
Well you'd better just think again
You'd better watch your steps now
Woman, 'cause I ain't like those other men
There's something burning inside me
That makes me want to be free
And when I get these feelings honey
You better keep away from me


There's things in life now, baby
That I know I've got to do
And I need your love now, baby
To help me see it through
So you think you can own me
Well you'd better just think again
You'd better watch your steps now
Woman, 'cause I ain't like those other men

So you think you can own me
Well you'd better just think again
You'd better watch your steps now
Woman, 'cause I ain't like those other men
There's something burning inside me
That makes me want to be free
And when I get these feelings honey
You better keep away from me
