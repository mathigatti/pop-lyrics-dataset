Look for something that is hard to find
Searching somewhere deep inside your mind
Hope you find just what you’re looking for
Heaven’s waiting with an open door


If you should sell your soul as cheaply as I did then
The road to ruin is a long road to hide in
We signed our lives away to have an escape
It’s something that will be whatever our fate
There’s no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can’t take no more lying
This is the last
There’s no time for crying
When some of us are dying
None of us decide what is our fate

Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Is this the last together maybe this time now
We stand together and we’re holding the line here
There’s nothing we can do just sit here and wait
The die is cast that is deciding our fate

There’s no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can’t take no more lying
This is the last
There’s no time for crying
When some of us are dying
None of us decide
What is our fate

Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives
Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives
Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives
