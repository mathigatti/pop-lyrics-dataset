Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real, this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?
I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away


Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait til another day

Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait til another day

I have a lust for the earth below
And hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying
I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare

Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait til another day

Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait til another day

Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth, the path for you is decided

Oh, oh

My body tingles, I feel so strange
I feel so tired, I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or in heaven or hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait til another day
