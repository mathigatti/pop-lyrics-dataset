If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book?


Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Can I tempt you, come with me
Be Devil may care, fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go, would you be scared?

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Don't be afraid, you're safe with me
Safe as any soul can be
Honestly, just let yourself go

Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time

Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time

Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You try to hide your deepest sins
Of all the things that you've done wrong
And I know where you belong

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Make you an offer you can't refuse
You've only got your soul to lose
Eternally, let yourself go!

Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time

Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught now in two minds!
