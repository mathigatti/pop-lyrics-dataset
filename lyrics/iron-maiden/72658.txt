From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death
And he has cheated us


But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping and we'll dream for evermore

And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows we made with our hands
Deeper grey, came to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this Journeyman's day be his last?

I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away

But the memory still remains
All the past years not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud

And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around

In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then the Journeyman's day has begun

I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want.
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away

In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then the Journeyman's day has begun

I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away
