Another time, another place
A hollow universe in space
I took a trip to see the sights
I will be blacker than the night
One way ticket, no return
My shootin' star so fast it burns
On the edge that you can't see
Let's shoot the moon, you and me
I'm not particular, you see
Just a lonesome galaxy


Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

I'll say a mass for you and wave
Shootin' plasma from my grave
Event horizon lost in space
Runnin' in a human race
I don't know where, I don't know when
But somehow, back there time again
I'm on the edge that you can't see
I’m not particular at night
A single particle of me
You won’t be tracking me by sight

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We're slipping into the night

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night
