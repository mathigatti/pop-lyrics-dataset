I'm running out of my time,
I'm running out of breath
And now it's getting, so I can't sleep at night
In the day, feel like death


I'm getting in far too deep, I feel them closing in
I've got to say that I'm scared,
I know they'll win
Even so, I'm prepared

Do you believe, what you hear?
Can you believe, what you see?
Do you believe, what you feel?
Can you believe?

What is real?
Futureal
What is real?

Whenever anyone seems
to treat me like a freak
It makes me see I'm the only one who feels
That I know what is real

Sometimes it feels like
a game of deadly hide and seek
And when you're reading this, then I will be gone
Maybe then, you will see

Do you believe, what you hear?
Can you believe, what you see?
Do you believe, what you feel?
Can you believe?

What is real?
Futureal
What is real?
Futureal
