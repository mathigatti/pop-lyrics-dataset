She fell in love with his greasy machine, she leaned over wiped his kickstart clean
She'd never seen the beast before, but she left there wanting more more more
But when she was walking on down the road, she heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back, "I'll take you on a ride from here to eternity" 


Hell ain't a bad place, hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place, hell is from here to eternity 
She must be having one of her crazy dreams, she'd never sat on a piece so mean
It made her feel like's she's on cloud nine, she even thought she heard the engine sigh
But like all dreams that come to an end, they took a tumble at the devil's bend
The beast and Charlotte they were two of a kind, they'd always take the line from here to eternity 

Hell ain't a bad place, hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place hell is from here to eternity 
(2:16-Solo: Dave Murray)

Hell ain't a bad place, hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place hell is from here to eternity
