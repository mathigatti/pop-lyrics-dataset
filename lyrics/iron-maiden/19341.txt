Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before but I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law


I met up with a stranger last night
To keep me alive
He spends all his time on gambling and guns to survive
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight, tonight

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight, tonight

I can laugh at the wind
I can howl at the rain
Down in the canyon or out on the plain

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight, tonight
