Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed


Why won't you listen to me
Is it so hard to understand
That I am the real seventh son?
Your life or death on me depends

Suffering and pain. Impending disaster
Souls crying. The devil's laughter
Heard the cry of the seven whistlers
Lucifer smiles, looks on and waits

I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my visions
Heed what I say and you'll see
What will be. Please listen to me

Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame unto me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment

It stays with me, knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed

Purgatory beckons souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs, hell awaits

I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes in my visions
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now, it's too late.
