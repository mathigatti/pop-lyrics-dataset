Look inside your head and find
And tell me now that it's all in your mind
Look inside your head and find
A way deep inside and it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind, it's all in your mind


Revolution, air pollution
Chairman Mao Tse Tung is in your mind
(But he's dead now, he's not very well anyway!)
New day breaking, people hating
Love supreme, but it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind, it's all in your mind

Segregation, preservation
Politicians all are in your mind
Pewter Suta, kama sutra
Even Blankenheimer is in your mind
It's all in your mind, it's all in your mind
