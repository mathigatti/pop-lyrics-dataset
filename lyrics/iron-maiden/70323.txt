I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night
I was strolling throught the streets of Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was butchered remains
Of two girls laying side by side


Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Flee before the killers go free

There's some people coming down the street
At last someone's heard my call
I can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all

Well I must have got some blood on my hands
Because everybody's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away

Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever going to be free

And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law
All France is looking for me
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down the South to Italy

Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the Gendarme
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home

Well I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Any time somebody stares at me
Well I just started running blind

Well I'm running throught the shadows tonight
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
Cause I know that I show the signs of...

Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Runnin' from the arms of the law

Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free

It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died

If I could go to somebody to help
It would get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that it's on my mind
That my doctor said I've done it before

Murders in the Rue Morgue
They're never gonna find me
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home
