Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I'm goin' fast
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
She walked up to me and really stole my heart
And then she started to take my body apart


Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you

Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know, I'm just can't last
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know, I'm goin' fast
It's only just a moment
She's turning paranoid
It's another situation for a nervous boy

Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know, I'm goin' fast
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, I just can't take any more

Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you

Oooh! I'm on the run
