As he travels on the beast of burden
Moving up along the mountainside
As he gazes looking down the valley
No regrets but his pride


As he journeys across mountain passes
And significant sweeps over him
His reflection of the beauty around him
Feeling empty inside

He is running from his wildest thoughts
He is running from his everything
He is looking now to find something
Hoping he can be saved

He's searching for the answer now
It's something that he's managed to avoid up 'till now
Real conviction that he craves
He needs to find the answer sooner or later

Pushed himself to the limits
He had to strive for all the harder things in life
But what the cost to giving now
His life his, time are the only things that he has

Life is not a rehearsal
All he has is the one chance to get it right
Living really is the only way to know

Maybe one day they'll forgive him what he's done
But now the pain of lying too early in the grave

Destiny no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now, we'll be his saving grace

He tries to make his peace with God
All is forgivable but he's left a little late
Trying something that he's not
Is impossible to change such a lot

He's taken someone's life away
There's not a day that goes by, he regrets what he's done
He should have found another way
But the good book says an eye for an eye

In reflecting on decisions that were made
On the judgements that will haunt him 'till his grave
No one has the right to take another life
But in his mind he had no choice, so be it

Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now, will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now, we'll be his saving grace

Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now, will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now, we'll be his saving grace

Far, far away
The man who would be king
Far, far away
The man who would be king
So far way
The man who would be king
So far way
The man who would be king
Far, far away
The man who would be king
