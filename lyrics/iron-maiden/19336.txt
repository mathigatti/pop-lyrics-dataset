He is the king of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow
He rules the sandworms and the Fremen
In a land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow
He is destined to be a King
He rules over every thing
In the land called planet Dune
Body water is your life
And without it you would die
In the deserted planet Dune


Without a stillsuit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis
It is a land that's rich in spice
The sandriders and the mice
That they call the Muad'Dib
He is the Kwisatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar
He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He's the ruler of the stars

The time will come for him to lay claim his crown
And then the foe, yes they'll be cut down
You'll see, he'll be the best that there's been
Messiah supreme, true leader of men
And when the time for judgement's at hand
Don't fret he's strong and he'll make a stand
'Gainst evil the fire that spreads through the land
He has the power to make it all end
