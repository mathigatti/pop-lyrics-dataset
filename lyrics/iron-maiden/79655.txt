My telescope looks out
Into the stars tonight
A little speck of light
Seems twice the size tonight
The calculations are so fine
Can it be growing all the Time?


Now I can't believe it's true
And I don't know what to do
For the hundredth time
I check the declination

Now the fear starts to grow
Even my computer shows
There are no erros in the calculations

Now it's happened take no other view
Collision course,
you must believe it's true
No there's nothing left that we can do

When Two Worlds collide
The anger and the pain
Of all those who remain
Two worlds collide
Who will be left alive
No place to hide

When Two Worlds collide
The anger, the pain
Of those who remain
When Two Worlds collide
So who will survive
There's no place to hide
When Two Worlds collide

When Two Worlds collide
The anger, the pain
Of all those who remain
Two Worlds collide
Who will be left alive
No place to hide
There's no place to hide
When Two Worlds collide
