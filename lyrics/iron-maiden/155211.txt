[Bruce] 'Would you like to see Black Bart?' 
[Nerd] 'Who's Black Bart?' 
[Bruce] 'Let me introduce you' 


Black Bart's seen it 
Black Bart knows 
Black Bart's done it 
The Black Bart blues 
Suspended in suspension 
Many evil nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere 
We all got to try the Black Bart blues 

Black Bart's truckin' ain't what it seems 
Black Bart's lookin' 
Don't know where she's been 
Maybe she's an acrobat 
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole 
We all got to try the Black Bart blues 
Black Bart tried most anything 
Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing 
So he asked me to tell ya 
Try it for yourself and you will see 
We all got to try the Black Bart blues

[Bruce] 'What did you do that for?' 
[Nerd] 'I'm sorry, I just..., I guess I'm not used to... 
[Bruce] 'Shut up and get on with it will you' 

Black Bart's livin' across the ocean now 
Black Bart's lookin' to come back somehow 
So if you are a dancer, 
You could dance his pole in May 
That's a maypole 

Black Bart's coming 
Now Black Bart's gone 
Black Bart did it so I wrote this song 
Whatever and however, 
In and out or several at a time mmm yes! 
We all got to do the Black Bart blues 
Here comes the guitar solo 

We all got to try the Black Bart blues 
Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!
