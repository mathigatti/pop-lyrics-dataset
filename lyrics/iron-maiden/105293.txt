Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive, and some of us are here just so that we'll die
How come the bullet hits the other guy, do we have to try and reason why 


Be it the devil or be it him, you can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know, not just one power runs the show 
Are we the lucky ones saved for another day, or they the lucky ones who are taken away
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the lord above, or the devil himself come to give you a shove 

Be it the devil or be it him, you can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know, not just one power runs the show 
A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away, a hurricane devastates the cities in it's way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind, the worst is yet to come a hell to face mankind 

(2:52-Solo: Dave Murray)
(3:31-Solo: Janick Gers) 

Be it the devil or be it him, you can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know, not just one power runs the show
