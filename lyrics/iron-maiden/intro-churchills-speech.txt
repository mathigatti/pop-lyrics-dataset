We shall go on to the end
We shall fight in France
We shall fight on the seas and oceans
We shall fight! With growing confidence
And growing strength in the air!


We shall defend our island
Whatever the cost may be
We shall fight on the beaches
We shall fight on the landing grounds
We shall fight in the fields
And in the streets
We shall fight in the hills

We shall never surrender!
