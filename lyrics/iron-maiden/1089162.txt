You're in for surprise 
You're in for a shock 
In London town streets 
When there's darkness and fog 
When you least expect me 
And you turn your back 
I'll attack 


I smile when I'm sneaking 
Through shadows by the wall 
I laugh when I'm creeping 
But you won't hear me at all 

All hear my warning 
Never turn your back 
On the ripper 

You'll soon shake with fear 
Never knowing if I'm near 
I'm sly and I'm shameless 
Nocturnal and nameless 
Except for "The Ripper" 
Or if you like "Jack The Knife" 

Any back alley street 
Is where we'll probably meet 
Underneath a gas lamp 
Where the air's cold and damp 
I'm a nasty surprise 
I'm a devil in disguise 
I'm a footstep at night 
I'm a scream of the fright 

All hear my warning 
Never turn your back 
On the ripper...the ripper....the ripper
