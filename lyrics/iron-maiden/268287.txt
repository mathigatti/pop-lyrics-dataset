People try to put us down
Talkin' 'bout my generation
just because we get around.
Talkin' 'bout my generation
Things they do look awful cold.
Talkin' 'bout my generation
I hope I die before I get old.
Talkin' 'bout my generation


My generation,
My generation, baby.

Why don't you all fade away?
Talkin' 'bout my generation
Yeah, don't try and dig what we all say.
Talkin' 'bout my generation
I'm not tryin' to cause a big sensation,
Talkin' 'bout my generation
I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation.
Talkin' 'bout my generation

My generation,
My generation, baby.
