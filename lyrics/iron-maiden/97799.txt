Start, with the sun
And move on out
The future's in the skies above
The heavens unfold
And a new star is born
Space and time makin' love


Oh, what a time we had
Living on the ground
I've moved to station #5
See you next time around
Next time around

As far you want, as close as you need
It's all in the mind, you know
This old world hasn't really seen it's day
It's here, time to go

Oh, what a time we had
Living on the ground
I've moved to station #5
See you next time around
Next time around

Remember when it was so clear
We were young, but the memory still remains
To pick fruit from a tree
Fish from the seas
Now nothing's left here, but the stains
Well I can't cry no more
Can only be glad
There's other places we can be
If the time suits you right
I'm leaving tonight
Come fly away
With me!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

Start, with the sun
And move on out
The future's in the skies above
The heavens unfold
A new star is born
Space and time makin' love

Oh, what a time we had
Living on the ground
I've moved to station #5
See you next time around
Next time around
