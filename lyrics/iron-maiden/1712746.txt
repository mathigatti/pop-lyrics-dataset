I try to call the Earth's command
Desperation in my voice
I'm drifting way off course now
With very little choice


The loneliness is hard to bear
I try to calm my fear
Just hoping any second now
Some contact filters through

Desperate calls
Signal back from Satellite
As my life flashes right in
Front of me

Try again, must get through
Hear me now
For I've very little time

Not much time, hear my call
Please get through, I am here

I'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace
I haven't this chance of getting away
Too close to the Sun and surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes

I think my life, reliving my past
There's nothing but wait til' my time comes
I've had a good life, I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time afresh

For I have lived my life to the full, I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them one last goodbye

The final frontier, the final frontier!!
The final frontier, the final frontier!!

If I could survive to live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Done more in my life than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over again

For I have lived my life to the full, I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family and tell them that one last goodbye

The final frontier, the final frontier!!
The final frontier, the final frontier!!

There isn't much time, must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes, if only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find

For I have lived my life to the full, I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them that one last goodbye

The final frontier, the final frontier!!
The final frontier, the final frontier!!
The final frontier, the final frontier!!
The final frontier, the final frontier!!
Ah, ah! The final frontier, the final frontier!!
The final frontier, the final frontier!!
