Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eyes as he stops one of three
Mesmerizes of one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea!


And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell, and the mariner tells his tale

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings

And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse, a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung

And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me

Day after day, day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water, everywhere, and all the boards did shrink
Water, water, everywhere, not any drop to drink!

There!, calls the mariner
There comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no
Wind in her sails and no tide?
See, onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life; wait, but there's two!

Death, and she life in death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner
And he belongs to her now
Then, crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She, she, life in death
She lets him live, her chosen one

One after one, by the star dogged moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face, with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
And I heard nor sigh nor groan
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down, one by one

The curse, it lives on in their eyes
The mariner, he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty, not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures, all of them too

Then, the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead, into the sea
Then down in falls, comes the rain!

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak, and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy, he could not believe
The pilots boat, his son and the hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him

And the ship, it sinks, like lead, into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell his tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on
