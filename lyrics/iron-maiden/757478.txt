You lead me on the path
Keep showing me the way
I feel a little lost
A little strange today


I think I'll take ahold
Of whatever comes my way
Then we'll see what happens
Take it day by day

I thought I had it all
I had it all worked out
Just what the future held
That there would be no doubt

But then the card came up
And I took another turn
But I don't know what is
Fulfillment that I yearn

Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learn

Don't wanna be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I'm afraid it's not for me

Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life, it's not too late to learn

Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life, it's not too late to learn

Don't wanna be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I'm afraid it's not for me

Don't know what I want
Or where I want to be
Feeling more confused
The more the days go by
