Love is a razor
And I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If I could only see her now


Living on the razor's edge
Balancing on the ledge
Living on the razor's edge
Balancing on the ledge

Balancing on the ledge
Living on the razor's edge
Balancing on the ledge
You know, you know!

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on!
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on!

Circle of fire my baptism of joy
And an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain
The book of life opens before me

And I will pray for you
Some day I may return
Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn

Living on the razor's edge
Balancing on the ledge
Living on the razor's edge
You know, you know!

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on!
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on!

Yeah, yeah!

Living on the razor's edge
Balancing on the ledge
Living on the razor's edge
You know, you know!

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on!
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on!

The evil
The evil
The evil that men do!

The evil
The evil
The evil that men do!

Yeah, yeah!
