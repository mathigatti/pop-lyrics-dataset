My son, ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee


Near to the East, in a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son to Philip of Macedon
The legend his name was Alexander

At the age of nineteen, he became the Macedon king
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegian Sea in 334 BC
He utterly beat the armies of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men

King Darius the third, Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon king as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria

By the Tigris river, he met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon and Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a God amongst mortal men

A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the Gordion knot
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia

Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity

Marching on, Marching on

The battle weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon
