We are not the sons of god
We are not his chosen people now
We have crossed the path he trod
We will feel the pain of his beginning


Shadow fingers rise above
iron fingers stab the desert sky
Oh behold the power of man
On it's tower, ready for the fall

knocking heads together well
Raise a city, build a living hell
Join the race to suicide
Listen for the tolling of the bell

Out of the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed

Yellow sun its evil twin
In the black the wings deliver him
We will split our soul's within
Atom seed to nuclear dust is riven

Out of the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed

Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns

Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns

Bury your morals
And bury your dead
Bury your head in the sand
E=mc squared you can relate
How we made god with our hands

Whatever would Robert have said to his god
about how we made war with the sun
E=mc squared you can relate
how we made god with our hands

All nations are rising
Through acid veils of love and hate
Chain letters of Satan
uncertainty leads us all to this
All nations are rising
through avid veils of love and hate
cold fusion and fury

Divide and conquer while ye may
Others preach and others fall and pray
In the bunkers where we'll die
Where the executioners they lie

Bombers launch with no recall
Minutes warning of the missile fall
Take a look at your last sky
Guessing you won't have the time to cry

Out of the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed

Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns

Holy Father we have sinned
