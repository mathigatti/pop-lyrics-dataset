Honey it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes you tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
So unchain your back door and invite me around


Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go!
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go!

Honey it's getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
Cos you know, you know I'm coming soon

Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go!
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go!

So pick up your foolish pride, no going back
No where, no way, no place to hide

Bring your daughter, bring your daughter, bring your daughter,
bring your daughter, bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter

Bring your daughter, fetch your daughter, bring your daughter,
fetch your daughter, bring your daughter, fetch your daughter to the slaughter

Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go!
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go!
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go! Let her go! let her go, let her go!
I'm coming get you, now!
