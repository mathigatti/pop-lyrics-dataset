When I stand and look
About the port
And contemplate my life, will I
Ever see my countrymen again?
As the captain calls us on the deck
I take my things and walk
To the harbourside, I glance back
One last time


Fleeing our nation, our problems
We leave behind
Ships by the tenfold sail
Out on the tide
We are pleased to be out and
Embracing the open sea
Free from our troubles
And more free from thee

Inheritors unfulfilled reason
Behind us
We flee from what is not what
Is will be
We flee the earth and face our
Harsh reality
Will death be low mist that
Hangs on the sea?

We run from the evil tongues, rash
Judgements, selfish men
Never to be seen on these
Shores again

As we sail into oceansize
And lose sight of all land
A face of contentment
Around in the air
We're off now to
Seek all our fortunes
To the land of our dreams

Riding the waves and the storm
Is upon us
The winds lash the sails but
The ropes keep them tight
Off in the distance a dark cloud
Approaching

None could imagine what there
Was to come
No, there's no one going back
No, there's not a second chance
As we strap onto the side
We pray to God that we don't die

As we ride the rough seas
As we soak from the ocean waves
I just hope for all our lives
And pray that I survive

Four ships are lost in the
Stormy conditions

The spirits of the sunken crews
Their phantoms follow us

Spirits, sails, they drive us on
Through the all consuming waves
Cold mortality, no weapon
Against these ever raging seas

Four leagues and ten and we
Hit storms again
We just can't get away from
The eye of the storm

The birds outsoar the raging storm
But we cannot escape it
Abandoned earth that we
Now crave
Is many leagues from safe

Holding on for our dear lives
And we're praying once again
Rotten luck or just jonahed?
The talisman is in my hand

Limbs fatigues, trembling with cold
Blinded from the sea spray salt
Clasping anything we can hold
Heaven's rain upon us falls

Twenty days without a meal
And ten without fresh water still
Those that didn't die in storms
The scurvy rest did slaughter

Westwards the tide
Westwards we sail on
Westwards the tide
Sail by the talisman

We approach the other side
Of the ocean with the tide
In our favour just for once
Welcome greeting, our new land
The elation in our hearts
The excitement in our veins
As we sail towards the coastline
Of our golden promised land

Weary limbs fatigued away
I have no life left in me
No more strength and nothing
Left to give
Must find the will to live

Never thought that we could
Make it
Truly sight of shores divine
The sickness I am dying from
Never wanted it to end this way

Westwards the tide
Westwards we sail on
Westwards the tide
Sail by the talisman
