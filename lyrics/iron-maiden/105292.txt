We live our lives in fever, in a choking sweat of fear
In the heat of the night you can feel so much
In the heat of the night I scream "Don't touch!"
I remember a time when we used and abused
We fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night... bodies aflame
We live in fever...


I hear your secret heartbeat, I can hear your silent cries
The kids have lost their freedom, and nobody cares till somebody famous dies

I remember a time when we used and abused
And we fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night... bodies aflame

Now we live in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key - to what you want to be
You don't get a say the majority get's it's way
You're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die

I hear your secret heartbeat, I can hear your silent cries
Oh, it gets to lies and lies
The kids have lost their freedom, and nobody cares till somebody famous dies
They're telling lies and lies and lies and lies and lies...

I remember a time when we used and abused
Ah, it was just lies
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
But it was just lies and lies and lies and lies and lies
In the night, ooh

(4:27-Solo: Janick Gers)

We live in fever, we live in fever, we live in fever

Now we live in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key - to what you want to be
You don't get a say the majority get's it's way
You're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die
