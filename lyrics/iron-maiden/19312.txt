I've been looking so long for you now you won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask
And you know and I know that you aint got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past


You're standing in the wings, there you wait for the curtain to fall
Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Yeah, I know that you're gonna scratch me, maim me and maul
You know I'm helpless from your mesmerising cat call

Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray, from the narrow way

I'm running and hiding in my dreams you're always there
You're the phantom of the opera, you're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air
Haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me back at your lair
