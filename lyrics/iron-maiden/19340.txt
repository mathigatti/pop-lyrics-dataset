I was born into a scene
Of angriness and greed
Of dominance and persecution


My mother was a queen
My dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be

Now I spend my time
Looking all around
For a man that's nowhere
To be found
Until I find him
I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm going to find my man
Gonna travel round

Cos I'm a wrathchild
Well I'm a wrathchild
Yeh I'm a wrathchild

I'm coming to get you
Oh, yeah yeah

Some say it shouldn't matter
Ain't nothing gonna alter
The course of my destination

But I know I've gotta find
Some seriaus peace of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy

Now I spend my time
Looking all around
For a man that's nowhere
To be found
Until I find him
I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm going to find my man
Gonna travel round

Cos I'm a wrathchild
Well I'm a wrathchild
Yeh I'm a wrathchild

I'm coming to get you
Oh, yeah yeah
