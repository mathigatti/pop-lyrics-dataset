Look out now baby won't you take me away,
Sitting here I think it's gonna be a new day.


Gonna get my song 'til I can't go on,
Gonna keep on roaming gotta sing my song.

What you feeling when you hold me tight,
Gonna cuddle up to you tonight.
Gonna get you feeling so secure.
Listen child, don't you see there's a cure.
Anywhere got to get you away,
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day.

Gonna get my song 'til I cant go on,
Gonna keep on roaming gotta sing my song.

What you feeling when you hold me tight,
I wanna cuddle up to you tonight.
Gonna get you feeling so secure.
Listen child, don't you see there's a cure.
Anywhere got to get you away,
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day.

Gonna get my song 'til I cant go on,
Gonna keep on roaming gotta sing my song.

Gonna sing my song yeah,
And it won't take long.
Gonna sing my song yeah,
Won't you sing along.
I wan't you to sing it,
sing it, sing it, sing it along.

Repeat.
