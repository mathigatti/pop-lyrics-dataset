Bleeding you dry from the start 
The sum of my parts 
To give it away 
New life in a day 
Some new Frankenstein 
Damned for all time 


Cursed by the angel who fell 
Who saves me from hell? 
And who is my god? 
And where is my soul? 
Too tired to jump too young to run 

Neverending forever searching 
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart 
Always seeking always asking 
Questions right from the start 

Out beyond the new frontier 
Playing god without mercy without fear 
Create a beast made a man without a soul 
Is it worth the risk a war of god and man? 
Is it worth the risk a war of god and man? 

I want to end my life now, but I don't know how 
Recycled again a lifetime of pain 
The spawn of a man 
The devil has planned 

Neverending forever searching 
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart 
Always seeking always asking 
Questions right from the start 

Out beyond the new frontier 
Playing god without mercy without fear 
Create a beast made a man without a soul 
Is it worth the risk a war of god and man? 
Is it worth the risk a war of god and man?
