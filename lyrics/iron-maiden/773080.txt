Hold a halo round the world
Golden is the day
Princes of the universe
Your burden is the way
So there is no better time
Who will be born today
A gypsy child at day break
A king for a day


Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it, to live again

Dusty dream in fading daylight
Flicker on the walls
Nothing new, your life's a drift
What purpose to it all?
Eyes are closed and death is calling
Reaching out his hand
Call upon the starlight to surround you

Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it, to live again

Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it, to live again

Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it, to live again

Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it, to live again

A man who cast no shadows has no soul
