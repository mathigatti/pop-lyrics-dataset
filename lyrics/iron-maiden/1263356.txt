Yeah, it cost me a bundle
Trying to track you down, it's true
Yeah, and it's the truth
I'm looking from town to town for you
You know you never offered much security
Do you know I'm gonna get you back?
You just wait and see


I'm never goin' back, Juanita
I know you never got my call
I'm never goin' back, Juanita
Never at all

Yeah, I'm spending a long time
Trying to work it out for true
Yeah, it's such small crime
Thirsting over you
Living in a Cheisea flat
Seems so lonely now
I just know I gotta get you back
I just don't know how

Yeah, I just got to tell you
I'm gonna leave it up to you
Yeah, what more can I say?
What more can I do?
Living in a Cheisea flat
Seems so lonely now
I just know I gotta get you back
I just don't know how

I'm never goin' down on, Juanita
Never gonna make that call
Never goin' down on, Juanita
Never at all
I'm never goin' down on, Juanita
Never gonna make that call
Never goin' down on, Juanita
Two fingers at all
I'm never goin' back, Juanita
Never goin' down on you
Juanita, I'm never goin' back, Juanita...
