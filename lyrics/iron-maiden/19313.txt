The only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why


Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
A let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place

Stalks of light come from the ground
When I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world

Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old

Don't you hear me call? Ooh
