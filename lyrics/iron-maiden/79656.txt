"Beehive hairdo", 45 on the hip
Patrolwoman Saunders, don't you give her no whip
Took me to the station for a breath test
Then back to the bedroom for some house-arrest


Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but
Oh! They feel so warm

Coming back to London on a 7:47
Stewardess made me feel like I'm in heaven
Looking up the aisle to see what I could see
She leaned over said "give it to me"

White apron, brown leather shoes
The nurse at the clinic left my heart all bruised
Gave me a massage, sprained my right
Now she takes my temperature every night

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but
Oh! They feel so warm

Women in uniform (4x)

Commando raid on the Lebanese border
Sergeant Anita, she gives the order
Khaki jacket and a love gun
Baby, I surrender, let's have some fun

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but
Oh! They feel so warm

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but
Oh! They feel so warm

Women in uniform (4x)
Women in uniform, khaki, white and blue

Women in uniform, coming after you
Women, women, women in uniform (2x)

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but
Oh, yeah (2x)

Women in uniform, khaki, white and blue
Women in uniform (3x)
Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform
