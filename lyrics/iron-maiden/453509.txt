"We shall go on to the end
We shall fight in france
We shall fightover the seas and oceans
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air
We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be
We shall fight on beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets
We shall fight on the hills
We shall never surrender"
