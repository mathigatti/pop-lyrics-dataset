The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool
Who are you kidding being that cool?


Trying to break away from running
With the pack
But they ain't listening so you've
Gotta go back

You're a weekend warrior when
You're one of the crowd
But it's over, just look at you now...

You're not so brave the way you behave
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick
It's all bravado when you're out
With your mates
It's like a different person goes through
Those gates
And the game begins
The adrenalin's high
Feel the tension maybe someone
Will die...

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't
That way anymore

You've gotta get out gotta get away
But you're in with a clique it's not
Easy to stray
You've gotta admit you're just
Living a lie
It didn't take long to work out why

It's hard to say why you got involved
Just wanting to be part
Just wanting to belong...

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't
That way anymore

Some of the things that you've done
You feel so ashamed
After all it's only a game... Isn't it?
And after all the adrenalin's gone
What you gonna do on monday?

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you were
Never like that at all
