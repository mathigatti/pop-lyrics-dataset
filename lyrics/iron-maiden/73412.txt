Vocais principais de Adrian Smith com apoio de Bruce Dickinson

Intro : Solo harm√¥nico (os dois Murray e Smith)

It's over your head
And you don't seem to understand
One word I say
And you can't live your life
Trying to run away


You're fighting your friends
Arguing everybody
But it never ends
You're wearing me out


Come on
Reach out
And let someone into your life

Don't get me wrong
You always apologize
It's just your way
Of making a scene
You need to be loved
It's not such a crime

estrofe 2x
Come on
Reach out
And let someone into your life

Solo: Harmonia (1:52) / Dave Murray (2:05) / Adrian Smith (2:12)

I said
Over your head
You just don't seem to understand
One word I say
And you can't live your life
You got so much love
It's burning inside

Come on
Reach out
And let someone into your life
