Just sixteen, a pickup truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own
Hit the gas, and here I go


I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free

Spent the night in an L. A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
They ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free

I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free

(Get out off my way, yeah!)

I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, oh I'm running free

Puller here at the Bottle Top
Whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be

I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, oh I'm running free
