Hey girl, what you doin'?
Hey girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is about you
But I like it a lot
Oh why don't you let me hold you
Let me feel your lovin' touch 
 
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown, drive me insane! 
 
Hey girl, I got something I think you want to know
Hey girl, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms
And feel your love tonight
I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause I like your charms 
 
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown, drive me insane! 
 
(1:16 - Solo: Janick Gers) 
 
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown, drive me insane! 
 
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
I want to feel your love all night
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
I'm gonna make your telephone work tonight
Communication breakdown
