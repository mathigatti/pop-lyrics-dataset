Azazel is besides you
And he's playing a game.
Demons are inside you and they are making a prayer
Watching on their hiding as they wait for the time
For the devil to get ready and take over heaven


You and only god will know
What can be done?
You and only god will know
I am the only one.
You and only god will know
What can be done?
You and only god will know
I am the chosen one.

(Chorus)

Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we charish and Love
Nothing left but to face this all of my own
Cause I am the chosen one.

Beaten Fallen angel
But I've risen again
And the power is inside me
I've decided to pray
He's awake for armageddon
And he's coming my way
It's an honor to be chosen
And awaken from the dead
