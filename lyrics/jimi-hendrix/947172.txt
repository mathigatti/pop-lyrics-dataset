I sure got the blues this morning, baby
Yeah! And I'm here to tell you about it
So you might as well pick up on it!
I'm a man
At least I'm tryin' to be
I've lived before
The other half of me
I've lived before
That you don't want me
But in this search
For nothing desperately
Oh, I'm tryin' tryin'
Not to be a fool
I'm tryin' tryin'
Lord to keep my cool, baby tryin' so hard to keep it together


After I find, baby
That true love of mine
IÂ¹m just rollin' screamin'
Cryin' flyin'
Can't be trusted, but busted
Rolling Stone

You're a woman
At least you say you are
You're a woman
At least you look like you are
You're a woman
At least you taste like you are
But you can take it off
In bed with my guitar
And then you leave them
Throw me outside
To cry, cry
To the moon and the nighttime
Save my soul,
You can't find
All you want is a ticket to ride
After you show me everything
It did prove otherwise
You just rollin', screamin', cryin' good love is sometime, but can't be trusted
