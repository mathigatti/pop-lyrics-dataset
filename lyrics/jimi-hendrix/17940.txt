Down the street you can hear her scream "you're a disgrace"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside and all the neighbors start to gossip and drool


He cries "oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Against the door he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall and burn the garden green

And so castles made of sand, fall in the sea, eventually

A little Indian brave who before he was ten, played war game sin
The woods with his Indian friends, and he built a dream that when he
Grew up, he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief

Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrow
He would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle, but something went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And so castles made of sand, melts into the sea, eventually

There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown
Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she would stop living, so she decided to die
She drove her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled

You won't hurt me no more
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way
And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on going
And so castles made of sand slips into the sea
Eventually
