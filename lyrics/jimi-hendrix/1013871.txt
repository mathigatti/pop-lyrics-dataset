The stars up above that play with laughing sam's dice
They make us feel the world was made for us
The zodiac glass that bleams come through the skies
It will happen soon, for you
And a way we go
Yeah
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
And now we would like to bring to you our wide lonely freindly neighborhood
Experience me
Right now listen
The milky way express is loaded, all aboard
I promise each and every one fo you you won't be bored
What I'm really concerned about
Is my grand-new pair of butterfly roller skates
Thank you, thank you
No throwing cigarette butts out the window
No throwing cigarette butts out the window
Now if you look to your right you'll se saturn
If you look to the left you'll see mars
I hope your brought your parachutes with you
Hey look out!
Look out for that door
Don't open that door
Don't open that door
Oh well
That's the way it goes
Hey, everything is all right now
