My girl it's all about your girl
The finest, ditto, fine!
She's got somethin' lord
Knows? Drivin' her


She's got a nice personality
And if you ever saw her you will agree

That she's a fox now, my baby!
She's a fox now

She stands out above the crowd
She sure makes her fellow proud

My girl it's all about your will
If you need it, tee it off, ditto
Need, she's a slub, lord knows girl
Cups so loud, industriously

Some girls got it and some girls ain't
Some girls can do it, lord and some girls cant
Cause she's a fox now, my baby, she's a snow fox
My baby she's a? Snow fox
She's a stow fox, my bea
She's a fox now
My baby, she's a fox now
