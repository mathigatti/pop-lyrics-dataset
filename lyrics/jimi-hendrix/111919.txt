Hello, my friend 
 So happy to see you again 
 I was so alone 
 All by my self 
 I just couldn't make it 
 
 Have you heard, baby 
 What the winds blowing round 
 Have you heard, baby 
 A whole lot of peoples coming right on down 
 
 Communication, yeah 
 Is coming on strong 
 And don't give a damn, baby 
 If your hair is short or long, huh 
 
 I said, get out of your grave 
 Everybody is dancing in the street 
 Do what you know, don't be slow 
 You gotta practice what you preach 
 'Cause it's time for you and me 
 Come to face reality (it sounds like he says "fake reality")
 
 Forget about the past, baby 
 Things ain't what they used to be 
 Keep on Straight Ahead 
 Keep on straight Ahead 
 
 Straight Ahead, baby 
 Straight Ahead, baby 
 
 We got to stand side by side 
 We got to stand together and organize 
 They say power to the people, 
 That's what they're screamin' 
 Freedom of the soul 
 Pass it on, pass it on to the young and old 
 
 You got to tell the children the truth 
 They don't need a whole lot of lies 
 Because one of these days, baby 
 They'll be running things 
 So when you give them love 
 You better give it right 
 Woman and child and man and wife 
 The best love to have is the Love Of Life 
 
 Pushing on Straight Ahead 
 Straight Ahead, baby 
 
 Hello my friend 
 It's so good to see you again 
 And I've been all by my self 
 I don't think I can make it alone 
 I gotta keep on pushing ahead
