A little boy inside a dream just the other day
His mind fell out of his face and the wind blew it away
A hand came out from heaven and pinned a badge on his chest
And said get out there, man, and do your best


They called him astro man, and he's flyin' higher than
That old faggot superman ever could
And they call him cosmic nut
And he's twice as fast as Donald duck
And he'll try his best to screw you up and mess up your mind

There he goes, there he goes
Where he stops no one knows
There he goes, there he goes
He's trying to blow out the rest of your mind
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind
If you're looking for a piece of mind
Astro man, give me a piece of it
