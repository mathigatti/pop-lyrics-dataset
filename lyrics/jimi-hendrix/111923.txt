Well. I'm up here in this womb 
 I'm looking all around 
 Well, I'm looking out my belly button window 
 And I see a whole lot of frowns 
 And I'm wondering if they don't want me around 
 
 What seems to be the fuzz out there? 
 Just what seems to be the hang? 
 'Cause you know if ya just don't want me this time around, 
 yeah I'll be glad to go back to Spirit Land 
 And even take a longer rest, 
 before I'm coming down the chute again 
 Man, I sure remember the last time, baby 
 They were still hawkin' about me then 
 So if you don't want me now, 
 Make up your mind, where or when 
 If you don't want me now, 
 Give or take, you only got two hundred days 
 'Cause I ain't coming down this way too much more again 
 
 You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills 
 But I think you're just a little too late 
 So I'm coming down into this world, daddy 
 Regardless of love and hate 
 And I'm gonna sit up in your bed, mama 
 And just a grin right in your face 
 And then I'm gonna eat up all your chocolates, 
 and say "I hope I'm not too late" 
 
 So if there's any questions, 
 make up your mind 
 'Cause you better give or take 
 Questions in your mind 
 Give it a take, 
 you only got two hundred days 
 
 Way up into this womb 
 looking all around 
 Sure's dark in here 
 And I'm looking out my belly button window 
 And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns 
 And I'm wondering if they want me around.
