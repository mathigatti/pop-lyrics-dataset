Oh, remember the mocking bird, my baby bought
He used to sing for his supper, baby
Yes he used to sing for his dinner, babe
He used to sing so sweet
But since my baby left me he ain't sang a toon all day


Oh, remember the blue-birds and the honey bees,
They used to sing for the sunshine
Yes, they used to sing for the honey
They used to sing so sweet
But since my baby left me they ain't sang a toon all day
All day

Hey pretty baby, come on back to me
Make everybody happy as can be

So, baby, if you'll please come home again
you know I'll kiss you for my supper,
You know I'll kiss you for my dinner, yeah!
But, ah, if you don't come back you know
I'll have to starve to death
'cus I ain't had a kiss all day now
Please remember
You got to remember
You got to remember our love
Come on back, baby, come on back in my arms,
I'll make everything that better
Come on, baby, hurry up now
Can you hear me calling you back again now?
Come on, baby, stop jiving around, hurry home, hurry home
