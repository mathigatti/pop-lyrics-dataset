Yeah
Yeah
Yeah its about the time we'd like to present you to
The electric church
And, baby, if you would you all listen to our notes
Here here in our seens, playin'
Instead of rappin' like I am now
Then maybe I'll well maybe this is good enough
What ya think we stick with songs
It's all freedom


There's a red house, over yonder, baby
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder, baby
Lord, that's where my baby stays

I ain't been home to see my baby
In about a ninety-nine and one half days
It's about time to see her
Wait minute something's wrong, babe
Lord, have mercy this key won't unlock this door

Wait a minute something's wrong
Wait a minute something's wrong, baby
Wait a minute something's wrong, baby
Lord, have mercy the key won't unlock this door
