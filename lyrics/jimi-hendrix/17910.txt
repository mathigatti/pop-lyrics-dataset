There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief


Business men, they, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word, hey

No reason to get excited
The thief, he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke

But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late, hey!

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too

Outside in the cold distance
A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl, hey!

(All along the tower)
(Beware, oh, beware)

All along the watchtower
