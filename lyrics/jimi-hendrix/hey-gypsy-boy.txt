Hey gypsy boy
Where do you come from?
From the land (of the) new rising sun
Hey gypsy boy
Where do you plan to go to?


I'm gonna spread a lot of love
And of peace of mind, too
May I come along?

May I come along?
May I come along?
May I come along?

May I come along?
May I come along?
May I come along?

Hey gypsy boy
Where do you go to?
I'm gonna spread a lot of love
And of peace of mind, too
May I come along?

May I come along?
May I come along?
May I come along?
