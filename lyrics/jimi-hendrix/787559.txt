American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama let me be


Don't come hanging around my door,
I don't want to see your face no more
I got more important things to do
Than spend my time growin' old with you

Now woman, I said stay away
American woman, listen what I say
American woman, get away from me
American woman, mama let me be

Don't come knocking around my door,
I don't wanna see your shadow no more
Colored lights can hypnotize,
Sparkle someone else's eyes

Now woman, I said get away
American woman, listen what I say
American woman, I said get way
American woman, listen what I say

Don't come hanging around my door,
Don't want to see your face no more
I don't need your war machines,
I don't need your ghetto scenes
Colored lights can hypnotize,
Sparkle someone else's eyes

Now woman, I said get away
American woman, listen what I say
American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama let me be

I gotta go, I gotta getta away
I'm gonna leave you woman (4x)
Bye, bye... bye, bye
Bye, bye... bye, bye

And you're no good for me
And I'm no good for you
Looking at you, right in the eye,
Tell you whatI'm gonna do

I'm gonna leave you woman,
You know I gotta go
I'm gonna leave you woman,

I gotta go American woman
I gotta go
I gotta go American woman.
