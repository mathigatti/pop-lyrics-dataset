Everybody's wishing me a happy birthday
Everybody's wishing you a real good time
Everybody's wishing me a happy birthday
Everybody's wishing me a real good time


A phone call my telephone
I can tell I have some mail

Everybody's wishing me a happy birthday
Everybody's wishing, wishing me well
As a year comes around
When it comes, some people fall
But I'm happy

Everybody's wishing me a happy birthday
Everybody's wishing you a real good time
Everybody's wishing me a happy birthday
Everybody's wishing me a real good time

A phone call my telephone
I can tell I have some mail

Everybody's wishing me a happy birhtday
Everybody's wishing me a real good time

A phone call my telephone
I can tell I have some mail

Everybody's wishing me a happy birhtday
Everybody's wishing, wishing me well
