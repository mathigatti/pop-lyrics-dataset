Will I live tomorrow?
Well I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say


But I know for sure
I don't live today

No sun coming through my windows
Feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of a grave
No sun coming through my windows
Feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of a grave

I wish you'd hurry up 'n' rescue me
So I can be on my mis'rable way

I don't live today, maybe tomorrow
It's such a shame to waste you time away like this

Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say.
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say

But I know for sure
I don't live today
