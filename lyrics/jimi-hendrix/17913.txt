"HAPPY NEW YEAR FIRST OF ALL.  I HOPE WE'LL HAVE
A MILLION OR TWO MILLION MORE OF THEM... IF WE
CAN GET OVER THIS SUMMER, HE HE HE.  RIGHT I'D
LIKE TO DEDICATE THIS ONE TO THE DRAGGIN' SCENE
THAT'S GOIN' ON  ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT ARE FIGHTIN'
IN CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND NEW YORK... OH YEAS, AND
ALL THE SOLDIERS FIGHTIN' IN VIETNAM.  LIKE TO DO
A THING CALLED 'MACHINE GUN'."


MACHINE GUN
TEARING MY BODY ALL APART

MACHINE GUN
TEARING MY BODY ALL APART

EVIL MAN MAKE ME KILL YA

HEY AND YOUR BULLETS KEEP KNOCKING ME DOWN

HEY I PICK UP MY AXE AND FIGHT LIKE A BOMBER NOW

AFTER A WHILE YOUR YOUR CHEAP TALK DON'T EVERN CAUSE ME PAIN
SO LET YOUR BULLETS FLY LIKE RAIN
