You don't need me
You just wanna bleed me,
So take out your dagger and cut me free, cut me free, cut me free,
Hey, you don't love me girl, you just try to suffocate me . . .
You don't love me, hey look at ya, all lovey-dovey when you,
mess around with that needle . . .
As long as you're gonna be all messed up, I don't give a damn,
Slow down, slow down, slow down, bang bang, shoot shoot,
As long as you're your silly self, I don't give a hoot.
