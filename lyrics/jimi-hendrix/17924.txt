Manic depression's touching my soul
I know what I want
But I just don't know how to go about getting it


Feeling, sweet feeling
Drops from my finger, fingers
Manic depression's captured my soul

Woman so willing the sweet cause in vain
You make love
You break love
It's-a all the same when it's
When it's over

Music sweet music
I wish I could caress, caress, caress
Manic depression's a frustrating mess
Well, I think I'll go turn myself off an' go on down

Really ain't no use me hanging around
Oh, I gotta see you
