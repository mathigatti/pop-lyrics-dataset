Well, i see hands and attesting faces
Reachin' up but not quite touching the promised land
Well, i taste tears and a whole lot of previous years
Wasted
Saying 'lord please give us a helping hand'
Lord lord lord
Lord, there's got to be some changes
Lord lord lord
Gonna be a whole lot of re-arranges


Lord lord lord
You better hope love is the answer
Lord lord lord
Yeah, it better come before the summer

Well, everybody can hear the sound of freedom's
Beating heart
Sirens flashing with earth and rockets stoning
You better love me like it's gonna be the last time
And tell the child to bury daddy's old clothes
Love love love
Yeah, they're talking about getting together, yeah
Love love love
Together for love love love

You better hope love is the answer baby
I think you better hope it comes before the summer

Don't let your imagination take you by surprise
A queen and me i, one day, visualise
My head in the cloud, my feet on the pavement
Don't get too stoned, please remember you're a man
Love love love
Lord, there's got to be some changes
Love love love
Living together's gonna be a lot of re-arranges
