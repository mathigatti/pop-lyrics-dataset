I get stoned
I can't go home
I'm calling long distance on a public saxophone
My head is achin'
Lord my mind is breakin'
Feel I got run over by Captain Coconut and his dog named Rover
Gotta keep on movin'
Gotta keep on movin'
To understand both sides of the sky
you gotta keep on groovin' yeah,
Good groovin'
'Cause you got your God and so do I
We gotta keep on lovin'
Good, good, good, lovin'
Make love on my dyin' bed
We gotta stop smokin', stop, stop,
I mean cigarette smokin'
Or else I cough myself to death
And to make love to you baby,
I wouldn't even have the breath
we gotta keep movin'
keep on groovin'
Understand both sides of the sky
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
You got your God and so do I.
