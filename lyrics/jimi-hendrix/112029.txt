So down and down and down and down
and down and down we go.
Hurry my darling we mustn't be late
for the show.
Neptune champion games to an aqua
world is so very dear.
"Right this way," smiles a mermaid,
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer.


I can hear Atlantis full of cheer...
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer...
