People talkin' but they just don't know, 
What's in my heart, and why I love you so. 
I love you baby like a miner loves gold. 
Come on sugar, let the good times roll. 
(Let the good times roll). 


So many people live in make believe, 
They keep a lot a going up their sleeves. 
But my love baby is no kind that folds. 
Come On Baby, let the good times roll. 
(Let the good times roll). 

Lead 

A love is nice if it's understood. 
It's even nicer when you're feelin' good. 
You got me flippin' like flag on a pole. 
Come on sugar, let the good times roll.
