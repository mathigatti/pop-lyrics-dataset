I feel the ocean swaying me...
Washing away all my pains
See where I was wounded
Remember the scar ?
Now you can't see a thing...
And I feel no pain


Singing about the Valley of Sunsets
Green and blue... Canyons too
Singing about Atlantis love songs
The Valleys of Neptune is arising

Mercury liquid... Emerald's shining
Telling me where I came from
Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he
Lays in... On the Burning
Edge Horizon

I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission...
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam
See the wind make love to all
The ocean... Joy spread and
The massage got home
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets...
Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising

Look out East coast, but you're
Gonna have a neighbor
A rebirth land ...
The praying Burning Sands

We know there were worlds
So much older...
And they shall rise, and
Tell us much more the truth of man

I see visions of sleeping peaks
Erupting...
Releasing all hell that
Will shake the Earth from end to end
And this ain't bad news, good news
Or any news... It's just the truth
Better save your souls while
You can

Singing about the New Valleys
Of the Sunrise... Rainbow clean
The world is gonna be...
Singing about getting ready for the new tide ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising.
