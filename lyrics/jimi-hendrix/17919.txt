Especially the ones that fly you too low.
Come on back to earth, my friend,
Come on back'up with me.
We all been thru the nite time, babe.

With the power of soul anything is possible.

Playing too much with one toy tends to lead
Into the foggy.
It's so groovy to float around, sometimes even

And so slack, lord, ain't no kinda bone in his jelly back.
Floatin' ev'ry day and ev'ry night is a risk, sometimes
The wind ain't right!
