Well I realize that I've been hypnotized, I love your gypsy eyes 
I love your gypsy eyes 
Alright! 


Hey! 
Gypsy. 

Way up in my tree I'm sitting by my fire 
Wond'rin' where in this world might you be 
And knowin' all the time you're still roamin' in the country side 
Do you still think about me? 
Oh my gypsy. 

Well I walked right on to your rebel roadside 
The one that rambles on for a million miles 
Yes I walk down this road searchin' for your love and ah my soul too 
But when I find ya I ain't gonna let go. 

I remember the first time I saw you 
The tears in your eyes look like they're tryin' to say 
Oh little boy you know I could love you 
But first I must make my get away 
Two strange men fightin' to the death over me today 
I'll try to meet cha by the old highway. 
Hey! 

Well I realize that I've been hypnotized, I love your gypsy eyes 
I love your gypsy eyes 
I love your gypsy eyes 
I love your gypsy eyes 
Alright! 

I've been searchin' so long my feet have made me lose the battle 
Down against the road my weary knees they got me 
Off to the side I fall but I hear a sweet call 
My gypsy eyes is comin' and I've been saved. 

Oh I've been saved 
That's why I love you uh 
Said I love you 
Hey! 
Love you uh 
Lord I love you 
Hey!
