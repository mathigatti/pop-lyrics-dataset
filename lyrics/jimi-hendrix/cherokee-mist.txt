he night I was born
Lord the moon turned a fire red
Said the night I was born
Lord the moon turn a fire red
My poor mother cried the gypsy was right
And she fell down ... right down dead
She took me past the outskirts of infinity
Well I..
I made a love to you lil' girl when you'r sleepin
and you felt no pain
I did remember, loved in your dream into that night
and I've seen your smile till stayin'
and I milion miles adventure the way from you that i'm on
Yet, new picture of frame
My arrows are made of desires
From far away as jupiters sulphur mines
My arrows are made of desires
From far away as jupiters sulphur mines
