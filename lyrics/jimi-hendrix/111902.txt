Announcer:
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Jimi Hendrix Experience!"


Jimi:
"I see that we meet again hmmm.
Yeah well, well, well.
Dig, Dig, I'd like to get something strait, we, ummm, we got tired
of the Experience, and every once in a while we're blowing
our minds too much, so we decided to change everything around.
And I call it 'Gypsy Sun and Rainbows' for short nothing but
a 'Band of Gypsys'.
We have Billy Cox playing bass, and, umm,
from Nashville Tennessee we have Lary Lee playing guitar over there,
we got Juma playing congos over there, Juma,
and we have Granny Goose.
Oh I'm sorry Mitch Mitchell on drums over there,
and we got Jerry Velez on congos too.
You got yours truly on Pete Whistle, what me worry?
Gives us about a minute and a half to tune up, O.K?
Like we only had about two rehearsals, so, we'll only do a primary
rhythm thing.
(Someone in the background) I have mine thank you
I have mine thank you, baby."
