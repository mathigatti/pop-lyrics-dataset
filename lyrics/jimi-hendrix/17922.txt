Well I wish I was a catfish
Swimming in, Lord, the deep blue sea
I'd have a, all you pretty women
fishin' after me, fishin' after me
fishin' after me, yeah
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah


When I went down my girlfriends house
And I sat down, Lord, on her front step
And she said a, come in now Jimi
My husband just now left, just now left
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

Well there's two, two trains runnin'
but there's not one, Lord, that's goin' my way
You know there's a one train runnin' at midnight
Other one leave just for a day
leave just for a day
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah
