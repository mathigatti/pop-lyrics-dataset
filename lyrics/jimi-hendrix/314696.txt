Sister moon will be my guide
In your blue blue shadows i would hide
All good people asleep tonight,
I'm all by myself in your silver light
I would gaze at your face the whole night through,
I'd go out of my mind, but for you
Lying in a mother's arms
The primal root of a woman's charms
I'm a stranger to the sun,
My eyes are too weak
How cold is a heart
When it's warmth that he seeks?
You watch every night,
You don't care what i do...
...my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun
My hunger for her explains everything i've done
To howl at the moon the whole night through
And they really don't care if i do...
...sister moon...
