You got me floatin' round and round,
Always up, you never let me down
The amazing thing, you turn me on naturally,
And I kiss you when I please


You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please

You got me floatin' across and through
You make me float right on up to you
There's only one thing I need to really get me there,
Is to hear you laugh without a care

You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please

You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please

Now your Daddy's cool, and your Mamma's no fool,
They both know I'm heads over heels for you,
And when the day melts down into a sleepy red glow,
That's when my desires start to show

You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please
