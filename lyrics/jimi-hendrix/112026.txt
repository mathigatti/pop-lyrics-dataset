You jump in front of my car when you
Know all the time that
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a ride


You're just like (crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you (crosstown traffic)
I don't need to run over you (crosstown traffic)
All you do is slow me down
And I'm tryin' to get on the other side of town

I'm not the only soul accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can see you had your fun but
Darlin' can't you see my signals turn from green to red
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead

You're just like (crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you (crosstown traffic)
I don't need to run over you (crosstown traffic)
All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town

You're just like (crosstown traffic)
Yeah, yeah
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
Look out!
(Crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you

Yeah
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
You're just like, you're just like

You're just like (crosstown traffic)
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
(Crosstown traffic)
(Crosstown traffic)

You're just like (crosstown traffic)
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
You're just like
