It's very far away,
It takes about half a day,
To get there, if we travel by my a.....dragonfly


No, it's not in Spain,
But all the same,
You know,
It's a groovy name
And the wind's just right.

Hang on, My Darling,
Hang on if you want to go
You know it's a really groovy place
And it's just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic.

The clouds are really low,
And they overflow,
With cotton candy
And battle grounds,
Red and brown.

But it's all in your mind,
Don't think your time,
On bad things,
Just float your little mind around.
Look out
Hang on, My Darling, Yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there.

Hang on, My Darling, Yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there.
