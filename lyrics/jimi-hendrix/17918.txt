There's a Red House over yonder
That's where my baby stays
There's a Red House over yonder, baby
That's where my baby stays


Well, I ain't been home to see my baby,
in ninety nine and one half days.
'Bout time I see her,
Wait a minute something's wrong here
The key won't unlock the door.

Wait a minute something's wrong baby,
Lord, have mercy, this key won't unlock this door,
something's goin' on here.
I have a bad bad feeling
that my baby don't live here no more.

That's all right, I still got my guitar
Look out now . . .

I might as well go on back down
go back 'cross yonder over the hill
I might as well go back over yonder
way back over yonder 'cross the hill,
(That's where I came from.)

'Cause if my baby don't love me no more,
I know her sister will
