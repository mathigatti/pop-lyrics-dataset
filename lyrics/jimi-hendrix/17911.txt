Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss the sky


Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Help me, help me
Oh, I don't know

Purple haze was all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You've got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time

Who knows?
Help me, yeah
Come on know
Tell me, tell me
