Hey, baby, where are you coming from?

Well, she looked at me and smiled
And looked into space and said, "I'm coming from the land of the new rising sun"


Then I said, "Hey, baby, where are you trying to go to?"

Then she said, "I'm going to
Spin and spread around peace of mind and a whole lotta love to you and you"

Hey girl I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come along

Would you like to come along? She asked me
Yes, take me along right now
Hey, baby, can I step into your world for a while?

Yes, you can, she said
Come on back with me for a while
We're gonna go across the Jupiter sand and see all you people
one by one
We gotta help you people out right now
That's why I'm doing it all about

Hey! Yeah, may I come along?
May I come along?
May I come along?
Please, take me
