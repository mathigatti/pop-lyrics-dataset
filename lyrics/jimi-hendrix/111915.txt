Rainy day, rain all day 
Ain't no use in gettin' uptight 
Just let it groove its own way 
Let it drain your worries away yeah 
Lay back and groove on a rainy day hey 
Lay back and dream on a rainy day 
Lay back and groove on a rainy day 
Lay back 
Oh yeah ! 


Lay back and groove on a rainy day 
Lay back and groove on a rainy day 
Lay back and dream on a rainy day 
Lay back and groove on a rainy day 
Lay back and dream on a rainy day 
Lay back and, lay back, lay back, lay back and groove. 

Ooh 
Aaaah ! 

Lay back and groove on a rainy day 
Lay back and groove on a rainy day 
Lay back and groove on a rainy day 
Lay back and groove on a rainy day 
Lay back and dream on a rainy day. 

Still rainin' still dreamin'.
