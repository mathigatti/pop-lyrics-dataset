Born under a bad sign,
Been down since i began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
Wouldn't have no luck at all


Bad luck and trouble
Been my only friend
Ive been down ever since i was ten

Born under a bad sign
Been down since i began to crawl
If it wasn't for real bad luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck
I wouldn't  have no luck at all
