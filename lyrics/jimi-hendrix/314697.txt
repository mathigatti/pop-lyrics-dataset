Everyday in the week I'm in a different city
If I stay too long people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog
Talkin' about the clothes I wear
But they don't realise they're the ones who's square


Yeah
And that's why
You can't hold me down
I don't want to be tide down, I gotta move
Hey

I said
Stone free do what I please
Stone free to ride the breeze
Stone free, baby, I can't stay
I got to got to got to get away
Yeah

Listen here, baby
A woman here a woman there try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realise it's so easy to break
Yeah buta sometimes I get a ha
Feel my heart kind a gettin' hot
That's when I got to move before I get caught

So dig this
And the is why, listen to me, baby, you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I gotta move on

I said
Stone free do what I please
Stone free to ride the breeze
Stone free I can't stay
Got to got to got to get away
Yeah
Tear me loose, baby

Hey

Stone free to ride on the breeze
Stone free do what I pleasee
