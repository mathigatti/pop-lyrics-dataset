Well I, I just came back today . . .
 I just came back from the storm.
 Yeah!
 I said: I just came back, baby . . .
 I just came back from the storm.
 Yeah, from the storm.
 Well, I didn't know it then,
 But I was sufferin', sufferin' 
 For my love to keep me warm.
 It was so cold and lonely, yeah.
 The wind 'n' cryin' blue rain 
 Were tearing me up.
 It was so cold and lonely.
 The crying blue rain was tearing me up.
 Oh, tearing me up.
 I wanna thank you my sweet darling
 For digging in the mud and picking me up.
 Thank you so much!
 
 It was a terrible rain that was burning my eyes.
 It was you my love who brought me in.
 I love you so much,
 I'll never stray from you again.
 Hey!
 
 I just came back baby.
 I just came back to get my baby on her way.
 Yeah, yeah.
