Have you ever been (have you ever been) to Electric Ladyland? 
The magic carpet waits for you so don't you be late 
Oh, (I wanna show you) the different emotions 
(I wanna run to) the sounds and motions 
Electric woman waits for you and me 
So it's time we take a ride, we can cast all of your hang-ups over 
the seaside 
While we fly right over the love filled sea 
Look up ahead, I see the loveland, soon you'll understand. 


Make love, make love, make love, make love. 

The angels will spread their wings, spread their wings 
Good and evil lay side by side while electric love penetrates the sky 
Lord, Lord I wanna show you 
Hmm, hmmm, hmmm 
Show you.
