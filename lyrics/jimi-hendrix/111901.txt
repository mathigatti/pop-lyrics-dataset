Well, I stand up next to a mountain
I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
I pick up all the pieces and make an island
Might even raise a little sand


Yeah, hey!
'Cause I'm a voodoo child, voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby

I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'm gonna write back one of these days
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
Write back one of these days
Heya aah heya aah

I don't see you no more in this world
Maybe I'll try the next one don't be late
Don't be late
'Cause I'm a voodoo child, voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby
