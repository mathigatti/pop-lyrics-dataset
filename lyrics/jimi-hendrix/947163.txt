You got me sitting up on the shelf
While you're out bewitching someone else
Do I live, do I die
Do I laugh, do I cry
What game am I supposed to loose this time?


You got chains attached to my head
You spreading magic honey all in your bed
What is it you want?
Just a puppet that talks
Or maybe just a lover who makes love to the dead

Step onto the stage, just a few more minutes
Let's see what kind of juggler you really are
Say without that whip and those bloody boots
Which are rented you actually could become
A morning star
But you rang your last bell
Even your planets, they've gone to hell
And your world turns to nothing but a bubble
In a shotgun jar
And now you don't know who you really are

So instead of trying to make me your slave
Why don't you just call it a day?
Either way I'm gonna win
So save yourself some wind
Don't make me to be the last to see
You to your grave
Well well, ball and chain for sale
New day come, masters gone to hell
Well well, ball and chain for sale
Sunrise come, master's dying in hell
