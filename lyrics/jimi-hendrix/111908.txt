"yeah well a like i said before 
we only ran up a few numbers 
so let me try and do this one 
like we were just 
jammin' at the house 
we don't have a name for yet 
it's just like an instrumental 
so we'll just go along with it.  
it goes somthin' like this."  


"before we go any further 
we'd like to say that you all 
really had a lot of patience
three days worth.  
you've prooved to the world 
what can happen with a little bit 
of  love and sounds.  
oh, i left my girlfriend at home 
i'm sorry.  i'd like to do a thing
that a new american anthem 
until we get another on together.  
this is called 'voodoo child 
(slight return)'."
