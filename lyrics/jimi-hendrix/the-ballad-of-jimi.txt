This is a song dedicated to the memory of my best friend
His name was Jimi


Me and my best friend travelled down life's highway

We talked of how, how things should be
Of peace and love for you and me
Of a life without hate
Of a life filled with love
On that first day, he played my guitar
Somehow I knew, we travelled far
We travelled fine, his distant star
Many things he would try
For he knew soon he'd die
Oh, why did it happen?
All the sadness, he is gone
But he left us something that time can't erase
Now he's loved by us all
Yes, he's loved by us all
That is my story. It has no end
Now Jimi's gone, he's not alone
His memory still lives on
Like the fox that he named
Though they still gained less pain

Five years, this he said
He's not gone, he's just dead
