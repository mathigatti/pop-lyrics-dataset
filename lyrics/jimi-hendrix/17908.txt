Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind
That's running round
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And fairy Tales


That's all she ever thinks about

Riding with the wind

When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free

It's alright, she said
It's alright
Take anything you want from me
You can take anything, anything

Fly on, little wing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, little wing
