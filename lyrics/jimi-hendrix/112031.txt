Golden rose, the color of the dream I had 
 Not too long ago 
 A misty blue and the lilac too 
 A never to grow old. 
 
 A there you were under the tree of song 
 Sleeping so peacefully 
 In your hand a flower played 
 A waiting there for me. 
 
 I have never 
 Laid eyes on you 
 Not like a before 
 This timeless day 
 A but you walked and ya ha 
 Once smiled my name 
 And you stole 
 My heart away 
 A stole my heart away little girl, yeah 
 All right ! 
 
 Golden rose, the color of the dream I had 
 Not too long ago 
 Misty blue and lilac too 
 A never to grow old. 
 
 Golden rose, the color of the dream I had 
 Misty blue and lilac too 
 Golden rose, the color of the dream I had 
 Misty blue and lilac too 
 Gold and rose, gold are rose, gold and rose. 
 
 It's only a dream 
 I'd love to tell somebody about this dream 
 The sky was filled with a thousand stars 
 While the sun kissed the mountains blue 
 And eleven moons played across rainbows 
 Above me and you. 
 Gold and rose the color of the velvet walls surround us.
