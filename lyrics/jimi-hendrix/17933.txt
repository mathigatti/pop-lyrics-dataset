If you can just get your mind together
Then come on across to me
We'll hold hands and then
We'll watch the sunrise
From the bottom of the sea
But first, are you experienced?
Uh-have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have
(Well) I know, I know
You'll probably scream and cry
That your little world won't let you go
But who in your measly little world
Are you tryin' to prove to
That you're made out of gold
And-uh, can't be sold
So-uh, are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have
Uh, let me prove it to you
Yeah


Trumpets and violins
I can hear in the distance
I think they're callin' our name
Maybe now you can't hear them
But you will, ha-ha, if you just
Take hold of my hand
Ohhh, but are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?

Not necessarily stoned
But beautiful
