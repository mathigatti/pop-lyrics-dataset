Is that the stars in the sky or is it the raining fallin' down?
Will it burn me if I touch the sun
so bit, so round?
Will I be truthful, yeah
in choosing you as the one for me?


Is this love baby
or is it-a just confusion?

Oh, my mind is so mixed up, goin' round 'n' round
Must there be all these colors without names
without sounds?
My heart burns with feelin' but
Oh! but my mind is cold and reeling

Is this love, baby
or is it confusion?

Oh, my head is pounding pounding
going 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Must there be all these colors without names
without sounds?

My heart burns with feelin' but
Oh! but my mind is cold and reeling

Is this love, baby
or is it confusion?
