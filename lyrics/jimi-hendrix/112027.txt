Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey 

Look at the sky turn a hell fire red 
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down 
Down, down, down. 


Well I asked my friend where is that black smoke comin' from ? 
He just coughed and changed the subject and said oh wa I think it might 
snow some 
So I left him sippin' his tea an' I jumped in my chariot 
And rode off to see just why and who could it be this time. 

Sisters and brothers daddys mothers standin' 'round cryin' 
When I reached the scene the flames were makin' a ghostly whine 
So I stood on my horse's back an' I screamed without a crack 
I say oh baby why'd you burn your brother's house down ? 

Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! 

Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord 
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down 
Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord 
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down down. 

Well someone stepped from the crowd he was nineteen miles high 
He shouts retired and disgusted so we paint red through the sky 
I said the truth is straight ahead so don't burn yourself instead 
Try to learn instead of burn, hear what I say, yeah, yeah. 

So I fin'ly rode away but I'll never forget that day 
'Cause when I reached the valley I looked way down cross the way 
A giant boat from space landed with eerie grace 
And came and taken all the dead away. 

Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! 

What'd I say. 
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red Lord 
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down 
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red Lord 
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down 
Look at the sky, look at the sky. 

Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Oh baby.
