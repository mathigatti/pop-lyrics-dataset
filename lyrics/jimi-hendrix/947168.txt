Look over yonder here comes the blues...
I can see 'em comin'
Wearing a blue armoured coat...
You're sittin' there with your violins
Hittin' wrong notes...
Look over yonder, he's comin' my way
When he's around,
I never have a happy day (you even bust my guitar strings)


Look over yonder
Well, he's talkin' to my baby
They found my peace pipe on her
Now they're draggin' her away
Lord knows we don't need a devil like him beatin' us around
Well, he's knockin' on my door
Now my house is tumbling down
