She's just a night bird flyin' through the night.
 She's just a night bird making a midnight, midnight flight.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Well she's flyin' down to me, but until tomorrow
 got to set her free, set her free.
 So all we got, baby, is one precious night.
 All we got is one precious night.
 
 Throw off your blues and shoes and things
 and lay it down under the bed.
 Just wrap me up in your beautiful wings,
 better hear what I say.
 Please take me thru your dreams,
 inside your world I want to be.
 Until tomorrow no tears will be shed.
 Hold on till the sun gets out of bed.
 Hold on, hold on, baby.
 Sail on, sail on, sail on.
 Sail on.
