No one knows where she comes from 
Maybe she's a devil in disguise 
I can tell by looking in her eyes. 


Little miss strange 
Little miss strange. 

Little miss strange came into my parlor 
I don't know just what to ask her 
I don't remember what we did after. 

Little miss strange 
Little miss strange. 

Little miss strange came out of the darkness 
Walked across my head, I stood beneath the light 
I'm talkin' 'bout the dream I had the other night. 

Little miss strange 
Little miss strange.
