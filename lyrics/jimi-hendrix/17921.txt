Well I hear my train a comin'
Hear my
Hear my train a comin'


Ay, yeah

Well I wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Take me, take me
Take me away
From this lonesome town
Lonesome town
Too bad you don't love me no more girl
Too bad you people put me down

Tears burnin' me
Tears burnin' me in my eyes
Way down
Way down in my soul
Tears burnin' me way down in my heart, yeah
Too bad you don't love me no more girl
Too bad you and me had to part, had to part

Hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'

Well I hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'
