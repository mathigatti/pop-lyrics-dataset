You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Scratchin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog baby
Scratchin' all the time
You ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine


When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
When they said you was high classed baby
That was just a lie
You ain't never kill a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

Waouhh

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Scratchin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog baby
Scratchin' all the time
You ain't never, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
