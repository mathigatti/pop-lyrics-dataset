Welcome to radio station EXP.
Tonight we are featuring an interview
with a very peculiar looking gentleman
who  goes by  the name  of Mr. Paul
Corusoe on the  dodgy subject of are
there or are there not flying saucers
or UFOs?  Please Mr. Corusoe, please
could you give us your regarded
opinion on this nonsense about
spaceships and even space people?
Mr. Corusoe: Thank you As you well know
you just can't believe everything you
see and hear, can you? Now, if you'll
excuse me, I must be on my way.
Announcer:   Bu...but,but...gulb...I,I,don't belive it
Mr. Corusoe: Pffffttt!!...Pop!!...Bang!!...Etc!!!?
