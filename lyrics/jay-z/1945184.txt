[Beyoncé]
We gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged
I'm 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars


Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
You don't know what we been through to make it this far
So many scars
'Bout to take this whole thing to Mars

[Kanye West]
(Lift off)
Lift off, takin' my coat off
Showin' my tattooes, I'm such a showoff (Huh?)
I feel the pain and then rolled off
I got the whole city, they about to go off
How many niggas wit' me up in the neon?
How many people wanna roll a Neon?
Not givin' you no '99, you know me by now
Know me, know me by now

[Beyoncé]
We gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged
I'm 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars

Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
You don't know what we been through to make it this far
So many scars
'Bout to take this whole thing to Mars
(Lift off, ahh, ahh)

Not givin' you no '99, you know me by now
Know me, know me by now
You know, know me by now
Know me, know me by now

[Jay-Z]
Lift off
Represent, Watch The Throne, nigga'll be pissed off
Earth is boring to 'im, shit is makin' my dick soft
When your every heart is bein' rich and then you hit a big wall
If I fall, 3, 2, we need fuel, lift off

[Beyoncé]
We gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged
I'm 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars

Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
You don't know what we been through to make it this far
So many scars
'Bout to take this whole thing to Mars
