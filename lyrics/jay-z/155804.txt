Uh huh uh, ji ji
Roc-a-Fella y'all
Jigga, Rell, nine-eight edition
This is Roc-a-Fella for life, this is Roc-a-Fella for life
This is Roc-a-Fella for life, this is Roc-a-Fella for life


I play my parts with the honies hard
It's gotten even worse now that the money's washed
Like a letter y'all, the nine-eight find me straight
Good health, can't complain about my financial state
What else? I guess tomorrow knows
I run through chicks like borrowed clothes
I'm the type of nigga your father oppose, never test Jay
You follow the code, ese, on my best day
I'm like God with a blow, bless me

[Rell]
Baby, why are you chasing that man?
Knowing that he can't, love you like I can
I guess you'd rather chase, instead of feeling
what's real inside, I got to thinking
And I hope you realize (all this love for free)
(Better come and get it soon) Hurry hurryahahyyy
(Please, don't take too long) I want your love babe
(Before it's all gone, I just wanna put you on)
The apple of my eye, sweet cherry surprise
Let me up inside, of your body tonight
There's so much that we can do
and I'll do you, know how much I wanna
taste your lovin, so good (all this love for free)
(Better come and get it soon) Hurry baby
(Please, don't take too long) Cause I want your love
(Before it's all gone, I just wanna put you on)
(Hurry hurry hurry, hurry baby cause I can't wait)
(Hurry hurry hurry, cause later on might be too late)
Gotta hurry (Hurry hurry hurry, tell me whatcha gonna do)
(Hurry hurry hurry, there's too many dimes for me to choose)
Baby you got me (got me goin)
Goin round in circles (tell me why)
And I can't explain whyaayiyyy (I need your love)
Can't get enough of your love

[Jay-Z]
Yea yea yea
In the SL with Rell, music at a high decimal
Mami frontin, touchin buttons like she spec-ial
cause she sex well, in the best tell, roca-fella cartel
Excel-ing like Hyundai, Sunday to Sunday
it's for the nachoes, come out the clothes
And baby girl if it's Hammer time, then hide your toes
The game cold like, five below, but once inside the show
we to' it down; about that money, we throw it around
So when the ice hit the sun rays, run for shade
Game's over, we didn't come to play
The fuck y'all thinking??

[Rell]
(You got me going) Round and round in circles
(Tell me why) I can't explain why
(I need your love) Can't get enough of your love
Baby I've got all this love (all this love for free)
(Better come and get it soon) Baby baby baby
(Please don't take too long) I want your love babe
(Before it's all gone, I just wanna put you on)
Can you feel me growing baby
(All this love for free... better come and get it soon...)
