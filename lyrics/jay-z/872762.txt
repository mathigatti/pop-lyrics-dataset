I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same) 
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change)

When the singer Rob calls the police on me y'all niggaz ran out and copped the CD 
see what I discovered is y'all snitch lovers I might speak, but I don't fuck with nobody 
see What Doug, Jimmy &amp; L.A. don't know, these youngins crossed the line with Hov, I'm letting it blow 
had the papers writing stories like: "didn't they know, this what happen when they made that rapper CEO" 
I know, its just a matter of time before the steady hate start to overflow then the leavey breaks 
and my conscience go, you escape the rico, why throw everything away over ego? 
you paper chasing, they paper hating, billionare Hov you on the pace to make it 
fuck that exclamation comma quotations I love drama period 

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same) 
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change) 
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same) 
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change) 

smelling like Petrone singing dirty rap songs, tip-toeing in the crib like 6 in the morn 
every day its the same I said in blueprint that I'd never change its just a part of the game 
respect me I'm a thug, I might cool out for a sec but expect me to bug its in my blood 
but if my chick leave me she gonna leave me for something, she gone leave me cuz Halie, 
she ain't gonna leave me for nothing, picture me gettin up with something sleazy 
something something so easy you could take out its beat like nothing something 
soon as you finish cuttin you like leave me please, not me I need Angilina Jolize company, 
so I ain't gonna make a move unless I got I got a plan b, that'll happen the day i have a baby by free, 
not to say that anything is wrong with free, just to say that ain't nothing wrong with me 
If my hands in the cookie jar, know one thing, ima take the cookie not leave my ring 
if my hands in the cookie jar know one thing ima take (laughs) y'all know what I mean 

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same) 
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change) 
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same) 
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change)
