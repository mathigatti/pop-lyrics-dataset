Uh huh yea, yeah
Guru!
You gotta let it bump
Uh, uh, uh like dat yeah
Come on bring the chorus in


1 - I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

I抎 do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trustin' that
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
My brother from anotha pop, minus one shot
We Neno and G-Money man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us gettin mad, throwin' rocks off the roof
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we're young execs
My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Tah
My nigga Ja, my nigga Gotti
We embody all that抯 right with the world
No matter how pretty she is, you never likin' my girl
That's how we run, when you ain抰 around
I'll spank ya son, keep him in line
If you should die, I抣l keep him like mine
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

I know mama, your little baby
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom for your wisdom for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
"Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them"
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing when my asthma was bad
And my chest was weezin', thanks for the look of love
Just as I was leavin'
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back
That left you grieving'
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As the man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn抰 the life meant for you
You抮e a queen, you deserve the cream
Everything that gleamed, everything that shines
Everything that抯 mine

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Check it out, uh, uh
Dear nephews, I抦 writing' this with no pen or a pad
And I抦 signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look back if you fall and you抮e feeling bad
I抦 right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
If it comes a time when you ain抰 feelin' your real dad
Put my face on his body don抰 wait for nobody
Don抰 follow no nigga, that's hoe shit man
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
The world is yours
Some girls are nice some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew
Do what works for you
Standin' back from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed,
You know my number when it抯 code red if you're wrong my nigga
You抮e my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga

Repeat 1 until fade
