Spoken:

Uhh uhh uhh
You ready B? Let's go get 'em...


Look for me
Young B
Cruisin' down the westside highway
Doin' what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides wit me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is durin' "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie feva, but soon as the show's ova
She's right back to being my souljah
Cuz mami's a rida, and I'm a rolla
Put us togetha, how they gon' stop both us?
Whateva she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B, holla

Chorus:

Jay-Z: All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my
Girlfriend)
Beyonce: Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and My
boyfriend)
Jay-Z: All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my
Girlfriend)
Beyonce: Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and My
boyfriend)


The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
Wit the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nuttin' - if eva you mad about sunntin'
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work wit the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermes Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

Repeat Chorus


Jay-Z:

(Talk to 'em B)


Beyonce:

If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
(take 'em up top)
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothin' will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (one more time)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
