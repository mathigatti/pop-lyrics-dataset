Verse 1:
Ay yo, I got a resolution...This year I'm playing right
No six fifteen this year, you can stay the night
We can go bowling, it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing? I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honeys come to the crib
Thinkin' they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses'
No room service just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil' Debbies and when your done get ready
The chicks I was fiendin' to smash
Let 'em lean on the cash, will take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that playa shit
I need a chick that practice Tai Chi...that still can buy weed
And can give me some good head, and I'll make her a mind me
You hear me?

(Hey papi)
[Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going
(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow, they sayin]

Verse 2:
I was the worse...I use to switch chicks every day
Had niggas mad for real like, "I wish he was gay"
Cause they knew...sooner or later hun was gettin' with Jay
Just a...matter of time she was gettin' with Jay
I'll have your chick in the summer tropics sippin' on 'zae
Spittin' up in the Pacifics smoking spliffs in the shade
She used to love ya, but she feeling different today
You used to smother her, look at your honey slippin' away
Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
She said...she feel free when she's around me
I'm letting her do her and in turn she's doing me
She on the phone with her friends like how cool is he

[Verse 3]
I was nice to girls, but that wasn't the Shawn they felt
They said the Coupe was alright, but they didn't like the seat
belts
I looked tight...they told me "Loosen up", run a
couple of lights
Spank'em, pull their hair...just don't treat'em so nice
Left me confused, I messed wit chicks that was best when abused
Nice guys finish last wit they special set of rules
And me?  I over did it.  All chovanistic, would treat'em...so
vicious
Would stroke...but won't kiss it, but now...I'm tryna flow
different
I'm tryna cool it now. I'm tryna plant a seed, start a new
addition
I'm sick of chasin chickens...
Sick of every other...city we go...same ol' hoes
