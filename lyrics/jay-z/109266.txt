You gonna need a vocal here right?

Motherfuckers wanna act loco, hit 'em wit', numerous
shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots runnin' to the Po-Po's, smoke 'em like cocoa
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck dat, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshittin', glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin' shocked when the bullet hit
And hey ma, how you, know nigga'z wanna buy you
But see me I wanna fuck for free, like Akinyele
Take this ride 'til you feel it inside ya belly
If it's tight get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, 'til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me

I am
A little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everybody can see these scars
I am
What I want you to want what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
So I
Let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here cause your all that I've got

Got a condo with nuttin' but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowin' on my last cassette?
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin a tec, never jam though
Never get high, never run out of ammo
Nigga'z hatin' 'n' shit cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're, actin' raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your hoe, wanna marry your hoe
Now she's mad at me, cause your majesty, just happened to be
A pimp with a tragedy
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked her friend
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said
"Shit there's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!"

I am
A little bit insecure a little unconfident
Cause you don't understand I do what I can
But sometimes I don't make sense
I am
What you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you
For once just to hear me out
So I
Let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

Now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
