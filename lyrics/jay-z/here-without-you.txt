Most incredible baby...

Good dude, I know you love me like quick food,
Even though a nigga gotta move like a cool dude,
We was together on the block since we lunch,
We shoulda been together havin' 4 seasons brunch,
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather,
But now we travel 1st class to change the forecast,
Never in bunches, Just me and you,
I loved your point of view 'cause you eld me on hunches,
But still I left you for months on end,
It's been months since I checked back in,
We're somewhere in a small town,
So we're lockin' 'em all down,
Woodgreens, Four chains, Armor, War now,
I could understand why you wanted the boss now,
Though I can't let you know it, Pride won't let me show it,
Pretend to be heroic, That's just one to grow it,
But deep inside a nigga so sick!

A hundred days have made me older, Since the last time that I saw your pretty face,
A thousand lies have made me colder, And I don't think I can look at this the same,
But all the miles that seperate,
That disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face,
I'm here without you baby,
But you're still on my lonley mind,
I think about you baby,
And I dream about you all the time,
I'm here without you baby,
But you're still with me in my dreams,
And tonight, It's only you and me!

Her face was stone with shock on the other end of the phone,
"Word back home is that: 'You had a special friend'",
'Till: "What was: 'Oh so special' than?",
You were givin' away without gettin' at me,
That's your fault, How many times have you forgivin' me?,
How was I to know you was plain sick of me?,
I know the way a nigga livin' was whack,
But you don't get a nigga back like that,
Shit, I'm a man of pride, You don't do shit like that,
You don't just pick up and leave, and leave me sick like that,
You don't throw away what we had, Just like that,
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back,
They say: "You can't turn a bad girl good,
But once a good girl's gone bad, She's gone forever",
I mourn forever,
Shit, I gotta live with the fact I did you wrong forever!
