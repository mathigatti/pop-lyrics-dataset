[Chorus]
Everyday a star is born [J. Cole]
Clap for em, clap for em, clap for em [Jay-Z]
Everyday a star is born [J. Cole]
Clap for em, clap for em, clap for em [Jay-Z]
Hey,


[Jay-Z]
I seen MA$E do it, I seen Ye do it,
X came through, caught lighter fluid,
Still i came through it,
clap for em,
but I'm the blueprint,
I'm like the map for em,
I dropped another classic,
Made Puff pass it,
nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it,
Wayne scorching, I'll applaud him,
if he keep going, pass the torch to him,
50 came through like hurricanes do,
I thought I'd finish his ass at summerjam too,
I had the Illmatic on bootleg,
sh-t was so ahead, thought we was all dead,
Wayne did a millie, 50 did a millie,
Ye too, but what Em did was silly,
the white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him,
his flow on Renegade, f-cking awesome,
Applaud him,

[Chorus]

Snoop Dogg did, Nelly came down,
The Face Mob, kept it ghetto for the H town.
Luda moved digits after he moved b-tches,
Drake's up next, see what he do with it,
Rule had a run, couple movie parts,
T.I literally wanted to shoot up the charts,
Wat up Jeezy, wat it do,
ya remind me of us in early '92,
Outcast landed, 3 thou was ill,
like a male version of Lauren Hill,
Mobb Deep shook it but Prodigy took it a lil too far,
can't f-ck with Brooklyn,
Wu-Tang gang bang, Meth ate,
Rae' took on the date with the Purple Tape.
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface,
they had a hell of a run,
standing Ovate, ayyy,

[Chorus]

And I am one of one,
can't you see just along my front,
My brain new lou sun shine
been a star since i was back in one time,
one time give it up for him,
December 4th a star was born,
Clap for him,
he went from moving that corner
to this corner office is so enormous,
Hey, Pres Carter,
Watch him get a Monica on all day,
Hey,
got so many monikers but only 1 Jay
they come they go,
some real some faux,
some friends some hoes
but no i goes nowhere this Hov,

[Chorus]

[J. Cole]
And could i be a star,
does fame in this game have to change who you are,
or could i be the same one who came from a far away life,
just to make it in this broadway lights,
now shining in the broad day, light, go figure,
a slow transition from a lil broke n-gga from the Ville,
Got a deal a real life saver,
dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada,
i chill now a lil ice later, Cole you got a glow like a lil lightsaber,
so clap for him, then applaud Hov, he gave em a plat for him,
flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him,
no sir,
the flow cold as a shoulder of a gold digging hoes when a broke n-gga approaches,
told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muthf-ckers soak it in,

[Chorus]
[End]
