(50 Cent):
Man I told ya'll 
I was finnin' 
To blow like C4
Stunt in the G5 
Fly in the G4
G Unit footwear 
G Unit apparell
I'm so hood
That green 
And that white 
Looks so good
Hip Hop man 
We gon take it 
To the next level
Kicks match that hat 
And that throwback
Kicks stay color 
Coordinated man 
You know that
Truth is 
I ain't got a jump 
Shot but 
I got a left hook
I don't swing golf clubs 
But I sell 
Like Golf Brooks
I'm hot man
I rocky rock man
If it ain't the G Unit 
It's the S Dot man


(Jay-Z):
S. Dots takin' off 
G4s 'bout to land
See how we cross brand
We boss about it man
Got the sole 
Of the old Guccis 
If you upset sue me
If not sit back 
And watch me do me
Parking lot pimpin' 
Sideline ballers
We don't sweat up we fresh 
Let the girls do it for us
The watch talk for me
Drop talk for he
Brand new S Dots 
Walk with me
Sort of like you 
Just scored a bucket
Bootlegger you frontin' you 
Walkin' awkardly
Ho it's nothing 
Keep score with me
Give me three hot seconds
I'll bring heat rock records
