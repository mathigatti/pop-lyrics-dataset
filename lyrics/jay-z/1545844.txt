Welcome,
To tha,
Future
Hey count me in
Find me a nice soft place to land
I'm so high
Find me a place to land
Yeah
Right there
Yeah


(Verse 1)
I'm so tomorrow, they order mines on yesterday
Which means you on-time than late
So even if I slow it down,
My sound is fast forward
Hold up
I'm just a runway show
But I wear this on my plane in these my runway clothes
Cashmire sweats
They come out next year, but they my last year sweats
And my hoe's so sick,
Your new chick can't fuck with my old bitch
And you know this shit,
I'm professional, they know this is
I just may let you borrow this,
This the Blueprint nigga follow this
This is what what tomorrow is,
Welcome to tomorrow Bitch

Whatever you about to discover We off that
You about to tell her you love it, we off that
Always want to fight in the club and we off that
But you can't bring the future back
Ya'll steady chasing the fame, we off that
Oversize clothes and the chains, we off that
Niggas still makin' it rain and we off that
But you can't bring the future back

Tell them hatas get off me
Chris we off that
Timbs we off that
Rims we off that

Jay-Z
Yeah we off that

And we still making money
Cuz we still on that

(Verse 2)
Say black versus white, my niggas we off that
Please tell Bill O'Reilly to fall back
Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls
This 2010 ain't 1864
Yeah we come so far
So I drive around town hard top and it's off
And my trop at the loft with my high brow Ah and my high yellow broad
And my dark skin sense and my best white mate say what's up to Chris
Hows that for a mix
Got a black president, got green presidents
Blue prints in my white iPod
Black diamonds in my Jesus piece, my God
We ain't tripping off that
This is a Benetton ad, nigga been up off that

(Verse 3)
I don't give a fidduck, abbibout the riddate
You used to move, what you used to do
And I don't give a fidduck abbibout the bitches
That you used to screw but your future do
And we don't really care what you used to say
Unless that effects your future pay
I'm on a practice field running two-a-days
So I don't drop the ball when it's threw my way
I don't give a fidduck, abbibout the shit that
You probably did who you probably is
The only time I deal in past tense
Is I'm past rims and I'm past tints
If you driving it, I drove it,
If you got it, cause I sold it
You copped it, I bought it back
We don't give a fidduck Nigga we off that
