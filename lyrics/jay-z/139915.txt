[Intro: Jay-Z]
Uh, its the boy Jay-Z, and the boy R. Kel
The best of both worlds, please believe it
Brookland, Chi-Town, to all the beautiful ladies in the world
Dedicated to TT my niece, everybody in the world, talk to 'em Kel
That's right, Tone this is mean and vicious man, so mean and vicious
Rockland, Roc-a-Fella, the best of both worlds, come on


[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Lord forgive me I'm ballin' out of control
Got the spirit of a hustler pouring out of my soul
Mami I love you but ain't no stopping my stroll
If you wanna be down with me you gotta rooolll
Like a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold
You gotta know that I'm out chasin' doooough
I'm ain't stunting these hoes
Stunting my growth if I fuck 'em I'm fleeing them
I need something to hold
Then I'm home to you
I might roam like a cellular phone
But I never leave you alone I
Solemnly swear, I was married to the block before I met you
It's still a part of me there but I
Solemnly swear, I try but it's in my blood
Pumping yay since I was yay high
I'm in love with the life
So except me for the bastard that I am
You're still in love with me right?

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Baby I can't figure it out
Said you pussy tastes like honey
But I can't stop huggin' the block
All night tryna get this money

Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gonna do with both these girls
Two main squeezes in separate cities
Both found out man, shit ain't pretty
Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gonna do with both these girls
Hard to choose between her and these streets
Cuz the game keeps calling me

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock
I would often find I was off my block
Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot
They never thought that a pause or stop
Was in my pores to push rock raw
Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low
Like a one against the grain
Got the sun against my brain
A girl in my ear
I like her for her
I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her
Sometimes I can't figure it out
I'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out
She know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house
Lock down while his niggas is out (out)

[Chorus X2]
