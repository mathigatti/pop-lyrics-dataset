Give the drummer some
I already gave the summer some
It's the winter's turn
Hovie hov is the coldest
I'm just getting better with time
I'm like opusâ€¦One
Young, no two alike like a snowflake
Ok, show me what you got, baby
Words is slurring engine purring
Mami frontin but I'm so determined
Shots of patron now she's in a zone
I ain't talking about the 2-3
Mami in the zone like the homie 2-3
Jordan or James
Makes no difference, boo I'm ballin the same
I am the Mike Jordan of recording
You might want to fallback from recording
But you right it's not important
So it forced him to go for the hype
For being brave and they applaud him
Well misery I will assure them
Ah, baby, just ignore them
Truth or dare mami listen and learn
I got a drop I just took off the top
It's your turn

Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

H.o.v.a
Gold bottles of that ace of spade
Why even fool with these other guys? They all stingy
All these dudes know how to say is 'gimmie'
Gimmie some ass, gimmie some brain
Gimmie your number, gimmie your name
But if I get one night baby girl I swear
I'll make you tell these other dudes gimmie got you here
I'll take you shopping, take long trips
I'll take the cork off, you can take sips
I'll take you there, take my time
Take you clothes off, I'll take off mine
Ma, show me what you got
Hovie in the spot tried to told you I was hot
Tell these other dudes it's a wrap
Get the fuck out the thrown you clone
The king's back!
