[Chorus] - [Kid Cudi]
Oh, They want me to fall (fall)
Fall from the top (top)
They want me to drop (drop)
They want me to stop (stop)
They want me to go (go)

[Jay Z] - [Verse 1]
These niggas want me to go
Don?t they know that I'm gone
They know I'm space shuttle level
They need oxyg-g-g-gen
Don't they know that they boring?
Don?t they know that I yawn?
Only time they exciting is when they mentioning Shawn
Seen Single White Female when she dyed her hair
blonde?
Sometimes I look at these rappers
The movie remind me of them
Somebody turn these boys off
Don't they know that I'm on
Can't they see that it's foolish to try and kill me with songs
What the fuck are they Lauryn
They killing me softly
You talk me to death, only thing you can do to him
I open the door for them, what else can I do
These niggas want me to walk for them
Somebody talk to them
Before I go off on them

[Chorus] - [Kid Cudi]
Oh, They want me to fall (fall)
Fall from the top (top)
They want me to drop (drop)
They want me to stop (stop)
They want me to go (go)

The shit that I'm on (hey)
I'm already home

[Jay Z]
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home

[Jay Z] - [Verse 2]
I taught 'em 'bout fish scale, they want me to fish for them
They want me to catch clean then cook up a dish for them
All of this just for them,
Or they got a diss for him
They want me to disappear
Like it's gone do shit for them
They say that I'm in the way
They want me to sit with them
But what they admitting is they aint got shit for him
And really the fact is, we not in the same bracket
Not in the same league
Don't shoot at the same baskets
Don't pay the same taxes,
Hang with the same bitches
So how am I in the way, what is it I'm missing?
Nigga I been missing
Nigga I been gone
The shit that you just witnessesing I been on
And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it
Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it
Now these niggas is mad,
Oh they call me a Camel
But I mastered the drought, what the fuck I'm an
animal
Half man half mammal
My sign is a Sadge
This is just what I planned to do
Oh don't be mad

[Kid Cudi] - [Chorus]
Oh, They want me to fall (fall)
Fall from the top (top)
They want me to drop (drop)
They want me to stop (stop)
They want me to go (go)
I'm already gone (already)
The shit that I'm on (hey)
I'm already home

[Jay Z]
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home

[Jay Z] - [Verse 3]
