[intro]
Smoke somethin, bitch
Ugk, hold up, talkin bout, uhh


[pimp c]
Pimp c p.a. trill nigga
Polo fuck that hilfiger
Made myself a ghetto star
On the slab, sippin barre
Smokin weed, sellin white
Them other niggaz shit don't come back right
That's how niggaz get popped
Trying to get the cheaper price
Watch yo' paper, guard your life
Cause most these niggaz ain't livin right
Keep yo' pistol, fuck a fight
Cause niggaz out here jack every night
I keep my mind on my money nigga fuck the fame
Big face hun'erds, keepin the game
Hittin the corner in the candy thang
Sittin on leather, grippin the grain

[chorus: z-ro + (young jeezy)]
Good weed, good drink, big money, we - (aye!)
Rollin in somethin' foreign, i'm leather grippin grain (yeeeah!)
I handle my business so i think i deserve to get throwed, throwed

[bun b]
Well i came in the door, i said it befo'
I never fuck a hoe without head no more
I never pull up in nuttin less than a four
And i smoke cigars, it ain't just for the show
I'm blessed from the do', and known for my stidile
I send a nigga baby mamma home with a smidile
You can have the bitch nigga, i ain't sending men out
Smoke weed and freestyle, no instrumental
Been out, lived through the wicked streets of p.a.
Motherfuck the judge, prosecutor and the da
Head to the h, where the hoes will fuck three way
Two way, four way, anyway the pro say
Never hear a hoe say no i won't, no i can't
Stop it and no i don't
Cause a bitch know that i might just explode
And slap her in the face with a pie a la mode
Cause a nigga gettin throwed

[chorus - repeat 2x]

[young jeezy]
You already know what it is, nigga
Snowman, 16 5 a piece, nigga usda
I grind hard (grind hard) and play harder (play harder)
Break out the pot (yup) heat up the water (damn!)
Swear to god the minivan do tricks
Hit the bricks hit the lions and wow, there go them bricks
Slide through the hood (hood!) sittin on some big wheels
Niggaz coppin white and turn flips like cartwheels
Trapstar, my nextel chirp all day (aye!)
Ridin' dirty, three nines and a four way (g-yeeeah!)

[chorus]

[jay-z]
Big money, mayn - we only ride the best
This one and only, big homey
Tried to told you i'm thug, ha

So far i'm tourin on foreign land
Worldwide i'm known for the arm &amp; hamm-
-er, murder the streets i'm a wanted man
(but the flow's like dope) so it's on again
Started with the block, hit it brick by brick
Then i charted with the roc nigga, hit by hit
I'm retarded with the glock nigga, clip by clip
The competition is none, they deceased to exist
Let it breathe a little bit
He's off his rocker, he's a lil schitz'
Roll like a football, hov' used to cook raw
Now i got the game sewn like granny's good shawl
Sure, y'all niggaz want war
Y'all got it backwards, y'all should want raw
Y'all should want more (and more, and more - uhh!)

[chorus - repeat 2x]
