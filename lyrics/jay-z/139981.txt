[talking] 
Uhh uhh uhh. 
You ready B? Let's go get 'em... 
[Verse 1: Jay-Z] 
Look for me! Young, B 
Cruisin down the westside - high, way 
Doing what we like to do - our, way 
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason 
all of my dates been blind dates 
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me 
I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin the wheel, it's true to theheart 
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney 
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City" 
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over 
She's right back to being my soldier 
Cuz mami's a rider, and I'm a roller 
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us? 
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder 
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused 
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be 
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B 
[Chorus] 
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend (meand my girlfriend) 
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend(me and my boyfriend) 
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend (meand my girlfriend) 
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend(me and my boyfriend) 
[Verse 2: Jay-Z] 
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin 
with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin 
Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin 
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that 
I don't be at, places where we comfy at 
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that 
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid 
I keep you workin at Kermain, Burkin bag(?) 
Winolo (?), Timbs, aviator lens 
600 drops, Mercedes Benz 
The only time you wear Burberry to swim 
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him 
She do anything necessary for him 
And I do anything necessary for her 
so don't let the necessary occur, yep! 
[Chorus] 
[Beyonce] 
(Talk to 'em B) 
If I was your girlfried 
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you 
Even if it's somebody (?) 
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em) 
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be 
And so I put this on my life 
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us 
And I promise I'll give my life 
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend 
Put this on my life 
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in 
I promise I'll give my life 
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend 
[Chorus]
