(Verse 1)
I'm so tomorrow, they order mines on yesterday
which means you on-time than late
So even if I slow it down,
My sound is fast forward
Hold up
I'm just a runway show
But I wear this on my plane these my runway clothes
Cashmire sweats
They come out next year, but they my last year sweats
And my hoe's so sick,
Your new chick can't fuck with my old bitch
And you know this shit,
I'm professional, they know this is
I just may let you borrow this,
This the Blueprint nigga follow this
This is what what tomorrow is,
Welcome to tomorrow Bitch

Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls
This 2010 ain't 1864
Yeah we come so far
So I drive around town hard top and its off
And my trop at the loft with my high brow Ah and my high yellow broad
And my dark skin sense and my best white mate say whats up to Chris
Hows that for a mix
Got a black president, got green presidents
Blue prints in my white iPod
Black diamonds in my Jesus piece, my God

This is a Benetton ad, nigga betta fault that

(Verse 3)
I dont give a fidduck, abbibout the riddate
you used to move, what you used to do
And i dont give a fidduck abbibout the bitches
that you used to screw but your future do
And we dont really care what you used to say
unless that effects your future pay
Im on a pratice field running two-a-days
so i dont drop the ball when its threw my way
I dont give a fidduck, abbibout the shit that
you probably did who you probably is
The only time i deal in past tense
is im past rims and im past tints
If you driving it, i drove it,
if you got it, cause i sold it
you copped it, i bought it back
we dont give a ffidduck Nigga we off that
