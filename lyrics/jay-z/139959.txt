Verse1:
I got myself a gun
Brooklyn, stand up
I got myself a gun

I aint gotta two-way you gays
this is not beef/this is rap hommie/i dont have a scratch on me
you feel Jay soft/rip jay off/damn im only worth over a hundred million
look/i got beef with like a hundred children
niggaz with pink suits/tryin to get cute
you a little outta line hommie/dont let the 9 hommie/ put ya out ya mind hommie/bitch keep tryin hommie
kick yo little lies/ i kick my real facts

we wasnt chasin you/we had a tape and too/we came through to do our little one, two thang
It wasnt a rockafella come through thing/if it was on like that/why would i come through Queens
Yo, ya'll Queens nigga know how I do/ i got mo' shooters in Queens Bridge than u
Niggaz'll(niggaz will) tie you up on the Colloseum roof/and open beer bottles off ya boy's chipped tooth
Look Here, Chorus:

(Nas Voice:)
I dont give a fuck All I really know is that yo hoe wants to be with me
she aint playin/believe what im sayin Verse 3:
Me and tha boy A.I.* got more in Common* than just ballin and rhymin
Get It?/More in COMMON
I came in ya Bentley backseat/skeeted in Jeep/left condoms in tha baby seat
Here nigga/tha gloves is off/the love is done/its whateva, wheneva, howeva/nigga "1"
And since you infatuated with sayin tha gay shit/yes u was kissin my dick when u was kissin that bitch/crazy bitch
you thought i was boning her back/called a hundred times ,while i was boning her neck
You got a baby by that broad/you cant disown her yet
when does ya lies end?/when does the truth begin?
when does reality set it?/or does it not matter
gotta hurt that im ya baby mama's favorite rapper
and ask your current girl/she know whats up/ holla at a real nigga
(Nas Voice:)
I dont give a fuck All I really know is that yo hoe wants to be with me
she aint playin/believe what im sayin
