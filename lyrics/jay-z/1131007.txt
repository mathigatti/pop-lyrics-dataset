(Chorus)
i know i shouldnt did that
i know it's gon' come right back
i know it's gon' destroy everything i made
it's probably gon' get you boys sent away
but this game i play aint no way to fix it
it's inevidable and im


(verse 1)
said that i would've stop be-fore i even started
when i get to one brick, than the game i would depart with
got to one brick then i looked to the sky
like, sorry God i lied but give me one more try
got to two bricks new cars new whips
but, niggas never learn 'till they end up in the news clip
the irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
guess theres two sides to what, substance abuse is
can't stop won't stop innocents new shit
brand new convertables im so roofless
front row fight night see how big my tube is
f**k HD nigga see how clear my view is {Fallin'}
but theres a price for over duing it
doing it this big'll put you on the map
stick up kids is house attacks
plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back
dahm

(chorus)
i know i shouldnt did that
i know it's gon' come right back
i know it's gon' destroy everything i made
it's probably gon' get you boys sent away
but this game i play aint no way to fix it
it's inevidable

(Verse 2)
now your {falling} when you should've fell back
now your {falling} right into they lap
fallin they applaud and they screaming at the screen
dahm you f**ked up like their favorite movie scene
Godfather, Good Fellas, Scarface, Casino
you've seen what that last run did to Deniro
when he can't beat the odds can't seek the card
can't blow too hard life's a deck of cards
now your tumbling is humbling you fall and your mumbling
under your breathe like you knew this day was coming {falling}
now lets pray that arm candy that you left you eX for a stay down'll come in handy
cause come january it gets cold and your letters start to slow and your conversary's low
when your lawyer screems appeal only thinking 'bout a bill
and your chances are a mil dahm gravity's ill

(chorus)
i know i shouldnt did that
i know it's gon' come right back
i know it's gon' destroy everything i made
it's probably gon' get you boys sent away
but this game i play aint no way to fix it
it's inevidable

(Verse 3)
but your {falling} and you cant get up
all you do is push up, pull up sit up
lock down the town now belongs to the squares
who said they won't make the same mistakes that got you there
and your arm candy sweet on 'em and the woman
that you left with is ever got a college degree coming
bad news keeps coming hard to keep something on your stomache
your sick 'bout what you life is be-coming {falling}
but you use to has beens bragging bad 'bout all the new grooves talking stuff on the youtube
'bout what you use to do, but thats old school
to the new crew they doing numbers like soduku
build a new you, and it's dahm near inevidable they'll expirience deja vu too
fight and you'll never survive, run and you'll never escape
so just fall for grace

(chorus)
i know i shouldnt did that
i know it's gon' come right back
i know it's gon' destroy everything i made
it's probably gon' get you boys sent away
but this game i play aint no way to fix it
it's inevidable and im
