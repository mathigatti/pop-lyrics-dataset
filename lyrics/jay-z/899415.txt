ANYTHING (FEAT. USHER, PHARRELL) 
Jay-Z


[Chorus Usher &amp; Pharrell] 


Anything you want girl 
I'll bet you never seen it like this 
Just stay up on that floor girl 
And I'll grant all your wishes 
You know, you know, you know, 
You know, you know, you know, 
You hot 
Especially when you bounce, bounce 
I really like it when you bounce, bounce 


[Verse One] 


Ooh you so nasty 
Amateur pole dancing 
Come and get this cash from me 
They call me rain man 
She tried to rain dance 
Money so long it will drown you girl 
Buried under so much stacks 
They had to pull back about 50 thou 
Before they found ya girl 
I brought book bags of that bankroll 
I'm a D boy baby they know 
I'm an original D boy 
They go bankrupt if they try to keep up 
No roof in my car but I got mirrors on the ceiling 
I'll spread bread on the bed 
Ever had sex on a million 
Tell me 

[Chorus] 


[Verse Two] 

Red light, TLC 
Through the left eye 
My POV 
On the eye chat 
How's that for computer love 
She rolled her eyes back 
I'm like ooh you're so nasty 
You turned my Maybach back seat 
Into the Hotel De'Paris 
I ain't gotta go 
Down to the go-go 
You got a private show that's like magic city 
I got stacks of fifties 
I got piles of hundreds 
That's role play 
Act like you want it 
You know you know you hot like fire 
You throw that body 
I'll throw them dollars 
But not them 1's and not no 5's 
Have you ever seen a Grover Cleveland? 
That's a thousand dollars 


[Chorus] 


[Verse Three] 


Girl 
You know 
You hot like fire 
As I blow some dough 
You might retire 
Take it slow like Ne-Yo 
When shots was fired 
In the Matrix have patience 
Got lots of bottles 
Rock-a-bye baby JAY-Z got notes like Mariah 
Got no 1's got no 5's 
My D notes are higher 
I'm a D boy, they decoys 
They money is lighter 
Like Nicole Richie 
Come with me 
They on the diet baby 

[Chorus 2x]
