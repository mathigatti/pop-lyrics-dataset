[Intro]
Have you ever?
Have you ever?


[Hook: X2]
Have you ever been to heaven? Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bow down to your highness? And do you know how heaven taste?
Lie me down

[Verse 1]
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head - this is god body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding - we just want our equality
Food, clothing, shelter - help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in the streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming illuminati
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2, how the fuck he fit in a new bugatti?
Aw fuck it you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic I be out in marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a diablo yellow shit
Color of jello-o shit
Hello bitch, it's me again
Fresh in my easter clothes feeling like Jesus and

[Hook: 2x]

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion

[Verse 2]
Getting ghost in the ghost
Can you see me?
Can you see me?
Have mercy on a judas, angels wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division
Like my maybach partition n
God is my chauffeur

Boy they loves hova
From the south side of chi
To brooklyn where I growed up I confess
God in the flesh
Live among the serpents
Turn arenas into churches
I'm like michael recycle, these are not 16s
These are verses from bible
Tell the preacher he's a preacher
I'm a motherfucking prophet, smoke a tree of knowledge
Drink from a gold chalice, you gotta love it
I arrive at pearly gates, I had luggage
Meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only god could judge us, motherfuckers

[Hook: 2x]
