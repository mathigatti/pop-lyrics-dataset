Uh huh yea yea
Duro!, you gotta let it bump
Uh uh uh like that yea
Come on, Bring the chorus in


[chorus]
I'd risk everything
Oh, i'd risk everything
Yes i'd do anything, anything
Anything for you

I do a bid
loose a rib
Bust a cap
trustin' that
Run up the heaven doors
exchange my life for yours
Leave a steak out the door
mi casa, su casa
Just remembered to turn the lights off in the hall
My brother from anotha pop
minus one shot
We need em for G-Money man
we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes
stoppin' us from playin' hoops 
And us gettin mad
throwin' rocks off the roof 
Straight thuggin' man
i thought we would never progress
But look at us now man
we're young execs 
My nigga Dame
my nigga Biggs
my nigga Tah
my nigga Ja
my nigga Gotti
we're the body
oh its right with the world 
No matter how pretty she is
you never likin' my girl
That's how we run
when you aint around 
I'll spank ya son
keep him line
If you should die
i'll keep him like mine
God forbid
keep this in mind
my nigga

[chorus] x2
I'd risk everything
Oh, i'd risk everything
Yes i'd do anything, anything
Anything for you

Mama's lil baby
but these streets raised me crazy
Product of my enviroment
nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me
bloom for your wisdom for your womb
For the roof over my head
for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said:
"Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achievethem"
Thanks for the days you kept me breathin'
when my asthma was bad and my chest was weezin'
Thanks for the look of love
Just as i was leavin'
some nights, you thought that i wouldn't come back
I left you grievin'
thanks for holdin' down the household
When times were bad
as a man, i apoligize for my dad
When the rent was due
you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasnt the life meant for you
your a queen
you deserve the cream
everything that gleams
everything that shines 
Everything thats mine

[chorus] x2
I'd risk everything
Oh, i'd risk everything
Yes i'd do anything, anything
Anything for you

Dear nephews
i'm writin' this, wit no pen or a pad
And i'm signin' it
ya uncle, ya bestfriend, and ya dad
Don't look at before when your feelin' bad
i'm righ there
For when you cut to when you peelin' a scab
if it comes a time
And you aint feelin' your real dad
put my face on his body
Dont wait for nobody
Don't follow no nigga
that's hoe shit man 
Stand on your own two
Do your shit man
the world is yours
Some girls are nice
Some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew 
Do what works for you
standin' back away from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass
then you wait on there ass
Bite your tongue for no one
and whatever is said take it 
how they want
a closed mouth don't get fed
ou know my number when it's code red
or if you're wrong, my nigga 
Your my nephew
fuck it we get it on my lil nigga

[chorus] x4 
I'd risk everything
Oh, i'd risk everything
Yes i'd do anything, anything
Anything for you
