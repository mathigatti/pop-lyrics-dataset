Dear summer 
I know you gon' miss me
For we been together 
Like Nike Airs 
And crisp tees
S dots with polo fleeces
Purple label shit 
With the logo secret
Gimme couple years 
Shit I might just sneak in
A couple words 
And like peaches and herb
We'll be reunited 
And it feels so hood
Have the whole world saying 
"How you still so good?"
Well I do this 
In my slumber summer
I ain't none of these 
Half-assed newcomers
You know how I do summer
I drop heat 
When you bring the sun up
The combo 
Make niggaz act up 
I pick the gun up
Niggaz back up 
They know 
I'm not no fronter
I don't talk shit 
I just flip it +Un+ ya
Sorry Lance 
I'm just trying 
To advance my quotes
I ain't making you 
The butt of my jokes
But let's not stray 
Ffrom what I came to say
To my beloved 
Think we need 
Some time away
They say if you love it 
You should 
Let it out it's cage
And fuck it 
If it comes back
You know 
It's there to stay
It's tugging 
At my heart 
But this time 
Apart is needed
From the public 
Who should've gave me 
The pulitz'
Instead gave me 
They ass to kiss
But you know me 
Thugging 'til 
The casket dips
But still shine light 
Down on all my peers
I know they weird 
Some queer 
I still want them to share
And all the success 
I received 
I know you can't believe
I still love 'em 
But they don't love me
They like the drunk 
Uncle in your family
You know they lame 
You feel ashamed 
But you love 'em the same
It's like when niggaz 
Make subliminal records
If it ain't directed 
Directly at me 
I don't respect it
You don't really want it 
With Hov, for the record
I put a couple 
Careers on hold 
You could be next kid
Keep entering the danger zone
You gon' make that boy 
Hov put your name in a song
If you that hungry for fame 
Motherfucker c'mon
Say when 
Take ten paces and spin
But on another note 
'Bout to take another vaca'
On another boat 
Goddamn a motherfucker rode
His way out the hood
And I pray 
That I stay out for good
But any day 
You know a nigga could
Try and play like he Suge 
Then I gotta play 
Like Dutch Schultz
You pass the dutchie 
I blast you, trust me
Niggaz can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood you lucky 
I got a good groove
And I ain't trying 
To fuck my thing up
But I will lay down 
A couple green bucks
Get you cleaned up
Now I'm Pulp Fiction 
Colt four-fifth and
Young niggaz 
That blast for me
Blasphemy, no religion


Fala:
Listen here summer baby 
I just believe 
It's the right thing to do
I got a brand new bitch 
Corporate America
She showing me 
A lot of action right now
And I know you put me 
On my feet and all, but
I mean 
It's time for me to grow
You gotta let me go baby 
You gotta let me go

I'm done for now 
So one for now
Possibly forever 
We had fun together
But like all good things 
We must come to an end
Please show the same love 
To my friends
Dear summer
