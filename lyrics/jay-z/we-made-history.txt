Now that all the smoke is gone(lighter)
And the battle finally rise(give me a lighter)
Victory's finally ours (lighters up, lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long…


In search of victory, she keeps eluding me
If only we could be together momentarily
We could make love, and make history
Why won't you visit me, until she visits me
I'll be stuck with a sista, her name is defeat
She gives me agony, so much agony
She brings me so much pain
So much misery, like missing your last shot
And fallin' to your knees .
As the crowd screams, for the other team
I practice so hard for this moment victory don't lead
I know what this means, i'm stuck in this routine
Whole new different day, but the same old things
All i got is dreams, but nobody else could see
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me
Where are you victory, i need you desperately
Not just for the moment. to make history

Now that all the smoke is gone(lighter)
And the battle finally rise(lighters)
Victory's finally ours (yea, yea, yea)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long…

So now i'm flirting with death
Hustla like a g, while victory wasn't watching
Took chances repeatedly
As a teenage boy, before acne
Before i got proactive, i couldn't face sheet
I just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets
I swear i met success, we lived together shortly
A success is like lust, witch is good for the touch
Witch is good for the moment, but she's never enough
Everybody's had her, she&amp;#146;s nothing like me
A success is all i got, unfortunately
But i'm burning down the block
I've been in it down defeat
But something tells me that there's much more to see
Before i get killed, cos i can't get robbed
So before me, success and death bandage
I gotta get lost, i gotta find free
We gotta be together to make history

Now that all the smoke is gone (lighters up)
And the battle finally rise(lighter up)
Victory's finally ours (lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long…

Now history is mine, it taste so sweet
She's my trophy wife, she commin with me
We have a baby who stutters' repeatedly
We name him history
He repeats after me
He's my legacy, son i'm a hard work
Future of my past, he'll explain who i be
Rank me among the greats
Either 1 2 or 3, if i ain't number one
Then i failed your victory
Ain't in it for the fame, that dies in 10 weeks
Ain't in it for the money, can't take me when you live
I wanna be remembered long after you breath
Long after i'm gone, long after i breath
I live all i am, in the hands of history
Bless my last will testimony
This is much more then a song
It's a baby shower, i've been waiting for this hour
History your ours.

Now that all the smoke is gone
And the battle finally rise
Victory's finally ours (lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long…
