[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Paparazzi spots me
In the lobby
Of my high-rise
I hide
Behind my shades
Cause the fame is blinding my eyes
My god
I know how Ozzie Oz
Once had felt when he was as high
As I have got
I have got
To make this stop
People often warn me
That the fame ain't for the vain if heart
It'll change those
Who they had love for you
Into strangers
When your fame starts
It's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when the train departs
Stranger
Things have happened
Rapping
Stacking
Platinum plaquin'
Born in Brooklyn got a place in Manhattan
Going back to Brooklyn
To escape the madness
When your friends is
Chris and Gwyneth
When your girl is more famous
Then you then is
Time to get all your windows tinted
Keep your eyes squinted
It's gon' flash any minute
The music biz is like musical chairs
Its about where you standing when the music stop spinning
In a

[Chorus]

[Beyonce Verse + (Jay-Z)]
You got to get it

Do you want it

But you don't need it
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh
What do you do (now that you got what you want)
oh oh oh
What do you do (oh you want more?)
oh oh oh
Hey

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Hey mista
Pay sixa
A lista
You're in the mist of
The ride of your life
But you gotta keep them hits up
Can't put your guard down
Gotta keep your mitts up
Take a sip sir
It's so in toxicating

Try not pick you jaded
Hollywood's been good to ya
Startin' feel like birds to ya
Don't lie
Gon' fly
You addicted to the lights
Without the fame
How you gon survive
It's like livin on
Heroine
You so high

[Bridge 2: Beyonce + (Jay-Z)]
And everybody warning you about it (Try to told you)
And once you taste you can't live without it (It's addictive)
Not cause you choose to not live without it (Sure you want this baby)
It's now a part of you (It's a part of you)
It's now a part of you
And everybody warning you about it (I see you blinded)
And once you taste you can't live

[Chorus (with minor ad-libs from Beyonce)]
Ooh it's the lights (It's the lights)

Satisfaction! (So addictive)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Wanna be seen

Blow your whole life
Tryna live in the lights
Heroins followin Marilyn
Hoppin' over the edge

All of them ended by

Thank God for Hollywood
