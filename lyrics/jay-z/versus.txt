Hey sucka n**ga
Where ever you are
I thought about ya fool
While I was driving my car


I wonder if you fools
Realize how far
You are
You’re no where in my rear mirror

Your last sh** ain’t better
Than my first sh**
Your best sh**
Ain’t better than my worst sh**

The truth in my verses
Versus
Your metaphors
About what your net worth is
