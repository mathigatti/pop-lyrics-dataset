[Verse One]

Momma I made it
Ya'll know how I do when the Doc do it
I fly thru it
That's how I operated
Momma I made it
Ghetto like the grease when you getting your hair braided
Sweeter than your sister Kool Aid is
Hooray is the underdog
Now my feet under desk
It's the presidential favorite
Can't believe I got away with my earlier stages
Being on stages
Having my way with
Congratulations
Ya baby boy's a made man
I'm a hold the fam down at least 3 generations
I'm talking when spaceships are around
And ya great, great grands
Reminiscing about foundation you gave 'em
For repairing my relationship with my pops before he passed 
All I ask is you raise your glass for this celebration
Toast to the most beautiful girl in the world
My inspiration, thanks for your information


[Chorus]

Momma I made it [2x]

[Verse Two]

I'm in BK where 
It ain't everyday that you make it out
To be on top of yachts waving
I remember you saving for the light bill
Paid the rent with a light bill
Now my crib dark as a basement
And you'd lock up the when you wasn't home
We was communicating like the money you made wasn't basic
Our cable was basic
No HBO, no WHT
Just Ralph McDaniels on the station
I aggravated you for Atari and Coleco Vision
Pinstripe Lee's when the first day day of school came
I was OK with not having everything as long as Saturdays
You had the Commodores playing
The expression on your face was priceless
It's still with me till this day
Baby girl I won't erase it
I go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made 
You deserve a standing ovation
Momma I made it

[Chorus 3x]

[Verse Three]

Now your lil misfit makes sure every day is Christmas
Write down your wish list
Sixes, wrist is glistening
You don't even like jewels
But you can missing anywhere you like to
Where the water's light tube
Anything you order, sign it to your nice room
Leave an extra tip Ma
Be extra nice to 'em
CEO Carter Foundation
Wow I know pop's looking down
I know Colleek somewhere up in the clouds
Like go get 'em Grandma, make me proud
Didn't have a man in the house so you made one
So I act like ya husband and I'm only ya son
I told you one day I'll get you a home
But I didn't know it would possibly be in Rome
She told me don't wait on nobody
Get your own, so with me myself &amp; my microphone I made it

Momma I made it....

Momma I made it....

[Music slowly fades out]
