(H to the izz O, V to the izz A)
Welcome ladies and gentleman to the 8th wonder of the world
The flow of the century, always timeless...HOV!
Thanks for comin' out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
I appreciate that....uh H to the izz O, V to the izz A
Fa shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in V-A
Was herbin' 'em in the home of the turbans
Got it dirt cheap for them, plus if they was short wit cheese I would work wit 'em
Boy did we? got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustler, I was birthin' 'em
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
Fa sheezy my neezy keep my arm so greasy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped they chrome it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D-A's wanna box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
It's not real to me therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoos son of a bitch H to the izz O, V to the izz A
Fa shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in V-A
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
That's the anthem get ya damn hands up
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
Not guilty y'all got to feel me
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
That's the anthem get ya damn hands up (holla at me) I do this for my culture, to let 'em know what a nigga look like
When a nigga rent a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me I'm raisin the status quo up
I'm over-chargin' niggas for what they did to the cold crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hold us
We could talk but money talks so talk mo' bucks H to the izz O, V to the izz A
Fa shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in V-A
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
That's the anthem get ya damn hands up
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
Not guilty y'all got to feel me
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
That's the anthem get ya damn hands up Hov is back, life story told through rap
Niggas actin' like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs, no Hov did that
So hopefully you wouldn't have to go through that
I was raised in the pro-jects roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they momma's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the Ave.
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand close?
Crack's in my arm, watchin the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
The try and the fail, the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game the two things that's great
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
What else can I say about dude I gets busy H to the izz O, V to the izz A
Fa shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in V-A
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
That's the anthem get ya damn hands up
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
Not guilty y'all got to feel me
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
That's the anthem get ya damn hands up H to the izz O, V to the izz A
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
H to the izz O, V to the izz A
