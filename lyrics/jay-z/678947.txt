i don't like too be alone in the night
and i don't like to here im wrong when i'm right 
and i don't like too have the rain on my shoes 
but i do love you
but i do love you


i don't like to see the sky paintred grey 
i don't like when nothings going my way
i don't to be the one with the blues
but i do love you
but i do love you
