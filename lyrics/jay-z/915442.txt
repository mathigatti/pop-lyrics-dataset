Either Respect The Flow Or Learn Your Lesson From Your Weight 
I'm Wishin Arthritis On All Writers Who, Knock My Hustle 
How Can Y'all Understand The Struggle? 
It's Hard To Live, When You Got Greedy Niggaz In The Mix 
Knowin I Outclass Three-E Niggaz In The Six 
So I Outblast Til It's Empty Clips 
And I Outlast Niggaz, Survival Of The Fit 
One Life, I Gotta Make Sure It's Done Right 
Cause Them Yet To Have A Conversation Bout Reincarnation 
Ball Out, Until I Fall Out 
Stick Thick Chicks, Try To Tear They Wall Out 
Hard To Think About Your Future With, Nothin To Gain 
Hard To Concentrate On School With Stomach Pain 
Life's Harsh, I Know Y'all Runnin From 'caine 
But It'll Only Catch You And Track You Down 
With No Deal, Who You Gonna Rap To Now? 
Start Your Own Record Company, That's Profound 
Live Niggaz Gonna Rumble When You Back From The War
