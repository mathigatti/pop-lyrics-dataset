I'm a hyphen hater
If you are in between my words I'll see you later
Cause I'm a hyphen hater
You are silent when I speak but I can see you on paper
You are higher than an underscore
But no more
To me, you're as dead as Latin
I can't even hear you, when I am chattin'
Z comes after Y, we all know that
So why did you have to get involved? Like some big man that
Was there something wrong with my grammar? Well now it doesn't matter
My name is four letters split by the button which is fatter
You are only good for pause, but when I got my flow
No one will stop me until I bring the applause
My alphabet goes from Jay to Z, you are not a proper letter
So that is why, I have decided that a space is much better
This should not be a surprise to you, your kind of character was up for being dismissed
So now that you are free go catch some vibes with brother asterisk
Forward slash, back slash, hash tag, comma, no thank you
Only the alphabet will do, I'm keepin' it simple with syllable two
After zero is where you belong
At the end of all those numbers is where you are strong
Sharing with cousin underscore
Plus and equals sitting next door
All is not lost, you have set a legacy
On websites, tickets, records and CD
This is not the end
You were more than a connector, you were my friend
There is a new journey on the horizon
Go and enjoy life by saying 'Hi Fun!'
