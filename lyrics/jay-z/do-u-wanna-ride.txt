Chorus

I know
I know
Some places we can go
Some places we can go


I know
I know
Some places we can go
Some places we can go

Do you wanna ride
With me
Do you wanna ride
With me

Verse One

You know why they call a project a project
Cause it's a project
An experiment, we're in it
Only as objects

And the object for us
To explore our prospects
Side step cops
On the way to the top, yes

As kids we would daydream
Sitting on our steps
Pointing at cars like
Yeah that's our six

Hustler's profits
Made our eyes stretch
So on some Dr. Spock sh*t
We started our trek

Some of us made it
Most of us digressed
In the name of those
Who ain't made it my progress

Is your success
Please live through me
See I'm the eyes for Emory
Keep em alive

Collect call
So every time I press 5
All he wanna hear is
His boy talk fly

Up in the Feds
He still holding his head
Cause when he hits the streets
We gonna eat thru this bread, now let's ride

Chorus

I know
I know
Some places we can go
Some places we can go

I know
I know
Some places we can go
Some places we can go

Do you wanna ride
With me
Do you wanna ride
With me

Verse Two

International HOV
I told you so
40/40's out in Tokyo
Singapore

All this from
Singing songs
Coming up though
We thought slinging raw

Was the end all, be all
To being rich didn't we
Little did I know
My mo' potent delivery

Would deliver me Kingpin of the ink pen
Monster of the double entandre
Coke is still my sponsor, the cola, yeah
HOVA still getting it in with soda

Started from the crates
Drinking, playing spades
Looking out for older guys
Back in the days

Then we got our turn
The takes on the stage
We was stars at the bar
All day pouring Rosé

Now I can't wait
Till you get your date
I got some temp plates
Outside of the gate, we gonna ride

Chorus

I know
Some places we can go
Some places we can go

I know
I know
Some places we can go
Some places we can go

Do you wanna ride
With me
Do you wanna ride
With me

Verse Three

Now me and my lil Momma
Keta and Ty Ty
Juan and Dez
Out in St. Tropez

Jay Brown &amp; Kawanna
Sneaking marijuana
You know that Mary J
Give you no more drama

Plus a couple of friends
This whole sh*t got weird
But when you get home
You know your spot's reserved, ya heard

I put my ni**as on,
My ni**as put they ni**as on
And now we all somewhere foreign
Chilling, sipping something, I ain't forget you cousin

Chorus
