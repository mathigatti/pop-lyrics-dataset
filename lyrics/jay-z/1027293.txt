And Ne-yo is like young mic well i'm queenzo hoe 
here's the flow that broke the da vinci code 
I'm psycho everything I wrote go together so nice like a wed make you wanna throw rice I'm skitso coucou clock

I put words at the end like bluetooth 
I'm a sandwich sorta of like a picnic ignorante 
thoughts come a cross shes was swore that i written this but 
i didn't so maybe its good to be crazy aint it baby 


I wrote your name on my wall 3000 time last night , 
you wear on my mind ..thats what chu do to me thats 
what chu do ..then one by one 
i went down the line just repeating it cuz it makes me smile thats what chu do to me thats what chu doo some say that is just strange to act that way but they don't understand no they don't get it ur soo magnetic tho its pathetic 
to my simple eternity just call me crazy inside and deranged it dont matter to me.. call it what u want to i dont care..
