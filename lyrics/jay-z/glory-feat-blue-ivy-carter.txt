The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe
What I'm feeling, for real (oh, glory)
Baby, I'll paint the sky blue
My greatest creation was you
You
Glory
Oh, glory


False alarms and false starts
All made better by the sound of your heart
All the pain of the last time
I pray so hard it was the last time
Your momma said that you danced for her
Did you wiggle your hands for her?
Glory
Glory
Glory
Sorry

Everything that I prayed for
God's gift, I wish I would've prayed more
God makes no mistakes, I made a few
Rough sledding here and there,
But I made it through
I wreak havoc on the world
Get ready for part two
A younger, smarter, faster me
So a pinch of Hov
A whole glass of B
Glory
Oh, glory
Yeah

The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe
What I'm feeling, for real
Baby, I'll paint the sky blue
My greatest creation was you

Your grandpop died on liquor failure
Then he died of liver failure
Deep down he was a good man
Goddamn, I can't deliver failure
Badass lil Hov
Two years old, shopping on Savile Row
Wicked ass lil B
Hard not to spoil you, rotten
Looking like lil me
The most beautifulest this thing in this world
Daddy's little girl, yeah
You don't yet know what swag is
But you was made in Paris
And momma woke up the next day
And shot her album package
Last time, the miscarriage was so tragic
We was afraid you'd disappear
But no, baby, you magic
So there you have it, shit happens
Just make sure the plane you on
Is bigger than your carry-on baggage
Everybody go do stuff
Life is a gift, Blue, open it up
You're a child of destiny
You're the child of my destiny
You're my child with the child from Destiny's Child
That's a helluva recipe
Glory
Glory
Glory
Sorry

Glory
Oh, glory
Yeah

The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe
What I'm feeling, for real (oh, glory)
Baby, I'll paint the sky blue
My greatest creation was you
Oh, glory
