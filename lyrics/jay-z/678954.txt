The sun will come out tomarrow
you bet your bottom dollar that tomarrow
there'll be sun
Just thinking about tomarrow 
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow
till theres none


When I'm stuck with a day thats gray and lonley
I just stick up my chin and grin and say

The sun will come out tomarrow
So you gotta hang on to tomarrow
Come what may 
Tomarrow Tomarrow I love ya tomarrow
Your always a day away

The sun will come out tomarrow
So you gotta hang on to tomarrow
Come what may
Tomarrow Tomarrow I love ya tomarrow
Your always a day away

Tomarrow Tomarrow I love ya tomarrow
Your always a day away
