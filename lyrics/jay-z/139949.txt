So I told shorty I be producing, I be making those beats

[Chorus 2x]

[R. Kelly]
I'm chillin in my 4.6, at the light
5 o'clock in the morning, been drinking all night
And, Plus I'm high, but it aint over
4 slim bodies scooped me in a wide body rover
Panties and bras all the way from the bed to the sofa
For all you R&amp;B so called playas, I'm bout to coach ya
Sit right there, and watch me freak yo girl chocha
Tounge all down her throat as if a nigga was trying to choke her
Its The Best Of Both Worlds, stickin ya in the "uhhhhhh!!"
Put ya hands up like it's money in the air
We bout to rip these charts like Zorro Blade
So hot your gonna need a cold glass of lemonade
To all my real live niggas, that shoot dice and play spades
In a nice crib, word up, drinking the Maid 
On the rizel my nizel, that nigga Jigga is the dizel
R. Kizel in the hotel swizel's chicks on the mizel's

[Chorus 2x]

Shorty
