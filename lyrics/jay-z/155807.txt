And it's a
Talent most people should learn
How to
Make you laugh without saying a word
People have to yell nowadays to get heard
But charlie was a man and that man could turn
Serious, into delirious, he had
A myriad of ways to paint a smile, and
Every woman in the house went, oh
If they wanted to act, they better aact on cue so


Refrain

He hicked the game go figure
Had no time for gold diggers
The mack daddy of the 1930's, i'm
Kicking back on the couch watching modern times
One more time

Rise 'em up
Hold that thought i got a vision, it's intense
I want a globe i can bounce off of people's heads
And when the earth starts shaking, people will commence
In a laughter, without one word being said
Does anybody here want to hear my voice
Or is silence the golden choice

Refrain

Ladies and gentlemen
Can you hold the applause, the show is about to begin

Instrumental
