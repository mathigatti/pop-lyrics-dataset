Yeah, uh
(sun in the sky)
(you know how i feel)
Me and the rza connect
(breeze driftin' on by)
Yeah, me and the rza connect
(breeze driftin' on by)
(it's a new life for me)
(for me, for me)
(oooh, oooh)
(and i'm feelin' good)


And i'll never let my son have an ego
He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
I mean, i might even make 'em be republican
So everybody know he love white people
And i'll never let 'em leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And i'll never let 'em ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends
See, i just want 'im to have an easy life, not like yeezy life
Just want 'im to be someone people like
Don't want 'im to be hated, all the time judged
Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
And i'll never let 'im ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And i'll never let his mom move to l.a.
Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray

(sun in the sky)
(you know how i feel)
(breeze driftin' on by)
(breeze driftin' on by)
(it's a new life for me)
Me and the rza connect
(for me, for me)
Me and the rza connect (oooh, oooh)
(and i'm feelin' good)

Sorry junior, i already ruined ya
'cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya
Sins of a father make yo' life ten times harder
I just wanna take ya to a barber
Bondin' on charters, all the shit that i never did
Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
Took me 26 years to find my path
My only job is cuttin' the time in half
So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
And if the day comes i only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
Cause my dad left me and i promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

(sun in the sky)
(you know how i feel)
(breeze driftin' on by)
(breeze driftin' on by)

(it's a new life for me)
(for me, for me)
(oooh, oooh)
(and i'm feelin' good)

(sun in the sky, you know how i feel)
(breeze driftin' on by, you know how i feel)
(breeze driftin' on by, you know how i feel)
(it's a new life for me)
(it's a new dawn, it's a new day)
(it's a new life for me)
(oooh, oooh)
(and i'm feelin'â€¦)
(birds flyin' high, you know how i feel)
