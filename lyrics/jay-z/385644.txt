1-Dirt Off Your Shoulder/Lying From You

I ordered a frappachino. 
Where's my fucking frappachino? 
Alright, let's do this.


When I pretend everything is what I want it to be,
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see,
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am,
Stealin' second after second just 'cause I know I can,
But I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay,
I'm just trying to bend the truth,
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be,
So I'm lying my way from..

If you feelin' like a pimp Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off,
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off,
Nigga is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you,
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder.

I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force,
Tryin' to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche,
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced,
Middle finger to the law, Nigga, grippin' my balls,
All the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin',
All the ballers is bouncin' they like the way I be leanin',
All the rappers be hatin', off the track that I'm makin',
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it,
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops,
Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block,
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block,
I can run it back, Nigga, cause I'm straight with the Roc.

If you feelin' like a pimp Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off,
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off,
Niggaz is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you,
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder,
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder,
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder,
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder.

Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir,
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya,
But like, fifty-two cards when I'm, I'm through dealin,
Now, fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em,
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling,
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin',
With a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve,
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen,
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean,
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real.

Yeah, I remember what they taught to me,
Remember condescending talk of who I outta be,
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again,
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in,
And now you think this person really is me,
And I'm trying to bend the truth,
But, the more I push, the more I'm pullin' away,
'Cause I'm lying my way from you.

(No turning back now),
I wanna be pushed aside,
So let me go,
(No, no turning back now),
Lemme take back my life,
I'd rather be all alone,
(No turning back now),
Anywhere on my own,
'Cause I can see,
(No, no turning back now),
The very worst part of you,
The very worst part of you,
Is me.

This isn't what I wanted to be,
I never thought that what I said,
Would have you running from me,
Like this,
This isn't what I wanted to be,
I never thought that what I said,
Would have you runnin' from me,
Like this (like this),
This isn't what I wanted to be,
I never thought that what I said,
Would have you running from me,
Like this (like this),
This isn't what I wanted to be,
I never thought that what I said,
Would have you running from me,
Like this.

You..

(No turning back now),
I wanna be pushed aside,
So let me go,
(No, no turning back now),
Lemme take back my life,
I'd rather be all alone,
(No turning back now),
Anywhere on my own,
'Cause I can see,
(No, no turning back now),
The very worst part of you,
The very worst part of you,
Is me.

Biatch! 

2-Big Pimpin'/Papercut

Hahaha, wasting your talent Randy!
Yeah, you're ready?

It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right

Come on!

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here is not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime they lie
A face that laughs everytime they fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right

You know I - thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
Cause I don't fuckin' need em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin 'bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe' em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin' 'em up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'm a break bread
So you can be livin' it up? Shit I..
Parts with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen
I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience
And I hate waitin'...
Hoe get yo' ass in
And let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide... check 'em out now
ri-i-i-i-i-ide, yeah
And let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide... check 'em out now
ri-i-i-i-i-ide, yeah

We doin'... big pimpin', we spendin' G's
Check 'em out now
Big pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s
We doin'... big pimpin' up in N.Y.C.
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B.U.N.B
Yo yo yo... big pimpin', spendin' G's
We doin'... big pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s
We doin'... big pimpin' up in N.Y.C.
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B.U.N.B-B-B 

3-Jigga What/Faint

Uh, uh, Jigga What?
Uh, uh, Jigga Who?
Uh, uh, Jigga What?
Uh, uh, Jigga Who?
Uh, uh, Jigga What?

You gonna need a vocal here right?

Motherfuckers wanna act loco, hit 'em wit', numerous
shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots runnin' to the Po-Po's, smoke 'em like cocoa
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck dat, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshittin', glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin' shocked when the bullet hit
And hey ma, how you, know nigga'z wanna buy you
But see me I wanna fuck for free, like Akinyele
Take this ride 'til you feel it inside ya belly
If it's tight get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, 'til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me

I am
A little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everybody can see these scars
I am
What I want you to want what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
So I
Let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here cause your all that I've got

Got a condo with nuttin' but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowin' on my last cassette?
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin a tec, never jam though
Never get high, never run out of ammo
Nigga'z hatin' 'n' shit cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're, actin' raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your hoe, wanna marry your hoe
Now she's mad at me, cause your majesty, just happened to be
A pimp with a tragedy
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked her friend
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said
"Shit there's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!"

I am
A little bit insecure a little unconfident
Cause you don't understand I do what I can
But sometimes I don't make sense
I am
What you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you
For once just to hear me out
So I
Let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

Now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored 

4-Numb/Encore

Yeah
Thank you, thank you, thank you
You for to come
Haha
Uh, yeah
Ready?
Let's go

Can I get a encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So, for one last time, I need y'all to roar
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So, for one last time, nigga, make some noise

Get 'em, Jay

Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime
I'm young H.O.: Rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe-now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young what the fuck you expect? (yep, yep)
Grand openin'-grand closin'
God damn, your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen?
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him (him)
With cheap imitations for these generations

Can I get a encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So, for one last time, I need y'all to roar
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So, for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits-look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high-perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan wearin' the four-five
It ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you-probably maim you
If I owe you I'll blow you to smithereens
Cocksucka', take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So mo'fucka', if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless
Lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure
Of walking in your shoes
[Caught in the undertow/
Just caught in the undertow]
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
[Caught in the undertow/
Just caught in the undertow]
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

I've become so numb
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (more)
I've become so numb
So, for one last time, I need y'all to roar
One last time, I need y'all to roar

5-Izzo/In The End 

This is fun
Ladies and gentlemen, put our hands together for the astonishing...

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world
The flow o' the century... always timeless... HOVE!
Thank you for comin' out tonight
You could'a been anywhere in the world, but you're here with us
We appreciate that... uh...

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was herbin' 'em in the home of the terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short wit' cheese I would work wit' them
Boy and we got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers I was burpin' 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me is not real to me
Therefore he doesn't exist
So poof... vamoose son of a bitch

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty ya'll gotta feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A (Check it out)
Yo, It starts with one thing...

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on and didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when 
I tried so 

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
LP, Jay-Z, Help me out
We'll have a good old time out there
It starts with
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
LP, Jay-Z, Help me out
We'll have a good old time out there
It starts with
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
LP, Jay-Z, Help me out
Yeah, yeah, yes it's here ladys and gentleman

Am i under arrest or should i guess some mo?
"Well you was doin fifty five in a fifty four"
"Liscense and regestration and step out of the car"
"Are you carryin' a weapon on you i know alot of you are"
I ain't steppin' out of shit all my papers legit
"Do you mind if i look round the car a little bit?"
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk and the back
And i know my rights so you gon' need a warrant for that
"Aren't you sharp as a tack you some type of lawyer or something?"
"Or somebody important or somethin'?"
Nah i ain't pass the bar but i know a little bit

Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe
This is not a hoe in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin no God Damn sense, try and push me
I tried to ignore him and talk to the Lord
Pray for him, cause some fools just love to perform
You know the type loud as a motor bike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
The only thing that's gonna happen is im'ma get to clappin
He and his boys gon be yappin to the captain
And there i go traped in the kit kat again
Back through the system with the riff raff again
Fiends on the floor scratchin' again
Paparatzi's with they cameras snappin' them
D.A. tred to give the nigga the shaft again
Half-a-mil for bail 'cause i'm African
All because ths fool was harrasin' them
Tryin to play the boy like hes saccarin'
But ain't nothin sweet 'bout how i hold my gun
I got 99 problems but this bitch ain't one

99 problems but a bitch ain't one
If your having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
