Rap verse 1 [jay-z]:
I used to run base like juan pierre
Now i run the bass hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like birkin bags
Now i bag b ([beyonce]: boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn bay where they birthed me at
Now i be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin curtains back
Me and b, she about to sting
Stand back

Verse 1 [beyonce]:
Baby...
Seems like everywhere i go
I see you...
From your eyes, your smile
It's like i breathe you...
Helplessy i reminisce
Don't want to...
Compare nobody to you

Pre-chorus [beyonce]:
Boy, i try to catch myself
But i'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh

Chorus:
Know that i can't get over you
'cause everything i see is you
And i don't want no substitute
Baby i swear it's dejá vú
Know that i can't get over you
'cause everything i see is you
And i don't want no substitute
Baby i swear it's...
Dejá...
Vú

Verse 2 [beyonce]:
Seeing...
Things that i know can't be
Am i dreaming...
When i saw you walking past me
Almost called...
Your name
Got a better glimpse
And then i looked...
Away
It's like i'm losing it

Pre-chorus [beyonce]:
Boy, i try to catch myself
But i'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh...

Chorus:
Know that i can't get over you
'cause everything i see is you
(oh...)
And i don't want no substitute
Baby i swear it's dejá vú
Know that i can't get over you
'cause everything i see is you
(whoa...)
And i don't want no substitute
Baby i swear it's...
Dejá...
([jay-z]: yes)
Vú

Rap verse 2 [jay-z]:
Hova's flow so unusual
Baby, girl you should already know
It's h-o, light up the strobe
'cause you gon' need help tryna study my
Bounce, blow, blow
What's the difference
One, you take in vein
While the other you sniffin'
It's still dough
Po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go
My dough keep the scales, tippin
Like 4-4's
Like i'm from the h-o-u-s-t-o-n
Blow, wind
So chicago of him
Is he the best ever
That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No dejá vú
Just me and my, oh

Bridge [beyonce]:
Baby i can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having dejá vú
'cause in my mind i want you here
Get on the next plane, i don't care
Is it because i'm missing you
That i'm having dejá vú

Pre-chorus [beyonce]:
Boy, i try to catch myself
But i'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Whoo...

Chorus:
Know that i can't get over you
'cause everything i see is you
And i don't want no substitute
Baby i swear it's dejá vú
Know that i can't get over you
'cause everything i see is you
And i don't want no substitute
Baby i swear it's...
Dejá...
Vú

Know that i can't get over you
'cause everything i see is you
And i don't want no substitute
Baby i swear it's dejá vú
Know that i can't get over you
'cause everything i see is you
And i don't want no substitute
Baby i swear it's...
Dejá...
Vú
