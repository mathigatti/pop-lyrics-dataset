Baby, what we gon' do?
I need you to talk to me, c'mon


[R. Kelly]
Suddenly, I feel the need - to pull you close to me
But I don't know, if it's what you want, baby
Girl show me some kind of sign
that tells me that you're, miiiine, all mine, baby
It's gettin awfully warm, off in this room
I'm gettin head up off yo' sweet perfume
and I'm ready, to explore, every part of you
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, then now you
Ooooooooooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo baby
Baby.. tonight we'll be, naked
Oooooooh, oooooooh, oooooooh, ooooooooh
I'll take a stroll through your garden of love
and show you so so much
Just take my hand, and believe, in our fu-ture
Gettin you open like matchin doors
Sheets and covers on, the floor
And if the bell should ring, we won't answer
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, and now you
Wanna tell, what I want from you

Baby tonight I wanna see you naked
So dim the lights
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked
I wanna see you tonight
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked
Oh babe, oh babe, yo' body's the reason for sight
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked
Ohhh-ohhh, naked
