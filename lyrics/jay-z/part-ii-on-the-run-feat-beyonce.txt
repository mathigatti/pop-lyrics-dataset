Who wants that perfect love story any way
Anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day
Anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché


What about the bad guy goes good, yea
And the missing love that's misunderstood
Yea black hour glass
Our glass
Toast to cliché
In a dark past
In a dark past
In a dark past

Boy meets girl
Girl perfect women
Girl get the bustin' before
The cops come running
Chunking deuces
Chugging

What you say
Boys in blue say

I don't care if you on the run
Baby as long as I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out
The best in you
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come
No
I know it's crazy but
They can take me
Now that l found the places that
You take me
Without you I got nothing lose

I'm an outlaw
Gotta outlaw chick
Bumping 2pac
On my outlaw, shit
Matching tatts this
Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off
If things ring off
My nails get dirty
My past ain't pretty
My lady is
My mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100
Hit the lottery
You ain't about that life
Ain't gotta lie to me nigga
You know it's till the death
Hope it obvi to niggas
Cross the line
Speak about mine
I'mma wave this tech
I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at
Click clack, push your motherfuckin' wig back
L did that
I been wilding since a juvi
She was a good girl till she knew me
Now she is in the drop bustin' uey's,
Screaming

They can take me
Now that l found the places that
You take me
Without you l got nothing lose

Deeper then words
Beyond right
Die for your love
Beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece
Beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray bans on
Police in sight
Oh what a beautiful death
Let's both wear white
If you go to heaven
And they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me
Bring me a box of l's
She fell in love with the bad guy
The bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys
Them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl
But you see it
If it's you and me against the world
Then so be it

I don't care if they give me life
I get all my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come
No
I know it's crazy but

I don't care l will never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No, I swear
I'll never give it up give it up give it all away
I don't care l will never give it up
Give it up give it up give it all away
No, I swear
I'll never give it up give it up give it all away
Without you I got nothing lose
