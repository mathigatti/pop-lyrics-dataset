[Verse 1: Jay-Z] (Swizz Beatz)
Yeah! You would think I was on 'roids

Nah we ain't on HGH
Though I might pick up some weight when I'm runnin through your state
(Runnin through your state! ) Nah nah nah we ain't on the clear
We on the runway in back to back Lairs (In the air!!!)
Yeah Yeah! It's Ms. No More Drama
And Barack Obama rhymers feel honored (Talk to 'em HOV)
I put my life on these tracks
You act like y'all don't wanna p-pay me for the facts
Luckily my therapy is to rap
I just bare my soul I don't expect nothin back (Get it up!)
Your all welcome long as you felt them
I was 'gon get mine you know where the hell I'm from
I'm from the bottom so I do this from the diapers (Stinky!!!)
Quick fast turn the big apple into cider (Nasty!!!)
I do this, I'm a writer and a rider
Spew it cause I'm nicer but I do this for the lifers (Tell 'em again Hov!!!)
I'm a writer and a rider
Spew it cause I'm nicer but I do this for the lifers, your welcome

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige - singing in tune of Slick Rick's "La Di Da Di"]

Viva Hovito bandito muy bien
Big up to Biggie and Pac, I do it for them
Until I rich Kaleek, I do it for him
Do it for those who can't do for self do to the pen
May these bars reach through your bar
And ma, when Mary sing it heals your heart (*Hands up!)
God so Lisa Stansfield you are
Love Is A Battlefield we all get scarred (*OH!)
AH! I put my heart into this
This is much more than marketed music
The reason I got a market to do this
As there's people goin through pain I'm just walkin 'em through this
(I'm here for you) This ain't no marketed music
People goin through pain I'm just talkin 'em through it, your welcome

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige] (Swizz Beatz)
If it wasn't for your love it would all be a dream
And you made our dreams come true
That's why y'all don't need to thank us
Cause we do this all for you (Talk to 'em Mary!)
We know what you were goin through
Because we were goin through it too
When no one seems to understand
We were always there to hold your hand

[Verse 4: Jay-Z] (Swizz Beatz)
Sure I taught you 'bout watch brands and watch bands
I also said watch the man hoppin out of vans (WOO!!!)
I ain't only teach you about Efizel
I told you how to fish and not let other niggas feed you, your welcome

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige - singing in tune of Slick Rick's "La Di Da Di"]
To all of y'all, keepin y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Your all are welcome, your all are welcome, your all are welcome
