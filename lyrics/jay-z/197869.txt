I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless
Lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure
Of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you



I've
Become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm become in this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly
Afraid to lose control
Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that i take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second i waste is more than I can take


I've
Become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm become in this
All i want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you


And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

I've
Become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm become in this
All i want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

I've
Become so numb
[I'm tired of being what you want me to be]
I've
Become so numb
[I'm Tired of being what you want me to be]
