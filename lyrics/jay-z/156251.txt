(feat. Memphis Bleek)

Uh, uhh, uh
Uh, ah, now Hov's in the building, Hov's in the building
Uh, uhh, uh
Kels in the building, Kels in the building
Uh, uhh, that's right
Hov's in the building, Hov's in the building
Uh what? Ho, ho
Yo Kels in the building, Kels in the building


[R. Kelly]
I'm in the building tonight, it's goin down my nigga
Got a pocket full of cash and some 'dro my nigga
Attitude like I don't give a fuck my nigga
Probably the drunkest fool on the flo' my nigga
One of the best that ever did this here, every year
It's the #1 R&amp;B singer this year
But y'all know, still mo' money mo' problems
Mo' niggaz, mo' chicks, mo' clubs, Mo' bottles
One little note in your ear, and I gotcha
Ladies call me the black Frank Sinatra
Yeah a real pimp floss and the pimp be blingin
It's just the same reason why a young pimp be leanin
Hard liquor, couple sips, and I'm passin it
Maybach so big you can dance in it
Jigga lil' nigga fuckin with the baddest chicks
Got your girl lookin at you like the maddest chick
We goin

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got everybody up in the club, hands high
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got players, ballers, hustlers and they back 
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got all of the pretty girls left in the city
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got 'em goin, we got 'em goin

[Jay-Z]
Yo yeah it's the boy Hov', yeah I blow O's
Circles around competition, not an Optimo
To sit low, in a six-oh, oh
Solo, on lo-lo's, fuck po'-po's
Take a pho-to, last time you see a nigga so cold
So be-low zero, so froze
So-so rappers are so sore, hate his soul
It ain't my fault I'm so rock'n'roll
I'm just Hov'

[Chorus]
ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got everybody up in the club, hands high
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got players, ballers, hustlers and they back 
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got all of the pretty girls left in the city
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got 'em goin, we got 'em goin

[Memphis Bleek]
Geah, it's the kid from the Stuy, and I stay high
In my A-O-L-A blowin lah lah lah
Goodbye, I see you chumps on top
Or on the highway in somethin that ends with I
Like I, 745, I
Or the F-E-double-R-the-A-R-I
AR-15 to spray y'all guys
You die (you die) goodbye (goodbye)

[Chorus]
ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got everybody up in the club, hands high
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got players, ballers, hustlers and they back 
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got all of the pretty girls left in the city
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got 'em goin, we got 'em goin

[Jay-Z]
From New York to Chi, we blow like hy-dro
Blow out live shows without py-ro
See how I combined the I-O flow
Tone'll rep, Memph Bleek, Kels and Hov'

[Jay and Bleek alternate words]
Bottles, models, follow, to the hotter
way we play like it's no day tomorrow
Spendin my dough like I just hit the lotto
Bounce, park and stop shall not wake I'm straight safe


ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got everybody up in the club, hands high
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got players, ballers, hustlers and they back 
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got all of the pretty girls left in the city
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh
We got 'em goin, we got 'em goin
