(Woooooo)
(Yeah)
(Turn the music up turn the lights down I'm in my zone)


Thank god for grantin me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
Through my hard knock life time
My gift and the curse
I gave you volume after volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a reasonable doubt
(Yall can't fill my shoes)
From my blueprint beginnings
To that black album endin
Listen close you hear what I'm about
Nigga feel my truths

When pop died
Didn't cry
Didn't know him that well
Between him doin heroine
And me doin crack sales
With that in the egg shell
Standin at the tabernacle
Rather the church
Pratendin to be hurt
Wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like damn that mans face was just like my face
So pop I forgive you
For all the shit that I live through
It wasn't all your fault
Homie you got caught
And to the same game I fault
That uncle ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other
Save a place in heaven
Til the next time we meet forever

The music business hate me
Cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me
And the music I be makin
I dump down for my audience
And double my dollars
They criticize me for it
Yet they all yell "holla"
If skills sold
Truth be told
I'd probably be
Lyricly
Talib kweli
Truthfully
I wanna rhyme like common sense
(But I did five mil)
I ain't been rhymin like common sense
When your sense got that much in common
And you been hustlin since
Your inception
Fuck perception
Go with what makes sense
Since
I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most impor-tant
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back
To me that's the win, win
The next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is workin just like them
(The rims that is)

My homie sigel's on a tier
Where no tears should fall
Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See in my inner circle all we do is ball
Til we all got triangles on our wall
He ain't just rappin for the platinum
Yall record
I recall
Cause I really been there before
Four scores and seven years ago
Prepared to flow
Prepare for war
I shall fear no man
You don't hear me though
These words ain't just paired to go
In one ear out the other ear
No
Yo
My balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me?
Nigga scars'll scab
What you gonna box me homie?
I can dodge and jab
Three shots couldn't touch me
Thank god for that
I'm strong enough to carry biggie smalls on my back
And the whole bk nigga holla back
