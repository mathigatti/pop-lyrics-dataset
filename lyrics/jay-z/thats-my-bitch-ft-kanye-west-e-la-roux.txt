[Kanye West]
Hello, can I speak to a, a,
Yeah you know who you are
Look, you had no idea what ya dealing with
Something on some of this realest sh-t
Pop some nines, so I give you the Fifth
Something, something
Yeah, that's my b-tch


That's my bitch
sh-shorty right there
That's my bitch
That's my bitch

[Chorus - Elly Jackson]
I've been waiting for a long long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life
And live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high

[Kanye West]
I paid for them titties, get your own
It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne
You say I care more about them basquion's, basquiats
She learning a new word, it's yacht
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called, told me "I fell in love with her"
Seen by actors, ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved n-ggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
I'm a freak huh, rock star life
The second girl with us, that's our wife
Hey boys and girls, I got a new riddle
Who's the new old perv that's tryna play second fiddle
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle

[Chorus - Elly Jackson]
I've been waiting for a long long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life
And live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high, high, high, high

Silly little vixen, mixes 'til morning
Not swerving, oh, yeah
Swear you never strolled on a bottle of that potion
Stop motion, ooh, yeah

[Jay-Z]
Go harder than a n-gga for a n-gga go figure
Told me "keep my own money" if we ever did split up
How can somethin' so gangsta be so pretty in pictures?
With jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers
Uh, Picasso was alive he woulda made her
That's right n-gga Mona Lisa can't fade her
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice
But why all the pretty icons always all white
Back to my Beyonce's
You deserve 3 stacks for the Andre
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in museums
You belong in Vintage clothes watching the whole building
You belong with n-ggas who used to be known for dope dealing
You too dope for any of those civilians
Now shoot trigga, stop looking at her tits
Get ya own dog, ya heard
That's my bitch

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for a long long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life
And live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high

Silly little vixen, mixes 'til morning
Not swerving, oh, yeah
Swear you never strolled on a bottle of that potion
Stop motion, ooh, yeah

[Kanye West]
You have no idea what you're dealing with
Something on some of this realest sh-t
Pop some nines, so I give you the Fifth
Something, something, yeah

That's my bitch
That's my bitch
Sh-shorty right there?
That's my bitch
That's my bitch
