[Kid Cudi]
They want me to fall, fall from the top,
They want me to drop (They want me to stop)
They want me to go, I'm already gone (The sh-- that I'm on)
I'm already home


[Jay-Z]
These nigga's want me to go, don't they know that i'm gone
They know i'm space shuttle level they need oxyg-g-g-gen
Don't they know that they born?
Don't they know that i'm young?
Only time they excited is when they mentioning Shawn
See a single white female but she dyed her hair blonde
Sometimes i look at these rappers, the movie remind me of them
somebody turn these boys off
don't they know that i'm on
Can't they see that it's foolish to try and kill me with songs
what the fuck are they doing, they kill me softly
You talk me to death, only thing you can do to him
I open the door for them, what else can i do
These nigga's want me to walk for them, somebody talk to them
Before i go off on them

[Kid Cudi]
They want me to fall, fall from the top,
They want me to drop (They want me to stop)
They want me to go, I'm already gone (The sh-- that I'm on)
I'm already home

[Jay-Z]
I taught-em about fish scale they want me to fish for them
They want me to catch clean, then cook up a dish for them
All of this just for them, or they got a diss for him
They want me to disappear, like it's gonna do shit for them
They say that i'm in the way, they want me to sit with them
But what they admitting is, they aint got shit for him
But really the fact is, we not in the same bracket
Not in the same league, don't shoot at the same baskets
Don't pay the same taxes, hang with the same bitches
So how am i in the way, what is it i'm missing?
Nigga i been missing, nigga i been gone
The shit that you just witnessed is the shit that i bin on
And as for the critics, tell me i don't get it
Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it
Now these nigga's is mad, oh they call me a Camel
But they ass is in a drought, what the fuck i'm an animal
Half man half mammal
My silence is sad, this is just what i plan to do
Oh don't be mad

[Kid Cudi]
They want me to fall, fall from the top,
They want me to drop (They want me to stop)
They want me to go, I'm already gone (The sh-- that I'm on)
I'm already home

[Jay-Z]
I'm in the hall already, on the wall already
I'm a work of art, im a wall-hall already
On another level, on another plane already
H-O-V i got my own lane already (already)
I done cut up the rock already
So why the fuck can't ya'll get hot already (already)
Put your name in the pot already, then you can compare me to biggie and PAC already
Like im gone already and i am nigga i'm already home already
If ya'll can't already see i aint worried about ya'll cos i'm already me
Do you already, enough of the complaining bo-who's already.
Eat food already, aint nothing given you gotta claim your shoes already

(i don't know who you racing i'm already at the finish line with the flag waving)
