[Verse One]

Pops sped off
Left Mom with a bundle of
Joy ya boy
Smack dab in the jungle
Took tunnel vision
But he would soon become a mogul
But first he brought that crack back like a yo-yo
Don't play with my yo-yo
Loco niggas in the hood
First niggas hating on me
It's all good
I'm buying things like my sh*t don't stink
Gucci links and Gucci gooses
Watching too many movies
Bulletproof this
Had some nerve
Like pulling tooths
When you sixteen, coming through roofless
Yeah ya boy ruthless
Like Ice Cube was
Turn the whole city on
I'm the new plug
So if this is your first time hearing this
You are about to experience someone so cold
A journey seldom seen
The American dream
From the bottom to the top of the globe
They call me HOV


[Chorus]

They gunning for me
Wanna see me fall
You know my story
I been through it all
Nights I felt like dying
But I ain't crying
What didn't kill me
Made me strong as iron
I am
I am
Oh my God, HOV

[Verse Two]

Now I'm knee-deep in the concrete
Like the streets made of quicksand beyond deep
I got a chemical romance, two left feet
So now I dance with the devil, please GOD
Save me from the black parade, release me
My life like Grand Theft Auto PSP
I'm in the Volvo puffing on the la la
Ducking from the po-po
Every time I drive by
Say hi to the bad guy
All my momma friends is like hmm hmm hmm
Would you just look at him
So sorry dear momma for your embarrassment
Give me a couple years I pray I never sin
Got all these rival dealers trying to do me in
And all these little rappers don't know how prepared for them I am. I am.
I'm feeling like the world's against me Lord
Call me crazy but I love them odds

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]

Now these baby ballers toy rappers
Calling out my name to bring the boy backwards
Shooting air balls at the basket
What you call money I paid more in taxes
I got crowned came down in Africa
Down in Nigeria do you have any idea
Sold out shows in Seoul Korea
Jo-berg, Dublin, Tanzania
Lunch with Mandela, dinner with Cavalli
Still got time to give water out to everybody
Everybody fall back
Y'all rapping I'm reenacting
CNN you see it's accurate
ESPN see me in action
Monday nights when the half ends
When you ten years in holla back then
