VerseI

who wanna bet us that we don't touch letters,
stack cheddars forever,
live treacherous, all the etceteras,
to the death of us, me and my confiants
we shine, you feel the ambiance
y'all niggas just rhyme,
by the ounce doe accumulates like snow,
we dont just shine, we illuminate the whole show,
ya feel me?,
factions from the other side would love to kill me,
spill 3 quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat,
fuck em, they hate a nigga lovin his life,
in all possible ways, know the feds is buggin my life,
hospital days, reflects with my man laid up,
on a uptown hot block, he got his side sprayed up,
I saw his life slippin, this is a minor setback,
yo still alone we livin, just dream about the getback,
that made him smile though his eye said "pray for me",
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully,
murder is a tough thing to digest, its a slow process,
and I aint got nothing but time,
I had near brushes, not to mention,
3 shots close range, never touched me,
divine intervention cant stop pa,
from drinking mataje, with tata, down in nevada, ha ha pa pa,
word life, by dabbling crazy weight,
without rap I was crazy straight,
partna I'm still spending money from 88 whhhaattt!!!


chorus
Im out for presidents to represent me (repeat)

verse II

you know what?,
I'll make, you and your wack mans,
fold like bad hands, roll like monolpoly,
advance, youre coppin me like, white crystal,
I gross the most at the end of the fiscal year than these niggascould wish to,
the dead presidential, candidate
with the sprinkles, and the presidential ice,
that'll offend you,
in due time, when crime flees my mind,
all sneak thieves and playa haters could shine,
but unitl then, I keep the trillion cut diamond shiningbrilliant,
I'll tell you half the story, the rest you fill it in,
long as the villain wins, I spend Japan Yen at 10 major events,
catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is biting,
J-A-Y hyphen, controlling, manipulating, I got a good life man,
pounds and plants, nuff dollars make sense,
while you riding the bench,
catch me swinging for the fence, dead presidents ya know

chorus

verseIII

so be it,
the soviet, the unified steady flow,
you already know, you light, I'm heavy roll, heavy doe,
mic macheted ya flow,
your paper falls slow like confetti, mine are steady grow,
perricooooo (cocaine),
paid 5 debit for blow, better believe I have 11 60 to show,
my doe flip like tae-kwon, Jay Z the icon,
maybe you like dom, maybe the kristal will change ya life huh?,
roll with the winners, heavy spinners like hit records,
roc-a-fella, dont get it corrected, this shit is perfected,
from chips to chicks to scribbin a lexus,
naked without ya gun, we takin everything ya run,
we cakin, ya'll niggas is fakin, we gettin it done,
crime family, well connected Jay Z and you,
fake thugs is unplugged like MTV,
I empty 3, take your treasure, my pleasure,
dead presidentials, politics is cha cha chow, blooow

chorus
