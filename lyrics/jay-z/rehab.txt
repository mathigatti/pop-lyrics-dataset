(feat. Jay-Z)

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no,
no'
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know
know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go
go


I'd rather be at home with ray
I ain't got seventy days
Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no,
no'
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know
know know (you're now rockin' wit' the best amy baby)

The man said 'why do you think you here'(hov)
I said 'I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
so I always keep a bottle near'
He said 'I just think your depressed,(the best baby)
kiss me here baby and go rest'

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no,
no'
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know
know know

[Jay Z:]
More money, more checks,I'm addicted to fresh
Six pair of kicks is my definition of 12 steps
Kick back in the back, get the phantom to drop
Bass blarin outta my system, thats how i detox
O when will he stop, he still pumpin that real sh*t
My flow so dumb, my face is numb, n*gga,i dont feel
sh*t
Wheres a therapist? Yea I'm outta control
They tryna make me go to rehab, I won't go, no
And so I'm addicted, I'm Britney, Whitney, and Bobby
Betty Ford ain't ready for it, ain't nothin can stop
me
O look he's collapsin, just look how he's rappin
Everytime I try to get out it pulls me back in
Amy should have rehab'd him,'stead she doubled his
ration
Can you blame me for being a slave to my passion
My heron flows more deeper than marilyns nose I'ma
o.d. till I'm in peace like Anna Nicole, hov!

I don't ever wanna drink again
I just ooh I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
have everyone think I'm on the mend

It's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go
