[Cassidy Verse 1]
I'm a hustler, I'm a hustler homey
I got the product, narcotics for customers homey
Feins open they be smoking like a muffler homey

If you a hustler I could, I could fuck wit you homey
You spend a couple of bucks Ill stay in touch with you homey
I get money I get 20 to K I got 20 strip although I'm 20 today
I get cake from buds and haze I'm making dubs

But you can take my information if you taking drugs

[Cassidy Verse 2]
Married to the game, same bride as a new dru
I do more then just do toons
cause my bills come in too soon, my son gone be two soon
royalty checks come like once in a bluemoon
but I'm getting my doe from doin shows
I made more doe on the grind then goin cold
that's why I stay fly and flying on shows
car's are so cool,Aston no shoes
just a rubberband on my wrist no jewels
I ain't gotta prove I'm rich, I'm no fool
I know the rules I ain't got time for it
But a Nigga will shine when its time for it
and they will hate you deal with the real cake
and they on the corner
from morning till real late
I deal weight and if you bastards doubt me
I'm a hustler ask about, ask about me

[Jay-Z Chorus]

[Cassidy Verse 3]
To git paid you gotta save don't be spendin the change
In fifth grade I was hustlin my genesis games
I was dummy young selling chewing gum to my classmates
On the cash chase moving at a fast pace
never been a dummy never did what the dummies do
so I had a mill to burn before I turned 22
mo money, mo problems is true cause the more money
I make the more problems for you
yeah I used dude voice props to the boy sean
he made it a hot line I made a hot song
So stop drawing man you got to respect it
I'm the best swizz got to perfected don't mess with
C-A-double S-I-D-Y cause I became the best when B-I-G died
the kid do it big like P-U-N cause
I'm nice P-A-C with the P-E-N
