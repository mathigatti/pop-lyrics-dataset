Verse 1:] 
Me and You 
Been kickin' it for sometime 
Shorty, you ain't let me know what's on your mind 
I remember when cheatin' on my girl was once my steez 
But the love's so good 
You got me on my knees askin' 
Please can we? 


[B Section:] 
Make love tonight 
Feel so right 
Hold you tight 
Take my sweet time 
To let you know how I am feelin' for you 
So tight, your love is right 
Keeps me up girl, all night 
I love the way you hook me up girl 

[Hook:] 
Always hook you up, if you keep it real 
Your love girl, I'll keep it real 
You have got me stuck on how good it feels 
It feels so good to me my baby 

[Verse 2:] 
Boy you know 
I'm sittin' here outta my mind 
'Cause I never thought I'd find 
Someone to spend my time with 
And the way you've opened up to me 
Lets me know 
That you're the one for me 
So tell me can we?

[Rap:] 
Yo, realer than my late night creeps 
You understanding me 
The genuine article I can't fade sleep 
Jay-Z, the king of the one nights 
I can't stay forever, love 
I get it done right 
And I shall return to sweat out your perm 
Cutie I would truly do damage to your dooby 
That's the deal, ma 
That's the deal of the deal 
I keep it real, what 
I keep it realer than real 
Word to my life...Jigga
