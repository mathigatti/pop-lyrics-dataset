By the way yo
Yo, how the fuck you gonna talk about MC's on our hill
When we just cop them things homey the chromy wheels
Both arms are chunky the sleeves on chill
Any given times 100 G's in your grill
Don't talk to me bout MC's got skillz
He's alright but he's not real
Jay-Z's that deal with seeds in a field
Never fear for war, hug, squeeze that steel
Fuck, you gotta a flow that's cool with me
You gotta lil' dough that cool with me
You gotta little cars little jewelries
But none of y'all motherfuckers could fool with me
You know the wrist frost bit minus two degrees
Bout as blue as the sea the way I manuever the V
Hat cocked can't see his eyes, who could it be?
With that new blue Yankee on, who but me?
Niggaz shift two million, then I blew the three
Then I skated the four, before I went on tour
I came back and it's plain
Y'all niggaz ain't rappin the same
Fuck the flow y'all jackin our slang
I seen the same shit happen to Kane
Three cuts in your eyebrow tryin to wild out
The game is ours will never foul out
Y'all just better hope we gracefully bow out
Throw your hands up
Niggaz, Bitches, Bustas, Hustlers FUCK THAT
