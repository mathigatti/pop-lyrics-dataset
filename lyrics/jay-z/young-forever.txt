Let's dance in style
Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the sky's
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sand pit life is short trip
The music is for a sad man


Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

[Jay-Z]
May the best of your todays,
Be the worst of your tomorrows,
But we ain't even thinking that far,
You know mean?

[Jay-Z]
So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the
hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that
pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
Cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed,
Drink some wine,
Reminisce, talk some shit
Forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut,
I'll be fine,
I'm forever young...

[Mr. Hudson]
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

[Jay-Z]
Fear not when, fear not why,
Fear not much while were alive,
Life is for living not living up tight,
See ya somewhere up in the sky,
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye
bye,
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves,
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to
generations
While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here,
Show that the nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here,
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears,
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

[Mr. Hudson]
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

[Jay-Z]
Slamming Bentley doors,
Hopping out of Porsche's,
Popping up on Forbes lists,
Gorgeous,
Hold up,
Niggas thought I lost it,
They be talking bullshit
I be talking more sh-t
They nauseous,
Hold up,
I'll be here forever
You know, I'm on my fall shit,
And I ain't waiting for closure,
I will never forfeit,
Less than four bars,
Guru bring the chorus in,
Did you get the picture yet,
I'm painting you a portrait of young...
