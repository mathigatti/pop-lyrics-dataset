No I don't wanna be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do
No I don't wanna be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do


Why do we argue the way we do
Can't you see girl that I, I'm in love with you
And it hurts (it hurts so bad)
To see you cry (to see you sad and blue)
When I'm needing you the most
But you feel (you feel someone)
When no one (will take the place of you)
And I don't wanna be alone

No I don't wanna be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do
No I don't wanna be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do

Don't hide the way you feel for me no more (no more)
Just because we're miles away doesn't mean I'm insecure
And it hurts (it hurts so bad)
To hear you cry (when I can't hold you)
And you're needing me the most
I feel (I feel the same)
Never chance (and I'll always love)
And I'll always love you

No I don't wanna be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do
No I don't wanna be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do

Don't run away from my love that you need
Don't turn away from my love you will see
You are the reason that I wanne live
And I want you to remain with me

No I don't wanna be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do
No I don't wanna be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do...
