[Intro: Jay-Z]
I mean, Ush, is this what it comes to man?
It's how we gon do it?
I mean even grass grow baby, you know?
Seeds become plant, boys become men
What we gon do? Let's lead the way
 
[Jay-Z]
Uh, wrapped around all girls like Pashminas
What's my demeanor? The grass is always greener
On the other side, there's bigger lies, can't give a ringer
I couldn't give a {{fuck}}, how could I give her finger?
Let alone have bad for closets
So claustrophobic, if there are close objects
Now it's sort of like two car garages
It's like two broad menages, you're the best, mama
 
[Usher]
Is there any chance that you remember, mami being more?
Just a horrible man, and would you consider pulling this trigger and taking a second 
shot at romance? Aw baby, I groomed the days when you were my girl
And I was your man, though I took you for granted
But it wasn't till now I see how much i missed you
Girl I'm sorry I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once it dawns the truth
I can be fake, I can be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homage is slowly
I try to flex but I confess, that when you left you took the very best thing
 
[Chorus]
The best thing that ever happened to me 
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And you're all I feel in strength
Cause baby when you left, you took the very best
 
[Usher]
Remember Mimi or Vita? Remember Iesha or Eva, I ain't got 'em no more
Hey, it's for Naomi and Jenny, the same outcome as Chilli, girl, I let 'em all go
Oooh, no more trickin and kissin miscellaneous chicks acting like a jerk
Woman, I been to church and I talked to the bishop
And he wanted me to share this with you; how much I missed you
I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once it goes that's true
I can be fake, I can be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homage is slowly
I try to flex but I confess, that when you left you took the very best thing
 
[Chorus]
 
[Jay-Z]
Uh, momma try to told me "Hovi Hov to slow it down
You gon' lose the your thing if you keep gettin round" 
Like pop need a partner when you ol' to hold him down
Ma, forever young was forever numb
Sorry Staci, sorry Dawn, Amil-lion and all of them
All of them was for the time, it wasn't you, it was him
School me once, school me twice, three times I was dumb
Now it's so plain to see to me I got the one, you the best mama
 
[Usher]
I can be fake, I can be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homage is slowly
I try to flex but I confess, that when you left you took the very best thing
