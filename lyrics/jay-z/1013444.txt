[Jay-Z]
Ahuh Ahuh (Yea Rihanna) 
Ahuh Ahuh (Good girl gone bad) 
Ahuh Ahuh (Take three... Action) 
Ahuh Ahuh 


No clouds in my storms 
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank 
Coming down with the Dow Jones 
When the clouds come we gone, we Rocafella 
She fly higher than weather 
And G5's are better, You know me,
an anticipation, for precipitation. Stacked chips for the rainy day 
Jay, Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine 
Rihanna where you at? 

[Rihanna]
You have my heart 
And we'll never be worlds apart 
May be in magazines 
But you'll still be my star 
Baby cause in the dark 
You can't see shiny cars 
And that's when you need me there 
With you I'll always share 
Because 

[Chorus]
When there's sunshine, we'll shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever 
Said I'll always be a friend 
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end 
Now that it's raining more than ever 
Know that we'll still have each other 
You can stand under my umbrella 
You can stand under my umbrella 
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella 
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)

These fancy things, will never come in between 
You're part of my entity, here for Infinity 
When the war has took it's part 
When the world has dealt it's cards 
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart 
Because 

[Chorus]
When there's sunshine, we'll shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever 
Said I'll always be a friend 
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end 
Now that it's raining more than ever 
Know that we'll still have each other 
You can stand under my umbrella 
You can stand under my umbrella 
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella 
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)

You can run into my arms 
It's okay don't be alarmed 
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour 
I'll be all you need and more 
Because 

[Chorus]
When there's sunshine, we'll shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever 
Said I'll always be a friend 
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end 
Now that it's raining more than ever 
Know that we'll still have each other 
You can stand under my umbrella 
You can stand under my umbrella 
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella 
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under my umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)

It's raining 
Ooh baby it's raining 
Baby come into me 
Come into me 
It's raining 
Oh baby it's raining
