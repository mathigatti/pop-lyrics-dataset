This just a record deal, y'all motherfuckers been on some shit
Bite my style, tryin to get rich, so I decided to flip my shit
Bene-fit me like a tight outfit, like Mr. Biggs' about to have a
fit
It's, a, bout, to, be, some, shit (please believe it)

Same fight, different round; same circus, different clown
Same pussy, different town; assholes how you like me now?

Put two heads together, mean mo' figures (ha)
Word to Tigger, put me off up in the "Bassment"

Psycho, like no, bitch-ass niggaz

Shoot from the line like a free throw
With this 'nali of mine like a Pi-co
Leave niggaz far behind like a cheap hoe
On my grind every time that you see Hov'

Red dot I stop ya, yellow niggaz move slow

[Beanie Sigel]
Red dot I got 'em, tell that nigga move slow
Head shots pop 'em when I let the uz' go
He done told fool..
Dunn think Dunn loc'in when a gun smokin
Tell Dunn I been gun-totin
He don't know he facin death
Hockey mask on Jason's step
Don't make me pop past your Raisinette
