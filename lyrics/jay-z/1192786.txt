Just Blaze!

[Snoop]
Ehehe, oh really?
You know what? .. You talk too much
Hoe get up out my face unless you tryin to fuck
Cause on the real a nigga kinda drunk
And right now the way you lookin bitch you fly as fuck
I don't even know if I done had too much
You play too much, I had to fuck
Cuddled you up and put my hands on your butt
Rubbin your stuff and now your pants full of nut
.. You can't tell me nuttin
Let me shoot my thang on your bellybutton
I got to, keep it gangsta
Your homegirl want some, I just might bank her
Shank her, bank her, and take her bankroll
Big Snoop Dogg and my game is way cold
Never, ever, overexpose
I usually got a car with a room full of hizzoes


[Chorus]
Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, bake this thing for me
Cause you just flow so viciously
Soopa-Duper, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, bake this thing for me
Cause you just flow so viciously

[Soopafly]
Now bitch, check it out, where my money, c'mon break it out
Just sayin hoe, I ain't playin c'mon, take it out
Dick down the track, c'mon, we gon' work it out
Straight pimp shit we on, we gon' church it out
(If you don't know) I'm quick to change up stick
My dick in yo' mouth and aim up
Open up your eyes you'll see my navel
Flip down my drawers, you'll see that label
Sniffed so much 'caine/Kane, the bitch got able/Abel
Put the switch on, directed my cable
Splash! What head work and what ass
Bitch stop my dick hurtin, now fuck Daz
Run fast if I tell ya bitch walk
Get caught, I'm takin all that bitch got
I don't need no relationship
All I really had in mind was my dick, yo' face and lips, c'mon

[Chorus]
Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, bake this thing for me
Cause you just flow so viciously
Hovi Baby, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, bake this thing for me
Cause you just flow so viciously

[Jay-Z]
Young! Woo! Hov'! Yes
She wanna meet the only king on the East coast
Hook me up witcha boy Snoop she said he so low
I never get the chance to get at him
Only on the TV when I blow kisses at him, muah
Listen here madam, you can throw the pussy at him
If it ain't about snatch, well it just won't happen!
.. Hov ain't into backwards mackin
.. How backwards that is
.. I don't love 'em though
'Less makin a little paper then I love 'em the most
If she's, sneakin in the club with the toast
I'm flyin the friendly skies with 36 hoes
Shit, I can get a chef to cook for me
Talk about some paper if you tryin to book me
Ma, you can keep your head
I got, expensive habits that need the bread

[Chorus]
Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, bake this thing for me
Cause you just flow so viciously
Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, bake this thing for me
Cause you just flow so viciously

"Let's go do the bump.. give me that funky stuff" {*repeat 4X*}

[Nate Dogg]
I like the way you shakin that ass, so don't stop
Slang that ass like I used to slang rocks
Bend over trick let me get to that spot
Later on you can lick on my lollipop
I like the way you shakin that ass, so don't quit
You know you get a hella response from my dick
Don't put your fuckin clothes back on 'til you rich
The type of woman I want tonight, a straight bitch!
