Verse: Pharrell Williams]
Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes cause you love me
(I'm sorry but.. so sexy)
So you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe cause you love me (Uh, you do it well)
So then we tried - ain't feeling this love now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast wetouched)
Then we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up (tear ya ass up)


[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on, nevermind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin (you know I want ya babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (you should stop frontin babe)

[Verse: Pharrell Williams]
Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gon' palm her ass like it was
And she's gon love it (whoa-oh whoa, yeah yeah)
So then we tried - ain't feeling this love now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast wetouched)
Then we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up (tear ya ass up)


[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Verse: Jay-Z]
Everytime your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant infront of an audience
Like if you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told you do me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be frontin when I'm feeling Denzel
And you acting like you ain't appealing but you are
Stuting like you ain't my only girl but you are (I was justfrontin)
I'm ready to stop when you are

[Chorus]

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Dance, ooooooh ooooh
Whoa-oh, oh ohhhh
Dance, ooooooh ooooh
Whoa-oh, oh ohhhh
