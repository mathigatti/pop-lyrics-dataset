Jay-Z -

Beyonce -
Partna let me upgrade u
I hear you be the block
But I'm the lights that keeps the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash tho
I'm known to walk alone but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink aint appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy
Dont doubt yourself
Trust me, you need me
This aint a shoulder with a chip, or an ego
But what you think they all mad at me fo'?
You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
And Ima help you build up your account (That's a good look, better yet a hood look, ladies that's a good look)
Believe me
When you're in those big meetings for the mils (That's a good look)
You take me just to compliment the deal (That's a good look)
Anything you cop I split the bill (That's a good look, better yet a hood look, ladies that's a good look)
Believe me

Beyonce:
I can do for you what Martin did for the people
Ran by the man but the women keep the tempo
Its very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal
Stilll play my part and let you take the lead role
Believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever you need me
I see your hustle, with my hustle I can keep you
Focused on your focus I can feed you
You need a real woman in your life ( That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly ( that's a good look)
I can help you build up your account ( That's a good look, better let a hood look, ladies that's a good look)
Believe me
When you're in the big meetings for the mils ( That's a good look)
You take me just to compliment the deal ( That's a good look)
Anything you cop I split the bill ( That's a good look, better yet a hood look, ladies that's a good look)

Jay-Z:
I be the d-boy who infiltrted all the corporate dudes
They call shots I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, bubbles Loraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big ballin baby when I'm caught in you
I'm talking spa bags and fly pads and rooms at, the Bloomberg
And rumors, you on the verge of a new merge
Cuz that rock on your finger's like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me they watchin and we just yachtin'
Island hoppin off the Omafi coast
Mafioso, Hov baby you ever seen satin?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You sure to see stars
This is high level not eye level
My bezzle courtesy of Audemars
I'll order yours tomorrow now look at the time I saved ya
Mama let me upgrade u

Beyonce:
Just when you think you had it all
Big ends, car notes, collectin cars
Picture your life elevated with me
Make you my project celebrity
I'll keep your name hot in them streets
That makes the diamond really shine
And you already is a star but
Unless you're flawless,
Then your dynasty aint complete without a chief like me
