I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit
About how to give and take
I'm I'm I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit
About how to give and take
I'm I'm new soul

I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money Cash Hoes
I'm from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like fuck critics you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits well I don't give a shit so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads fuckers
I don't know what you take me as
or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches nigga I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me

I'm I'm I'm I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit
About how to give and take
I'm I'm I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit
About how to give and take take take take take

The year is '94 and in my trunk is raw
In my rear view mirror is the mother fucking law
I got two choices yall pull over the car or
bounce on the double put the pedal to the floor
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with jake
Plus I got a few dollars I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
And I heard "Son do you know why I'm stopping you for?
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Do I look like a mind reader sir, I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo?
Well you was doing fifty five in a fifty four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you I know a lot of you are
I ain't stepping out of shit all my papers legit
Do you mind if I look round the car a little bit?
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk and the back
And I know my rights so you gon' need a warrant for that
Aren't you sharp as a tack are some type of lawyer or something?
Or somebody important or something?
Nah I ain't passed the bar but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
Well see how smart you are when the K-9's come
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
Hit me

I'm I'm I'm I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit
About how to give and take
I'm I'm I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit
About how to give and take
