[Kelly Price (Jay-Z)]
Talking: Throughout my life (uh huh uh huh uh)
No matter what I've done. (Right)
You've been merciful and your love endureth (yeah)
Through all things (ye yeah) For that
I am eternally grateful


Since my date of birth
Bought you nothing but hurt
Play those video games
Stole change from ya purse
Sat on the cold court bench
'Til I was arraigned in ya skirt
Saw the pain in ya face
Through you maintained a smirk
All you did was motivate me
Don't let 'em hold you back
What I do I turned around
And I sold you crack
I was a bastard for that
Still I'm drowning in shame
Just remember one thing now
You're not to blame
You was newly seperated
Tryin' to escape ya world
And through my thirst
I didn't help you
I just made things worse
I hated me and everybody
That created crack
Had me thinkin'
The newest kicks and the latest gat
Still haven't apologized
So please play this back
While I try to come to terms
With such a heinous act
You know in more than one way
Cocaine numbs the brain
All I did was think about
How the funds once came
Then I ran across this memory
And it stung the brain
How can you ever destroy the beauty
From which one came
That's a savage you're the reason
Why me and these beats make a marriage
Why I rhyme above average and
I ain't shit
Glad you got yourself together
No thanks to me
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
You must love me

[Chorus (K. Price) (You must love me repeats in background)]
Say that you love me
All I know say that you must love me
Ohh yeah

We used to fight every night
But I never would suffer
Just smile my big brother's
Tryna make me tougher
As we grew fussing and fighting continued
As I plundered through ya stuff
And snuck ya clothes to school
Got intense real intense
As we got older
Never believed it would lead
To be popped in one of ya shoulda
With my rings knew you had it
'Cause you took too long
As Mickey, Andy, and the girl that bought it looked on
Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand
Told you step outside
Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
Made our way down the steps
Maybe you thought it was just a threat
Or maybe ya life was just that crazy
And you was beggin' for death
Try to justify this in my young mind
But ya drillin' it
And my ego hurt combined
Drove me berzerk
Saw the devil in your eyes
High off more than weed
Confused I just closed
My young eyes and squeezed
What a sound
Opened my eyes just in time
To see ya stumbling to the ground
Damn what the fuck I done now
Runnin' around in a circle
Thinking I'm assed out
Hot gun burnin' my waist
Ran straight to Jazz' house
Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga
And ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga
Left the scene how could I go out that way
Still you asked to see me in the hospital ya next day
You must love me

[Chorus (You must love me repeats in background)]
What after all the wrong I've done
I know you must

Everything in my power and within my frame
To protect you from this life and
Keep you away from the game
But you was one of the few people
That I can trust
And the fact of the matter I slang
These pies for us
You put the pressure on me dearly
Rarely would you let it go
Was a thousand and one times
I had to tell you no
When it was one of those days
When nobody was around
And I needed emergency trip
Out of town
Searched my mental rolodex
For all the numbers I know
As you stared in my face
Asking me could you go
I'm agreed said sender
Everything'll go smooth
Just tell her what to do
And everything'll go through
Strapped her body with them thangs
As you boarded the plane
Couldn't explain these strange feelings
That I caught and the pain
I'm thinkin' why would I send you
When I knew it ain't right
I'm thinkin' what would
Make you sacrifice ya life
You must love me

After everything that I've done wrong
I know inside you must love me
I know that you love me
You showed me I know it
I know
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
I know you must love me
Oh yes you do
Inside I know it
You've always shown it
You love me yea yeah
oh, yeah
I know that you love me
