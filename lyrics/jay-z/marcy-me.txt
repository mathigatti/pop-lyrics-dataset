Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest one representing BK to the fullest
Bastards duckin' when Hov be buckin'
Chicken-heads be cluckin'


Back when ratchet was a ratchet and the vixen was a vixen
And Jam Master Jay was alive I was mixin'
Cookin' coke in the kitchen
Back when Rodman was a Piston
Mike was losin' to Isiah, but he soon would get his sixth one
Gave birth to my verbal imagination
Assume a virtue if you have not
Or better yet here's a verse from Hamlet
"Lord, we know who we are
Yeah, we know not what we may be"
So maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy
I'm from Marcy houses, where the boys die by the thousand
Back when Pam was on Martin
Yeah, that's where it all started
When Denzel was blottin' carpet, I'd pack a nine millimeter
When Slick Rick made "Mona Lisa"
When Lisa Bonet was Beyoncé of her day, I had divas, y'all
Think I just popped up in this bitch like a fetus? Nah
Pregnant pause, give you some second thoughts
There's room on the bandwagon, don't abort
Marcy me

Marcy me
Streets is my artery, the vein of my existence
I'm the Gotham City heartbeat
I started in lobbies now, probably with Saudis
Sufi to the goofies, I could probably speak Farsi
That's poetry read a coca leaf from my past
Came through the bushes smellin' like roses
I need a trophy just for that
Old Brooklyn not this new shit, shift feel like a spoof
Fat laces in your shoe I'm talkin' bustin' off the roof
Hold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke
Y'all flirtin' with death, I be winkin' through the scope
Shout out to all the murderers turned murals
Plural fuck the Federal Bureau
Shout out to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle
All the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile
Shout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes
Thus concludin' my concerto; Marcy me

[The-Dream]
Must be in the air
Oh, can't walk away, I know, I know
Just the way I was raised
I know, I know, I know
Oh Marcy, Marcy me
Just the way I am always gonna be
I ain't gonna change, no
Marcy, Marcy me, just the way I am
(Como as minhas [mãos?] tocando aquí
Eu não canto do mundo, o meu tempo)
