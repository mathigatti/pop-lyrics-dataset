No clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame (Eh eh)
Comin' down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone
We Rockafella (Eh eh)
We fly higher than weather
And G5's are better
You know me
An anticipation for precipitation
Stacks chips for the rainy day(Eh eh)
Jay, rain man is back
With lil Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where are you at?

You had my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny Cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share

Because ...

When the sun shines
We'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath Imma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my Umbrella
You can stand under my Umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)

You're becoming a dream to me
A fairytale fantasy
Nothing can never compare
An Image to my memory

And girl I'm asking could you be my queen?
A vision on a magazine
That's when I'll be there
It's something we both share

Because...

When the sun shine
We'll shine together
You know I'll be here forever
Although it's a lot of rain outside
Girl it's gettin late and you can stay the night
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car I ain't tryna stress ya
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl you can be my cinderella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
You can be my cinderella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
You can be my cinderella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
You can be my cinderella
(ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)

You can run into my arms

It's okay don't be alarmed

Come into me

There no distance in between our love...

So gone and say my name some more

I'll be all you need and more

Because

When the sun shines
We'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'm stick it out til the end
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car i aint tryna stress ya
I'm lookin for the one with glass slipper
Baby girl you can be my cinderella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
You can be my cinderella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)

It's raining (raining)
Ooh baby it's raining (raining)
Baby come here to me (Oh!)
Come into me
