Hello Brooklynnnnn!!!!!!!!

(Chorus-Lil' Wayne)
hello brooklyn how you doing
where you going and can i come too
and if i can imma be your man
you could be my lady and have my baby
and drive my car and drive me crazy
wherever your going baby girl just take me
cause im so taken if you taken
Im just saying baby im just saying


(Verse 1-Jay-Z)
like a mamma you birthed me, brooklyn you nursed me
schooled me with hard knocks, better than Burkley
they say you murked me by the time i was 21
that shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
hello brooklyn, if we had a daughter
guess what imma call her, Brooklyn Carter
when i left you for Virginia it didnt offend ya
cause you know i only stepped out to get dinner
and im eating, too much or just extra
so much so that dinner now turned into breakfast
i only roll lexus to hug your road
i love your corners, im half your soul
Hello Brooklyn

(Chorus-Lil' Wayne)
hello brooklyn how you doing
where you going can i come too
and if i can imma be your man
you could be my lady and have my baby
and drive my car and drive me crazy
wherever your going baby girl just take me
cause im so taken if you taken
Im just saying baby im just saying
hello brooklyn

(Verse 2-Lil'Wayne)
whats your story, she said she's eating on the run but she aint Nore
she said she's got a man but he aint worried
but baby imma have to ride him like Orie
she said she love B.I.G. and she likes Tupac
and when i said Jay-z she said it's the roc
imma leave it like this like this like that
where brooklyn at, where brooklyn at

have you seen her, and when she tell you something you better believe her
she told me she like my New Orleans deminer
and so i said goodbye Katrina and Hello Brooklyn

(Chorus 2-Lil'Wayne)
but baby you are the sweetest site eyes could see
i said hello brooklyn, but baby i hope you never say goodbye to me
i said hello broklyn, but baby you are so dahm fine to me
and i remember the time, place and the weather from the day you said hi to me
and i say hello brooklyn

(Verse 3-Jay-Z)
Brooklyn you crazy look how you made me
razor blades in my mouth walking 'round behaving
or demented black hoodies and timerlanded
always scheming you see the gleem on that niggas pendant
hello Brooklyn, you bad influence
look what you had me doing
but i aint mad at you, look at my attitude it says my life's too real
check out my ice grill baby im cold as ice
i come from Brownsville but my +beds in the stye+
blow la la +Flatten your Bush+ till we smoking C.I.
what up to the boy D.I. you know i handle B.I.
i dont half step on a cane as them feds 'bout I
how you want it slow she like it hard cold
so i grind slow iller than out in time square mall back in the 9-0
my fine Hoe we got some victims to catch
so in a couple years baby imma bring you some next

(Chorus-Lil' Wayne)
hello brooklyn how you doing
where you going and can i come too
and if i can imma be your man
you could be my lady and have my baby
and drive my car and drive me crazy
wherever your going baby girl just take me
cause im so taken if you taken
Im just saying baby im just saying
hello brooklyn

(Lil'Wayne)
but baby you are the sweetest thing eyes could see
i said hello brooklyn, but baby i hope you never say goodbye to me
i said hello broklyn, but baby you are so dahm fine to me
and i remember the time, place and the weather from the day you said hi to me
and i say hello brooklyn
