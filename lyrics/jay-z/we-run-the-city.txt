Feeling it coming in the air,
Hear the screams from everywhere,
I'm addicted to thrill,
Its a dangerous love affair,
Can't be scared when nickels down,
Got a problem tell me now,
Only thing thats on my mind is who gon run this town tonight,
Who gon run this town tonite,
We gon run this town!


We are,
Yeah i said it we are,
This is roc nation,
Pledge your allegiance,
Get your fatigues on,
All black everything,
Black cards, blacks cars,
All black everything,
And that girls a black birds riding with their dillingers,
I get more in depth,
If you boys really real enough
This is la familia, i'll explain later,
But for now let me get back to this paper,
I'm a couple bands down,
And im tryin get back,
I gave doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks,
Me im talking 5 comma 6 zero's, got zero's,
Back to running circles round, nigga
Now we squared up, hold uuuup

Life's a game and but its not fair,
I break the rules so i don't care,
So i keep doing my own thing,
Walking tall against the rain,
Victory's within the mile,
Almost there don't give up now,
Only thing thats on my mind is who's gon run this town tonight,
Heeeeey, heeeey, heeeey
Who's gon run this town tonite,

We are,
Yeah i said it we are,
You can call me ceasar,
In a dark ceasar,
Please follow the leader,
So eric b we are,
Microphone fiend, this the return of the god,
Peace god,
Ah ah,
It aint no nobody fresher,
Im in mason, ah, martin, margella,
On the table screaming fuck the other side they jealous,
We got a banquet full of broads,
They got a table full of fella's,
Yeaaaahh, and they aint spending no cake,
They should throw they hand in cos they aint got no spades,
Yeah, my whole team got dough,
So my banquet is looking like millionaires row.
Yeaaaaah.

Life's a game and but its not fair,

Its crazy how you can go from being joe blow,
To everybody on your dick, no homo,

Next time i'm in church please no photos,
Police escorts, everybody passports,
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life we are on a crash course
What you think i rap for to push a fucking rav 4,
But i know that if i stay stunting,
All these girls only gon want one thing,
I can spend my whole life good will hunting,
Only good gon come is its good when im coming,
She got an ass that will swallow up a g-string,
And up top ahh, 2 bee stings,
And im beasting off the re sling,
And my nigga just made it out the precinct,
We give a damn bout the drama that your dude bring,
Im just tryin change the color of your mood ring,
Reebok baby, you need to try some new things,
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
Whats that ye? baby these heels,

You trippin when you aint sippin, have a refill
You feel like you running huh, now you know how we feel,

Heeeeey, heeeey, heeeeey,
We gon run this town tonight,
