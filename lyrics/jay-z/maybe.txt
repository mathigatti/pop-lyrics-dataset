I just want you to uhh, listen to me,
Smooth it out. aye i promise you its uhh,
Its like you've never seen it before baby.


Maybe we gotta leave it all to faith,
Maybe we gotta go our separate ways,
Maybe we gotta slow it down this time.
Cause we moving to fast to see the signs
(to fast to see the signs).
Maybe i'm scared to lose you,
Maybe i feel the same way you do,
Maybe i'm buggin out over you,
Maybe you're just to good to be true
(just to good to be true)

I say go she says stay,
I say no she says yay,
I say so before we both get to carried away,
Let's just stop.
Now i'm saying but you playing
Like you don't wanna go to the top.
This is fake you say faith,
This is foriegn if i'm going to far,
Do it even fathom baby maybe i just made a mistake,
Tell me i ain't make a mistake.
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.
I'm so sick of fighting, not many sick inside.
Uh live or die baby sink or swim or uh...
Uh sick and tired of being sick and tired,
I'm so sick of fighting not many sick inside.
Baby live or die baby sink or swim,
Or uh leave i get in the wind. sick and tired
Of being sick and tired,
I'm so sick not fighting not many sick inside.
Baby sink or die baby live or swim,
Or believe i get in the wind,
Uh believe i get in the win.
