[Verse 1: Drake]
I've been up for four days, getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinking how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off man, it's probably true
Cause while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night nigga
I grow tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
But I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stunting hard in his yellow goose
And I'm a motherfucking missed target
But a target none the less and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talking to themselves Hov, hands free
And I'm just filling up this daily planner
Getting busy cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talking in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammer
That's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwing you
Just know that she gonna tell another nigga when she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me


[Hook]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight and make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down, we gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'm a make it go

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls, I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flowing, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight cause the satellite was crispy
Y'all gonna miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
Ain't got a scar yet
Cause you fucking around with me and my dogs is far fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, trying to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meet, watch for the traitors
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too, all I got is this money, this'll do

[Hook]
