(Jay-Z speakin)

ROC nation wat up
Corporate thuggin wat up
its a new day
DCmix yeah


[Chorus:]
My president is black my mayback too
And I'll be goddamned if my diamonds ain't blue
My moneys dark green and my porche is light gray
I'm headed for D.C. anybody feel me

My president is black
In fact, he's half white
So even in a racist mind he's half right
So if u have a racist mind you be 'aight
My president is black
But his house is all white
Rosa Parks sat
So Martin Luther could walk
Martin Luther walked
So Barack Obama could run
Barack Obama ran
So all the children could fly
So I'ma spread my wings
So you could meet me in the sky
I already got my own clothes
Already got my own shoes
I was hot before Barack
Imagine what I'm gonna do
Hello Ms. America
Hey pretty lady
Red white and blue flag
Wave for me baby
Never though I'd say this shit
Baby im good
You can keep ya puss
I don't want no more Bush
No more war
No more Iraq
No more white lies
The President is black

CHORUS
