[Jay-Z]
Yeah...
Come experience... life as we know it
As some of you should know it, yeah, yeah
Place, Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions... well, y'all know the actions


Uhh, I got this shorty on my block always clockin my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock
He likes the way I walk, he sees my money talkin
to honies hawkin I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He wanna, run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and
gear
then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
to Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle, nobody wanna be like Michael
where I'm from, just them niggaz who banned from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on

Chorus: Jay-Z and Memphis Bleek

It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)

[Memphis Bleek]
I'm out here slingin bringin the drama, tryin to come up
in the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here servin disturbin the peace, life could be better
like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's sellin weight, I'm sellin eight... balls
sixteen tryin to graduate to pushin quarters y'all
I ain't gon' sweat him I'ma let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggaz gon' see
I'm tired of bein out here round the clock
and breakin day, and chasin crackers up the block for my pay
I'm stayin fresh, so chickens check
I'm tryin to step up to the next level, pushin Vettes to the
Jets
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibirum
and stunned I'm waitin for my day to come
I got the urge, to splurge, I don't wanna lifetime sentence
just give me the word

Chorus
