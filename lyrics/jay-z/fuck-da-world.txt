Look, look, look
A young nigga screamin fuck da world and let em die
Behind tints, tryna duck da world and smoke and ride
Got my bandana round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red ang glock on my seat
I'm tryna stya under intoxication
I lost my father and got a daughter
Plus i'm on probation
I'm drinking liquor like its water gettin pissy drunk
And stayin away from the lil broads tryna get me sunk
I keep a chopper in the trunk and a heater on my waistline
Duckin the law cuz i ain't tryna do no fed time
Sometimes i just wish i could get away
But i gotta take care of reginae
And keep ms.cetha straight
So i just maintain the struggle
And i keep trying.
But how can i when my closest people keep dying
I ain't lying like the law tryna bust my clique
But i scream fuck da world
Man i'm too young for this


Look, i don't curse,but in this verse man,
Fuck da world
I lost my father to the gun and made a lil girl
And i'm still thuggin wit my niggas tryna keep it real
Plus i'm still doing for my mother and i'm paying bills

Give me a cigarette
My nerves bad
The feds said they heard that i know where the birds at
And my ole lady said she saw me wit another brizzah
And some lil boy shot up my block and now i gotta kill em
And teachers keep tellin my mama that i'm gettin worst
And now she trippin talkin bout i need to be in church
And my lil girl whole family tryna lie in court
Tryna put me a child on child support
And my own family deny me of what i do cause i'm a thug and stuff
Plus my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin away
Man they got clowns around me killin they self everyday
We keep fighting but they strong
I know its hard don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate count ya blessing and woodie keep ya trust
And grab yo nuts and let em know we don't give a fuck

I mena this world ain't gon never change
So i just keep my head up and my nuts let em hand
Dog i swear its very rough out here for the youngsters
Like everybody against me cause i'm a young thug
Dear rabbit, why they had to kill rabbit?
But i'ma keep u alive nigga i'm lil rabbit
Thats why this lil nigga be thuggin like its no tomorrow
I can only depend on ms. cetha and c-m-r
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But i'm upset so i'm steadily wipin tears away
And police got me under surveillance when and whenever
Wreckin they brains, tryna figure where i'm gettin tha cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a damn lone
I can handle all of my business, this lil man grown
But i try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everything was cool, i wouldn't write this damn song
