Motivation for me, is them telling me what I could not be
Oh well


I felt so inspired by what the teacher said
Said id either be dead or be a reefer head
Not sure if that's how adults should speak to kids
Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class
Ill teach his ass
Even better what my uncle did
I popped my demo tape in start to beat my head
Peeked out my eye, see if he was beatin' his
He might as well said beat it kid,
He's on the list
It's like im searching for kicks
Like a sneaker head
You gon' keep pushing me til I reach the ledge
And when I reach the ledge, I tellem all to eat a dick
Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread

(Chorus)
Motivation to me, is them telling me what I could not be, oh well
Im so ambitious, I might hit two sisters,
Hey im on a mission, no matter what the conditions
Fuck the personal issues, when u go what I been thru,
hey, if you believe it, then you can conceive it


Verse 2
Had to lace up my boots, even harder
Father is to far away to father
Further, more of the kids either
Smoke reefer or either move white
Theres few writers, in my cipher
So they made lighter, my type of
Dreams seen to them, they said wise up
How many guys are? You see making it from here
The world don't like us, is that not clear, alright bruh
Im different I cant face what im gon' be, or
For what everybody isn't, they don't listen
Just whispering behind my back, no vision,
Lack of ambition, So Wack!

(Chorus) Pharrell
Motivation to me, is them telling me what I could not be, oh well
Im so ambitious, I might hit two sisters,
Hey im on a mission, no matter what the conditions
Fuck the personal issues, when u go what I been thru,
hey, if you believe it, then you can conceive it

Verse 3
Had a couple of meetings, no office yet
Maybe I aint good enough for these offices
Back to the drawing board, ducking officers
Its all good cuz the streets, is saying ?
So with or without any of your involvement
We coming for all of this, respect my conglomerate
I went from pauper to the president, cuz every deal I ever made said precedent
Niggas probably thought a 4 without 0 buddy, oh Buddy
What I do is make more money
Dear teacher, you probably somewhere speaker
Im balling out of control, can you hear my sneakers?
Fuck yall!!

(Chorus) Pharrell
Motivation to me, is them telling me what I could not be, oh well
Im so ambitious, I might hit two sisters,
Hey im on a mission, no matter what the conditions
Fuck the personal issues, when u go what I been thru,
hey, if you believe it, then you can conceive it
