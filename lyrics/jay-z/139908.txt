[Jay-Z]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh uh-uh - gettin that money my nigga

You better call the muh'fuckin cops
This is a crime, uh-uh, let's go

[R. Kelly + (Jay-Z)]
Keys to the Bentley, off to the club
Switchin lanes like what the..
Chick on the cell wanna get with a bruh
But y'all know I don't love no.. (never love her)
She, say, she, slick
I'm, like, baby, please
She, say she's got a man
but what's that got to do with me? (f'real)
Some chicks like low-key
Wrists of, zero degrees
I'm, toxic off the Belve'
Two strippers, in my hotel suite
Fee fie and, foe fum-ah
Look out now, here I come-ah
For you haters, keepin up trauma
Me and Jigga thugged out on the come up (holla)

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
You got what I want; I got what you need
Let's put it together; get, this, mo-ney
You got what I want; I got what you need
Let's put it together; get, this, mo-ney

[R. Kelly + (Jay-Z)]
Ace hit the club 'bout five o'clock (woo!)
Hungry 'bout to hit the IHOP (let's go)
After that, menage-a-trois
And he out by seven o'clock (p-YOON)
Cause I'm a baller, thought I told ya
Blue rocks lightin up my shoulders (bling!)
See y'all niggaz know y'all need to grow up
Your album ain't out, cause I'm the hold up (ha)
Busters wanna hoop with me
Wanna run our ways, doin R&amp;B
I'll, creep creep, blink blink
Cross your ass over, take it from me
Fee fie and, foe fum-ah
Look out now, here I come-ah
Golddiggers, this you gets none of
Me and Jigga thugged out on the come up (holla)

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z + (R. Kelly)]
Pull up on the block, cran-apple Benz
White tank top, cran-apple trim
Egg-shaped watch, cran-apple gems
Dice hands 'side both of them
Two rolls and I leave with a stack
Off to the club, G's in in the back
V.I.P. nigga beez like that
When you gettin that money my nigga (get.. this.. mo-ney)
I spit this for my riders
Twenty-inch rims and wide body drivers
We can't let nothin stop us (get.. this.. mo-ney)
Young H-O-V-A
And the boy R. Kel', you know how we play
For that fetti, mayne, we'll let the lead rang
You young boyz ain't ready
You don't know NANN a nigga to NEAR Jigga

Yeah it's money, recognize the smell
And we up out this bitch, yell

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z + (R. Kelly)]
Gettin that money my nigga
Ha ha, ha ha
