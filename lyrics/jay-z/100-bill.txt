My life has got to be like this, it's got to keep going up
I've been in several things, I was in the drug business, then I was in the oil business but I'm not in either one now you understand?
I had my own little business on the side, a sort of sideline
A rather confidential sort of thing...but you might make a nice bit of money


100 dolla bill

Benjamin Franklins filled, folded just for the thrill
Go numb until I can't feel, or might pop this pill
Stock markets just crash, now I'm just a bill
History don't repeat itself it rhymes, 1929 still
Write like Mark Twain, Jay Gatsby, I park things
Yellow cars, yellow gold like Slick Rick
Still tip on four-four's (Who?)
Four-four's at the 4-0, (Wait), for O
Dollars fall on the skin, some might call it sin
Politicians all move for money, what the hell are we callin' them?
Low life, I'm crawlin' out, 911 I Porsched it out
Y'all niggas so hypocrites, y'all know what this shit is all about
100 dolla, 100 dolla bill real, uh

New heroines, new Marilyns
Move coke through Maryland
Through Easton, oh you beastin'
Move fat packs, Jack Gleason
The honeymoon's over with the streets, yeah
Least see my kids on the weekend
Carter, new Kennedy
No ordinary Joe, you'll remember me
No prohibition for my coalition
Colin Powell, general admission
You're all welcome, new Malcolm of the talcum
By any means, AK lookin' out the window screen
Let's get it on, new Marvin
Who wanna become my 100th problem?
Semi-automatic or revolver, semi-automatic I'll solve em
Einstein, my mind, this MC move white squares with my relatives
That cheese made us constipated couldn't tell us shit
Took that, Taylor Swift to a hundred fucking million, bitch
I'mma let yaâ€™ll continue but... haha

I need a 100 bricks on them 100 blocks
I got a 100 drops, took 100 cops, uh
100 blocks, I need a 100 bricks on them 100 blocks, uh
Decade of decadence, ill reverence, irreverence
Decade of decadence, ill reverence, ill reverence
Uh, young, uh
