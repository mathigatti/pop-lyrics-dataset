[Jay-Z]
(Bitch) you know my name and the company I own
(Bitch) you like my style and you smell my cologne
(Bitch) don't try to act like my track-record ain't known
(Bitch) you probably gotta couple CD's in your home
(Bitch) don't make me say it twice, you acting all up tight
Also diddy like, like, like
You ain't a (Bitch), I ain't no ball player, you ain't gonna get pregnant again
Hit off with paper, you gonna get hit off and slid off
Before the neighbors take off to go to work
So just, take off your shirt, don't hit me with that church shit
(Bitch) I got a sister who schooled me to shit you chickens do
Tricking fools, got a whole Robin Givens crew that I kick it to
They be hipping dudes, how you chickens move, I be listening to
(Bitch) (Bitch) (Bitch)
Don't make me say it thrice, you acting all up tight
Also diddy like, like
You ain't a (Bitch), You ain't no better cuz you don't be fucking rappers

Say Jay-Z, why you gotta go and disrespect the women for? Uh

[Jay-Z]
(Bitch) Sisters get respect, bitches get what they deserve
SIsters work hard, bitches work your nerves
Sisters hold you down, bitches hold you up
Sisters help you progress, bitches will slow you up
Sisters cook up a meal, play their role with the kids
Bitches in street with their nose in your biz
Sisters tell the truth, bitches tell lies
Sisters drive cars, bitches wanna ride
Sisters give-up the ass, bitches give-up the ass
Sisters do it slow, bitches do it fast
Sisters do their dirt outside of where they live
Bitches have niggers all up in your crib
Sisters tell you quick "you better check your homie"
Bitches don't give a fuck, they wanna check for your homie
Sisters love Jay cuz they know how 'Hov is
I love my sisters, I don't love no bitch
