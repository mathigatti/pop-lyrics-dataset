Storm - Lenny Kravitz Ft. Jay-Z
[Verse 1] (Lenny Kravitz)
My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love


[Chorus]
I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?

[Verse 2]
At night, I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love

[Chorus]
I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?

[Verse 3](Jay-Z)
I got the bounce Lenny
Check me out
Brooklyn's bad boy back again
Feet hit the ground runnin' and my back's to the wind
Angels on my shoulders, head in the clouds
No, I'm not rappin', I'm just thinkin' real loud
My karma's my armor, my charm and wit
Is like a lethal bomb, I'm warm and s***
And I did bad for good but when you're trapped in the 'hood
You do worse for less, homie earth's a test
Only god can judge me
My heart ain't ugly
But the thoughts that I drop is heavy
Try budge me
Mama loved me, pop left me
Still the homies call me lucky lefty
I'm flashy and bentley
Deceptively smart
I make hustlin' heaven and pimpin' an art
Long as I know that I'm blessed
'Cause I'm loved in depth
I can walk through the water and not get wet
I'm that fresh

[Chorus]
I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?

[Bridge] (Jay-Z)
 There you have it
Young hov, Lenny Kravitz
Not your average
Get your umbrella
It's raining macs and broads
all grace to god

[Chorus]
I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?
