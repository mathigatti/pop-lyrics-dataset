Everything, everything this my only single thing
Everything I hear is my answer
And if you think I say, then innocent if I say?
I never hear that, I be in the posse
Never seen a ceiling in my whole life
Everything I seen, everything is rotten
Never sit in silence, innocent is Carter
Innocent we seek them
I and say we see them
Everything I feed, everything I read
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka
Everything in shaka, everything in faka
Everything in shaka, everything in faka


I got bloodlines in Benin, that explains the voodoo
Got poison in my pen, thank God for Lulu
And thank the heavens for BB, her Creole roots run deeply
I'm crazy, you ever leave me I might have to put on a gris-gris
Spell for us to stay together
Facelessness
Maison Margiela embracing

'Cause we family
We, we, we, family

'Cause more than ever we gon' have to stick together, feel me?
More than ever my niggas gon' have to stick together, feel me?
Already ahead of your end, in the foreign bumping Fela, feel me?
Was out in Havana when that had that banned forever, feel me?
Fuck embargoes, I'm a narco
Colombian ties, shout out to Dapo
OG Juan also

'Cause we family
We, we, we, family

Feel me?
All the fellas from the favelas 'round me, feel me?
Lagos, all the barrios 'round me, feel me?
Bismillah, all the gods around me
Mexicanos ain't building fucking walls around me

'Cause we family
We, we, we, family

I feel like Ali
Viet Cong never done shit to me, feel me?
More worried about Trump than anyone overseas, feel me?
I'm out in the art clubs in London sipping tea, feel me?
I'm out in Michelangelos in FTs

'Cause we family
We, we, we, family, feel me?
