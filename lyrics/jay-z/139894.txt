Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
Secret society tryna keep they eye on me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
I can't die, I can't die, I can't die


This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win
But then again, maybe it's for the best though
'Cause when they're saying too much
You know they're trying to get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out, couldn't understand
The mechanics and the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine to five is how you survive, I ain't trying to survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body
I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
That's right it's wicked, that's life I live it
Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins, ends
I break bread with the late heads
Picking their brains for angles on, all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us
And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils

Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die, I can't die, I can't die

We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinking back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned so in turn I'm kidnapping his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feeding her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feeding her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee, we used to stay up all night
At slumber parties, now I'm tryna rock this bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close, now I see his fears
Through her tears know she's wishing we were still close
Don't cry, it is to be, in time
I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils

Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die, I can't die, I can't die

My flesh, no nigga could test, my soul is possessed
By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The Exorcist got me doing sticks like: Homie
You don't know me, but the whole world owe me, strip!
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
So now I'm down for whatever ain't nothing nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me
I can't be held accountable, D'evils beating me down, boo
Got me running with guys making G's, telling lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower
For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers
Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify D'evils

Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die, I can't die, I can't die
