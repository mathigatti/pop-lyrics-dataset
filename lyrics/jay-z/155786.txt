[intro: wayne marshall] + (vybz kartel)
Original dancehall remix from kingston jamaica, star trak!!!
(up to di time) turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, wow!!!


[verse 1: jay-z] + (pharrell)
Everytime your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant infront of an audience
Like if you was just another shorty i put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told you do me for a loop, this hov
I'm too old to be frontin when i'm feeling denzel
And you acting like you ain't appealing when you are
Stunting like you ain't my only girl when you are (i was just
Frontin)
I'm ready to stop when you are

[verse 2: vybz kartel]
Jay-z, marshall, kartel and pharrell pha-real
Roc-a-wear apparel for real
Girlfriend your friends and you full of a sex appeal
You have the best for texture feel
And to kim, karyn, nicole or ce'cile
Now for my lovefor you in time will reveal
Mi a go make you wear a ring like shaquille o' neal
Keep it real with me and i'll keep it real, you know

[verse 3: wayne marshall]
Don't be fooled by my glitter and my fame girl
Cause it's you that i really wanna share my name, yeah, my name
Yo, hey, a lot of girls come and go with the hype up
To me you mean more than just one night, yo, one night

[chorus: pharrell &amp; wayne marshall]
I know that i'm carrying on, never mind if i'm showing off
I was just frontin (you know i want ya babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know i want ya (you should stop frontin babe)

[verse 4: vybz kartel]
Listen, and you will hear wedding bells in my ear
Reception in spain honeymoon in zaire
Mi need yuh fi breed by di end of this year
Of if you girl fi mi brighten my world fi mi
This isn't comedy like fresh prince of bel air
Mi serious when mi tell yuh seh mi love and mi care

Double king size bed deh yah, wid di linen fit here

[verse 5: wayne marshall]
Don't be fooled by my glitter and my fame girl
Cause it's you that i really wanna share my name, yeah, my name
Yo, hey, a lot of girls come and go with the hype up
To me you mean more than just one night, yo, one night

[chorus]

[verse 6: wayne marshall]

Yo, hey, a lot of girls come and go with the hype up
To me you mean more than just one night, yo, one night

[chorus]

[outro: wayne marshall] + (vybz kartel)
Oh, girl i never really mean to front (never meant)
I know you probably think i'm drunk

You know we don't play no stunts (straight up)

But i'm just being blount
You know we don't play no stunts
