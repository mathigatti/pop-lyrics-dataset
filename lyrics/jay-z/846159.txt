Everybody listen all over the world 
I got a story 'bout my favorite girl (Wait a minute) 


Oh, my baby sexy for sure 
I had to have him when he walked through the door (Wait a minute) 

She was 'bout to drive me insane 
She come with drama while I'm giving her chains (Wait a minute) 

I'm focused but I'm losing control 
He only wants me for my body zone (Wait a minute) 

Girl, why you do me like that? 
You take all my money 
Can't even call a player back (Wait a minute) 
Boy, why you tripping like that? 
You think 'cause you tricking you get it just like that? (Wait a minute) 

Minding my business, I was doing my thing 
Got my attention, so I gave him a chance (Wait a minute) 
Did I mention he was buying a bar? 
Gave him my number, he was trying so hard (Wait a minute) 
Bought me some things I didn't want, didn't need 
Dropped down his jeans like I'm supposed to drop to my knees (Wait a minute) 
He been blowing up my phone like he know me 
Been leaving messages "You know what you owe me" (Wait a minute)

Slow your roll 
Who you think you jiving? 
You're disturbing my flow (Wait a minute) 
Why you be bugging? 
Like I'm some kind of hoe 
Got no more questions and I want you to go 
So break (Break) 

Hey, let me talk to you for a minute 
Shut up...shut up 

I love the way you strut 
Girl, you already know 
But, I'm feeling like you don't want me 
You just after my dough 

Baby, please, I'm fine 
I'm not one of these hoes 
Chasing dreams not diamond rings 
So don't call me no more 
(Wait a minute)

So you can keep that 
Wait a minute... 
Uh yeah, you can give that back
