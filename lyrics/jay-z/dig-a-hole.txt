Chorus

Told you to get your money when you see a boss coming
Thought sh*t was funny, but what, what you say now
Learn how to accomplish, I done came, I done conquered
Now what's that you talking bout, we gonna see now


Dig a hole
Dig a hole
Dig a hole
Go 'head bury yourself

Verse One

I'm still here mon frair
You know the cost I bear
They like, that's why they call you HOV
I'm like yeah, I'm like Air

Little shots go through me
Won't tear one tissue
No tears no tissue,
Not an issue

Don't cry for me
I peep these ni**as from deep
Got a front row seat
Even if we don't speak

Silent partner
I hear you loud and clear
You left your fingerprint
You ain't gotta be there

I'm just waiting for you to dig a hole
Big enough
To put your whole body in
And then I'm gonna body them

It's nothing but a hobby to him
Simple as serve and volley to him
Ni**as is like HOV
Why don't you get it old boy

Why kill a puppet
And leave Geppetto alive
Why not wait to catch 'em all together
This way you dig one big hole one time

Verse Two

How is ni**as dissing me
I made it possible
For ni**as to make history
How is this possible

Please explain this sh*t to me
How is it logical
Have we forgotten our history
Let's open our Bibles

It's like the Disciples dissing Jesus
Becoming His rivals
Shunning the one thing
That they owe they life to

You let that man hype you
To go against your idol
Knowing good and goddamn well
This what I do

You think I'm in the office
I'm off my grind
That's how kids become orphans
You lost your mind

I keep my enemies close
I give 'em enough rope
They put themselves in the air
I just kick away the chair

Chorus

Verse Three

HOV gonna get you
I ain't forget yo little disrespect
No HOV daddy gonna spank you
For that sh*t you said

It's hard to do
When you ain't got nothing to prove
Everybody know you better
But you in a lose lose

Cuz even when you win
Ultimately you lose
Real ni**as is like
Why is HOV talking to dude

He sells in the 2's
Only time you went plat
My chain was on your neck
That's an actual fact

So I'm praying
That it spills outside of the booth
That's when y'all ni**as
Outside of ya truth

Outside of ya league
That's not what you do
Ni**as throwing Roc signs
Outside of ya coupe, oh

Don't look at HOV
Like he did something wrong to him
Cuz he's onto him
He just took what belong to him

Ni**as playing checkers
With chess playing HOV
This game is over, I dunno know if you know
You in the hole

Chorus
