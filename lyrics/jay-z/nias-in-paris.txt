So I ball so hard muhf*ckas wanna fine me
But first ni**as gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a muhf*ka like me
Can you please remind me?
Ball so hard, this sh*t crazy
Ya'll don't know that don't sh*t phase me
The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this sh*t gravy
Ball so hard, this sh*t weird
We ain't even spose to be here,
Ball so hard, Since we here
It's only right that we be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to be go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don't tick tok
Audemars thats losing time, Hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard, I'm shocked too, I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting f*cked up too
Ball so hard, let's get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
B**ch behave, Just might let you meet Ye,
Chi towns D. Rose, I'm movin'the Nets to BK


Ball so hard muhf*ckas wanna fine me
That sh*t crazy
That sh*t crazy
That sh*t crazy
Ball so hard muhf*ckas wanna fine me
That sh*t crazy
That sh*t crazy
That sh*t crazy

She said Ye can we get married at the mall?
I said look you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
That sh*t crazy, Ain't it Jay?
What she order, fish filet
Your whip so cold, this old thing
Act like you'll ever be around muhf***as like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
F**k ol girl she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French but I'm in France (I'm just sayin')
Prince William's ain't do it right if you ask me
Cause if I was him I would have married Kate &amp; Ashley
What's Gucci my ni**a?
What's Louie my killa?
What's drugs my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest
Cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh!

Ball so hard muhf*ckas wanna fine me
Ball so hard muhf*ckas wanna fine me

You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggaas is lyin
Actin' like the summer ain't mine

I got that hot bitch in my home

You know how many hot b**ches I own
Don't let me in my zone
Don't let me in my zone
Don't let me in my zone
Don't let me in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm bout to kill it
How you know, I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone

I'm definitely in my zone
