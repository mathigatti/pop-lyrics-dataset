(Pharrell)
You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot..

(Jay Z)
Everybody's like, 'He's no item. Please don't like him.
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!'
Now she don't like him, she never met him.
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em.
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em.
Better them than me, she don't agree with him.
She's mad at that, he's not havin that,
so those opposites attract like mag-a-nets.
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along
with a flashy nigga braggin on the song.
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that.
He 2 ways her, so she writes back.
Smiley faces after all of her phrases.
Either she the one or I'm caught in the matrix.
Fuck it, let the Fish-burn
Red or green pill, you live and you learn. C'mon!

(Pharrell)
Sex-cuse me... damn!

(Jay Z)
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one

(Pahrrell)
You're so contagious, I can't take it

(Pharrell)
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it

(Jay Z)
Gotta throw on Scooby Doo's, hehehehe

(Pharrell)
Ex-cuse me; what's your name? You so foxy girl
So hot to trot.. la-dy! What's your name?

(Jay Z)
Love let's go half on a son. I know my past ain't one.
You can easily get past, but that chapter is done.
But I'm done readin for now.
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now.
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role.
I'm bout to give you all the keys and security codes.
'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin.
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?

(Pharrell)
Sex-cuse me... damn!
