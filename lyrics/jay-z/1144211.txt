Poor me, dad was gone, finally got my dad back
Liver bad he wouldn't live long, they snatched my dad back
Guidance I never had that, streets was my second home
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
A place to study math at, matter fact I learned it all
Burnt it all this music is where I bury the ashes at
Flash back not having much, not having that
Had to get some hollerest you can holla back at
Holla that my Jewish lawyer do enjoy the fruit of within my cash stack
Just in case a nigga got to use his rat-ta-ta-ta-tat
Own boss own yawt, masters, slave
The mentality I carry with me to this very day
Fuck rich let's get wealthy who else gonna feed we
If I need it I'm gonna get it however God help me


(And I don't need no hook for this shit!!!!)

I'm so for sure is known for sure
Stay out of trouble, momma said as momma sighs
Her fear her youngest son being victim of homocide
But I got to get you out of here momma or I'm gonna -- die
Inside -- and either way you lose me momma so let loose of me
I got the rain our direction'll soon change
To live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game
Hustle cane, hustle clothes or hustle music
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick
Skinny nigga toothpick but, but I do lift
Weight like I'm using roids Rolls Royce
Keep my movements smooth while maneuvering
Through all the manuers in the sewers that I grew up in
Choices we make trying to escape

(And I don't need no hook for this shit!!!)

This is not for commercial usage
Please don't categorize this is music
Please don't compare me to other rappers
Compare me to trappers I'm more Frank Lucas than Ludacris
And Luda's my dude I ain't trying to diss
Like Frank Lucas is cool but I ain't trying to snitch
I'm gonna follow the rules no matter how much time I'm gonna get
I'm gonna live and die with the decisions that I'm gonna pick
So fuck the haven for cave in, that's why we don't speak
Made men ain't supposed to make statements
End of the story I followed the code cracked the safe
Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate
Leave that boy Hov alone why don't you
You don't have to if you don't want to but don't say I didn't warn you

Oh (And I don't need no hook for this shit!!!)
