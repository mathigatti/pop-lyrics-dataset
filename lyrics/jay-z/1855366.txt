[Chorus: Sample of "A Billi" by Jay-Z (Red Cafe)]
RAH, I'm Ill, I'm Ill, I'm Ill,
RAH, RAH, I'm Ill, (I'm Ill)
I'm Ill, I'm Ill, I'm Ill, (Red Cafe)
RAH, RAH, Motherfucker I'm Ill!
Motherfucker I'm Ill, Motherfucker I'm Ill
(Talk to 'em) RAH, RAH, (nigga) I'm Ill
I'm Ill, I'm Ill, I'm Ill, (I got this)
RAH, RAH!


[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Pop deuce spot, kid latch off, still rep white, that Ash Roth
That uncut, that sushi, I'm too G, that's Gucci (WHAT ELSE!)
I'm bossed up, they washed up, e'ryday that Kush I cough up
By all cash, we don't rent out, I'm Ill, swag in the penthouse
Been a Konvict, ask Akon, had blocks locked, ask Avon
That's real talk, what's up B'Mo! (Yep!)
Bad Boy got Diddy on the T'Mo (WHAT ELSE!)
I'm Ill, make it look simple, DJ bring it back like a rental
Drinks don't stop, we party all night
And e'rywhere I go, I let it go like

[Chorus: Sample of "A Billi" by Jay-Z] (Red Cafe) {Fabolous}
RAH, I'm Ill, I'm Ill, I'm Ill,
RAH, RAH, I'm Ill, (I'm Ill)
I'm Ill, I'm Ill, I'm Ill, (Red Cafe)
RAH, RAH, Motherfucker I'm Ill!
Motherfucker I'm Ill, Motherfucker I'm Ill
RAH, RAH, (what else) {Loso}
I'm Ill, {I'm Ill in case you ain't know so! }
I'm Ill, I'm Ill, I'm Ill, {It's R} RAH, RAH!

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
If my name was Willis, they'll prol'ly call me Will
But I'm the illest so that's why they call me Ill!
EWWWW! You niggas disgust me
And they ain't talkin 'bout shit unless they discuss me
Funeral Fab, yeah I'm in the building y'all
All black on and I be killin y'all
So, the name speak for itself
You have a loser plus a lame that'll equal yourself
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest ones
Still on my Grizzlies, no Iverson (Waddup A.I.)
You ain't no gangsta, you an off-duty cop
With ya fake ass, they should call you booty shots
Yankee game, better seats than Rudy got
Fruity pot has me with the eyes Matsui got (nice)
That nigga, that you are not
Red dot on ya head's the best tattoo you got
RAH!

[Chorus: Red Cafe]

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
They trash, And I'm Ill,
I'm too hot how the fuck I'm 'gon chill
Laid back, Maybach, back seat
I'm BALLIN! Like a athlete
Talk is cheap, everyone could afford it
Shakedown here, now everyone applaud
Now it's showtime, time to camcorde
I'm in the buildin, and I'm the landlord
From the east, opposite of Kanye
No appetizers it's just en trees
Just four doors, maybe a couple Coupes
Everybody's eatin, no Cup A Soup's
General R, just showed up
Don't pass me nothin already rolled up
Drinks don't stop, party all night
And everywhere I go, I let it go like

[Chorus]
