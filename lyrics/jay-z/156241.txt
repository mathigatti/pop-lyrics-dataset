Whether we dribble out this mothaf**ka, 
rap metaphors, &amp; riddle out this mothaf**ka, 
work 2nd floors, hospital out this maf**ka, 
Some How we gotta get up out this mothaf**ka. 
Some Day the cops kill a maf**ka, 
I don't always wanna be this drug dealin' maf**ka d**n.....
wish I could take us all 
on this magic carpet ride through the sky, I....
used to play the hall up 5th floor 
me &amp; my boys we all poor gettin' high, I....
see the worse at a worse 
I deserve every blessin', I received I'm from the dirt, I.....
planted my seed on unfertile land 
Myrtle Park Marcy, Flushing &amp; Nostrand, and....
still I grew 
Some How I knew dat the sun'll shine through, and...
touch my soul, 
take hold of my hand, 
look man a tree grows in Brooklyn.

Too old Nell, Sigel street I ain't forget chu, 
20 Ni**as on the block tryin' chase that buck....
nusey neighbors &amp; the haters keep their face on stuck, 
cops roll up on the pavement breaks the dice games up,
behind smoke kids can't chase the ice cream truck,
girls fightin' over Rollie young hype things up,
Ni**as fightin' over Colder young boys light things up. 
All the petty a** wars f**k the night scene up, 
remember Lil' Eddie Draw man I ain't like mean up, 
then they wonder why we like green up,
back to back steam up 
tryin' to relax but I can't lean up 
in the L or the repha that steamer that steam up is my head, 
stress to the point I get a fever....
think about the block 
and all the mothers &amp; their kids that can't 
leave and how the chinks gotta feed 'em...
for the rest of their life f**kin' 
wings, fried vegetable rice....
{gotta be kiddin'} no breakfest Cap'n Crunch at night. 
Our kids eatin' lunch at night 
in their beds all bunched an tight....
No less then 3 or 4....
know how go 2 by the foot 2 by the headboard 
man I'm gettin scared ya'll I feel for them 
{yeah i know} gotta grip the shorties on the block 
all they do is smoke weed &amp; drink 40's....
cop their lower quarties 
nough to get the latest ROC, newest glock, &amp; old jordies.

Right cher's another lil' story bout' this clique I claimed 
another chapter based on how I get that game, 
hangin' round my neighborhood &amp; bang my street 
sittin' watch the passers-by play my sweep 
South Side, Sunny Side, block's I run, 
South Vegas, South Paul ni**as all got guns 
over here we got this cold salad get that there 
we know tomorrow ain't a promise so get that there 
f**k sittin' in the livin' room guardin' the steps 
workin' inside a slump house starvin' to death 
servin' these ni**as flippers 
quarter ounces in zippers 
agents snappin' you're picture 
neighbors plottin' to get ya, 
situation is critic 
I was out here to get it 
livin' it like a savage 
cause ni**a I gotta have it 
holdin' back on the mothers for a minute, pumpin' hard dog, 
erase enough to walk it down &amp; f**k it all dog, 
love bein' willied and you're creek gonna rise, 
Im'ma be a ni**a and these streets gonna rise
("Some How, Some Way"),("Some How, Some
Way") 
Im'ma be a ni**a and these streets gonna rise.
