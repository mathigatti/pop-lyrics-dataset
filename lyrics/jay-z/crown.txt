[Intro: Sizzla]
They can't keep a gooda man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officers askin' for a search
They found no weapon just only a draw of herbs


[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You in the presence of a king
Scratch that, you in the presence of a God
Put in the belly of the beast
I escaped, a nigga never had a job
Scott Boras, you over baby
Robinson Cano, you coming with me
These niggas is like rotary phones
It's a new day, hit up KD
Niggas always try to knock a nigga down
Knock me to my knees about a million times
Uncle said I'll never sell a million records
I sold a million records like a million times
These niggas shouldn't let me in
I ball so hard on ESPN
See my name come across on CNN
'Bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again
'Bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again

[Hook 2x: Travi$ Scott]
Shit on me
These niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead
They tried to wipe me out of your history

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Bulletproof glass, glass roof like the Pope
Bulletproof love, Niggas down since the yolk
Bitch asked if I was God
Fuck I'm supposed to say, "no"
You already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T.
You already know what I could do with the coke
Drop it in the water, made it disappear
I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope
I make my roof get ghost
Bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold
All the shit did, I wasn't supposed to live
Hallelujah Hov
Wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able
Wasn't for the bread, probably be dead
Best friends become ya enemies
Niggas' knives are double-edged

[Hook 2x]
