[Jay-Z]
Ahuh Ahuh (Yea Rihanna, Chris Brown)
Ahuh Ahuh (Good girl gone bad)
Ahuh Ahuh (Take three... Action)
Ahuh Ahuh


No clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone, we Rocafella
We fly higher than weather
And G5's are better, You know me,
an anticipation, for precipitation. Stacked chips for
the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where you at?

[Rihanna]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
May be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

[Chorus]
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh

[Chris Brown]
You're becoming a dream to me
Fairytale fantasy
Nothing can ever compare
An image to my memory
Girl I'm asking could you be my queen?
A vision on a magazine
That's when I'll be there
It's something we both share
Because

[Chorus - Chris Brown]
When the sun shine, we'll shine together
You know I'll be here forever
Although it's a lot of rain outside
Girl it's getting late you can stay the night
But you can dipout anytime whenever
I can call a car I ain't tryna stress ya
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl you can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh
You can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh
You can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh
You can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh

[Both]
You can run into my arms
It's okay don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and say my name some more
I'll be all you need and more (ah.. ready?)
Because

[Chorus]
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car I ain't tryna stress ya
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl you can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh
You can be my Cinderella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh

It's raining (rainin')
Ooh baby it's raining (rainin')
Baby come into me (oh)
Come into me
It's raining (Rihanna)
Oh baby it's raining (Rihanna)
You can always some into me
Come into me
