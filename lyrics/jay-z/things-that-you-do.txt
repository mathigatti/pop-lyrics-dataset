Uh, uh, come on

{Mariah (Jay-Z)}
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so...
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can explain
(Uh)
I love you
You thug look at what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, bounce)
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so..
(Exhale breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can explain (Yeah)
I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug look at what you make the clubs do


{Jay-Z}
You know the flow sicka, know Jigga, mo' sicka now right
You know what me and Swizz's shit sound like
Crazed and demonic, uh without blazin chronic
Product of Reaganomics
You know that motherfuckin stoop raised me
Ringin in da hoops but I was too lazy
School made me sick, teachers said I was too crazy
Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z
Let me explain this to you baby
I spent nights out, days in
Niggaz was blazing, twelve noon where I was raised in
I felt caged in but kept roaming
Prayed for the Day of Atonement
Married to the streets no date of annulment
It seems every time it comes up
They postpone it
So I kept my chrome at the waist
Waiting for the omen
Savoring the moment and now you know
The reason that I flow the way I flow baby

{Mariah (Jay-Z)}
It's the things that you do
(Uh, inhale, exhale, breathe on it)
That make me feel so..
And I don't know the way I feel
I can explains
I love you
You thug look at what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, shake, bounce, shake)
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so..
(Uh, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel I can explain (Uh)
I love you
You thug look at what you make the clubs do
(Drop, bounce, yo)

{Jay-Z}
You know I move like an ounce
Bottled up like crack
That's how I make you bounce like that
Defy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that
That's why no other rapper got a sound like that
Trap, trap of my life
Flashback, kill niggaz
Rap skills unmatched, Jigga man baby
I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it
God given, gifts of a soul for hard living
Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom
Could've been lost in the system
Instead I'm involved with the rhythm
I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions
I know I must be part of some mission
Shit I used take it for granted
Why they placed me on this planet
I would ask myself while writin raps to myself
But right there under my nose
Was the flow of all flows
Not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on

{Mariah (Jay-Z)}
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so..
(Inhale, exhale, breathe on it MC)

And I don't know the way I feel I can explain
I love you
You thug look at what you make the clubs do
(Lights out nigga)

{Jay-Z}
You know I've traveled through zones
Homes spazzed like a bad back
I came into this game on Jaz's back
I jumped off stood on my own two like boom, that's that
Yeah I'm here to show and prove
Don't matter to me the Garden or flowin on Clue
Whatever niggas wanna do - it's alright with me
Whether you big or bossy, jig or flossy
Dusty or musty, sober or saucy
Broker than Todd Bridges, richer than Bill Cosby
Forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty?
Past on to the next life and you still haunt me
I'mma keep doing me unfortunately
I make the club rock, make thugs pop guns
Make old folks do the bus stop; can't stop son
Shit I give you what's hot and what's not, I never knew
Y'all (niggas) know (niggas) how (niggas) do

{Mariah (Jay-Z)}
