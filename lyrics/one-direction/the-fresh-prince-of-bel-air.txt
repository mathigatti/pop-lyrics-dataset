In West Philadelphia, born and raised,
On the playground where I spent most of my days
Chillin out, maxin', relaxin' all cool,
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys,said we were up in no good,
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood,
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said 'You're movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air!'
