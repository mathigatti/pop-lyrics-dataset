I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Something deep inside me, I can't give up
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
I roll and I roll till I’m out of luck
Yeah, I roll and I roll till I’m out of luck


I'm feeling something deep inside
Hotter than a jet stream burning up
I got a feeling deep inside
It's taking, it's taking all I've got
Yeah, it's taking, it's taking all I've got

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long
It's been so long
Maybe you are fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

I think I'm gonna win this time
Riding on the wind and I won't give up
I think I'm gonna win this time
I roll and I roll till I change my luck
Yeah, I roll and I roll till I change my luck

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long
It's been so long
You must be fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long
It's been so long
Maybe we are fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do.
