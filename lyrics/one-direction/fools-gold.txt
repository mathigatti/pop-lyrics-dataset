I’m like a crow on a wire
You’re the shining distraction that makes me fly home
I’m like a boat on the water
You’re the raise on the waves that calm my mind
Oh, every time
But I know in my heart you’re not a constant star


And yeah I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I’m not done yet
Falling for your fool’s gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don’t regret falling for your fool’s gold

I’m the first to admit that I’m reckless
I get lost in your beauty and
I can’t see two feet in front of me
And I know in my heart you’re just a moving part

And yeah I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I’m not done yet
Falling for your fool’s gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don’t regret falling for your fool’s gold

Yeah, I know your loves not real
That’s not the way it feels
That’s not the way you feel

And, yes, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I’m not done yet
Falling for your fool’s gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don’t regret falling for your fool’s gold
