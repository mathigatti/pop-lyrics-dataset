I keep playing it inside my head
All that you said to me
I lie awake just to convince myself
This wasn't just a dream


'Cause you were right here
And I should' ve taken the chance
But I got so scared
And I lost the moment again
It's all that I think about, oh
You're all that I can think about

Is your heart taken?
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking?
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away
When, when I should' ve kissed you

I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you
I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you
I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you
I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you

Every morning when I leave my house
I always look for you, yeah
I see you every time I close my eyes
What am I gonna do?

And all friends say
That I'm punching over my weight
But in your eyes I
Saw how you were looking at me
It's all that I can think about, oh
You're all that I can think about

Is your heart taken?
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking?
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away
When, when I should' ve kissed you

I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you
I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you
I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you
I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you

When you're stood there
Just a heartbeat away
When we were dancing
And you looked up at me
If I had known then
That I'd be feeling this way
If I could replay
I would have never let you go
No, oh
Never let you go
Am I out of time?

Is your heart taken? (yeah)
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking? (yeah)
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away
When, when I should' ve kissed you

I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you
I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you
I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you
I should, I should, oh, I should' ve kissed you
(I should have kissed...)
