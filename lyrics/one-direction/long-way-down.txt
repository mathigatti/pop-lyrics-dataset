We made a fire, went down in the flames
We sailed an ocean and drowned in the waves
Built a cathedral, but we never prayed
We had it all, yeah and we walked away


Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you, but I struggle 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm falling
It's a long way down
It's a long way down from here

We had a mountain, but took it for granted
We had a spaceship, but we couldn't land it
We found an island, but we got stranded
We had it all, yeah, who could've planned it?

Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you, but I struggle cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm fallin'
It's a long way down from here
Such a long way down from here
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
Such a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
