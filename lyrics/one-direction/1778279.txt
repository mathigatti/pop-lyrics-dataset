Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why


Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing
Heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town

Downtown the young ones are growing
Downtown the young ones are going

We're the kids in America
We're the kids in America
Everybody live for the music-go-round

Bright lights, the music gets faster
Look girl, don't check on your watch
Not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey
Not a chance

Hot-shot, give me no problems
Much later baby you'll be saying never mind
You know life is cruel
Life is never kind

Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory

We're the kids in America
We're the kids in America
Everybody live for the music-go-round

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America

We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America

We're the kids in America
We're the kids in America
Everybody live for the music-go-round
