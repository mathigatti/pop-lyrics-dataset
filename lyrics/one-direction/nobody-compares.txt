You’re so pretty when you cry, when you cry
Wasn’t ready to hear you say goodbye
Now you’re tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You’re tearing me apart


You’re so London your own style, your own style
And together we’re so good, so girl why
Are you tearing me apart, tearing me apart?
You’re tearing me apart

Did I do something stupid, yeah girl, if I blew it
Just tell me what I did, let’s work through it
There’s gotta be some way to getcha to want me like before

'Cause no one ever looked so good in a dress
And it hurts cause I know you won’t be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do
When you smile, baby tell me how to make it right
Now all my friends say
It’s not really worth it
But even if that’s true
No one in the world could stop me
From not moving on, baby even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you

We’re so Paris when we kissed, when we kiss
I remember the taste of your lipstick
Now you’re tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart
You’re tearing up my heart

Did I do something stupid, yeah, girl if I blew it
Just tell me what I did, let’s work through it
There’s gotta be some way to getcha to want me like before

'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress
And it hurts cause I know you won’t be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do
When you smile, baby tell me how to make it right
Now all my friends say
It’s not really worth it
But even if that’s true
No one in the world could stop me
From not moving on, baby even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you

Nobody compares to you
There’s gotta be some way to getcha to want me like before

'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress
And it hurts cause I know you won’t be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do
When you smile, baby tell me how to make it right
Now all my friends say
It’s not really worth it
But even if that’s true
No one in the world could stop me
From not moving on, baby even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you
