Once in a lifetime
It's just right
We made no mistakes
Not even a landslide
Or riptide
Could take it all away


Somehow it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
Out loud, someone is calling my name
It sounds like you

When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side

Once in a lifetime
It's just right
And we are always safe
Not even the bad guys
In the dark night
Could take it all away

Somehow feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
Out loud, someone is calling my name
It sounds like you

When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side
Once in a lifetime
You were mine
