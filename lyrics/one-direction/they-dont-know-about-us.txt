People say we shouldn’t be together
Too young to know about forever
But I say, they don’t know what they talk talk talking about
'Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don’t wanna wait, any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you’re mine, girl


They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you's
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don’t know about, they don’t know about us

Just one touch and I was a believer
Every kiss, it gets a little sweeter
It’s getting better, keeps getting better all the time, girl

They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you's
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don’t know about, they don’t know about us

They don’t know how special you are
They don’t know what you’ve done to my heart
They can say anything they want cause they don’t know us
They don’t know what we do best
It’s between me and you, our little secret
But I wanna tell ‘em, I wanna tell the world that your mine, girl

They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you's
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don’t know about, they don’t know about us

They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you's
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don’t know about, they don’t know about us
They don’t know about us
