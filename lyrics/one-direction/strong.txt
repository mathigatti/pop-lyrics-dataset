My hands
Your hands
Tied up
Like two ships


Drifting
Weightless
Waves trying to break it
I’d do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to say it?
My heart
Your heart
Sit tight like bookends

Pages
Between us
Written with no end
So many words were not saying
Don’t wanna wait till it’s gone
You make me strong

I’m sorry if I say, “I need you”
But I don’t care, I’m not scared of love
‘Cause when I’m not with you I’m weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong? That you make me strong

Think
Of how much
Love that’s been wasted

People
Always
Trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there’s nothing I’m running from
You make me strong

I’m sorry if I say, “I need you”
But I don’t care, I’m not scared of love
‘Cause when I’m not with you I’m weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

So baby hold on to my heart
Need you to keep me from falling apart
I’ll always hold on
‘Cause you make me strong
I’m sorry if I say, “I need you”
But I don’t care, I’m not scared of love
‘Cause when I’m not with you I’m weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

I’m sorry if I say, “I need you”
But I don’t care, I’m not scared of love
‘Cause when I’m not with you I’m weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

That you make me strong
I’m sorry if I say, “I need you”
But I don’t care, I’m not scared of love
‘Cause when I’m not with you I’m weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong
