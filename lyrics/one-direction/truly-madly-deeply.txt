Am I asleep, am I awake, or somewhere in between?
I can’t believe that you are here and lying next to me
Or did I dream that we were perfectly entwined?
Like branches on a tree, or twigs caught on a vine


Like all those days and weeks and months I tried to steal a kiss
And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this,
I’m just the underdog who finally got the girl
And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world

Truly, madly, deeply, I am
Foolishly, completely fallin’
And somehow, you kicked all my walls in
So baby, say you’ll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
In love with you

Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed?
And wake you up with all the words that I still haven’t said?
And tender touches, just to show you how I feel
Or should I act so cool, like it was no big deal?

Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
I’ll put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
‘Cause here’s the tragic truth if you don’t feel the same
My heart would fall apart if someone said your name

Truly, madly, deeply, I am
Foolishly, completely falling
And somehow, you kicked all my walls in
So baby, say you’ll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you

I hope I’m not a casualty,
Hope you won’t get up and leave
Might not mean that much to you
But to me it’s everything

Everything

Truly, madly, deeply, I am
Foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby, say you’ll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
In love with you
In love with you
With you
