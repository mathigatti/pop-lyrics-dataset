Stained coffee cup
Just that fingerprint
Of lipstick’s not enough


Sweet, where you lay
Still a trace of innocence
On the pillowcase

Waking up
Beside you I’m a loaded gun
I can’t contain this anymore
I’m all yours, I got no control
No control

Powerless
And I don’t care it’s obvious
I just can’t get enough of you
The pedals down my eyes are closed
No control

Taste on my tongue
I don’t wanna wash away
The night before

In the heat
Where you lay
I could stay right here
And burn in it all day

Waking up
Beside you I’m a loaded gun
I can’t contain this anymore
I’m all yours, I got no control
No control

Powerless
And I don’t care it’s obvious
I just can’t get enough of you
The pedals down my eyes are closed
No control

Lost my senses
I’m defenceless
Her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour
Heart devour
Lying here I count the hours

Waking up
Beside you I’m a loaded gun
I can’t contain this anymore
I’m all yours
I got no control
No control

Powerless
And I don’t care it’s obvious
I just can’t get enough of you
The pedals down my eyes are closed
No control

No control
No control

Powerless
And I don’t care it’s obvious
I just can’t get enough of you
The pedals down my eyes are closed
No control
