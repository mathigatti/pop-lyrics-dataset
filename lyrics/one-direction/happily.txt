You don't understand, you don't understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be, but a twist of fate
Made it so we had to walk away


'Cause we're on fire, we are on on fire
We're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire, we are on on fire
We're on fire now

(1, 2, 3)

I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave
So come on, baby, be with me so happily

It's 4am, and I know that you're with him
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
And if he feels my traces in your hair
I'm sorry, love, but I don't really care

'Cause we're on fire, we are on on fire
We're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire, we are on on fire
We're on fire now

(1, 2, 3)

I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave
So come on, baby, be with me so happily
So happily

(1, 2, 3, 4)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
We're on fire now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
We're on fire now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
We're on fire now

I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave
So come on, baby, be with me so happily

I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave
So come on, baby, be with me so happily
