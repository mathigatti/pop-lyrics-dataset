Better than words
More than a feeling
Crazy in love
Dancing on the ceiling


Everytime we touch
I'm all shook up
You make me wanna
How deep is your love?
God only knows
Baby

Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough (ohh)
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough (ohh)
I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words (ohh, ohh)
Better than words

Better than words
Drive ya crazy
Someone like you
Always be my baby

Best I've ever had
Hips don't lie
You make me wanna
One more night
Irreplaceable, yeah
Crazy, crazy

Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough (ohh)
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough (ohh)
I can't explain your love, no

Every one tries (they try)
To see what it feels like (feels like)
But they'll never be right
'Cause it's better (better)
It's better

(Ooh, ooh, oh)
One more time
(Ooh, ooh, oh)
Better than words
Yeah

Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up (I don't know)
'Cause words ain't good enough
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up (to sum it up)
'Cause words ain't good enough
(The words ain't good enough)
I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words
It's better than words
It's better than words
