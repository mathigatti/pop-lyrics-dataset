I've tried playing it cool
But, when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race


Shot me out of the sky
You are my kryptonite
You keep making me weak, yeah
Frozen and can't breath

Some things gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

So, get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing and
You've got that one thing

Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night

Some things gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

So, get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
Get out, get out, get out of my mind
And c'mon, come in to my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing and
You've got that one thing

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You've got that one thing

Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead

So, get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
Get out, get out, get out of my mind (out of my mind)
And c'mon, come in to my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing and
You've got that one thing
