Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not?


Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young

Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, or never
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever?
Forever, or never
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?

So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
We let them come true

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever or never?

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, or never
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, or never
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young?
