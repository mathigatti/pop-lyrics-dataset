I'm wishing on a star, to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream, to follow what it means
I'm wishing on the rainbows, that i've seen
I'm wishing on the people who, really dream
I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes
I'm wishing on all of the things, we've never done


I never thought i'd see, the time where you would be
So far away from home, so far away from me
Just think of all the moments, that we spent
I just cant let you go, for me, you were meant
And I didn't mean to hurt you, but i know
In the game of love you reap what you sow

I feel its time we should make up, baby
I feel its time for us to get back together
And make the best of things oh baby when we're together
Whether or never

I'm wishing on a star, wishing on a star
To follow where you are, a-a-a-are
I'm wishing on a dream, to follow what it means
And I wish upon the rainbows that I've seen
I'm wishing on the people who, really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes
I'm wishing on all the things that we, we never to-o-o-old!
(Woo! JLS, 1D)

I'm wishing on a star (Oh wishing on a star)
To follow where you are (Oh anywhere you go)
I'm wishing on a star (I'm wishing on a star)
To follow where you are (To where you, where you go)
I'm wishing on a star.
