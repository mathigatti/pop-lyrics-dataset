It's inevitable, everything that's good comes to an end
It's impossible to know if after this we could still be friends, yeah
I know you're saying you don't want to hurt me
And maybe you should show a little mercy
The way you look I know you didn't come to apologize


(Eh, eh, eh)
Oh, why you're wearing that to walk out of my life? (Eh, eh, eh)
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight (Eh, eh, eh)
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time?

Oh, baby let me love you goodbye

Unforgettable together the whole world in my hands
Unexplainable the love that only we could understand, yeah
I know there's nothing I can do to change it
But is this something that could be negotiated?
My heart's already breaking, baby, go on and twist the knife

(Eh, eh, eh)
Oh, why you're wearing that to walk out of my life? (Eh, eh, eh)
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight (eh, eh, eh)
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time?

Oh, baby let me love you goodbye
Oh, baby let me love you goodbye
One more taste your lips just to bring me back
To the places we've been and the nights we've had
Because if this is it then at least we could end it right

Oh, why you're wearing that to walk out of my life? (Eh, eh, eh)
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight (eh, eh, eh)
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time
Oh, baby let me love you goodbye

Oh, baby let me love you goodbye
Oh, baby let me love you goodbye
