He knows about you in every way
He's memorized every part of your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
Yeah, he knows everything there is to know
Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods
The songs that you sing when you're all alone
Your favorite band, the way that you dance
Baby, baby


Does he know you could move it like that?
Woah-oh
Does he know you're out and I want you so bad?
Woah-oh
Tonight, you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back?
Does he know?

I catch your eye, then you turn away
But there's no hiding the smile on your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
He's not around, girl, you let me know
Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods
The songs that you sing when you're all alone
He knows how you dance in front of your friends
But, baby, baby

Does he know you could move it like that?
Woah-oh
Does he know you're out and I want you so bad?
Woah-oh
Tonight, you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back?
Does he know?

He'll never know
The way you lie when you look at me
So keep trying, but you know I see
All the little things that who make you who you are
So tell me, girl

Does he know you could move it like that?
Does he know that you'll never go back?
Woah-oh

Does he know you could move it like that?
Woah-oh
Does he know you're out and I want you so bad?
Woah-oh
Tonight, you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back?
Does he know?
