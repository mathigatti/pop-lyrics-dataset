A week ago you said to me
Do you believe I'll never be too far?
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none


We had some good times, didn't we?
We had some good tricks up our sleeve
Goodbyes are bitter-sweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

You will find me, yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind

Yesterday I went out
To celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast
I realised you were missing

We had some good times, didn't we?
We wore our hearts out on our sleeve
Goodbyes are bitter-sweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

You will find me, yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind

I know we'll be alright child
Just close your eyes and see
I'll be by your side
Any time you're needing me, oh yeah

You will find me, yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind, walking in the wind
