Another night I'm waiting for you
Waiting for my fantasy to crash and burn
It's you I am looking for
Another night of summer passes
Wide awake I'm waiting for you patiently
I want something more...


Light a flame and I will find you
Call for me I'll be beside you
You're the one I think about each day
Just tell me that you want me
Fall and I will run to catch you
Look to me and I'll provide you
With a light to guide you on your way
Just tell me that you want me

Tell me why can't you just tell me
How you feel are you that scared of hurting me?
I'm stronger than you know
Are we friends are something more than just another passing moment
I'm sure what you're looking for

Light a flame and I will find you
Call for me I'll be beside you
You're the one I think about each day
Just tell me that you want me
Fall and I will run to catch you
look to me and I'll provide you
With a light to guide you on your way
Just tell me that you want you

Remember last November
When I met you in the rain
Remember what you told me
Are you feeling still the same
Did you tell the truth then
Or was it just another game
Tell me (x3)
