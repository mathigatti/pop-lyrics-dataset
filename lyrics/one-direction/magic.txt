Baby c'mon over
I don't care if people find out
They say that we're no good together
And this never gonna work out


But baby you got me moving too fast
Cause I know you wanna be back
And girl when you're lookin' like that
I can't hold back

Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once, now I can't leave
Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic

So l-l-let them take pictures
Spread it all around the world now
I wanna put it on my record
I want everyone to know now

But baby you got me moving too fast
Cause I know you wanna be back
And girl when you're lookin' like that
I can't hold back

Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once, now I can't leave
Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic

Everything you do is magic

They say that we're no good together
And this never gonna work out
I wanna put it on my record
I want everyone to know now

Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic
Everything you do is magic

Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once, now I can't leave
Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic

C'mon
Kiss you once, now I can't leave
Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic
