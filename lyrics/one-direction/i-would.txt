Lately I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head I’m your boyfriend
But that’s one thing you’ve already got


He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He’d kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain

Would he say he’s in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would

Would he say he’s in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would

Back in my head we were kissing
I thought things were going alright
With a sign on my back saying ‘kick me’
Reality ruined my life

Feels like I’m constantly playing
A game that I’m destined to lose
Cause I can’t compete with your boyfriend
He’s got 27 tattoos

Would he say he’s in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would

Would he say he’s in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would

Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would?
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?

Would he say he’s in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would

Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would?
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?

Would he say he’s in l-o-v-e?
Well if it was me the I would, I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would

I would, I would, yeah
