I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach


You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat
But I hope it's gonna make you notice
But I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me
Ooh
Someone like me
(Somebody) ooh
Someone like me
(Somebody) ooh
Ooh

I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now

Ooh
Someone like you
(Somebody) ooh
Someone like you
(Somebody) ooh
Someone like you
(Somebody) ooh

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
