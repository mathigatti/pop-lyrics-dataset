I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don’t want to feel alone


So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved, and to be in love
All I can do is say
That these arms are made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

We took a chance 
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we’d be fine
So, pour me a drink (oh, love)
Let’s keep the night wide open
And we’ll see everything
We can living love in slow motion, motion, motion

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say
That these arms are made for holding you, ooh
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
When we were eighteen
Oh, Lord, when we were eighteen

Kiss me where I lay down
My hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say
That these arms were made for holding you
I want a love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I want a love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I want a love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
