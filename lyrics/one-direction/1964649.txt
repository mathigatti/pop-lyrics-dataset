We've got a bit of love hate
You take me to the edge then you hit the brakes
I say it's over one day
But then i'm crawling back begging you to stay
We make up then we break up all the time


I'll say that i hate a song
Then you'll go request it the whole night long
Some people say it's so wrong
But even when we fight, it'll turn me on
We make up then we break up all the time

We're like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah
Always like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah

No we can't make up our minds
'cause when we think we've got it right

We go na na na na
(na na na)
Na na na
(na na na)

You wanna party too late
But when i do the same all you do is complain
You know that it drives me insane
But when i get with you girl you make it okay
We make up then we break up all the time

We're like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah
Always like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah

No we can't make up our minds
'cause when we think we've got it right

We go na na na
(na na na)
Na na na
(na na na)

Ooh, ooh
It drives me mad, ooh.

We're like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah
Always like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah

No we can't make up our minds
'cause when we think we've got it right.

We go na na na na na na...
