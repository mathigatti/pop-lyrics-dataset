The end of the night
We should say goodbye
But we carry on
While everyone’s gone


Never felt like this before-ore
Are we friends or are we more?
As I’m walking towards the door
I’m not sure

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
'Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So, baby, if you say you’ll want me to stay, stay for the night
I’ll change my mind

Lean in when you laugh
We take photographs
There’s no music on
But we dance along
Never felt like this before-ore
Are we friends or are we more?
As I’m walking towards the door
I’m not sure

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
'Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So baby if you say you’ll want me to stay, stay for the night

I’ll change my mind
I’ll change my mind

Baby, if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
But, baby, if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind

'Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So baby if you say you’ll want me to stay, stay for the night
I’ll change my mind
