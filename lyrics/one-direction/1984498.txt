It feels like we been living in fast-forward
Another moment passing by (up, up, up all night)
The party's ending but it's now or never
Nobody's going home tonight (up-up-up all night)


Katy Perry is on replay, she's on replay
Dj got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
People going all the way, yeah, all the way
I'm still wide awake

I wanna stay up all night
And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one

Hold on to the feeling, and don't let it go
'Cause we got the flow now, get out of control
I wanna stay up all night and do it all with you

Up all night, like this, all night, hey!
Up all night, like this, all night, hey!
Up all night!

Don't even care about the table breaking
We only wanna have a laugh (up, up, up all night)
I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope she wanna kiss me back (up-up-up all night)

Katy Perry is on replay, she's on replay
Dj got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
People going all the way, yeah, all the way
I'm still wide awake

I wanna stay up all night
And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one

Hold on to the feeling and don't let it go
'Cause we got the flow now, get out of control
I wanna stay up all night and do it all with you

Up all night, like this all night, hey!
Up all night, like this all night, hey!
Up all night!

Katy Perry is on replay, she's on replay
(We're gonna want to stay up all night)
Dj got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
(We're gonna want to stay up all night)
(Up all night, up all night)
(We?re gonna want to stay up all night)

I wanna stay up all night
And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one

Hold on to the feeling, and don't let it go
'Cause we got the flow now, get out of control
I wanna stay up all night and do it all with you
