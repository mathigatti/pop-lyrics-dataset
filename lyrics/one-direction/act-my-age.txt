One, two, three, four
When I’m fat and old and my kids think I’m a joke
'Cause I move a little slow when I dance
I can count on you after all that we’ve been through
'Cause I know that you’ll always understand


I won’t act my age, no I won’t act my age
No, I’ll still feel the same around you
Hey!

When I’m fat and old and my kids think I’m a joke
'Cause the stories that I told, I tell again and again
I can count on you after all we got up to
'Cause I know that you truly understand

I won’t act my age, no I won’t act my age
No, I’ll still feel the same around you
I won’t act my age, no I won’t act my age
No, I’ll still feel the same and you will too
Hey!

When I can hardly walk and my hair is falling out
We’ll still stay up till morning
We’ll throw an after party, oh yeah, oh yeah

I won’t act my age, no I won’t act my age
No, I’ll still feel the same around you
I won’t act my age, no I won’t act my age
No I’ll still feel the same and you will too
