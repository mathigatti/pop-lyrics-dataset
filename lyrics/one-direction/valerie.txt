Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture


'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why won't you come on over Valerie?
