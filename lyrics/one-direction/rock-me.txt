Do you remember summer ‘09?
Wanna go back there every night
Just can’t lie, it was the best time of my life


Lying on the beach as the sun blew out
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud
Oh, my my, they could never shut us down

I used to think that I was better alone
Why did I ever want to let you go?
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
The words you whispered, I will always believe

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me yeah
I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

Yeah, we were together summer ‘09
Wanna roll back like press and rewind
You were mine and we never said goodbye

I used to think that I was better alone (better alone)
Why did I ever want to let you go? (Let you go)
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea (stared at the sea)
The words you whispered I will always believe

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal, show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

R-o-c-k me again
R-o-c-k me again
R-o-c-k me a-again
I want you to
R-o-c-k me again
R-o-c-k me again
R-o-c-k me a-again

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal, show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal, show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me
Yeah
