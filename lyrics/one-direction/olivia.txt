Remember the day we were giving up when you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'll be leaving you
She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on, just thinking how I went about it wrong
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love


Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go

Say what you're feeling and say it now cause I got the feeling you're walking out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya
The consequences are falling now, there's something I'm having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with ya

Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go

When you go and I'm alone, you live in my imagination
The summertime and butterflies
All belong to your creation
I love you, it's all I do, I love you

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go
