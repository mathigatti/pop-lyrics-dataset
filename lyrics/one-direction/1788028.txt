There was a time,
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun
I need to tell ya,
How you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay


And I can't explain,
But there's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
ItÂ´s that feeling I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But there's something about the way you look tonight
Girl, you take my breath away
The way you look tonight
