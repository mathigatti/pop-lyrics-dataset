Sometimes, sometimes I feel I'm tearing you apart
I'm taking you, so long to let it drop
because of something good,
I dont know what to do, what to do.
I'm loose but suddenly, becoming something true
and nothing can complain
I found in you and I could take way,
but I can't look back,
I shouldn't look back.


And I, I don't wanna wait,
another day with you,
I dont wanna take her heart
and give my heart at you.
Can you feel my heart beat?
Cause as look, as weight it feels,
but I'm tearing you apart,
read between the lines.
Oh, you're gonna read between the lines.

You take,take,and everything,
my heart can be the same,
as long as I regret to take away,
but something tells me dont look back
cause I will fall, and I will fall.
You say, our memories should look
at moving on.
And suddenly, the best to holding on
but something tells me that
I never should be afraid,
should be afraid.

And I, I don't wanna waste
another day with you,
I don't wanna take my heart
and feeling like at you
Can you feel my heart beat?
cause it's something, (about)
the way me feels
like I'm tearing you apart,
between the lines.
Oh, you're gonna read between the lines.
You're gonna read,
You're gonna read between the lines.
You're gonna read between the lines.
