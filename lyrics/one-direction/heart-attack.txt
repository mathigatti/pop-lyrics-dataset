Baby you got me sick
I don’t know what I did
Need to take a break and figure it out (yeah)


Got your voice in my head
Saying: Let’s just be friends
Can’t believe the words came out of your mouth (yeah)

I’m tryna’ be ok
I’m tryna’ be alright
But seeing you with him
Just don’t feel right

And I’m like, never thought it’d hurt so bad
Getting over you, and
You’re giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do
Cause you’re all I ever wanted, thought you would be the one it’s
Giving me a heart attack
Getting over you

Baby now that you’re gone
I can’t stand dumb love songs
Missing you is all I’m thinking about (yeah)

Everyone’s telling me
I’m just too blind to see
How you messed me up, I’m better off now (yeah)

I’m tryna’ be ok
I’m tryna’ be alright
But seeing you with him
Just don’t feel right

And I’m like, never thought it’d hurt so bad
Getting over you, and
You’re giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do
Cause you’re all I ever wanted, thought you would be the one it’s
Giving me a heart attack
Getting over you

Yeah, every time you look like that (oh)
You’re giving me a heart attack

Seeing you with him, just don’t feel right

And I’m like, never thought it’d hurt so bad
Getting over you, and
You’re giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do
Cause you’re all I ever wanted, thought you would be the one it’s
Giving me a heart attack
Getting over you

You’re all I ever wanted
Yeah, every time you look like that
You’re all I ever wanted
You’re giving me a heart attack
