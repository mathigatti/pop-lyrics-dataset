I was her, she was me
We were one, we were free
And if there's somebody calling me on
She's the one


We were young, we were wrong
We were fine all along
If there's somebody calling me on
She's the one

When you get to where you wanna go
And you know the things you wanna know
You're smiling
When you said what you wanna say
And you know the way you wanna play
You'll be so high you'll be flying

Though the sea will be strong
I know we'll carry on
If there's somebody calling me on
She's the one

If there's somebody calling me on
Yeah, she's the one
Yeah, she's the one
If there's somebody calling me on
She's the one
If there's somebody calling me on
She's the one
She's the one
If there's somebody calling me on
She's the one
