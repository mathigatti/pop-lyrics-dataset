Little black dress just walked into the room
Making heads turn, can't stop looking at you
It's so right, it's so right, it's so right, you know
Little black dress, did you come here alone?
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to go home
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, you know
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, you know


I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

Little black dress, who you doing it for?
Little black dress, I can't take any more
It's not right, it's not right, it's not right to know
Little black dress, what's your favorite song?
Little black dress I won't do you no harm
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, you know
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, 'cause I'll take you home

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me
