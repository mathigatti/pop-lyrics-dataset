Yeah!
One, two, three, four!


She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low
She’s addicted to feeling never letting go
Let it go

She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don’t anyone to know
That I’m the only one who gets to take her home
Take her home

But everytime I tell that I want more
She closes the door

She’s not afraid of all the attention
She’s not afraid of running wild
How come she’s so afraid of falling in love
She’s not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she’s so afraid of f-f-falling in love

Maybe she’s just trying to test me
Wanna see how hard I’m gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she’s worth
What do you worth

Maybe all her friends have told her
Don’t’ get closer he’ll just break your heart

But either way she sees in me and it’s just so hard

So hard, cuz’ every time I tell her how I feel
She says it’s not real

She’s not afraid of all the attention
She’s not afraid of running wild
How come she’s so afraid of falling in love
She’s not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she’s so afraid of f-f-falling in love

What about all the things we said
Talking on the phone so late
I can’t let her get away from me

When I say that I can’t do it no more
She’s back in my door

She’s not afraid of all the attention
She’s not afraid of running wild
How come she’s so afraid of falling in love
She’s not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she’s so afraid of f-f-falling in love
