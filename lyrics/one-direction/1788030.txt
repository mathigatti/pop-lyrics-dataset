I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it till my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69


Oh when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah - I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69
Oh

Man we were killing time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever - forever, no...

Back in the summer of '69
Oh Yeah
Back in the summer of '69 69 69
Back in the summer of '69
Oh Yeah
Back in the summer of '69
