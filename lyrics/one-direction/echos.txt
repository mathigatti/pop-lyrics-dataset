My minds at erase
And my thoughts are done
I've been meaning to tell you this
Since my lies begun
The way I feel inside
Reflects of the souls in your eyes
I've been meaning to tell you this
All of my life


To think of who I am
Shows much of what you were too
Slowly I realize
I'll be fine without you
I gave you your chances
And you just put them aside
To find out too late
Of who I am inside

Show me yourself come show me who you are
These are the times we wish it never went this far
Hidden by your words oh god please let me see
How someone plays with feelings oh so carelessly
Give me your heart to come and be in one
Vulnerable I was please come and steal and run
Just as we laughed, kissed I looked deep in your eyes
To tell you how I felt, came one without reply

Echos is all I hear I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
Let go is all I fear I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
Let go
I can't let go
So fall away is what I'll do
It's what I'll do
It's what I'll do
It's what I'll do
It's what I'll do
It's what I'll do
