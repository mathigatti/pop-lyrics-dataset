So your friends been telling me
You’ve been sleeping with my sweater
And that you can’t stop missing me


Bet my friends been telling you
I’m not doing much better
Because I’m missing half of me

And being here without you is like I’m waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I’m walking around with just one shoe
I’m half a heart without you

I’m half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I’m half a heart without you

Forget all we said that night
No, it doesn’t even matter
'Cause we both got split in two

If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river
We can really talk it through

And being here without you is like I’m waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kinda there, but not quite
Walking around with just one shoe
I’m half a heart without you

I’m half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do
I’m half a heart without you

Half a heart without you
Half a heart without you

Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is I got lost without you
And since then I’ve been waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I’m walking around with just one shoe
I’m half a heart without you

I’m half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I’m half a heart without you

Without you, without you
Half a heart without you
Without you, without you
I'm half a heart without you
