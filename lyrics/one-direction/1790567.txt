We'll do it all,
Everything,
On our own.


We don't need
Anything
Or anyone.

If I lay here,
If I just lay here,
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads.

If I lay here,
If I just lay here,
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old.
Show me a garden that's bursting into life.

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads.
