Hey girl I'm waiting on you

C'mon and let me sneak you out
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up the windows down


Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool
And we know it too
Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

Let's go crazy crazy crazy till we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never never never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some
And live while we're young
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And live while we're young
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tonight let's get some
And live while we're young

Hey girl it's now or never, it's now or never
Don't over think, just let it go
And if we get together, yeah get together
Don't let the pictures leave the phone oh oh oh
Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

Let's go crazy crazy crazy till we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never never never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some
