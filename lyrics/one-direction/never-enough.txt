Wanna pull an all nighter
And get into something we'll never forget
Wanna stay up and party
The weekend away and not know when to quit
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth
And go over the edge
Wanna wake up with you
And say: Baby, let's do it all over again


Lips so good I forget my name
I swear I could give you everything

I don't need my love
You can take it, you can take it and take it
I don't need my heart
You can break it, you can break it and break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
Come on
Come on

Wanna pull an all nighter
And get into something we'll never forget
Wanna stay up and party
The weekend away and not know when to quit
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth
And go over the edge
Wanna wake up with you
And say: Baby, let's do it all over again

Lips so good I forget my name
I swear I could give you everything

I don't need my love
You can take it, you can take it and take it
I don't need my heart
You can break it, you can break it and break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

Too much is never enough
Too much is never enough
Too much is never enough
Too much
Too much is never enough
Too much is never enough
Too much is never enough
Too much is never enough
Never enough, never, never
Never enough

I don't need my love
You can take it, you can take it and take it
I don't need my heart
You can break it, you can break it and break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough, never enough
I don't need my love
You can take it, you can take it and take it

I don't need my heart
You can break it, you can break it and break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
