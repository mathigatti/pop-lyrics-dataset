Don’t try to make me stay or ask if I’m okay
I don’t have the answer
Don’t make me stay the night
Or ask if I’m alright
I don’t have the answer


Heartache doesn’t last forever
I’ll say I’m fine
Midnight ain’t no time for laughing
When you say goodbye

It makes your li-i-ips, so kissable
And your ki-i-iss, unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes, irresistible

I’ve tried to ask myself
Should I see someone else
I wish I knew the answer
But I know if I go now
If I leave and I’m on my own tonight
I’ll never know the answer

Midnight doesn’t last forever
Dark turns to light
Heartache flips my world around
I’m falling down, down, down that’s why

I find your li-i-ips, so kissable
And your ki-i-iss, unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes, irresistible

Irresistible

It’s in your lips and in your kiss
It’s in your touch and your fingertips
And it’s in all the things and other things
That make you who you are
And your eyes, irresistible

It makes your li-i-ips, so kissable
And your ki-i-iss, unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes (and your eyes)
And your eyes
And your eyes
And your eyes

And your eyes, irresistible
