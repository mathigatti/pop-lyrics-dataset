Hey hey, oh no, no, no
Her laugh is as loud as many ambulances
As it takes to save a saviour, oh
Woah, woah, woah


No, she floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say she's such a fake
That her love is made up, no
No, no, no

Let's have another toast to the girl almighty
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightning

Am I the only, only believer?
There's something happening here
There's something happening here

The only, only believer
There's something happening here
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too

I'd get down, I'd get down
I'd get down on my knees for you
I'd get down, I'd get down
I'd get down on my knees
I'd get down on my knees for you

Her laugh is as loud as many ambulances
As it takes to save a saviour, oh
Woah, woah, woah

She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say she's such a fake
That her love is made up, no
No, no, no

Let's have another toast to the girl almighty
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightning

Am I the only, only believer?
There's something happening here
There's something happening here

The only, only believer
There's something happening here
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too

I'd get down, I'd get down
I'd get down on my knees for you
I'd get down, I'd get down
I'd get down on my knees
I'd get down on my knees for you
