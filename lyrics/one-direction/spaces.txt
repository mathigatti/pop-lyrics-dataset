Who’s gonna be the first one to start the fight?
Who’s gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night?
Who’s gonna be the last one to drive away?
Who’s gonna be the last one to forget this place?


We keep taking turns
Will we ever learn?

The spaces between us
Keep getting deeper
It’s harder to reach her
Even though I've tried
Spaces between us
Hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless
And I don’t know why

Who’s gonna be the first to say goodbye?

Who’s gonna be the first one to compromise?
Who’s gonna be the first one to set it all on fire?
Who’s gonna be the last one to drive away?
Forgetting every single promise we ever made

The spaces between us
Keep getting deeper
It’s harder to reach her
Even though I've tried
Spaces between us
Hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless
And I don’t know why

Who’s gonna be the first to say goodbye?

We keep taking turns
Will we ever learn?
When will we learn?

The spaces between us
Keep getting deeper
It’s harder to reach her
Even though I've tried
Spaces between us
Hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless
And I don’t know why

Who’s gonna be the first to say goodbye?
Who’s gonna be the first to say goodbye?
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
