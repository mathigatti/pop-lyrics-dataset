You'd rather leave me broken
Than whole with an empty heart
We were better left unspoken
Than the million miles apart


It's torture here in the space between
As you're loving and leaving me

You say there's nothing left to fight for
Cause this feels like to much
Your heart is so afraid to want more
Of the pain
You're left to touch
You only win, if you don't give-up
Cause love is war, and war is love

Trying to give up on perfect
In your battle of one
Ooohhhh
Trying to believe you're worth it
When every piece of you want to run

So now that you're caught in the space between
As you're the only enemy

You say there's nothing left to fight for
Cause this feels like to much
Your heart is so afraid to want more
Of the pain
You're left to touch
You only win, if you don't give-up
Cause love is war, and war is love
