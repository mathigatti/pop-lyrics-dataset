I want you to love me, like I'm a hot guy
Keep thinkin' of me, doing what you like
So girl forget about the world 'cuz it's gon' be me and you tonight
I'm gonna make your bed for ya, then i'm gonna swallow your pride


I'm gonna make you feel like you're the only girl in the world
Like you're the only one that I'll ever love
Like I'm the only one that knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
Cuz you're the only one that understands
How to make me feel like a man
Only girl

Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby, take me high, high
Let me make you first, first
Oh make it last all night
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby, take me high, high
Let me make you first, first
Make it last all night

I'm gonna make you feel like you're the only girl in the world
Like you're the only one that I'll ever love
Like I'm the only one that knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
Cuz you're the only one that understands
How to make me feel like a man
Only girl
