Been a lot of places
I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was
On the horizon
Hmm, but I know, I know, I know, I know
The sun will be rising
Back home


Leaving out the cases
Ain't packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was
On the horizon
Oooh well, I know, I know, I know, I know
The moon will be rising
Back home

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song

I've been away for ages
But I've got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've written in my memory
I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know
That I'm never leaving
No, I won't go

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song

Lights off when they should be on
Even stars in the skies they're wrong
Short days when the nights are long
When I think of the things I’ve done
Don't matter how far I've gone
I'm always be around, oh

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong (don’t forget it)
Home
If you ever feel alone don't
You were never on your own
Never, never, never
Ah

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong (don’t forget it)
Home
If you ever feel alone  don't
You were never on your own (you were never)
And the proof is in this song

Home
Don't forget it
Home
If you ever feel alone don't
You were never on your own (you were never)
And the proof is in this song

Never forget it this song
(Don't forget it)
No, I'd never forget it this song
You were never
