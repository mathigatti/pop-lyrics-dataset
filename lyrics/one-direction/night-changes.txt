Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn’t like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she’s showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won’t forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants


We're only getting older, baby
And I’ve been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Chasing here tonight, doubts are running ‘round her head
He’s waiting, hides behind his cigarette
Heart is beating loud, but she doesn’t want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She’s falling, doesn’t even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older, baby
And I’ve been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn’t like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

We're only getting older, baby
And I’ve been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you
