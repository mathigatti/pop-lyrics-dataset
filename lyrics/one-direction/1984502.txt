Can't ever get it right
No matter how hard I try
And I've tried


Well, I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives
And I'm tired

As you break my heart again this time

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance

Tell me anything
But don't you say he's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and

Tell me a lie

Well, you're the charming type
That little twinkle in your eye
Gets me every time

And well there must have been a time
I was the reason for that smile
So keep in mind

As you take whats left of you and I

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance

Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and

Tell me a lie
(Whoa, whoa, whoa oh)

Tell me a lie
(Whoa, whoa, whoa oh)
Tell me a lie
(Whoa, whoa, whoa oh)
Tell me a lie.....

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance

Tell me anything
But don't you say he's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and

Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
