Maybe it’s the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and passed the guards
Just like she already owned it
I said: Can you give it back to me?
She said: Never in your wildest dreams


And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can’t remember
How it goes but I know
That I won’t forget her
Cos’ we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes
Said her name was Georgia Rose
And her daddy was a dentist

Said I had a dirty mouth (I gotta’ dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it
I said: Can I take you home with me?
She said: Never in your wildest dreams
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can’t remember
How it goes but I know
That I won’t forget her
Cos’ we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes
You know, I know, you know I’ll remember you
And I know, you know, I know you’ll remember me
You know, I know, you know I’ll remember you
And I know, you know, I hope you remember how we danced
How we danced

How we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can’t remember
How it goes but I know
That I won’t forget her
Cos’ we danced all night to the best song ever
Danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can’t remember

How it goes but I know
That I won’t forget her
Cos’ we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes
Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
