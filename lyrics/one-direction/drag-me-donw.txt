I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul and baby you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason


If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man that could never be his best
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights that can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights that can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul and baby you're a boat
And baby you're my only reason

If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights that can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me

All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights that can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights that can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
