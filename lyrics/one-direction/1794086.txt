There once was a group with Liam and Niall
Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?
They lived with Zayn and their roo was vile
Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?


Did you know, Harry is such a slob?
He needs to win X Factor cause he can't get a job
And oh, Louis needs a boat
He dresses like he owns one cause he's got no other clothes
they really need your vote.

Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys? (Vas happenin' boys?)
Mick Jagger coulb be Harry's dad
(Harry) Vas happenin' mum? Vas happenin' Mick?
When Liam sings he makes his look sad
Vas happenin' song? Vas happenin' sad?

And Zayn's the master of echoes
(Zayn) Echoes, echoes, echoes
And Niall was raised by leprechauns so he won't ever grow
And oh, Louis needs that boat
He dresses like he owns one and it's becoming a joke
they really need your vote

Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?
Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?
Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?
