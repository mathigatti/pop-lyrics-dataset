Hey, angel
Do you know the reasons why
We look up to the sky?
Hey, angel
Do you look at us and laugh
When we hold on to the past?
Hey, angel


Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?
Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?

Hey, angel
Tell me, do you ever try
To come to the other side?
Hey, angel
Tell me, do you ever cry
When we waste away our lives?

Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?
Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Oh, I wish I could me more, I could be more, I could be more

Yeah, I see you at the bar, at the edge of my bed
Backseat of my car, in the back of my head
I come alive when I hear your voice
It's a beautiful sound, it's a beautiful noise
Yeah, I see you at the bar, at the edge of my bed
Backseat of my car, in the back of my head
I come alive when I hear your voice
It's a beautiful sound, it's a beautiful noise

Hey, angel
Hey, angel
Do you look up to the sky?
Do you look up to the sky?

Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?
Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?

Hey, angel
Hey, angel
