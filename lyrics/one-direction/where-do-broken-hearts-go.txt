Counted all my mistakes and there’s only one
Standing up from the list of the things I’ve done
All the rest of my crimes don’t come close
To the look on your face when I let you go


So I built you a house from a broken home
Then I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now I’m searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Trynna find you but I just don’t know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
It’s at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me
Anyone in between is the enemy

Shadows come with the pain that you’re running from
Love was something you never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now I’m searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Trynna find you but I just don’t know
Where do broken hearts go?

Are you sleeping, baby, by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Trynna find you but I just don’t know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid?
Where do broken hearts go?

Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me will you ever love me again?
Love me again?

Now I’m searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Trynna find you but I just don’t know
Where do broken hearts go?

Are you sleeping, baby, by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Trynna find you but I just don’t know
Where do broken hearts go?

Tell me where you’re hiding now?
Where do broken hearts go?
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me, 'cause I’m 10 feet down
Where do broken hearts go?

Come on, baby, come and get me out
Come on, baby, come and get me out
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now

Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
