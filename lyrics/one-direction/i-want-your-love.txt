I want your love
I know you love me to
I want your love I will love you


I loved you you just walked away and said
I dont need your love because
I'm married

I want your love
I know you love me to
I want your love I will love you

I loved you you just walked away and said
I dont need your love because
I'm married

Na na na na na na na na na naaa
Na na na na na na na na na na naaa

I loved you you just walked away and said
I dont need your love because
I'm married

You lied
I found another friend
So dont come back again
Because you married

I loved you you just walked away and said
I dont need your love because
I'm married

I kissed you
Again and again
You didnt want to marry me
Again
