I figured it out
I figured out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time


I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight, like us?
Did they ever fight, like us?

You and I
We don't want to be like them
We can make it 'till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You and I
Oh, you and I

I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground

I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light
Like us
They never tried like us

You and I
We don't want to be like them
We can make it 'till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the gods above
Can separate the two of us

'Cause you and I
We don't want to be like them
We can make it 'till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the gods above
Can separate the two of us

No, nothing can come between
You and I (you and I)
Oh, you and I
You and I
We can make it if we try
You and I
Oh, you and I
