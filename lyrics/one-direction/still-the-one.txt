Hello, hello I know it's been a while, but baby
I got something that I really wanna let you know
Yeah, something that I wanna let you know


You say, you say to everybody that you hate me
Couldn’t blame you ‘cause I know I left you all alone
Yeah, I know that I left you all alone

Yeah
Now I’m back at your door
You're looking at me unsure
I should have seen it before
You're all I think about baby

I was so stupid for letting you go
But I, I, I know
You're still the one
You might have moved on, but girl you should know
That I, I, I know
You're still the one

I know I say it too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
I I I know you're still the one
I I I know you're still the one

Hello, hello I'm really hoping you’ll forgive me
I keep talking, begging, tell me what I wanna hear
Yeah girl, just tell me what I want to hear

I'll try, I'll try to start again and find somebody
But I remember all the times and all the words we said
Yeah I can't get it out of my head-ead-ead

Now I'm back at your door
You're looking at me unsure
I should've seen it before
You're all I think about, baby

I was so stupid for letting you go
But I, I, I know
You're still the one
You might have moved on, but girl you should know
That I I I know
You're still the one

I know I say it too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
I, I, I know
You're still the one

I, I, I
I, I, I

Hey, you! You're still the one
Hey, you! You're still the one
Hey, you! You're still the one
Hey, you! You're still the one

I know I say it too much
But I will never give up

I was so stupid for letting you go
But I I I know
You're still the one
But I I I know
You're still the one
