I'm broken, do you hear me?
I'm blinded, 'cause you are everything I see
I'm dancing, alone
I'm praying, that your heart will just turn around


And as I walk up to your door
My head turns to face the floor
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Can love you more than this

If I'm louder, would you see me?
Would you lay down, in my arms and rescue me?
'Cause we are the same
You save me, when you leave it's gone again

Then I see you on the street
In his arms, I get weak
My body fails, I'm on my knees
Prayin'

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this

Yeah
I've never had the words to say
But now I'm asking you to stay
For a little while inside my arms
And as you close your eyes tonight
I pray that you will see the light
That's shining from the stars above

Now say
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Yeah

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this (yeah)
When he lays you down, I might just die inside (I'm broken)
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Can love you more than this
