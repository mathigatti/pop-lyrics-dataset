From the moment, I met you
Everything changed I knew I had to get you
Whatever the pain
I had to take you and make you mine (had to make you mine)


I would walk through the desert
I would walk down the isle
I would swim all the oceans just to see you smile
Whatever it takes is fine (whatever it takes it's fine)

Oh oh oh oh oh
So put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh oh
'Cause it's a stand up
I won't believin
'Till I've finished stealing every piece of your heart (every piece of your heart)

I know your heart's been broken
But don't you give up
I'll be there yeah I know it
To fix you with love
It hurts me to think
That you've ever cried

Oh oh oh oh oh
So put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh oh
'Cause it's a stand up
I won't be leaving
'Till I've finished stealing every piece of your heart (every piece of your heart)

Oh oh oh oh oh
So put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh oh
'Cause it's a stand up
I won't be leaving
'Till I've finished stealing every piece of your heart

And now I'll steal us the car
And we will drive to the stars
I will give you the moon
It's the least I can do
If you give me the chance

Oh oh oh oh oh
So put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh oh
'Cause it's a stand up

I'm a thief, I'm a thief
You can call me a thief
I'm a thief, I'm a thief
But you should know your a part

(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
I'm only here
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
Because you stole my heart

Oh oh oh oh oh (I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
So put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh oh (I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
'Cause it's a stand up
I won't be leaving
Till I'm finished stealing every piece of your heart

'Cause you stole my heart
Oh oh oh oh oh (i'm a thief, i'm a thief)
Call me a thief
Oh oh oh oh oh (i'm a thief, i'm a thief)
But you should know your a part
Oh oh oh oh oh (i'm a thief, i'm a thief)
I'm only here
Oh oh oh oh oh
Because you stole my heart
