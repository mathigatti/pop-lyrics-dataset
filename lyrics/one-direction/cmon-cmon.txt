The one that I came with
She had to go
But you look amazing
Standing alone


So come on, come on
Move a little closer now
Come on, come on
Ain’t no way you’re walking out
Come on, come on
Show me what you’re all about

Yeah I been watching you all night
There’s something in your eyes
Saying come on, come on and dance with me baby
Yeah the music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So come on, come on and dance with me baby

The one that I came with
Didn’t know how to move
The way that you let your hair down
I can tell that you do

So come on, come on
Move a little closer now
Come on, come on
Ain’t no way you’re walking out
Come on, come on
Show me what you’re all about

Yeah I been watching you all night
There’s something in your eyes
Saying come on, come on and dance with me baby
Yeah the music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So come on, come on and dance with me baby

Every step I take
I feel it more and more
She’s calling out
She’s looking good
My heart is racing
She’s turning around
I reach for her hand and I say

Hey I been watching you all night
There’s something in your eyes
Saying come on, come on and dance with me baby
Yeah the music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So come on, come on and dance with me baby

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
And dance with me baby
