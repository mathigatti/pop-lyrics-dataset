LIAM
Nobody knows
Nobody knows but me that I sometimes cry
If I could pretend that I'm asleep
When my tears start to fall
I peak out from behind these walls
I think nobody knows
Nobody knows, no


Nobody likes (nobody likes)
Nobody likes to lose their inner voice (lose their inner voice)
The one I used to hear before my life
Made a choice
But I think nobody knows (no)
Nobody knows

TODOS
Baby, oh your secret's safe with me
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be
And baby, don't it feel like you're all alone
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown
And I've lost my way back home
I said nobody knows

HARRY
Tomorrow I'll be there, my friend
I'll wake up and start all over again

TODOS
Baby, oh your secret's safe with me
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be, yeah
Baby, don't it feel like you're all alone
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown
And I've lost my way back home
I said nobody knows

HARRY
I said nobody knows

LIAM
Nobody knows but me

ZAYN
Me... me
