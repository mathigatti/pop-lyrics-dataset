I told her that I loved her
Just not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy
And she didn't say a word
Party died downstairs, had nothing left to do
Just me, her and the moon


I set you on fire babe
And down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes
All I know at the end of the day is love who you love
There ain't no other way
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

Sure the night was over, I said it's forever
Twenty minutes later wound up in the hospital
The priest thinks it's the devil
My mum thinks it's the flu
But girl it's only you

I set you on fire babe
And down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes
All I know at the end of the day is love who you love
There ain't no other way
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

When the sun goes down, I know that you and me and everything will be alright
And when the city's sleeping
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming

All I know at the end of the day is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes
All I know at the end of the day is love who you love
There ain't no other way
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
