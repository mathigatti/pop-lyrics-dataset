There's a lightning in your eyes, I can't deny
Then there's me inside a sinking boat running out of time
Without you I'll never make it out alive
But I know, yes I know, we'll be alright


There's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me
And every time I turn around it's only gaining speed
There's a moment when you finally realize
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes I know, that I'll be fine

This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the Sun
'Cause I wanna be yours
‘Cause you wanna be mine
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free
And I wanna be young
I will never look back now I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run

There's a future in my life I can't foresee
Unless, of course, I stay on course and keep you next to me

There will always be the kind that criticize
But I know, yes, I know we'll be alright

This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the Sun
'Cause I wanna be yours
‘Cause you wanna be mine
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free
And I wanna be young
I will never look back now I'm ready to run

This time I'm ready to run (ready to run)
I'd give everything that I got for your love

This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the Sun

'Cause I wanna be yours
‘Cause you wanna be mine
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run (this time I'm ready to run)
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free
And I wanna be young
I’ll never look back, now I'm ready to run
