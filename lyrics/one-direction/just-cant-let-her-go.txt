She's so mean but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a sexy animal
Spends too much
And I never tell her no
Drives me nuts
And she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go
La la la la la I just can't let her go
La la la la la I just can't let her go


Breaks a billion hearts
I know I'm next in line
But I don't mind, yeah
I want her
Everybody wants too
She knows it
I want her but I better run away

She's so mean but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a sexy animal
Spends too much
And I never tell her no
Drives me nuts
And she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la I just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la I just can't let her go

She's so mean but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much
And I never tell her no
Drives me nuts
And she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la I just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la I just can't let her go

Breaks a billion hearts
I know I'm next in line
But I don't mind, yeah
I want her
Everybody wants too
She knows it
I want her but I better run away

She's so mean but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a sexy animal
Spends too much
And I never tell her no
Drives me nuts
And she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I gotta love it
And I just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la I just can't let her go
La la la la la la la la la la I just can't let her go
