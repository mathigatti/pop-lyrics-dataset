Her name is Noelle
I have a dream about her
She rings my bell
I got gym class in half an hour
Oh, how she rocks in keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me


'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me

Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing

Man, I feel like mold
It's prom night and I am lonely
Low and behold
She's walking over to me
This must be fake
My lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am
And why does she give a damn about

I've got two tickets to iron maiden baby
Come with me friday
Don't say maybe
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby, like you
Ooh, hoo, hoo

Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
