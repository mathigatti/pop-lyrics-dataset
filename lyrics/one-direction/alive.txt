My mother told me I should go and get some therapy
I asked the doctor: can you find out what is wrong with me?
I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet
I can't control it
Yeah, I know it's taking over me
I'm going crazy
Can't contain it
So tell me just what I should do


She said, hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
She said, hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive

Went to a party, just after the doctor talked to me
I met a girl, I took her end up to the balcony
I whispered something in her ear that I just can't repeat
She said: okay, but she was worried what her friends will think
She's going crazy
Can't contain it
She asked me: what should I do?

I said, hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
I said, hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive

We got to live before we get older
Do what we like
We've got nothing to lose
Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders
Oh, we got nothing to prove

I said, hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight

I said, hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back
Live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
I said, hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive
