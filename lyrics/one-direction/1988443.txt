You know I've always got your back, girl
So let me be the one you come running to
Running to, r-r-running
I say this cause it's a matter of fact, girl
You just call my name
I'll be coming through, coming through, I'll get coming


On the other side of the world
It don't matter, I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two
I still feeling it everytime
It's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me

It's everything about you, you, you (it's everything about you)
The way you make it feel new, new, new
Like every party it's just us two
And there's nothing that could point too

It's everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
Everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (everything about you)
It's everything about you

Yes, I like the way you smile with your eyes
Other guys see it but don't realize that it's m-my loving
There's something about your laugh that it makes me wanna have too
There's nothing funny, so we laughing, no-no-nothing

Every minute it's like the last, so
Let's just take it real slow
Forget about the clock that's tick-tick-ticking

I still feeling it everytime
It's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby (the way that we touch, baby)
To the way that you kiss on me

It's everything about you, you, you (it's everything about you)
The way you make it feel new, new, new
Like every party it's just us two
And there's nothing that could point too

It's everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
Everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (everything about you)
It's everything about you

And you have always been the only one I wanted
And I wanted you to know without you I can't face it
All we wanna have is fun
But they say that we're too young
Let 'em say what they want

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me

It's everything about you, you, you
It's everything about you
It's everything that you do, do, do
Like every party it's just us too
And there's nothing that could point too

It's everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
Everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (everything about you)
It's everything about you
