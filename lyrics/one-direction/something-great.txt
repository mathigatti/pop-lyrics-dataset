One day you’ll come into my world and say it all
You’ll say we’ll be together even when you’re lost


One day you’ll say these words I’ve thought but never said
You’ll say we’re better off together in our bed

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don’t have to keep imagining
Come on jump out at me
Come on bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

The script was written and I could not change a thing
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again

One day I’ll come into your world and get it right
I’ll say we’re better off together here tonight

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don’t have to keep imagining
Come on jump out at me
Come on bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don’t have to keep imagining
Come on jump out at me
Come on bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
Is it too much to ask for something great?

You’re all I want
So much it’s hurting
You’re all I want
So much it’s hurting
