Who's that shadow holding me hostage?
I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?


I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to
Being held by you

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

Who's this man that's holding your hand
And talking about your eyes?
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind

I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But my Stockholm syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

All my life I've been on my own
I use the light to guide me home
But now together we're alone
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go

Baby, look what you've done
(Look what you've done to me)

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
