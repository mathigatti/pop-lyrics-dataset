I thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm she came around
She was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry


But you couldn't be that girl I adored
You don't seem to know or seem to care
What your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore

There's nothing where she used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine
I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
You crawled beneath my veins
And now
I don't care, I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch
I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
'Cause you're a little late
I'm already torn

There's nothing where she used to lie
Inspiration has run dry
That's what's goin' on
Nothing's fine
I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn

'Cause you're a little late
I'm already Torn
