LIAM
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning and I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


ZAYN
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

NIALL
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

HARRY, LOUIS E ZAYN
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs is singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

NIALL, LIAM E ZAYN
Oh oh oh oh whoa
Oh oh oh oh whoa (2x)

HARRY, LOUIS E ZAYN
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs is singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

LIAM
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
