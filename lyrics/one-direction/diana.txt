Front pages are your pictures
They make you look so small
How could someone not miss you at all?


I never would mistreat ya
Oh, I'm not a criminal
I speak a different language
But I still hear your call

Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying

Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you've been saving mine

It's only been for months, but
You've fallen out so far
How could someone mislead you at all?

I wanna reach out for ya
I wanna break these walls
I speak a different language
But I still hear your call

Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying

Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realise
Baby, you've been saving mine

We all need something
This can't be over now
If I could hold ya
Swear I'd never put you down

Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying

Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realise
Baby, you've been saving mine

Oh oh oh
Diana
Oh oh oh
Diana
Baby, you've been saving mine

Oh oh oh
Diana
Oh oh oh
Diana
Baby, you've been saving mine
