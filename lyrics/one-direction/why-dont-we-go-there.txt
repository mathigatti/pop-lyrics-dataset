I know you want, know you want take it slow
But think about all the places we could go
If you give in tonight
Just let me set you free
We'll touch the other side
Just give me the keys


'Cause we got all night
We're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there with me?

Say the word, say the word
But don't say "no"
Sky dive, you and I, with just these clothes
Your secret's safe with me
There's no right time or place
Cause anyone could see
Do it anyway

'Cause we got all night
We're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there with me?

Hey, I don't want you be the one that got away
I wanna get addicted to you, yeah
You're rushing through my mind
I wanna feel the high
I wanna be addicted
Don't say, no-o-o-o
Just let go-o-o-o-o

'Cause we got all night
We're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there with me? With me?
Why don't you go there with me?
