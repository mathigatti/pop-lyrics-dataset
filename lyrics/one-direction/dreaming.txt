I'm thinking of you tonight
And there's nothing that I want more
Than to be by your side
And let you grab so tight to me
As you whisper the words good night to me
Late at night


I love you, it's true
You mean everything to me
Words cannot explain how I feel
I must be dreaming when I'm awake

Your heart is fixing me
Without saying anything
My worries fall like rain
As these melodies run through your veins
Let me take you far - just hold onto me

And we'll take this world and you will see
That in the end, I'll be there for you

I love you, it's true
You mean everything to me
Words cannot explain how I feel
I must be dreaming when I'm awake

There's a sunshine floating
I see clearly now
So clearly now
There's so much more
That I hoped I'd ever find

I love you, it's true
You mean everything to me
Words cannot explain how I feel
I must be dreaming when I'm awake
