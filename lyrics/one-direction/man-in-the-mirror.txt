I'm gonna make a change
On once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right


As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind

I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man soul

They follow each other on the wind, ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer:
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
