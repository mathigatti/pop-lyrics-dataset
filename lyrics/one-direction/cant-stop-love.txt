We stand here today, together as one
You brighten my days just like the sun
When everything 'round is like stormy weather
We always survive cause were in this together


Whoever said that we could never hold on
And don't know I found my star (baby you are my star)
And now I'm happy I stood up for so long
And baby this is where the story starts

I can't stop, can't stop this love
No matter what they say, I love you
I can't stop, can't stop
I love you, no matter what they say
I love you

They said this love was the impossible kind
But we were strong enough to fight for this life
I can't stop, can't stop this love
No matter what they say, I love you

Now I'm carried away because I've opened my arms
You're here to stay, deep in my heart

They said that we couldn't, but we did make it work
And nothing could stop us
Not even two different worlds

Whoever said that we could never hold on
And don't know I found my star (baby you are my star) yeah
And now I'm happy I stood up for so long
And baby this is where the story starts

I can't stop, can't stop this love
No matter what they say, I love you
I can't stop, can't stop
I love you, no matter what they say
I love you

They said this love was the impossible kind
But we were strong enough to fight for this life
I can't stop, I can't stop this love
No matter what they say, I love you

I can't stop, stop
No I can't stop
I can't stop, stop
No I can't stop

I can't stop, stop
No I can't stop
I can't stop, stop
No I can't stop

I can't stop, I can't stop this love
No matter what they say, I love you
I can't stop, can't stop
I love you, no matter what they say
I love you

They said this love was the impossible kind
But we were strong enough to fight for this life
I can't stop, I can't stop this love
No matter what they say, I love you
