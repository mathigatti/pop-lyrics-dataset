Whenever I close my eyes, I picture you there
I’m looking out at the crowd, you’re everywhere
I’m watching you from the stage yeah
You’re smile is on every face now
But every time you wake up
You’re hearing me say
Goodbye


Baby, you don’t have to worry
I’ll be coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you
Lately, I’ve been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you

I’ve never been so into somebody before
And every time we both touch I only want more
So tell me nothing’s going to change yeah
And you won’t walk away yeah
Cause even though every night you’ll know what I’ll say
Goodbye

Baby, you don’t have to worry
I’ll be coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you
Lately, I’ve been going crazy
So I’m coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you

Right back for you
Right back for you
Right back for you

Lately, I’ve been going crazy
So I’m coming back
Yeah I am coming back
(for you)

Baby, you don’t have to worry
I’ll be coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you
Lately, I’ve been going crazy
So I’m coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you

Right back for you, right back
Right back for you, right back
Right back for you, right back
Right back for you

Lately, I’ve been going crazy
So I’m coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you
