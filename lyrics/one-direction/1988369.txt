Now that you can’t have me
You suddenly want me
Now that I’m with somebody else
You tell me you love me


I slept on your doorstep
Beggin’ for one chance
And now that I’ve finally moved on
You say that you missed me all along

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me ‘cos I’m taken
You don’t really want my heart
No you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breakin’
You only want me when I’m taken

You’re messin’ with my head
Girl that’s what you do best
Sayin’ there’s nothing you won’t do
To get me to say yes

You’re impossible to resist
But I wouldn’t bet your heart on it
It’s like I’m finally awake
And you’re just a beautiful mistake

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me ‘cos I’m taken
You don’t really want my heart
No you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breakin’
You only want me when I’m taken

Thank you for showing me who you are underneath
No thank you I don’t need another heartless misery
You think I’m doing this to make you jealous
And I know that you hate to hear this
But this is not about you any more

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me ‘cos I’m taken
You don’t really want my heart
No you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breakin’
You only want me when I’m taken

Now that you can’t have me
You suddenly want me
