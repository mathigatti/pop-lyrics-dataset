It's Christmas time, and there's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time, we let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty, we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmas time


But say a prayer to pray for the other ones
At Christmas time, it's hard, but while you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the kiss of a love can kill you
And there's death in every tear
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well, tonight, we reachin' out and touching you

Bring peace and joy this Christmas
To East Africa
A song of hope and there's no hope tonight
Why is come first to be fear?
Why is to touch to be scared?
How can they know it's Christmas time at all?

(Here's to you) raise a glass for everyone
(Here's to them) underneath that burning sun
How they know it's Christmas time at all?

Feed the world, let them know it's christmas time
And feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time
And feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time
And feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time
