(Waiting for a girl like you)
The light shines
It's getting hot on my shoulders.
I don't mind, this time it doesn't matter.
Cause your friends,
They look good but you look better.
Don't you know all night
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around, round, round


Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl,
To steal my heart tonight

With just one look, yeah
I waited for a girl like you

I'm weaker
My worlds fall and they hit the ground
Oh life, come on head
Don't you fail me now
I start to say
I think I love you but I make no sound

You know cause all my life I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around

Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl, to steal my heart tonight

With just one look, yeah
I waited for a girl like you

There is no other place that I would rather be
Than right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground I put my arms around you
And we can stay here tonight
Cause there's so much that I wanna say
I wanna say

Under the lights tonight
you Turned around, and you stole my heart
with Just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl, to steal my heart tonight

Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl, to steal my heart tonight

With just one look, yeah
I waited for a girl like you

I waited for a girl like you
