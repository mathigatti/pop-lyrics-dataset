I guess this means you're sorry
You're standing at my door
I guess this means you take back
All you said before


Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again

TODOS
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you (without you)

LIAM
Maybe I was stupid
For telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong

ZAYN
For trying to pick a fight

TODOS
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

ZAYN
Without you
