I wanna write you a song
One that's beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain for the feeling that I get when you are gone
I wanna write you a song


I wanna lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold you'll have a hiding place you can go
I wanna lend you my coat

Everything I need I get from you
And giving back is all I wanna do

I wanna build you a boat
One that's strong as you are free
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink, you know it won't
I wanna build you a boat

Everything I need I get from you
And giving back is all I wanna do

Everything I need I get from you
And giving back is all I wanna do

I wanna write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So any time I'm gone, you can listen to my voice and sing along
I wanna write you a song, I wanna write you a song
