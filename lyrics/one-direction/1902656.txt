Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give


Should've known you was trouble
From the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?

Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did

To give me all your love
Is all I ever asked 'cause
What you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

Oh oh, I would go through all of this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, you won't do the same

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey"
When you get back to where you're from

Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face
Then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did!

To give me all your love
Is all I ever asked, 'cause
What you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

Oh oh, I would go through all of this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
