Girl it should be me
Driving to your house
Knocking on your door
And kissing you on the mouth


Pulling on your hair
Dancing in the dark
Cause I was the only one
Who loved you from the start

But now when I see you with him
Tears my world apart

Because
I’ve been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart’s been taken
And nothing could be worst
Baby, I loved you first.
Had my chances
Could`ve been when he is standing
That’s what hurts the most,
Girl, I came so close
But now you’ll never know
Baby, I loved you first

Girl it should be me
Calling on your phone
Saying you’re the one
And that I’ll never let you go

I never understood
What love is really like
But felt it from the first time
Looking in your eyes

But now when I see you with him
My whole world falls apart

Because
I’ve been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart’s been taken
And nothing could be worst
Baby, I loved you first.
Had my chances
Could`ve been when he is standing
That's what hurts the most
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know
Baby, I loved you first

First touch
The first kiss
First girl who made me feel like this
Heartbreak
It’s killing me
I loved you first, why can’t you see?

I’ve been waiting all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart’s been taken
And nothing could be worst
Baby, I loved you first.

Had my chances
Could`ve been when he is standing
That's what hurts the most
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know
Baby, I loved you first

Baby, I loved you first
