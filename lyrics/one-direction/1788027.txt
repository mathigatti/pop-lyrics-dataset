Turn around


Liam
Every now and then, I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming round

Niall
Turn around

Liam
Every now and then, I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears

Niall
Turn around

Liam
Every now and then, I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by

Niall
Turn around

Liam
Every now and then, I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes

Todos
Turn around, bright eyes

Liam
Every now and then, I fall apart

Todos
Turn around, bright eyes

Liam
Every now and then, I fall apart

Todos
And I need you now tonight, and I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight, we'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

Zayn
I really need you tonight

Todos
Forever's gonna start tonight, forever's gonna start tonight...

Louis e liam
Once upon a time, I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart

Zayn
Nothing I can do, a total eclipse of the heart
