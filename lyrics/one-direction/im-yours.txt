Well you done done me and you bet i felt it
I tried to beat you but you're so hot that i melted
I fell right through the cracks, now i'm trying to get back


Before the cool done run out, i'll be giving it my bestest
And nothings going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But i won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, i'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love

Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We're just one big family, and
It's our god-forsaken right to be loved, love, loved, love, loved

So i won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait i'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, i'm yours

D-d-do you, but you, d-d-do
But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And i will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so i drew a new face and laughed

I guess what i'm saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue

But i won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait i'm yours

Come on and open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours

So please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicated
Cause our time is short
This is, this is, this is our fate, i'm yours!
