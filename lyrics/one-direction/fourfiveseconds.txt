I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness


Now I'm fourfiveseconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would dare me
Ooh, that's all I want

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

Yeah, 'bout fourfiveseconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til friday
I'm tryna make it back home by monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that's all I want

And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', How could I be so selfish?
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', How could I be so reckless?
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand

If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm fourfiveseconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Fourfiveseconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Cause that's all I want
