If this room was burning
I wouldn’t even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies


You say it’s getting late, it’s getting late
And you don’t know if you can stay, if you can stay
But you, you don’t tell the truth
No, you, you like playing games
Your hands touching me, they’re touching me
And your eyes keep saying things
They’re saying what we do
When it’s only me and you
I can’t concentrate
That’s all I’m thinking about
All I keep thinking about
Everything else just fades away

If this room was burning
I wouldn’t even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies

You say you’re a good girl
But I know you would, girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies

Backseat of the cab, we’re in the cab now
Lips getting so attached, they’re so attached now
You wanna make some rules now
Cool, then we’ll watch them break
Tonight, I know what you want
And I’ve been waiting so long

If this room was burning
I wouldn’t even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies

You say you’re a good girl
But I know you would, girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your, little white lies, little white lies
With your, little white lies, little white lies

I know you want it
I know you feel it too
Let’s stop pretending
That you don’t know what I don’t know
Just what we came to do (what we came to do)

If this room was burning
I wouldn’t even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies

You say you’re a good girl
But I know you would, girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies
