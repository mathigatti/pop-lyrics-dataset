She's seventeen,
And gets to thinking,
About Prom Queen and partying,


Can't get her head on straight,
But has to try before it's too late,
But I don't think she has a chance,

I know you, you know me,
But you're too proud to show me,
The way you really see the world,

I'm here to help,
And I'm sure it feels like hell,
Come take my hand we'll fly away to promised lands,

What are you running from?
Why can't you just see that this through?
When you're lost in life I will try,
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,
To find you.

Please believe,
That we aren't just here,
Sitting watch you do your thing,
You want to scream, but,
Those chains they hold you down,
And I won't wait to get you off the ground,

Free to look forward to what is at hand,
If there's something to ask,
It's too short for a regret,

People make mistakes,
And I'm here to lead the way,
To see you spread your wings.

What are you running from?
Why can't you just see this through?
When you're lost in life I will try,
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,
To find you.

What are you running from?
Why can't you just see this through?
When you're lost in life I will try,
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,
To find you.

What are you running from?
Why can't you just see this through?
When you're lost in life I will try,
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,
To find you.
