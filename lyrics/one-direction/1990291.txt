I, I wanna save your
Wanna save your heart, tonight
He'll only break you
Leave you torn apart, oh


It's a quarter to three, can't sleep at all
He's so overrated
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall
And he wouldn't take it

All that you want is under your nose, yeah
You should open your eyes but they stay closed, closed

I, I wanna save your
Wanna save your heart, tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh

I can't be no superman,
But for you I'll be superhuman
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight

Oh, now you're at home and he don't call
Cause he don't adore ya
To him you are just another doll
And I tried to warn ya

What you want, what you need has been right here, yeah
I can see that you're holding back those tears, tears

I, I wanna save your
Wanna save your heart, tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh

I can't be no superman,
But for you I'll be superhuman
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight

Up, up and away I'll take you with me
Up, up and away I'll take you with me

I, I wanna save your
Wanna save your heart, tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh

I can't be no superman,
But for you I'll be superhuman

I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight x3
