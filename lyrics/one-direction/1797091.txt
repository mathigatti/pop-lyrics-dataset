It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide


I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

TODOS
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross

But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

TODOS
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words

LIAM
How wonderful life is now you're in the world
