Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na


He takes your hand I die a little
I watch your eyes
And I’m in riddles
Why can’t you look at me like that

Na na na na

When you walk by
I try to say it
But then I freeze
And never do it
My tongue gets tied
The words gets trapped
I hear the beat of my heart get louder
Whenever I’m near you

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don’t see
Whenever you kiss him
I’m breaking
Oh, how I wish that it was me

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

He looks at you
The way that I would
Does all the things
I know that I could
If only time could just turn back
'Cause I got three little words that I’ve always been
Dying to tell you

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don’t see
Whenever you kiss him
I’m breaking
Oh, how I wish that it was me

With my hands on your waist
While we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me that you’ll call later on
'Cause you wanna say goodnight
'Cause I see you
With him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart cos you don’t see

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don’t see
Whenever you kiss him
I’m breaking
Oh, how I wish
Oh, how I wish
Oh, how I wish
That was me, me, me
Oh, how I wish that was me
