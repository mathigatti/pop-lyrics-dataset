Watching you get dressed messes with my head
Take that bag off your shoulder
Come get back in bed we’ve still got time left
This don’t have to be over


And you say it’s hard to keep a secret
Girl don’t leave me all alone in this hotel
And these shades can hide us from the streets yeah
One week and I promise that I’ll never tell

You should probably stay probably stay a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home
You should probably stay here with me a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home
Don’t go it’s not the same when you’re gone
And it’s not good to be all alone
So you should probably stay here with me a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home

Don’t play innocent I know what you meant
When you said you’d come over
Aren’t we way past that playing hard to get
We did that when we were younger

And you say it’s hard to keep a secret
Girl don’t leave me all alone in this hotel
And these shades can hide us from the streets yeah
One week and I promise that I’ll never tell

You should probably stay probably stay a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home
You should probably stay here with me a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home
Don’t go it’s not the same when you’re gone
And it’s not good to be all alone
Don’t go it’s not the same when you’re gone
Come on let me change your ticket home

Why don't we take some time?
Why don’t we take just a little more time?
Why don’t we make it right?
Girl I don’t wanna say goodbye

You should probably stay probably stay a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home
You should probably stay here with me a couple more days
Come on let me change your ticket home
Don’t go it’s not the same when you’re gone
And it’s not good to be all alone
Don’t go it’s not the same when you’re gone
Come on let me change your ticket home
