I know you said
That you don’t like it complicated
That we should try to keep it simple
But love is never ever simple, no


Someday, you’re gonna see the things that I see
You’re gonna want the air that I breathe
You’re gonna wish you never left me

Here, we go again
Another go around for all of my friends
Another night stopped, will it ever end?
Here we go again

Another go around for all of my friends
Another night stopped, will it never end?
Were never coming back down
Were looking down on the clouds

I know you said, that you don’t like it complicated
That you are tired of all the changes
Well love is always, always changing
Woah
Some day, you’re gonna see the things that I see
You’re gonna want the air that I breathe
You’re gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again
Another go around for all of my friends
Another night stopped, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go around for all of my friends
Another night stopped will it never end?
Were never coming back down
Yeah, were looking down on the clouds
And we go and we go and we go and we don’t stop
But we don’t, no we don’t, no we don’t, ever go out

Here we go again
Another go around for all of my friends
Another night stopped will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go around for all of my friends
Another night stopped will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go around for all of my friends
Another night stopped will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go around for all of my friends
Another night stopped will it ever end?
