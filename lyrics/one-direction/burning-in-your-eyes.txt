You got the burning in your eyes
Always a creature off the night
Just like a bullet into life
Young and reckless


But I am the one who knows the truth
When all the lights go down on you
You're finding it hard to make it through
Young and reckless

Yeah yeah yeah

Hmmm, a boy asleep in the darkest light
A girl awakes to another guy
He knows, the hole inside's all her

Oh Yeah yeah yeah

He's reaching out but she cannot hear
Through all the stars that are falling near
He wants the noise to disappear

Yeah yeah

You got that burning in your eyes
Always a creature of the night
Just like a bullet into life
Young and reckless

Oh

But I am the one who knows the truth
When all the lights go down on you
You're finding it hard to make it through
Young and reckless

Oh oh

She doesn't stay but she has to leave
To run away is the hardest thing
He knows for now she's best alone

Oh oh yeah

She finds the beauty in the pain
He wants to help but it's only vain
It's so hard to see those broken wings

Yeah oh

You got that burning in your eyes
Always a creature of the night
Just like a bullet into life
Young and reckless

Oh oh

But I am the one who knows the truth
When all the lights go down on you
You're finding it hard to make it through
Young and reckless

Yeah yeah oh

Baby, baby
It's so hard, baby
Baby, baby
It's so hard
Baby, baby

Did you get that burning in your eyes
Always a creature of the night
Just like a bullet into life
Young and reckless

Oh oh

But I am the one who knows the truth
When all the lights go down on you
You're finding it hard to make it through
Young and reckless

Oh yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
