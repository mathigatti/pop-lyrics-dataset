But you don't even know why.
Don't know what to do
Now I'm not with you
But I guess I'll have to try.
You're everything I'm looking for
You're a dream that came true.
Don't know why but now I love you more
Must be the reason I feel blue.
So this is why,I'm looking for a guy like you.


I'm looking for a guy who will always be there.
Not just any guy
But a guy who could also be my best friend.
I'm looking for an answer
Why did you play with my mind?
But I know for sure,better than you I'll never find.
No no,I won't find anyone better than you boy.

That you and me
Were more than just friends.
Then I saw you there
With that other girl
So my dream had come to an end.

But you're a mistery to me.
I'm just so happy that it's you I've found
You and me,it's ment to be.
So this is why,baby you're so perfect for me.
