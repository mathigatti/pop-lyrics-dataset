I made it through
The wilderness
Somehow I made it through[huh!]
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you


I was beat incomplete
I'd been had
I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new(oooh)

Like a virgin(úh!!)
Touched
For the very first tiiiime mooore
Like a virgin[aah!]
When your heart beats
Next to miiiine [ooúúúh yeah!!]
Music of marriage

Everybody comes to hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighbourhood
They like the smell of it in
Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks
So good?

We're bored with the concept of right and wrong
