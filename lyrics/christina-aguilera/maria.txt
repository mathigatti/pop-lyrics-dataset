Maria, hey, hey, Maria (I'm here)
Maria, don't you hear me calling, Maria?
Maria, girl you know you were the only one


How was I supposed to know that it would cost my soul?
Nothin is free' outchea, I wanna breathe outchea
How am I supposed to face this lonely life I've created?
Is that the price that I'm payin'?
I wanna feel it

All my life, wouldn't give up
Was too young to know the difference
How did I get so low?
When did I turn so cold?
Inside of my own mind, I believe my own lies
I'm facing the mirror

Where, where, where is Maria?
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just wanna see her
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just need to see ya, Maria

Now do you hear it in my voice that I'm tryna make a choice?
I don't know which way to go at this crossroads
You done taped my mouth shut
Make me feel worthless, used up

So tired of painting all this makeup
'Cause it won't hide my deep cuts
Eyes open but can't see, mouth open but can't speak
I'm facing the mirror

Where, where, where is Maria?
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just wanna see her
Where, where, where is Maria?
Oh, I just wanna see ya, Maria

Oh my lord (oh)
Can you take away this heavy load? (Oh)
I can't carry it anymore (oh)
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour?
Oh my lord (oh my lord)
Can you take away this heavy load? (Can you take away this heavy load?)
I can't carry it anymore (I can't)
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour?

[Michael Jackson]
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here
You keep running away

Can you hear me callin'?
My whole world is fallin'
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya (don't keep on runnin' away)
Can you hear me callin'?
My whole world is fallin'
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya (don't keep on runnin' away)

Don't run away, don't run away, no (keep on runnin' away)
Don't run away, don't run away, no (you keep on runnin' away)
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't run, don't run, don't run from me (no)

Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't you keep on runnin' from me
Don't you keep on runnin' from me
Where is, where is, where is, where is Maria?

Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Where is Maria?
You know I need ya
Where is Maria?
