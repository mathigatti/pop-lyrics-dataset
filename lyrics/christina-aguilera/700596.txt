No matter where i go, you're always there,
No matter where i look, i feel your stare,
I thought it was forgotten, or at least forgiven,
You're gonna keep punishing me till the day i leave him.


I'm not unfaithful, i just couldn't resist love,
I can't stay where i'm not getting enough,
I trusted my instincts (for happiness) but they turned out untrue,
It's my instincts (not me) to blame for hurting you.
You seem unwilling to put it in the past,
You're trying so hard to stop my love from lasting.

Stop! take a minute and look at me,
You want to be my lover not my enemy.

No matter where i go, you're always there,
No matter where i look, i feel your stare,
I thought it was forgotten, or at least forgiven,
You're gonna keep punishing me till the day i leave him.
