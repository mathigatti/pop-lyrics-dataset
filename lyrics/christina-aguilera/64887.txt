I remember when it all first began
We were tight right from the start
It wasn't long before you came on strong
Trying hard to win my heart
I played hard to get but I couldn't help
But give up my heart in the end
You were thoughtful, careful not to
Hurt the relationship


What happened to those days when you used to be compassionate?
Caring what I thought and said, so attentive, a gentleman
Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set
Taking me for granted lately, and frankly, it's gotta quit
(I'm not taking this)

Ooh, I feel underappreciated
Ooh, now girls help me out
If you know what I'm talking about, I said
Ooh, I'm feelin' underappreciated
Ooh, for all the time and effort I
Have put in this commitment

Let's take it back again to the very begining
When our love was something new
Back when romance was important
Not just another thing to do
I was feeling high on love's delight
Thought I'd never come back down
Now it seems that you and me have lost our solid ground

After time I realized I seem to give more than I get
Funny how things seem to change after a few years commitment
Used to talk for hours on end of our dreams while we lay in bed
I miss those days when you stayed awake
Now you roll over and snore instead
(I'm tired of this shit)

Ooh, I feel underappreciated
Ooh, now girls help me out
If you know what I'm talking about, I said
Ooh, I'm feelin' underappreciated
Ooh, for all the time and effort I
Have put in this commitment

I miss the nice massages, the long phone calls
And the way you talked, how it'd turned me on
Miss the bubble baths, had the sweetest laughs
I'm needin' those days back

Ooh, I feel underappreciated
Ooh, now girls help me out
If you know what I'm talking about, I said
Ooh, I'm feelin' underappreciated
Ooh, for all the time and effort I
Have put in this commitment

Ooh, I feel underappreciated
If you feel me sing it with me
C'mon help me out
Ooh, I feel underappreciated
Oh ooh
