Ooh, oh yeah, yeah, oh
Mmm, oh, yeah
Our day will come and
We'll have everything
And ooh, we'll share the joy
Falling in love can bring
And no one can tell me
That I'm too young to know
'Cause I love you so
('Cause I love you so)
And you love me yeah, oh

If we just wait awhile
And ooh, no tears for us
Make loving with a smile
And our dreams are meant to be
'Cause we'll always stay
In love this way
Our day, will come

Stand in our way, oh

Stand in our way

No one can change your mind
Baby you are one of a kind
Forever you'll be mine
We've got to get to know for me
You know I love you so
And I want the world to know
Forever, darling
You will be my baby
