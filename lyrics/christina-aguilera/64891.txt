Baby you pretend that things ain't what they seem
All this tension on titling just exactly what we should be
Now I don't mind us bein' some kinda casual thing
Listen all I wanna do for now is have you come and take all of me (can you)


Put your hands on my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind (a slow grind)
Runnin' chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

If you see me with a man understand that you can't question me
The feelings that you caught ain't my fault, can't help your jealousy
If you can handle the fact that what we have has got to be commitment free (free)
Then we can keep this undercover, lovin' comin' hidden underneath the sheets (can you)

Put your hands on my waistline (ooh, my waistline)
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (but don't fall in love)
Hang a please don't disturb sign (no, no love)
Put my back into a slow grind (slow grind)
Runnin' chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

So come on and freak my body
We can get nasty, naughty
All night a private party
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a 9 to 5
It ain't about the kissin' and huggin'
'Cause this is a physical lovin'
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin'
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a 9 to 5

We have a physical thing
We make love, but don't fall in love
Let me get mine, you get yours
We spend time
Just enough so you get yours and I get mine
No strings attached
I want your body (let me get mine, you get yours)
Not your heart (can you)

Put your hands on my waistline (hands on my waistline)
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (but don't fall in love)
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Runnin' chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

Put your hands on my waistline (put your hands on my waistline)
Want your skin up against mine (ooh, the baseline)
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (but don't fall in love)
Hang a please don't disturb sign (freak my body baby)
Put my back into a slow grind (nasty, naughty baby)
Runnin' chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

Come here
Don't be shy
I won't bite
Let me get mine, you get yours
