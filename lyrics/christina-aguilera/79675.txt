Glo-glo-glo-gloria

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plain
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Glo-glo-glo-gloria, in excelsis Deo
Ooh, no, yeah yeah


Shepards, why this jubilee
Why your joyous song prolong
What the gladsome tidings be, ohh
That inspire your heavenly song
Glo-glo-glo-gloria, in excelsis Deo
Oh oh oh, ooh oh, oh yeah

Ohh, come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing, oh
Come on adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, our new-born King
Glo-glo-glo-gloria, in excelsis Deo, oh yeah

On the day, that Christ was born
The angels sang such a heavenly song
In excelsis Deo, ohh
Angels we have heard on high
Angels we have heard on high
Angels we have heard on high
Angels we have heard on high
In excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
