Hey sexy lady shake your ass like that (ass like that, ass like that)
Hey pretty boy shake your ass like that (ass like that, ass like that)
Boys in the city make the beat so hot (beat so hot, beat so hot)
I like the way you movin' workin up and groove,
Don't stopin' when the sun goes down.


My music is breakin' the silence,
Turn it on for the last dance,
Do you want it?
Do you need it?
This is your chance!
Turn it up and dance!
