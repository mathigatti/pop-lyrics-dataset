Adam Levine:
Oh, oh
Just shoot for the stars if it feels right
And in for my heart if you feel like
And take me away and make it okay
I swear I'll behave


You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm making
You say I'm a kid, my ego is bad
I don't give a shit

And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me until you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Baby, it's hard when you feel like
You've broken a scar and if it feels right
But when you're with me, I'll make you believe that I've got the key

Oh, so get in the car, you can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
You wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here, ow yeah, yeah

And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me until you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you (oh, yeah)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I've got the moves like Jagger

Christina Aguilera:
You wanna know how to make me smile
Take control of me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby running right
If I share my secret, you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this, hey, hey, hey, yeah

And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (take me by the tongue)
Kiss me until you're drunk and I'll show you (yeah, yeah)
