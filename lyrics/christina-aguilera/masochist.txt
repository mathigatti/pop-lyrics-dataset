Sometimes I get lonely, I get needy
I call you
And I know that it's crazy, that it's stupid
But it's the truth


I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go
Yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
But I must be some kind of masochist
To hurt myself in this way
'Cause lovin' you is so bad for me
Oh, but I just can't walk away

I get all my pleasure in your bedroom
In your arms
You get all your pleasure from my torture
From my harm

I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go
Ooh, yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
But I must be some kind of masochist, ooh
To hurt myself in this way
'Cause lovin' you is so bad for me
Oh, but I just can't walk away

The more I stay in this madness
The more the hurt is my comfort and release
And maybe I'm just too damaged
To really know what's good for me

I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go, I should go
Yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
Ooh, I must be some kind of masochist (oh, yeah)
To hurt myself in this way (ooh, yeah)
'Cause lovin' you is so bad for me
Oh, but I just can't walk away (away)

And even though it's so obvious (so obvious)
That all you give me is pain
Oh, I must be some kind of masochist
Oh, 'cause I just can't walk away
From you, from you, from you

Oh, I just can't walk away, away, away
