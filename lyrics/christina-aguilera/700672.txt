How can i forget the night we met?
I can still remember what you wore.
I had the strangest feeling like we'd met before.
Maybe it was something that you said.
How can i forget the night we met?


How can i forget when we first touched?
Never thought that i would want someone so much.
I looked in your eyes and then i knew for sure
You would be my love forevermore.
As you slept, i kept thinking of the night we met.

Memories come and go like a dream lost in the night,
But i remember everything about you,
How you came and changed my life.

And how can i forget those wedding bells?
You looked like an angel, i remember well
How we danced all night and never touched the ground.
How can i forget the night we met?

Memories come and go like a dream lost in the night,
But i remember everything about you,
How you came and changed my life.

How can i forget your greatest gift?
I swore i saw your eyes when i first looked at his,
And when you cried, the tears were falling from my eyes
As i held our baby, held on to his first breath.
How can i forget the first night that we met?
And how can i forget that night?
How can i forget the night we met
