This is the moment that I take over your mind frame
Step into the picture that I paint using my brain game
I'll elevate you so high I'll give you a migraine
Over and over put it on replay til you're insane


This is a rollercoaster that's about to be long gone
Once you jump in won't wanna get off, buckle up and hold on
Just let it go, give it up, allow yourself to transform
Follow me, follow me to a place unknown of no return

Are you ready, ready, ready to go-g-g-go?
Are you ready, ready, ready to go-g-g-go?

Bionic, take ya supersonic, ey
I'm bionic, hit ya like a rocket, ey yeah
Bionic, so damn bionic
Gonna get you with my electronic supersonic rocket, hey

Bionic, take ya supersonic, ey
I'm bionic, hit ya like a rocket, ey yeah
Bionic, so damn bionic
Gonna get you with my electronic supersonic rocket, hey

I am the future, put it on you like a hurricane
Call me the supernova that's taking over all time and space
I'm testing your dimension, can't keep up with what I create
I'll break your concentration, imagination with what I make
Many times imitated, not duplicated, can't be replaced
No-no-now lemme spell it out, everybody come shout my name
X-X-X-T-T-T-I-I-I-N-N-N-A (say)
X-X-X-T-T-T-I-I-I-N-N-N-A-A-A (say, say)

Are you ready, ready, ready to go-g-g-go?

Bionic, take ya supersonic, ey
I'm bionic, hit ya like a rocket, ey yeah
Bionic, so damn bionic
Gonna get you with my electronic supersonic rocket, hey

Bionic, so damn bionic
Gonna get you with my electronic supersonic rocket, hey
