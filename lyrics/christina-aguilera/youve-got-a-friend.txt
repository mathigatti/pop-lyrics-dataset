When you're down and troubled
And you need some loving care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Just close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there to brighten up
Even your darkest night


You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am,
I'll come running, see you again
Ooh, into spring, summer or fall
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will

Now, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
They will take your soul if you let them
So, now don't let them

Uuh, you just call out my name
And you know wherever I am, I'll come running
To see you again!
Don't you know into spring, summer or fall
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend,
You've got a friend
Oh, you know, you know, you know

You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know?
Ain't it good to know?
You've got a friend.
