When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah


When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

Girls like you give girls a bad name
Trying to get a boy, but you sound so lame
Thinking it's cute to act real dumb
But the jokes on you, you stupid, hun

Hold up, hold up, you're making no sense
You're talking out your ass like a waffle head, you bobblehead
Just keep your trap shut like your mamma said

Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead?

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

But wait, like, I don't get it?!

He-ha, I don't care what you looking at
Body so skinny but your head's so fat
Talky, talky, talky but you don't say shit
Got a way with words, you're give me laughing fits
Banging on the door, nobody upstairs
You're a nightmare on Elm Street, got everybody scared
Making me wanna run when you coming around
Because you what, wait, what, it's a frightening sound

Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead?

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

But wait, like, like what?
Like, like what?
I don't get it!
Like what? What?
Really?

Hangin' with the girls makes you feel unsure
So you hang with the boys, makes you feel secure
Act all catty 'cause you hate competition
Follow like a sheep on your airhead mission
Love in your face but behind your back
They say: I kinda like the booty but the girl is wack?
You say the boys, the boys they love me
Think you?re a pain in the butt, know what, you're crazy

Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead?

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

And the real girls say
I never play dumb to get what I want
And always come out the one that's on top
I never play dumb to get what I want
And always come out the one that's on top
I never play dumb to get what I want
And always come out the one that's on top
I never play dumb to get what I want
And always come out the one that's on top

I don't get it
