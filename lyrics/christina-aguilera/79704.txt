In these moments, moments of our lives,
All the world is ours, and this world is so right.
You and I sharing this time together,
Sharing the same dream.
As time goes by we will find...


These are the special times, times we'll remember.
These are the precious times,
The tender times we'll hold in our hearts forever.
These are the sweetest times, these times together.
And through it all, one thing will always be true,
The special times are the times I share with you.

With each moment, moment passing by,
We'll make memories that will last our whole lives.
As you and I travel through time together,
Living this sweet dream,
And everyday, we can say...

These are the special times, times we'll remember.
These are the precious times,
The tender times we'll hold in our hearts forever.
These are the sweetest times these times together,
And through it all, one thing will always be true,
The special times are the times I share with you.

These tender moments, when heaven is so close,
These are the moments that I know...

These are the special times, times we'll remember.
These are the precious times,
The tender times we'll hold in our hearts forever.
These are the sweetest times, these times together.
And through it all, one thing will always be true,
The special times are the times I share-
The special times are the times we share-
The special times are the times I share with you.
(These are the special times)
(Special times)
(These are the special times)
(These are the special times)
