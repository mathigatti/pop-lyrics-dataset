What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back, back into time


Donny Hathaway, Leena Horne
Miss Aretha, The Real Thing
James Brown, Billie Holiday
Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight
Louis Armstrong, Minnie Riperton
Otis Redding, Etta James

Back in the day, they used to say
Play that song, get it going â€” and the band played
And still today you hear us say
Play that song all night long, Mr. DJ
Though times have changed, they're still the same
We all need a minute to get away
So let it go and feel the flow
If you got soul, let the world know

We're gonna set the mood
(Set the mood off right)
Gonna go back to an old school groove
(Go back, to an old school groove, yeah)
Gonna rewind to another time
When the originators, innovators were alive, yeah
(Here we say now)

So break out the Marvin Gaye, your Etta James
Your Lady Day and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday
Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Get out tonight and grab that Soul Train

(Take it back, takin')
Back in the day, back in the day (ah, baby)
Back in the day, back in the day (won't you take me back?)
Back in the day, back in the day (I'll do it)
Back in the day, back in the day (oh, yeah)

Y'all remember back in the day, you dig
Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald

Now Chain Of Fools and Respect
Was the anthem of a woman, Aretha said
What's Going On, Let's Get It On
Such classic songs, don't forget them
Though times have changed, they still remain
My inspiration everyday
So give it up for the ones
Who came before, opened up that door

We're gonna set the mood
(We're gonna, set the mood)
Gonna go back to an old school groove
(Go back, to an old school groove)
Gonna rewind to another time
(Rewind, another time, yeah)
When the originators, innovators were alive, yeah

So break out the Marvin Gaye, your Etta James
Your Lady Day and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday
Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Get out tonight and grab that Soul Train

(Take it back, takin')
Back in the day, back in the day (ah, baby)
Back in the day, back in the day (won't you take me back?)
Back in the day, back in the day (I'll do it)
Back in the day, back in the day

So get up, relive it
Gotta let yourself flow
Give up your praise
Come celebrate
Just get up, get on it
Get yourself on the floor
Don't back away (don't back away)
Come celebrate (we're gonna celebrate, yeah)

So break out the Marvin Gaye, your Etta James
Your Lady Day and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life (oh, yeah, ooh, alright)
The sound and vibe of yesterday (the sound and vibe, alright)
Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Get out tonight and grab that Soul Train

(Takin' it back, back in the day, the day)
Back in the day, back in the day
Back in the day, back in the day
Back in the day, back in the day (back in the day)
Back in the day, back in the day

I said, ah, baby
I said, I'll do it
Ah, baby
