Another shot of whiskey please bartender
Keep it coming 'til I don't remember at all
How bad it hurts when you're gone (no, no, no, no)


Turn the music up a little bit louder
Just gotta get past the midnight hour (uh huh)
Maybe tomorrow it won't be this hard

Who am I kidding?
I know what I'm missing

Oh, I had my heart set on you
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I waited and waited so long
For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah, yeah)
I'm just a fool
(Yeah)

I say that I don't care and walk away, whatever
And I tell myself we were bad together (uh, huh)
But that's just me trying to move on without you

But who am I kidding?
I know what I'm missing

I, I had my heart set on you
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I waited and waited so long
For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah, yeah)
I'm just a fool

For holding onto something that's
Never ever gonna come back
I can't accept that it's lost

I should've let it go
Held my tongue
Kept my big mouth shut
'Cause now everything is just wrong, wrong, wrong

I'm just a fool
A fool for you
I'm just a fool

I, I had my heart set on you (uh)
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I waited and waited so long
For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah, yeah)
I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool

It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm just a fool
