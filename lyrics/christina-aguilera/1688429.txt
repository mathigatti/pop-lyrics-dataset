A rubber band is what I call your love for me
'Cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline
But all this back and forth is freaky, it's confusing me
Like a pencil trying to write and you're erasing me


If I was a ruler I'll set you straight
But your love is like a sharpener, it really grates
'Cause when I'm trying to bounce, you pull me back
And when I try to come to you, you give me slack

Yo-yo-your lo-lo-love is pulling like a rubber band
Yo-yo-your lo-lo-love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, everlastic love, everlusting love
Such a spastic love
Elastic love, everlastic love, everlusting love
Such a spastic love

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

A rubber band was an analogy
You can even say it's a metaphor
The tension between you and me
I ain't gonna feel it if you let it go

I can take a little bit and make it more
A little bit of hate can make it war
But a lot of love ain't enough
And so, I don't really know how we find the cure

Yo-yo-your lo-lo-love is pulling like a rubber band
Yo-yo-your lo-lo-love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, everlastic love, everlusting love
Such a spastic love
Elastic love, everlastic love, everlusting love
Such a spastic love

Love, love, love

Pa-pa-pa-pa-paper clips they couldn't even hold us together
Pa-pa-paper clips they couldn't even hold us together
Pa-pa-paper clips they couldn't even hold us together

If we were gaffer taped maybe we could spend the summer
You could say your piece, you could post it on paper
When your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler

Yo-yo-your lo-lo-love is pulling like a rubber band
Yo-yo-your lo-lo-love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, everlastic love, everlusting love
Such a spastic love
Elastic love, everlastic love, everlusting love
Such a spastic love

Elastic love, everlastic love, everlusting love
Such a spastic love
Elastic love, everlastic love, everlusting love
Such a spastic love

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
