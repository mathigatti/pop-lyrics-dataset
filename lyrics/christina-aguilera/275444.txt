Share my life
Take me for what I am
'Coz I've never changed
All my colours for you


I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow

I won't hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

And don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms a few days
Or must I imagine you there

Don't walk away from me
I have nothing nothing nothing
If I don't love you
If I don't have you

You see through
Right through the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow

I won't hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Your lovem I remember
Forever

And don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms a few days
Or must I imagine you there

Don't walk away from me, no
I have nothing nothing nothing
If I don't love you, you
If I don't have you, baby
