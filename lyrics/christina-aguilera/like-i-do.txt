Right, heaviest heaven, talk to the reverend
But I know you bad as fuck and I'm tryna fuck
And you know we perfect baby girl, look at us
Make a young nigga cash out and run it up
All that little booty in your trunk
Make a man wanna say hallelujah when they jump
Make 'em buy a little Porsche, I'm around you so we stunt
Black men, black car, let you buy you what you want, uh
No, wait, baby you a problem
Sagittarius, hmm, exciting
Link and Aguilera, so you know we're gossip
Coexistence, you the moon, I'm the sun
Genie in my bottle, I'm trying to rub on your hips
Ain't no other man who can talk to you like I did, that's real
Let's start a family, I'm Uncle Phil, you my Aunt Viv
Fly to Spain, go to Rome
We don't ever have to ever go home
I wanna love you from your head to your toe
I like a little fuss and fighting when I go
You say leave, tell me stay, want me go
Then I leave, pump fake like I'm gone
But you know I never leave you on your own
And you're too bad for these brothers who be on your phone like


Let me make this simple for ya
Lay it out on the table for ya
In case you need a little reminder
I've been doing this way before you
Boy, you already know my story
You were raised in all my glory

I don't need your little money
I can put you under something
Stop talking, we can get along
We can Marvin Gaye and get it on
Where you want to be, I've been before
Shh, say no more
Boy, you're so much better when you don't speak
If you get somethin', get one thing
Can't play me, boy, I'm out of your league

No, baby, you can't do it quite like I do
I do
Like I do
I may not want, but just might have to show you
Show you
What I do
And you can't do it quite like I do

This feeling is legendary
Welcome to my sanctuary
Every time like the first time
But, baby, girls like me ain't temporary
Can't fake it when it comes this natural
I ain't ever tried, it's just natural, ha

I don't need your little money
I can put you under something
Stop talking, we can get along
We can Marvin Gaye and get it on
Where you wanna be, I've been before
Shh, say no more
Boy, you're so much better when you don't speak
If you get somethin', get one thing
Can't play me, boy, I'm out of your league

No, baby, you can't do it quite like I do
I do
Like I do
I may not want, but just might have to show you
Show you
What I do
And you can't do it quite like I do

Ooh (Ooh)
Can't keep running your mouth (can't keep running your mouth)
I got time, but I got time now (got time now)
What I gotta lie, what I gotta lie about? (What I gotta lie about?)
Ooh (oooh)
There you go running your mouth (there you go running your mouth)
Show me what it is, show me right now (show me what it is, show me right now)
'Cause I can do it without you (oh, oh)

Don't talk for a second, just get all this lesson
Don't you second guess it, just show some respect and
It can go far for you, I know it's kind of hard for you
It's not my job, but you're working so hard
I can share a bar or two
Plus you're kinda cute

Stop talking, we can get along
We can Marvin Gaye and get it on
Where you wanna be, I've been before
Shh, say no more (say no more)
Boy, you're so much better when you don't speak
If you get somethin', get one thing
Can't play me, boy, I'm out of your league

No, baby, you can't do it quite like I do (woo)
I do (yeah)
Like I do (like I do)
I may not want, but just might have to show you (let me show you what I do now, baby)
Show you (can't do it, boy, like I do, yeah, yeah)
What I do (yeah)
And you can't do it quite like I do
