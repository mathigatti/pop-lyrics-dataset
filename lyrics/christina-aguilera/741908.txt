If you see me walking down the street
Or in the pages of your magazines
Looking just a little differently
Showing off a softer side of me
They say I'm looking like a lady
They say that love has gone and changed me
But don't be fooled by everything you see
I gotta let the naughty in me free


There's a woman inside of all of us
Who never quite seems to get enough
Tryin' to play by the rules is rough
'Cause sooner or later something's gonna erupt us 'cause

I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree
And if you want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me
I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree
And if you want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me

No matter what you thinkin' of me
Still dirrty
And if ya still want it with me
Still got it
No matter what you thinkin' of me
Still dirrty
Still got that freak in me

Why is a woman's sexuality
Always under so much scrutiny?
Why can't she do exactly as she please
Without being called a million things?
They say I'm not the girl they used to know
'Cause I don't always wear revealing clothes
But don't be fooled the moment I get home
I'm letting loose, giving a private show

There's some women out there who talk and stare
Who never seem to let down their hair
Like to past judgement but they're just scared
And don't know what they're missing, so they better beware

'Cause I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree
And if you want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me
I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree
And if you want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me

No matter what you thinkin' of me
Still dirrty
And if ya still want it with me
Still got it
No matter what you thinkin' of me
Still dirrty
Still got that freak in me

Don't tell me to behave
'Cause I'll never play that game
Don't tell me what to do
'Cause I'll never be uptight like you
Don't look at me that way
'Cause I ain't never gonna change
And if you're talkin' 'bout my life
You're only wasting your own time

If I want to wear lingere outside of my clothes
If I want to be erotic in my own videos
If I want to be provacative, well, that ain't a sin
Maybe you're not comfortable in your own skin

I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree, in me
And if you want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me
I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree, in me
And if you want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me
