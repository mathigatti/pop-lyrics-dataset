I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you


I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly, but darling, can't you see?
There's no one more important to me
Darling, can't you see it through me?
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth witholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding, oh, yeah
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life 'cause you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together, together
When we were alone and I was singing this song for you

Oh, I, oh, I
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
And I love you, I love you, love you for my life
'Cause you are a friend of mine
When my life, when my life is over
Remember when we were together, baby
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
Ooh, we were alone now and I was singing this song for you
Said, said we were alone and I was singing this song for

Singing this song for you, you, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Singing this song, singing this song, singing this song for you
