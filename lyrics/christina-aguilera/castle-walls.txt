Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls, these castle walls
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls


[T.I.]
Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you think I got it made, better look again
I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy
With Phantoms e Ferrari's in the driveway
But you see the pain and the change of the sane man's sanity
Your vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparently it's damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas he may seem alright but all the disadvantages
His family encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my lines while I dare you with a stare at you
While it surelly seem like the King's life ain't glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the cameras doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile

[Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (these castle walls)
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls

Honestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit of all that I've accomplished
If my key is never with it, shit me knowing this
Why should the verses I have laid
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised?
I guess I'm saying that to say that oppotunity
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging Yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah ain't paied and Nique'Nique ain't straight
Would your favorite song about the whips, money and shit
Be relevant If you found out the money wasn't real, nope
So me being the GOAT shouldn't mean
More to me than see it to a king though
From a bad ass kid to a man with some dough
Otherwise I may well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefing with Flip,
Shawty Low, with Gucci or Ludacris
Or if I'm fucking with a hoe,
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand
Or slap me in the face, hey, I'm just the man
If they saying I ain't the best in making hit records
It's 'cause this is my life, this ain't just rapping
Didn't think it all it was that deep, did ya dawg
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Didn't think it all it was that deep, did ya dawg
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls

Everyone thinks that I have it all

If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls

Nobody knows I'm all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom but I feel trapped inside it all

And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world it's beautiful
But there's no place to fall

[T.I.]
For the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell it
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced
With matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
The day that I walk away I ain't saying that I'm amazing
Downplaying the way I keep fellas from catching cases
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying
And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakers
From one of the greatest centers, blessed with most of God's graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty
I'm always being given to recordings than the level of your loyalty
(Hmm)
Obviously you've been ignoring me
Who else ya seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed
While all the critics was looking for Prince charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even tho he made a castle out of what used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorite rappers only rap about
But most of ya'll don't see the castle through the walls
And the smiles till it fall in piles so while

[Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
(These castle walls, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
If I should tumble (If I should tumble), if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls
