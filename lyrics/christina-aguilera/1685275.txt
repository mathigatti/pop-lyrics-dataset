No I'm not bitter, I'm not mad
Well maybe just a little, just a tad
I know every apple here ain't bad
But I found a worm in every single one I had
Boys! They're only good for fruit, I mean bananas
Boys! Them boys so nuts, they're drivin' me bananas
Oh boys! We should pack 'em up and ship 'em out
The boys, the boys
The boys, the boys
I hate 'em


I hate boys but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys but boys love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I. Hate. Boys

If you hate them boys, shake it
Shake it
If you hate them boys, shake it
Shake it

We would all be happy, all be glad
If sweet mama nature never had
All this dirty little boys
Who think that the girls were only made for toys (oooh boys!)
Boys are so immature, they rarely turn to men
But then again all men are dogs (roof!)
All men are dogs!

I hate boys but boys love me (boys love me)
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys but boys love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I. Hate. Boys

If you hate them boys, shake it
Shake it
If you hate them boys, shake it

Let's go, boys suck (shake it)
Make me sick
Inflated egos, little dicks
Use 'em up, spit 'em out
I H-A-T-E boys!

I hate boys but boys love me (boys love me, oh yeah)
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys but boys love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I. Hate. Boys

I hate boys but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys but boys love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I. Hate. Boys
