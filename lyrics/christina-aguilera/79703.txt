Ooh, hmm, oh yeah
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright


And tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight, night
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two, ooh yeah
Though its been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you, ooh oh yeah, ooh oh yeah
They know that Santa's on his way, he's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two, yeah oh
Although its been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, yeah
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah ooh
Oh yeah to you
(Hum, hum, hum...)
Merry Christmas...
