This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel


You said that you'd be here by nine
Instead you took your time
You didn't think to call me boy
Here I sit trying not to cry
Asking myself why you do this to me

Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say:
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What did you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
instead you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What did you do to me
Can't take what you did to me

Now I see that you've been doing wrong
Played me all along.
And made a fool of me, baby
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheating on me
How could you do it to me?

Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say:
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What did you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Instead you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What did you do to me
Can't take what you did to me

This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What did you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Instead you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What did you do to me
Can't take what you did to me

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What did you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Instead you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What did you do to me
Can't take what you did to me

I aint goin to take it no more
I aint goin to take it no more
I aint goin to take it no more
I aint goin to take it no more

Everthing that you said was a lie
Don't lie to me
