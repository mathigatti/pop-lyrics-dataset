If you're getting curious
Come along
It'll never be the same
There's no such thing as yesterday


Looking around
I see shadows on the ground
Am I lost or am I found
All I know is I'm falling in

Everything's red
Have I lost my pretty head?
Am I alive or am I dead?
Either way, I'm home again

Bit of imagination (oh)
Beyond our expectations (oh)
We have no limitations
Total emancipation
This is your invitation

Welcome to my wonderland
It doesn't matter
If they don't understand

'Cause we're in this madness together
Just go ask Alice, she'll tell ya
Welcome (welcome)
To my wonderland (wonderland)
We're in this madness together

If you want a real adventure
Let go and try to?
You are now forever changed
There's no such thing as yesterday (yesterday)

We're in this madness together
