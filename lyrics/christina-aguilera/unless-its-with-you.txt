Never wanted to feel weak in love, give up control
Never wanted to let down my guard, be vulnerable
Never wanted to feel helpless or too comfortable
I make it on my own, hey


I've been thinking a lot about the way that people change
The most beautiful beginnings can go down in flames
It's inevitable, and that's what's got me so afraid
I'd rather be alone

I don't want no white picket fence
Dozen roses and a wedding dress
Fairy tales are fake happiness
But here we are and I must confess

Yeah, I'm in over my head feeling confused
I'm losing my mind, don't know what to do
'Cause I don't want to get married
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you

You came into my life when I wasn't trying to find
Anybody to love, hiding what I felt inside
But you opened me up and now I finally realize
I'll be your girl for life

Oh, we don't need a big audience
Thousand people we never met
Me and you and a couple of friends
And here we are and I must confess

Yeah, I'm in over my head feeling confused
I'm losing my mind, don't know what to do
'Cause I don't want to get married
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you

And oh, I know that it's scary
But I know that it's true, I'm saying I do
'Cause I don't want to get married
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you

Beating heart and trembling hands
Take me just the way I am
'Cause all that I want is one and the same
For the rest of my days, for the rest of my days

You can ask me in a hundred years
If I would still be standing here
When we're old and gray, I'd answer the same
Our love will remain, oh, our love will remain

I was over my head feeling confused
Been losing my mind, don't know what to do
'Cause I don't want to get married
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you

And I know that it's scary
(But I know that it's true, I'm saying I do)
'Cause I don't want to get married
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you
Unless it's with you
