I came here tonight
To get you out of my mind
I'm gonna take what I find, oh, oh yeah
So open the box
Don't need no key, I'm unlocked
And I won't tell you to stop, oh, oh, yeah


Hey, boy
I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in
No need for talkin'
Hey, boy
So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin'

All I wanna do is love your body
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It's true what you heard
I am a freak, I'm disturbed
So come on and give me your worst, oh, oh, yeah
We're moving faster then slow
If you don't know where to go
I'll finish off on my own, oh, oh, yeah

Hey, boy
I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in
No need for talkin'
Hey, boy
So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin'

All I wanna do is love your body
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (your body)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I think you already know my name
I think you already know my name
Alright, say
I think you already know my name

All I wanna do is love your body
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (ay, ay, say)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (say, say, hey)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
