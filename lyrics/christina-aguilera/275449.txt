We've been together true and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone
To understand my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need


Real love
I'm searching for the real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searching for a real love

Oh when I met you I just knew
that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration
Lead me to want some real love

I've got to have a real love
Love so true and oh, baby
Oh my darlin'
I thought that love was you

Real love real love real love

Oh I'd like to have a real love
Love so true baby
Oh my darlin'

I thought you were the answer
To the question in my mind

But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong

maybe I'll find a real love
So I try my best and pray to God
He'd send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me
towards a love my heart can feel
I know I know I can be faithful
I can be your all and all
And give you good lovin' through the summertime
Winter, spring and fall

Real love

I'm searching for the real love
Someone to set my heart free

Real love real love real love
I'd like to have a real love
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
