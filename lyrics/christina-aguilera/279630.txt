Dolly: 
Horace Vandergelder, Mrs. Horace Vandergelder 
Just leave ev'rything to me 
Though it wont be like the first time 
How can it be like the first time? 
But Why does it have to be? 
Don't look for shooting stars 
For love is only love 
You touch and still you touch the proud 
Don't listen for those bells 
For love is only love 
And if it's love you've found 
Your heart won't hear a sound 
And you hold his hand 
You only hold his hand 
The violins are all a bluff 
But if you're really wise 
The silence of his eyes 
Will tell you 
Love is only love 
And it's wonderful enough 
Without the shooting star 
Without the sounds of bells 
Without the violins 
Love is wonderful enough!
