It's a cold and crazy world
That's raging outside
But baby me and all my girls
Are bringing on the fire
You show a little leg
Gotta shimmy your chest
It's a life, it?'s a style, it's a need
It's Burlesque


E-X-P-R-E-S-S, love, sex, ladies no regrets
E-X-P-R-E-S-S, love, sex, ladies no regrets

Been holding back for quite some time
And finally the moment?s right
I love to make the people stare
They know I got that certain savor faire, hey

Fasten up, can you imagine what
Would happen if I let you
Close enough to touch
Step into the fantasy
You?ll never wanna leave
Baby that?s guaranteed (Why?)

It's a passion, an emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque
It will move you, going through you, so do what I do, Burlesque
All ladies come, put your gown up
Boys throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it
It's Burlesque

Burlesque
Burlesque

I tease them ?til they?re on the edge
They scream? and moan for more
And more they beg, ah
I know it?s me they come to see
My pleasure brings them to their knees, hey yeh

Fasten up, can you imagine what
Would happen if I let you
Close enough to touch (ooh)
Step into the fantasy
You?ll never wanna leave
Baby that?s guaranteed (Why?)

It's a passion, an emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque
It will move you, going through you, so do what I do, Burlesque
All ladies come, put your gown up
Boys throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it
It's Burlesque

Burlesque, Burlesque
Burlesque, Burlesque
Burlesque, Burlesque

It's a passion, an emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque
It will move you, going through you, so do what I do, Burlesque
All ladies come, put your gown up
Boys throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it
It's Burlesque

Burlesque
Burlesque

Burlesque
Burlesque

Burlesque
