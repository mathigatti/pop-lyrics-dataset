Why? Why? Why?

There you are
In a darkened room
And you're all alone
Looking out the window
Your heart is cold and lost the will to love
Like a broken arrow


Here I stand in the shadows (in the shadows)
Come to me, come to me
Can't you see that

[chorus]
Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing to hold you
So bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely so why? (why?)
Why don't you let me love you?

Why? Why? Oh, Why? Why?

Can you hear my voice
Do you hear my song
It's a serenade
So your heart can find me, oh
And suddenly your flying down the stairs
Into my arms, baby

Before I start going crazy (oh, crazy, oh)
Run to me, run to me
'Cause I'm dying

[chorus]
Nobody wants to be lonely (to be lonely)
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing to hold you (oh, longing to hold you)
So bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely so why? (why?)
Why don't you let me love you?

I want to feel you deeply (feel you deeply)
Just like the air you're breathing (breathing)
I need you here in my life
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Don't walk away, walk away
No, no, no, no

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry (nobody wants to cry)
My body's longing to hold you (is longing to hold you)
So bad it hurts inside (hurts inside)
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely so why? (why?)
Why don't you let me love you?

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry (nobody wants to cry)
My body's longing to hold you (oh, longing to hold you)
So bad it hurts inside...
