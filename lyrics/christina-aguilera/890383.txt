Verse 1:
Never,
under estimate what i can be,
I can,
be a woman of such strength, you'll see,
cos everyone just thinks i'm not there,
no matter what my clothes or my hair,
chorus: but i'm not a little girl anymore,
i'd do anything to get in the big womans world,
cos if anyone sees what i see,
they'll see a woman just like me.


Verse 2:
I'll show you,
everything that i can do and know,
let me do,
what i can and i'll be on show,
cos everybody thinks i'm not there,
i'll do my best to reappear,
