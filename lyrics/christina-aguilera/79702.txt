I wish I was
Somebody's
I wish I was
Somebody's baby


Somebody's somebody
Somebody's somebody

Watchin lovers walkin'
Hand in hand they pass me by
Wish I was one of them
Wish I had somebody
Wakin' up beside me
Looking into my eyes at night
I want a love to call my own
I want someone that I can hold
Want someone wanting me
Wanna feel how it feels to be

Somebody's somebody
Someone's someone
Some sweet lover's lover
I wanna be that one
Someone faithful to someone faithful
Someone kind to someone kind to me
Somebody to somebody who loves me
Who loves me

Spending all of my time
Spending all my time on me
Where is that someone who
I can give my time to
Searching for that lover
With the love that will change my life
I want two arms to hold me close
I want the thing I need the most
Somebody needing me
So I can feel how it feels to be

Somebody's somebody
Someone's someone
Some sweet lover's lover
I wanna be that one
Someone faithful to someone faithful
Someone kind to someone kind to me
Somebody to somebody who loves me
Who loves me

What I'm looking for
Is someone to love me more
Than I've been loved before
With love so right
What I need to find
Is someone to hold me tight
What I mean is I want to be

Somebody's somebody
Someone's someone
Some sweet lover's lover
I wanna be that one
Someone faithful to someone faithful
Someone kind to someone kind to me
Somebody to somebody who loves me
Who loves me

Somebody's somebody
Somebody's somebody
Somebody's somebody
Somebody's somebody
I wish I was
Somebody's baby
