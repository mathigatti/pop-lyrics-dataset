Get this party going on
Shake it baby
Gotta, gotta make it strong
Move it to the music
Get this party going on
Shake it baby
Gotta, gotta make it strong
Move it to the music
Get on up and
Feel the groove
Let the music take control
And let your body move
Just get lost into the sound
Once the music takes you
You will finally have found
It will take, you away
To another state of mind
Where peace you'll find
Inside the sound, oh
Just escape, to a place
Troubles seem to flow away
When you get away


Get this party going on
(Get this party going on)
Shake it baby
Gotta, gotta make it strong
(Gotta, gotta move it)
Move it to the music
Get this party going on
(Shake it, shake it, baby, baby)
Shake it baby
Gotta, gotta make it strong
Move it to the music

Can't deny it
Deep in your soul
Once you get ahold of it
You'll never let it go
Just get up and do
Whatever you care
Get up to the dance floor
Put your hands in the air
It will take, you away
To another state of mind
Where peace you'll find
Inside the sound
Just escape, to a place
Troubles seem to flow away
When you get away

Get this party going on
(Get this party going on)
Shake it baby
Gotta, gotta make it strong
