People come and go in these hotel rooms
Looking for a chance to make dreams come true
In america


There's a great big future in this promise land
Everyone deserves to hold it in their hand
In america hmm

You can hear the bell ringing in the school yard
The kids are playing in the summer sun
Racing through the fields while they're still young

In america
There's a seed of hope
Where freedom grows
In america
Where I believe in coming home
America, where we live out
In america

There's no rain coming down on this open road
There's an old man living with a heart of gold
In america ooooh

Mothers losing sleep tonight
Working hard just to provide
In america oh oh

There's a warm wind blowing right down the freeway
There's a song that's playing that I never heard
But somehow I know every single word

In america
There's a seed of hope
Where freedom grows
In america
Where I believe in coming home
America, where we live out
In america
I want to be right next to you
America, I will be strong

America hmmm
America hmmm
America hmmm
Hmmm
Footprints chasing us in the sand
Young love given another chance

In america
There's a seed of hope
Where freedom grows
In america
Where I believe in coming home
America, where we live out
America, I want to be right next to you
America, I will be strong

Hmmm in america
