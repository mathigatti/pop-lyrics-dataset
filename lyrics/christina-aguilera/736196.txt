What is this feelin' comin' over me
I'm taken back in disbelief
Is this really me
In the mirror I see
Starin' back at me
Could it be
A new reflection of a woman complete


All of the sudden, I'm so carefree
Your lovin's doin' somethin' strange to me
I got a new flame
Haven't been the same
Somethin' in me's changed
Rearranged
And I feel that I've been saved

You've got me feelin'
Like You're that somethin' that I've been missin'
Everythin's heaven
'Cause life with you has been a bleesing

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, I got it bad in a serious way (oh yeah)
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, your love has brought me to a higher place (oh yeah)
Who knew, who knew, it'd be you to restore my faith
Every day, I am amazed
And it makes me wanna get down and pray

Makes me wanna get down and pray
Said it makes me wanna get down and pray

I've kept some company I shouldn't have
Made some mistakes but that's in the past
I'm confessin' here to you
Proff that I am through
I'm coming clean
And I can breathe
And I finally believe

You've got me thinkin'
I'll be alright and you're the reason
Ooh I can feel it, we're movin' in a new direction

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, I got it bad in a serious way (oh yeah)
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, your love has brought me to a higher place (oh yeah)
Who knew, who knew, it'd be you to restore my faith
Every day, I am amazed
And it makes me wanna get down and pray

Makes me wanna get down and pray
Said it makes me wanna get down and pray
Makes me wanna get down and pray
Makes me wanna get down and pray

Where would I be, where would I be
Without You by my side
Where would I be, where would I be
Without You standing by
Makes me wanna
Makes me need to
When I'm feelin' low and all alone
You're the light in my day

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, I got it bad in a serious way (oh yeah)
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, your love has brought me to a higher place (oh yeah)
Who knew, who knew, it'd be you to restore my faith
Every day, I am amazed
'Cause it makes me wanna get down and pray

'Cause it makes me wanna get down and pray
Makes me wanna get down and pray

Thank you, father
Wanna lift my hands up and praise
Every time I'm hearing your name
Want to reach out and rejoice
At the mere sound of Your voice

Alright, that's it
