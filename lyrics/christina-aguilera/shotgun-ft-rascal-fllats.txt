When did you know
Youâ€™re heart is mine
You told the tale
So many times
There's nothing better
We've got to do
With all these miles to get to where we're going to


It's hard road honey
And there ain't nobody I'd rather be next to
It's a rough ride baby but we're gonna make it together
Me and you
When you're tired, I'll grab the wheel
And you take over when I'm done
Love is taking turns
Riding shotgun

When did you know
Tell me again
My heart was yours
When you walked in
You made a vow
To hold it deep
And you kept your promise to me all these years

It's hard road honey
And there ain't nobody I'd rather be next to
It's a rough ride baby but we're gonna make it together
Me and you
When you're tired, I'll grab the wheel
And you take over when I'm done
Love is taking turns
Riding shotgun

It's you and me
Against the world
You are my man
And I'm your girl
And when we're old
I'll take your hand
And ask you then when did you know tell me again
