I know there’s hurt, I know there’s pain
But people change, Lord knows, I’ve been no saint
In my own way, regret choices I’ve made
How do I say I’m sorry
How do I say I’m sorry


But I was scared, I was unprepared
Oh, for the things you said
If I could undo that I hurt you
I would do anything for us to make it through

Draw me a smile
And save me tonight
I am a blank page, waiting for you to bring me to life
Paint me a heart
Let me be your art
I am a blank page, waiting for life to start

Let our hearts stop and beat as one together
Let our hearts stop and beat as one forever

How can I erase decisions I’ve made
How do I go back, what more can I say
All that remains are hearts filled with shame
How do we say we’re sorry
How do we say we’re sorry

But I was scared, I was unprepared
Oh, for the things you said
If I could undo that I hurt you
I would do anything for us to make it through

Draw me a smile
And save me tonight
I am a blank page, waiting for you to bring me to life
Paint me a heart
Let me be your art
I am a blank page, waiting for life to start

Let our hearts stop and beat as one together
Let out hearts stop and beat as one forever

I go back in time and I realize
Our spirit’s alive and we never died

Draw me a smile
And save me tonight
I'll be your blank page, waiting for you to bring me to life
Oh, paint me a heart
Let me be your art
I am a blank page, waiting for life to start

Let our hearts stop and beat as one together
Let our hearts stop and beat as one forever
