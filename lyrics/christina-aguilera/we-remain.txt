All the ways that you think you know me
All the limits that you figured out
Limits that you figured out
Had to learn to keep it all below me
Just to keep from being thrown around
Just to keep from being thrown around


Yeah
Every single time the wind blows
Every single time the wind blows
I see it in your face
In a cold night, there will be no fair fight
There will be no good night to turn and walk away

So, burn me with fire, drown me with rain
I'm gonna wake up screaming your name
Yes, I'm a sinner, yes, I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain

Now we talk about our wasted future
But we take a good look around
Yeah, we take a good look around
Yeah, we know it hasn't been for nothing
'Cause we never let it slow us down
No, we never let it slow us down

Yeah
Every single time the wind blows
Every single time the wind blows
I see it in your face
In a cold light, there will be no fair fight
There will be no good night, to turn and walk away

So, burn me with fire, drown me with rain
I'm gonna wake up screaming your name
Yes, I'm a sinner, yes, I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain

Said, we remain
We remain

Burn me with fire, drown me with rain
I'm gonna wake up screaming your name
Yes, I'm a sinner, yes, I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain
