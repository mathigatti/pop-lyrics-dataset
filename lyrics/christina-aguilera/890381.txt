When i think of you i need you...
When i dream of you at night i just hold my head up high..
When i see you in the stars and i sit with you at night
I will hold you in my arms and never let go


Chorus:

You and i forever
Forever in mane
Forever in the sky even in the rain
We will last forever
I will not forget, i feel your pain

When you come to my house
And we talk and talk and talk
I will cherish every word
When we walk at night in the park
I will always mark
Every spot you stepped on

Chorus:

You and i forever
Forever in mane
Forever in the sky and even in the rain
We will last forever
I will not forget, i feel your pain

Remember........ i feel your pain.
