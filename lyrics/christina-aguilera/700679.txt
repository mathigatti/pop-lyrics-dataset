When was the last time
You called me on the phone?
Said you love me
And said you needed me
When was it?oh baby


It was yesterday
That i could hide in your arms
You spoke those those lovely words
That you want me
Was that true? i wanna know

Chorus:
I never knew a love so true so pure so innocent
But all i have left is sadness and misery
Those fond memories have left me
Stripped and i'm in agony
So why you do this to me?

It seems like i've trusted you
Broken and torn are my heart when i finally see
You and her staying around that corner
Whispers of love have left me so alone
Did you truly love me?

Just the other day
I saw another her
She n you in a bus sharing every pleasant thing in the world
I was so emotional i wanted to see you so much
But now it seems that all is gone
I guess i must move on

Chorus

How can a boy like you act like a man?
Come back my darlin' and i'll gif u all the happiness
I love you
You know its true
Come back please come back...
