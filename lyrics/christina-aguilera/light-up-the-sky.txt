We are the stars up in the sky
We light the darkness, you and I
We are the flicker in the night
Never shined so bright


We are the strong and though we fall
We fought for love, we risked it all
Never backed down against the walls
It's what we're living for, yeah

Keep on rising higher
Blazing through the fire
Right down to the wire
Won't stop fighting harder
As we stand together
Chase our dreams forever

Now we have wings we can fly
We can be kings, you and I
Wipe away the tears from our eyes
We light up the sky

Now we have wings we can fly
We can be kings, you and I
Wipe away the tears from our eyes
We light up the skies

Although the road ahead was long
I was too weak to carry on
You picked me up you were my home
I never stood alone

No one can tell us what we want
No one can stop us anymore
No looking back, we're moving forward
No one can take this moment away

Keep on rising higher
Blazing through the fire
Right down to the wire
Won't stop fighting harder
As we stand together
Chase our dreams forever

Now we have wings we can fly
We can be kings, you and I
Wipe away the tears from our eyes
We light up the sky

Now we have wings we can fly
We can be kings, you and I
Wipe away the tears from our eyes
We light up the skies

When skies are grey
I'll light your way
I'll be your shoulder
You can lean on me

When skies are grey
I'll light your way
I'll be your shoulder
You can lean on me

Now we have wings we can fly
We can be kings, you and I
Wipe away the tears from our eyes
We light up the sky

Now we have wings we can fly
We can be kings, you and I
Wipe away the tears from our eyes
We light up the skies

We light up the sky
Light up the sky
We light up the sky
We light up the sky
