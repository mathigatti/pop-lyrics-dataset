Can you feel me?


Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it (yeah, can you feel me?)
Do that shit, do that shit, do it (my lady right here)
Do that shit, do that shit, do it (can you feel me?)

(Oh yeah)
On the dance floor
Yeah yeah yeah
Lets play a game
On the dance floor
(Oh yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah

[Diddy]
Let's play a game
Let's pretend for a second you don't know who I am or what I do
Let's just put it to the side
I can feel your heart beating and I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes, trying to see into your mind
See into your soul
See, no limits to the levels, me and you can go
When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you that makes me wanna change
I like the way you dancing and the way you play the game
I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it not saying a thing
The way you got me going, got me going outta my brains
I see us going at it, going in and out of them lanes

I don't want your innocence, I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a commitment and I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number, baby, I want you to wonder
I want you to come up, looking like something you wanna

[Christina Aguilera]
Tell me
What you thinking about when you got me waiting patiently
And usually, I don't have to wait for nobody
But there's something about you
That really got me feeling weak
And I'm trying to find the words to speak

Boy, I got my eyes on you
So tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you're gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you wanna it (tell me)
And you don't have to fight it (you don't)
'Cause baby you're invited (baby)

I know you're gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you wanna it (tell me)
And you don't have to fight it (you don't)
'Cause baby you're invited (baby)

[Diddy]
You're dreams fulfilled, you're rocking with the best
Unforgivable, I'ma put yo limits to the test
You're pulsating, your heart is beating outta your chest
You're hyperventilating, trying to catch your breath (don't stop)
I'm the first, I'm the next, I'm the end
I'm the boss, in your thoughts, that'll make your mind bend
Look how I approach you, look how I expose you
Look how Ive studied every move, now I know you
I don't wanna control you, I wanna console you
And do everything that I told you
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me
Fly with me, see life with new eyes with me (don't stop)
I'm the dream, I'm the one, I'm the reason you come
I'm a king, I'm a hung, I'm a beast
I'm the last thing your eyes see
The passion's inside me, it's yours
Now come try me, c'mon

[Christina Aguilera]
Tell me, what you thinking about
When your hands is all on me
Cause I've been thinking about all the possibilities
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be
'Cause you're sweeping me off my feet

Boy, I got my eyes on you
Tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you're gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you wanna it (tell me)
And you don't have to fight it (you don't)
'Cause baby you're invited (baby)

I know you're gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you wanna it (tell me)
And you don't have to fight it (you don't)
'Cause baby you're invited (baby)

I got a selection of the positions of affection with no pressure
So tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it, baby
I got a selection of the positions of affection with no pressure
So tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it, baby

Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
