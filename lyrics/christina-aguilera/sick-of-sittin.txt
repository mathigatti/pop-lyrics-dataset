Okay you guys
Is everybody ready?


I ain't built for no fake shit
Bitch don't play me, I raise kids
Just be thankful I gave you this
'Cause I don't need it
Don't try to tell me I'm crazy
It's good pay, but it's slavery
I can't live with these chains on me
I have to get free

I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin'
I'm sick of sittin', I've been workin' too hard to not be livin'
I'm sick of sittin', I don't need it no more
I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin'
I'm sick of sittin', I've been workin' too hard to not be livin'
I'm sick of sittin', I don't need you no more

I don't need it anymore (I don't need it anymore, yeah)
I don't need it anymore (oh no, no)
I don't need it anymore, no (just don't need it, just don't need it)

I make it a policy not to tell anybody to sit down
I just still encourage everybody else to stand up

I survived the dark ages
But the former trailblazer
Took out the knife and cut ties, I'm just fine
Honey, don't do me no favours
The root of evil couldn't change me
You pray for them, but don't pray for me
I can't move with these chains on me
I have to get free

I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin'
I'm sick of sittin', I've been workin' too hard to not be livin'
I'm sick of sittin', I don't need it no more
I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin'
I'm sick of sittin', I've been workin' too hard to not be livin'
I'm sick of sittin', I don't need you no more

I don't need it anymore (gotta let it go, let it go, let it go, had to be free)
I don't need it anymore (oh, hey)
I don't need it anymore, no (I don't, no, I don't, no)

They wanna take my shine (my shine)
They wanna take my time (my time)
But I'mma take what's mine (what's mine)
Ha, don't play with me (don't play with me)
They try to use my name (my name)
Ha, what they wouldn't do for the fame (for the fame)
But I ain't you and we ain't the same
This ain't a game to me, oh!

I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin'
I'm sick of sittin', I've been workin' too hard to not be livin'
I'm sick of sittin', I'm so emancipated
I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin'
I'm sick of sittin', I've been workin' too hard to not be livin'
I'm sick of sittin', I don't need you no more

I don't need it anymore
I don't need it anymore
I don't need it anymore, no!
