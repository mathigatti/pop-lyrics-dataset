A woman, wants to feel
A woman, wants to feel
I wanna thank you, for your persistence, for carrying on
Giving me time to give myself to you
Understanding my fears
Without ever giving up
I dare to look but not to touch
I want more than just one crazy night
Thank you for understanding
For being patient and being faithful to me
Chorus
A woman, wants to feel
To be loved and not be hurt
And you'll have her love, as you whished it
A woman, wants to feel
Before she gives herself, that she is happy
She'll say yes to you, without being afraid
If your love, is true
You will win, my heart
You had faith, without doubting you would be
My loved and noble prince
That's why i love you
Because you prevailed
I know the love is better
If both feel it, like you and me
It has been difficult
But finally you've won my heart
Chorus
Make me dream, make me feel
That i can trust in you
Because i feel the way you do
Make me dream, make me feel
You win a woman with a plenitude of love
Make me dream (i am), make me feel (your woman)
Telling me that your arms will be my support
That there's no one like you
A woman wants, to feel
To be loved and not be hurt
Ooh, because you waited for me i'll make you so happy
A woman, wants to feel
Before she gives herself, that she's happy
It was very difficult, but today i'm only for you
Chorus
In my soul forever
There is a place for you
No matter where i am, your love will find me
Illuminating my sky, my darkness
Chorus
My guardian will be refuge of your love
The faith that makes me believe
It gives worth to my life
A home to which i'll always return
I love you still...forever you, ohh ah
Only you...ohh yeah ohh
Chorus
That you threw in the air
With resentment, with pain
I lost because of pride
All your love
And today i'm dying to have you
And to again see you, next to me, oh ooh oh
When i'm not with you
I feel i'm not alive
There's a great emptiness
When i'm not with you
Everything is lost
I'm useless without your love
Come back, i can't live with myself
When i'm not, with you
When i'm not, i'm not (3x)
With you, with you
Hey, when i'm not with you
When i'm not, i'm not (3x)
I feel i'm not alive
Ohhh...
When i'm not with you
I feel i'm not alive
There's a great emptiness
When i'm not with you
Everything is olst
I'm useless without your love
Come back, i can't live with myself
When i'm not, with you
Woo, no ohh
When i'm not, i'm not (ohh ooh), with you (oh oh, hey)
When i'm not, i'm not (no!), with you
When i'm not with you
Everything is lost
When i'm not with you, i'm not, it's like (with you), it's like
It's like a punishment...
When i'm not, i'm not, with you
When i'm not, i'm not, with you
I can't live
If you're not here
When i'm not, i'm not, with you (4x)
Yeah, ohhh...ha ha ha
When i'm not with you
Everything is lost
When i'm not with you, i'm not, with you
I'm not with you
