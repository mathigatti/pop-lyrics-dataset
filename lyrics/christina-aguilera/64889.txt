I'm leaving today
Living it, leaving it to change


Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze
Tongue tied and twisted are all my memories
Celebrating a fantasy come true
Packing all my bags, finally on the move

I'm leaving today
Livin' it, leaving it to change

As I'm driving I'm captured by the view
So much beauty the road becomes my muse
The heat is rising and my head surfs through the wind
Cool, calm, collected is the child that lies within, see

I'm leaving today
Livin' it, leaving it to change
I'm leaving today
Livin' it, leaving it to change

But somehow I miss it, I think I'll really miss it one day
I turn up the radio and I'm feeling like I've never felt before
Turn down the memories of yesteryears and broken dreams I bring
Finally free

Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze

I'm leaving today
Livin' it, leaving it to change
I'm leaving today
Livin' it, leaving it to change

Livin' it, leaving it
Said I'm living it, leaving it
Living it, leaving it to change
(I'm leaving it to change)
But somehow I miss it, I think I'll really miss it
One day
