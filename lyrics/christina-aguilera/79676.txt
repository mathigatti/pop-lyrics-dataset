When I think how life used to be
Always walking in the shadows
Then I look at what you've given me
I feel like dancing on my tip toes
I must say everyday I wake
and realize you're by my side
I know I'm truly...
Chorus:
Blessed for everything you've given me
Blessed for all the tenderness you show
Do my best with every breath that's in me
Blessed to make sure you never go


There are times that test your faith
Til you think you might surrender
Baby I'm, I'm not ashamed to say that
my hope was growing slender
You were by in the nick of time
looking like an answered prayer
You know I'm truly...

Chorus:
Blessed for everything you've given me
Blessed for all the tenderness you show
Do my best with every breath that's in me
Blessed to make sure you never go

2nd chorus:
Blessed with love and understanding
Blessed when i hear you call my name
(when i hear you call my name)
Do my Best with faith that's never ending
Blessed to make sure you feel the same
Deep inside of me you fill me with your gentle touch
You know I'm truly...

Chorus:
Blessed for everything you've given me
Blessed for all the tenderness you show
Do my best with every breath that's in me
Blessed to see you never go
(never never never go)
