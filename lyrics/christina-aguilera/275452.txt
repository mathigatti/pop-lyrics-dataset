You better think (think) 
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (think, think)
Let your mind go let yourself be free


Let's go back, let's go back
Let's go way on back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't have been too much more than ten

I ain't no psychiatrist
I ain't no doctor with a degree
But it don't take too much high IQ's 
To see what you're doing to me

You better think (think) 
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

Oh freedom (freedom)
Yeah freedom (freedom)
Oh yeah freedom 
Come on freedom

Now freedom (freedom)
Freedom (freedom)
Freedom 
Come on now freedom

Hey, think about it
You, think about it

There ain't nothing you could ask 
I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
But I was gonna change, but I'm not to keep doing things I don't

Hey think about what you're trying to do to me
Baby (think) let your mind go, let yourself be free

Yes, People walking around everyday, playing games that they can score
Trying to make other people lose their minds, be careful you don't lose yours

Yeah think (think) think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, think (think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

Coz you need me (need me) and I need you (don't you know)
Without each other there ain't nothing people can do

Hey yeah think 
Let your mind go, let yourself be free
You gotta think
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

Oh freedom (freedom)
Freedom (freedom)
Yeah freedom
Come on now freedom
Freedom (freedom)

Freedom
Come on now freedom

Coz you need me (need me) and I need you (don't you know)
Without each other there ain't nothing people can do
