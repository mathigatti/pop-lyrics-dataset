Disco dancing with the lights down low
Beats are bumpin on the stereo
Neighbours banging on the bathroom wall
Your sayin' crank the bass
I'm gonna get some more


Waters runnin' in the wrong direction
Got a feelin' its a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Summit funnies goin' on inside my mind
I don't know what its pushin' me higher
Its the static from the floor below
And then its drops and catches like a fire
Its a sound i, its a sound i ,

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and round
Move to the overflow
Where the girls gettin down to the sound of the radio
Up to the mystic night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and round
Its the sound of the under
Sound of the underground

Chain reaction running through my veins
Pumps the bass line up into my brain
Screws my mind until i lose control
And when the building rocks i know its got my soul

Waters runnin' in the wrong direction
Got a feelin' its a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Sumthin funnies goin' on inside my mind
Don't know what its pushin' me higher
Its the static from the floor below
Then its drops and catches like a fire
Its a sound i, its a sound i know

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and around
In to the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and round
Its the sound of the under
Sound of the u
