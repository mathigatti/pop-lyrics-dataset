A prisoner of your love
Entangled in your web
Sweet whispers in my mind
I'm captured by your spell


I'm touched by this show of emotion
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion
Should I, should I
Oh you better be good to me

That's how it's got to be now
Cos I don't have no use
For what you loosely call the truth
Oh you better be good to me

Yes you better be good to me
C'mon now be good to me

And I think it's also right
That we don't need to fight
But did you think I'd just accept you in blind faith
Oh sure babe anything to please you
Oh you better be good to me

That's how it's got to be now
Cos I don't have the time for your over loaded lines
Yes you better be good to me
Yes you better be good to me

(Why can't you be, good to me) Good to me
(Why can't you be, good to me) Good to me
