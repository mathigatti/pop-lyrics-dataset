Share my life
Take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change
All my colors for you


I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing

Ladies and gentleman Whitney Hoston

Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
No, don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh, oh

Whatever you want, whatever you need
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
'Cause I'm every woman (every woman)
It's all in me, it's all in me, yeah!
I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z, whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
I can cast a spell, of secrets you can tell
Mix a special brew, put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly I will appear 'cause
I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa

I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman (Chaka Khan), I'm every woman (Chaka Khan)
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
