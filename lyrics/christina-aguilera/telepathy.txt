You know how to read my mind
I'm lost and it's you I find
Rush into my side, you hold me tight
I know when to take a hint
I know when you're feelin' bad
Make you feel you can feel like a man


And when you're feelin' blue, I know
You're sad, I'll give you all my love
'Cause I know you, yeah, I know you
I got your back, I do
Boo, you keep me safe from harm
Ooh, you take me in your arms
'Cause you know me, yeah, you know me
You've got telepathy

I've got you and you've got me
Yeah, I know you and you know me
We've got telepathy
Yeah, I've got you and you've got me
Yeah, I know you and you know me
We've got telepathy

I know you and you know me
We've got telepathy
I know you and you know me
We've got telepathy

You know how to read my mind
I'm lost and it's you I find
Rush into my side to hold me tight, you hold me tight
And I know when to take a hint
And I know when you're feelin' bad
Make you feel you can feel like a man, feel like a man

Boo, you keep me safe from harm
Ooh, you take me in your arms
Cause you know me, yeah you know me
You've got telepathy

I've got you and you've got me
Yeah, I know you and you know me
We've got telepathy
