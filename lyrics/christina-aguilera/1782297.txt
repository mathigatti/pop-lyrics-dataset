[Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all
Behind these castle walls


[T.I.]
Observing the estate through the gate
From the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made
Better look again
I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy
With Phantoms and Ferraris in the driveway
But you see, it came in exchange of a sane man's sanity
Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses
You would see the agony
Apparently it's damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas he may seem alright but all the disadvantages
His family encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my nine's a while, I dare you, it'll scare you
While it surely seem like the king life seem glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles
On the castle 'til it falls in a pile.

Everyone thinks that I have it all

These castle walls
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all
Behind these castle walls

Honestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit
Of all that I've accomplished if my kids never win at shit
Me knowing this, why should the verses I've laid
Be more important to me than the persons I've raised?
I guess I'm saying that to say the opportunity
That they just don't equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right's a mistake
If they should end up a stripper and make jack slanging yay
How could I ever consider myself a great

If Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight
Would your favorite song about the whips, money and shit
Be relevant if you found out the money wasn't rich, nope
So me being the goat shouldn't mean more to me
Than see it to a king though
From a bad ass kid to man with some dough
Otherwise I may well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefin'
With Flip and Shawty Lo

Gucci or Ludacris, or if I'm fucking with a ho
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense?
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand
That slapped me in the face, ay, I'm just a man
If they saying I ain't the best at making hit records
It's 'cause this my life, these ain't just records
Bet you ain't think at all nigga that deep, did ya dawg?
See you can't see the castle for the walls 'til it falls
Bet ain't think it was that deep, did ya dawg?
'Cause see you can't see the castle for the walls 'til it falls

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all
Behind these castle walls
Nobody knows I'm all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom
But I feel trapped inside it all
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world it's beautiful
But there's no place to fall

For the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell you this
Honest interpretation of how affected when faced with
Matters most rappers choose to keep
Locked away in the basement
Every day that I walk away I ain't sayin' that I'm amazin'
Downplaying the way I kept fellas from catchin' cases
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying
If when I say what I mean
Even when I'm surrounded by the fakers
From one of the greatest sinners
Blessed with most of God's graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest
From the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty

And more is being given to recordings
Than the level of your loyalty
You obviously been ignoring me
Who else ya seen make it through the storm
Unharmed this charmin'
While all the critics was looking for Prince Charmin'
Disregarded the King of the South but raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out what used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorite rappers only rap about
But most of y'all don't see the castle for the walls
And it smiles 'til it falls into piles, so while

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all
Behind these castle walls
