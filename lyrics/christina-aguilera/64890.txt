When they push, when they pull
Tell me, can you hold on?
When they say you should change
Can you lift your head high and stay strong?
Will you give up, give in
When your heart's crying out that is wrong?
Will you love you for you
At the end of it all?


Now, in life, there is gonna be times when you're feeling low
And in your mind, insecurities seem to take control
We start to look outside ourselves for acceptance and approval
We keep forgettin' that the one thing we should know is

Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
It's in your hands, the world is yours
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers, they will unfold
What are you waiting for?
Spread your wings and soar

The boy who wonders
Is he good enough for them?
Keep tryin' to please 'em all
But he just never seems to fit in
Then there's the girl who thinks
She'll never ever be good enough for him
Keeps tryin' to change
And that's a game she'll never win

In life, there is gonna be times when you're feeling low
And in your mind, insecurities, they seem to take control
We start to look outside ourselves for acceptance and approval
We keep forgettin' that the one thing we should know is

Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
It's in your hands, the world is yours
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers, they will unfold
What are you waiting for?
Spread your wings and soar

In the mirror is where she comes face to face with her fears
Her own reflection, now foreign to her after all these years
All of her life she has tried to be something besides herself
Now time has passed and she's ended up someone else with regret

What is it in us that makes us feel the need
To keep pretending? Gotta let ourselves be

Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
It's in your hands, the world is yours
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers, they will unfold
Don't wait, no more
Spread your wings and soar

Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
It's in your hands, the world is yours
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers, they will unfold
Don't wait
Spread your wings and soar

Don't wait no more
You can soar
(Spread your wings and soar)
Don't wait no more
(So what you waiting for?)
(Spread your wings and soar)
You can soar

So what you waiting for?
