Play something for me Alicia
There you go Chris, what's up?
I just got something on my mind
Speak on it girl


Oh
It's impossible
It's impossible to love you
If you don't let me know what you're feeling, yeah
It's impossible, for me to give you what you need
If you're always hiding from me
I don't know what hurt you, I just
Wanna make it right, 'cause boy I'm sick and tired of trying to read your mind

'Cause it's impossible
Oh baby it's impossible
For me to love you, this way
It's impossible
Oh baby it's impossible
If you're makin' it this way

Impossible to make it easy
If you always tryin' to make it so damn hard

How can I, how can I give you all my love baby
If you're always, always puttin' up your guard
This is not a circus, so don't you play me for a clown
How long can emotions keep on going up and down

It's impossible
Oh baby it's impossible
For me to love you, this way
It's impossible
Oh baby it's impossible
If you keep treating me this way over, over

Impossible baby
If you making it this way, this way
Oh baby, it's impossible
If you're making it this way
