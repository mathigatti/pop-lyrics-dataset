Here we are, safe at last
We can breathe a sigh,
Seems the storm has passed
Through it all, no one knew
That all the tears in heaven
Would bring me back to you
No one, I know,
Imagined we would make it,
But it only matters that we both believed


You and me, we're a miracle
Meant to be and nothing can change it
Mountains move and oceans part,
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us,
And heaven shines upon us everyday

Everytime I felt near defeat
You were there for me, oh
On my side completely
You give me strength, oh
You set me free
This is because of you, oh
I'm all that I can be, oh
When I'm with you,
The world is ours to reach for
Together there's nothing we can't do

You and me, we're a miracle
Meant to be and nothing can change it
Mountains move and oceans part,
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us,
And heaven shines upon us everyday
The chance was so unlikely,
That we would ever be, oh
Two stars among the heavens
Destiny brought you to me

You and me, we're a miracle
Meant to be and nothing can change it,
Mountains move and oceans part,
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us,
And heaven shines upon us everyday
You and me, we're a miracle, miracle
You and me, we're a miracle, miracle
Miracle
