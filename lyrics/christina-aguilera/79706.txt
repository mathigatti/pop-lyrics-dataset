You'll be my New Year's Day, my Valentine
I ain't gonna stop until I make you mine
You'll be my April Fool, my Mardi Gras
The music on my tounge, when I sing fa la la
You'll be my flower child, in the month of May
My sunny summer lover on my holiday
You'll be my autumn leaves, my Halloween
The winter snow and everything that's in between
This year I'm gonna take you home
This year I don't wanna be alone


This year, this Christmas, together,
And the minutes they pass, and the hours the fly
This year, this Christmas, forever
And the weeks and the months go rushing by
This year we have learned how to live
How to forget, and how to forgive without fear
Just love, this Christmas, this year

You'll be my spring ahead, my fall behind
The shimmy in my hips, oh when I bump and grind
You'll be my Santa boy, all dressed in red
And ride that little reindeer all through my head
Round and round
Round and round
Here we go
This year I'm gonna take you home
This year I don't wanna be alone

This year, this Christmas, together,
And the minutes they pass, and the hours the fly
This year, this Christmas, forever
And the weeks and the months go rushing by
This year we have learned how to live
How to forget and how to forgive without fear
Just love, this Christmas, this year

Day by day, I'm gonna get my way
This year I pray for you
Seasons turn, I've got a lot to learn
And I thank God for you
This year I'm gonna take you home
This year I don't wanna be alone

This year, this Christmas, together,
And the minutes they pass, and the hours they fly
This year, this Christmas, forever
And the weeks and the months go rushing by
This year we have learned how to live
How to forget and to forgive without fear
Just love, this Christmas, this year
