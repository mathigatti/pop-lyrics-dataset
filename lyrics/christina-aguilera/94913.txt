Oh ooh, yeah

Does it ever feel like
No one is with you
No one sees it your way
Everyone's against you


But it's your life
Gotta keep the faith
Hold your vision
You will find your way, yeah

Ah, yeah, oh yeah

I may not fit the mold
May not do what I'm told
I will not be swayed
By the things that they might say

They may have had their doubts
No matter what I've found
I have held my ground
Look at me, I'm still around

So dream on, dream on, yeah
Don't ever let them steer you wrong
When life comes knocking
Gotta keep on rocking
Open that door and
Shout it to the world, singing

Hello, hello, ha
Here I am, here I go
Yeah, yeah
'Cause I got love to give
And I got dreams to live
So hello, hello
Hello, hello, oh ooh yeah

And if you don't fit in
Just know your differences
Are beautiful to see
Well, they're beautiful to me

There's no one quite like you
Be proud in all you do
You know you'll find a way
Be who you are, don't be ashamed now

Shine baby, shine, yeah
'Cause it's all in your mind
The life you crave
The love you make, said
It's all up to you and
You just gotta say

Hello, hello
Here I am, and here I go
Yeah, yeah
I got love to give
And I got dreams to live
So hello, hello
Hello, hello

So don't you ever let it pass you by
It's your life
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You gotta dream, you know you gotta try
It's your time to shine, oh yeah
Said, shout it to the world, sing

Hello, hello, woo
Here I am, here I go
Yeah, yeah
I got love to give
And I got dreams to live
So hello, hello

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hello, hello, ooh yeah
Hello, hello, oh ooh, yeah
Hello, hello
Hello, hello, yeah
Hello, hello, I said yeah, yeah
Said it goes on and on, yeah yeah
Hello, hello
Hello, hello, ooh
Ooh yeah

Goodbye
See you later
Ciao
Muah
