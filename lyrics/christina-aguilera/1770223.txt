The dress is Channel, the shoes YSL
The bag is Dior, Agent Provocateaur
My address today, L.A. by the way
Above Sunset Strip, the Hills all the way
My rings are by Webster, they makes their heads twirl
They all say Darling, what did you do for those pearls??
What?! I am a good girl


The age I adore, the day oh no more
Breakfast Polo Launch, the poolside's at the shore
The Chateau for cocktails, the Counteryard at night
Downtown is for dinner, the hell is divine
You know I have found, the word's gone around
They all say my feet never do touch the ground
What?! I am a good girl

I am a good girl
