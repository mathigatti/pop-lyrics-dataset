Redman: Ah, dirty
Christina: Dirty
Redman: Filthy (filthy)
Redman: Nasty (Christina), you nasty
Christina: Yeah
Redman: Too dirty to clean my act up (haha)
Redman: If you ain't dirty, you ain't here to party (woo!)
Christina (Redman): Ladies (move), gentlemen (move)


[Redman]
Somebody ring the alarm, a fire on the roof
Ring the alarm (and I'm throwin' elbows) (x7)

[Christina]
Uh, let me loose
Oooh, I'm overdue
Gimme some room, comin' through
Paid my dues, in the mood
Me and the girls gonna shake the room
DJ's spinnin' (show your hands)
Let's get dirty (that's my jam)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweatin' till my clothes come off

It's explosive, speakers are thumpin'
Still jumpin', six in the mornin'
Table dancin', glasses are crashin'
No question, time for some action

Temperature's up (can you feel it?)
'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls, get your boys
Gonna make some noise

Gonna get rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty, it's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival

Ah, heat is up
So ladies, fellas, drop your cups
Bodies packed, front to back
Now move your ass, I like that
Tight hip huggers, low for sure
Shake a little somethin' on the floor
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweatin' till my clothes come off

Let's get open, cause a commotion
Still goin', eight in the mornin'
There's no stoppin', we keep it poppin'
Hot rockin', everyone's talkin'

Give all you got (give it to me), just hit the spot
Gonna get my girls, get your boys
Gonna make some noise

Rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty, it's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh sweat dripping over my body
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival

Here it comes, it's the one you've been waitin' on
Get up, get it up, yup that's what's up
Givin' just what you love to the maximum
Uh oh, here we go (here we go)
What to do when the music starts to drop
That's when we take it to the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Uh oh, here we go (here we go)
Ohh ohh ohh, yeah yeah...

[Redman (Christina)]
Yo, hot damn, Doc and Jam like a summer show
I keep my car lookin' like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas (ow!)
If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina (what?), better hop in here
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair (yeah)
The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waitin' for sister to act, like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up
Baby it's Brick City, you heard of that
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB, the way I'm freakin'

[Christina]
Gonna get rowdy (rowdy), gonna get a little unruly (ruly)
Get it fired up in a hurry (hurry)
Wanna get dirty, it's about time that I came to start the party (party)
Sweat drippin' over my body (body)
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival

Rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty, it's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival

Rowdy, dancin' and gettin' a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Let's get dirty, it's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty (oh dirty), it's about time for my arrival

Uh, what
