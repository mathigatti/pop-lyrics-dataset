I woke up this morning with a smile on my face
Nobody's going to bring me down today
Been feeling like nothings been going my way lately
So I decided right here and now that my outlooks got to change


That's why I'm going to
Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried
For every time somebody hurt my pride
Feeling like they won't let me live life
And take the time to look at what is mine

I see every lesson so clearly
I thank God for what I got from above
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace
They can say all they want to say about me

But I'm going to carry on
Keep on singing my song

I never want to dwell on my pain again
There's no use in reliving how I hurt back then
Remembering all of the hell I felt when I was running out of faith
Every step I vowed to take was towards a better day

Because I'm about to
Say goodbye to every single lie
All the fears I've held too long inside
Every time I felt I couldn't try
All the negativity I had inside

For too long I've been struggling
I couldn't go on
But now I've found
I'm feeling strong and moving on
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace
They can say all they want to say about me

But I'm going to carry on
Keep on singing my song

Every time I tried to be what they wanted from me
It never came naturally
So I ended up in misery, wasn't able to see
All the good around me
Wasted so much energy on what they thought of me
Simply just remembering to breathe

I'm human
I am not able to please
Everyone at the same time, so now I find
My peace of mind living one day at a time
I'm human and I answer to one God
It comes down to one love
Until I get to heaven above
I have made the decision never to give up
Till the I day I die no matter what

I'm going to carry on and keep on singing my song
(I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace)
They can do what they wanna
Say what they wanna say
(They can say what they wanna)
But I'm gonna keep on
I believe that they can take from me
But they can't take my inner piece
Say what you wanna say
(Wanna say)
I'm gonna sing my song
