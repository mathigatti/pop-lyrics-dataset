Other guys may be rich and handsome baby
But I prefer you 
[blablabla]
Now but I prefer you

You have the quality that can't be surpassed
And the love we found I know it's gonna last 
That's why I prefer you

You can't give me all the fine clothes
That have been offered to me baby
But I prefer you

You can't give the riches that go understand
But I still daddy I prefer you
You have the standard that I live by yeah
And all the good lovin that I need,
That's why I, I, I prefer you
