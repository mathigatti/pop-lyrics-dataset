Yo nas..
I don't think they wanna fuck with this
Gangsta shit.. fo' sho'
("danger.. danger..")


Check it out
It's on, and once again i bring niggaz the rough
Fuckin with us, that get you motherfuckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the super sports rally
Beatin up the block, leavin these motherfuckers shot
They ain't ready for the nakamici
I flip this shit like i'm kamaneze
Now dey a motherfuckin see me
They try to breeze me, but i got niggaz in new york
Comin kama-kize, sparkin this shit that keep me off the heezee
Jay-hovah, he with my man came over
To scoop me, blowin dukey, in the black range rover
Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for
Tell these niggaz why we here

[nas]
Nuttin but the new york to texas connection
Nuttin but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreamin, think i'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after i smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, dr. death, kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, houston niggaz, come through for niggaz
Scarface get a call and we shootin niggaz
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business
Tryin to make future figures, we two of the illest, what?

[chorus: nas]

You wet who i want wetted, i'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)  [3x]
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who i want wetted
Any nigga can get it

[scarface]
You say you got a problem?  then tell a nigga where he at
So i can study his motions and peel his motherfuckin cap
Where his
