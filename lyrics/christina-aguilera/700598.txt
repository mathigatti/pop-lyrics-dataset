May I have your attention please (2x)
Will the real Slim Shady please shut up?
I repeat, will the real slim shady please shut up?
Were gonna have a problem here....


You will act like never heard a white person before...
His rymes are a bore
Punk kid trying to be hardcore
You wash your mouth backwards worse than before
Making a snore
Within in the microphone
It's return of the no wait your a fool
You didn't pay money for this CD did you?
And Dr. Dre did
Everything you idiot with without Dre's beat begs your as good as dead.
The worlds had enough of Eminem
Diky diky...even his girlfriends cheating on him!
Look at him, walkin around living off Dre..
Acting so cool but hes really kinda weak though
Little twit blast me on his new CD (why?) 'Cause I turned him down for a date hehe..
As for the question of who came first was it it Carson Daily or was it Fred Durst?
I'm sorry slim but this is gonna hard, they both came close than you ever did jerk!
Your song is on my nerves your song is on my nerves
Your kinda lucky 'cause you got more fame than you deserved that is the message that I deliver to little kids
Of course their going to like you of course they do your like a cartoon
Version of Ricki Shroter on silver spoons!
You ain't nothing but a product processed to be brought up
You know a year from now you won't be thought of
So you write about dead animals and canabais
And someday you'll stop dating dogs and date higher mammals
And theres a million of women who think like me that all can see slim shad it is just a boy dealing with puberty
So if you agree scream loudly with me!
Your slim shady yes your the real shady you sound like Peter Brady you'll get quite irritating so won't the realy Slim Shady
Please shut up please shut up please shut up
Your slim shady yes your the real shady you sound like Peter Brady you'll get quite irritating so wont the realy slim shady
Please shut up please shut up please shut up.....
