Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sweet sugar, Candyman


I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really got me workin' up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous
Than a boy with charm

He's a one-stop shop
Makes the panties drop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman

He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline

He's a one-stop shop
Makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman

He's a one-stop shop
Makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman

Well by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth he really hit the spot
He got lips like sugar cane
Good things come for boys who wait

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Candyman, Candyman

Sweet sugar candyman
He's a one-stop gotcha hot
Makin' all the panties drop
Sweet sugar candyman
He's a one-stop got me hot
Making my uh pop
Sweet sugar candyman
He's a one-stop get it while it's hot
Baby don't stop
Sweet, sugar

He got those lips like sugar cane
Good things come for boys who wait
He's a one-stop shop
With a real big uh
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman (say what?)
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman (say)
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman (ooh)
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman

Candyman
Candyman
Candyman
Candyman
Candyman
Candyman
Candyman
Candyman

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
(Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine)
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
(Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine)

Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell
(Jane lost her grip and down she fell)
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
(Squared herself away as she let out a yell)
