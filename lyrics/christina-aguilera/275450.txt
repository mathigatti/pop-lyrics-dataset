When you hit rock bottom you go two ways to go
Straight up and sideways
I have seen my share of hard times
And I'm lettin' you know
Straight up is my way


Things are tough all over
But I got good news
When you get down to nothin'
You've got nothin' to lose
I was born naked
But I'm glory-bound
And a dead end street
Is just a place to turn around

When the sky is the limit
Up on easy street
Rock Bottom
Ain't no place to be
Rock Bottom
Ain't no place for me

When the law of the jungle is the law of the

land
Good luck stayin' alive
Well, I keep a clenched fist under
This hat in my hand
Cos only the strong survive
Things are tough all over
But I got good news
When you get down to nothin'
You got nothin' to lose

Anyway, rock bottom is good solid ground
And a dead end street
Is just a place to turn around
When the sky is the limit up on easy street

Rock Bottom
Ain't no place to be
Rock Bottom
Ain't no place for me no, no

When the sky is the limit
Up on easy street
Rock Bottom
Ain't no place for me
