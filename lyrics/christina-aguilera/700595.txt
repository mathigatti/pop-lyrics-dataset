I remember that time when i first laid eyes on you
I looked into your eyes and i knew all my dreams would come true
With you
Then you left last summer and rest of your family
And you left me here all alone for the rest of eternity


Chores
It's not easy to move on and it's certainly not easy to
Be as stong as you'd like to be
Because you left me here with only one memory

How could ya do it how could ya leave knowing what you've done
How could stand blaming for what i have done
What i have done

It was a cold night and i was at home crying over you my
Friends were there to calm me and i got up and i jumped
Over the balcony

I ......
I blame you my.... my friends do to
It was all....all because of you
Because you left me to find someone new
