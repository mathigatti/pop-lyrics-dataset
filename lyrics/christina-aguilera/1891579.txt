Come on, let's do it, uh, I do it, uh
I do it like a nine to five
I said I do it, uh, I do it, uh
I do it 'till you good and tired


I was sittin' all alone, yeah
A lot on my mind
I felt a tap on my shoulder
And I rolled my eyes
I wasn't in the mood for another man
Not telling me lies
But how can a girl say: No
When you flash that sexy smile?

And you say
Aah hah, hey
I want to see you get nasty (Is that right?)
I want to see you shake yo' ass, babe
Hey

N.A.S.T.Y; you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type
(Boy, you're just so nasty)
N.A.S.T.Y; you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type

In the middle of the floor now
And I just don't care
Take my body so low now
The crowd stops and stares
Let 'em say what they want, but I'm feeling it
And it's for you, baby
Tell me, how can a girl say: No
When you're calling out to me?

And you say
Aah hah, hey
I want to see you get nasty (Is that right?)
I want to see you shake yo' ass, babe
Hey

N.A.S.T.Y; you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type
(Boy, you're just so nasty)
N.A.S.T.Y; you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type

What's your fantasy?
(Ooh, nasty, nasty)
Tell them all to me
(Ooh, nasty, nasty)
Don't you be afraid
(Ooh, nasty, nasty)
Share your nasty secrets, baby!

Aah hah, hey
I want to see you get nasty (Is that right?)
I want to see you shake yo' ass, babe
Hey

N.A.S.T.Y; you're nasty
(Boy, you're just so nasty)
N.A.S.T.Y; you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you're just my type
(Boy, you're just so nasty)
N.A.S.T.Y; you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
Boy, you're just so - nasty
