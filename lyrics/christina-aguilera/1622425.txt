So the pain begins
As the music fades
And I'm left here with
With more than I can take


If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
I know I'll rise tomorrow
And I'll be strong enough to try

When the static clears
And all is said and done
I will realize
That we all need someone

If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
I know I'll rise tomorrow
And I'll be strong enought to try

So when you see me crashing
And there's nowhere left to fall
Will you lift me even higher
To rise above this all?
If you lift me up
If you lift me up

(Said if you lift me up)
If you see me crashing and there's nowhere left to fall
Will you lift me even higher to rise above this all? (Will you lift me higher?)
If you see me crashing and there's nowhere left to fall (said when you see me crashing)
Will you lift me even higher to rise above this all? (Will you lift me even higher?)

When you see me crashing
And there's nowhere left to fall
Will you lift me even higher
To rise above this all?
If you lift me up
Said if you lift me up

If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
