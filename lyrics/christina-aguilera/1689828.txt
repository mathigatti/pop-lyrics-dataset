I am timid and
I am over-sensitive
I am a lioness
I am tired and defensive
You take me in your arms
And I fold into you
I have insecurities
You show me I am beautiful


Love me or leave me
Just take it or leave it
It's not that I'm needy
Just need you to see me

Take me
Free me
See through to the core of me
Take me
Free me
There will be no more pretending

I am temperamental and
I have imperfections and
I am emotional
I am unpredictable
I am naked
I am vulnerable
I am a woman
I am opening up to you

Love me or leave me
Just take it or leave it
It's not that I'm needy
Just need you to see me

Take me
Free me
See through to the core of me
Take me
Free me
There will be no more pretending

Now I stand before you with my heart in my hands
I'm asking you to take me just the way that I am
Please lay down your arms
Do you know me?
Make me feel safe from harm

Oh, just take me
Free me
See through to the core of me (see through)
Take me
Free me
There will be no more pretending

I am temperamental and
I have imperfections and
I am emotional
There'll be no more pretending
