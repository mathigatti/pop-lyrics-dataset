This hit, that ice cold
Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
This one, for them hood girls
Them good girls
Straight masterpieces
Stylin', while in
Livin' it up in the city
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
Gotta kiss myself, I'm so pretty


I'm too hot (hot damn)
Called the police and a fireman
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Make a dragon want to retire, man
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Say my name, you know who I am
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Am I bad 'bout that money
Break it down

Girls, hit your Hallelujah
Girls, hit your Hallelujah
Girls, hit your Hallelujah
'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
Saturday night and we're in the spot
Don't believe me, just watch (come on)

Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

Stop
Wait a minute
Fill my cup, pour some liquor in it
Take a sip, sign a check
Julio! Get the stretch!
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon' show out
Smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy

I'm too hot (hot damn)
Call the police and a fireman
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Bitch say my name, you know who I am
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Am I bad 'bout that money
Break it down

Girls, hit your Hallelujah
Girls, hit your Hallelujah
Girls, hit your Hallelujah
'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don't believe me, just watch (come on)

Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Before we leave
Lemme tell y'all a lil' something
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
I said Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Come on, dance
Jump on it
If you sexy, than flaunt it
If you freaky, than own it
Don? T brag about it, come show me
Come on, dance
Jump on it
If you sexy, than flaunt it
Well, it's Saturday night and we in the spot

Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up

Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
