Welcome to the greatest show
Greatest show on earth
You've never seen before
Let the fairytale unfold
What's behind the smoke and glass?
Painted faces, everybody wears a mask
Are you selling them your soul?
Wil you be left out in the cold?


Is it all blue skies
Fun and games untill you fall
Then you're left without anyone at all
You're ridin' on a shooting star
With a smile upon your face
But soon the shine fades

And you're left out all alone
Wonderin'
Where did they all go

Been jaded, hated
Who'll be around when the limelight's faded
Been shot down
Pushed out
Made to smile when I wanted to frown
Always takin' a bow
Always workin' the crowd
Always makin' the rounds
Always playin' the clown
Who'll be stickin' it out?
Who'll be stayin' around?
When the lights go down?
