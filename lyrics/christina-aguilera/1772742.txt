Sweet love, sweet love, trapped in your love
I've opened up unsure I can trust
My heart and I were buried in dust
Free me, free us
You're all I need when I'm holding you tight
If you walk away I will suffer tonight


I found a man I can trust
And boy I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you
I am bound to you

So much, so young, I faced on my own
Walls I built up became my own
I'm strong and I'm sure there is a fire in us
Sweet love, so pure
I catch my breath with just one beating heart
And I brace myself, please, don't tear this apart

I found a man I can trust
And boy I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you
I am bound to

Suddenly the moment's here, I embrace my fears
Knowing that I have been carrying it all these years
Do I risk it all?
Come this far just to fall
Fall

Oh, I can trust
And boy I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you
I am, oh, I am
I'm bound to you
