Sometimes when I'm sitting on my bed
Feeling so so lonely
Wishing someone hold me
All I have is three little notes playing in my head


Outside, I can cover all the scars
Inside, lie the words just
Pleading to be heard 'cause
All I have is three million melodies to kill the hurt

And now I'm ready
Now I'm gonna sing them all out
Sing them out just to myself
I don't even care what the world thinks 'bout how I sound

'Cause when I open my mouth
My whole heart comes out
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied
I'm singing 'till I'm winning
I'mma sing all night
'Cause when I open my mouth
There's no place to hide
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free
I'm singing 'cause I'm winning, I'mma sing for me

And I stand in believing who I am
Take shots at my heart but
Who am I to give up?
Everybody needs a melody to set their souls free

My stage is the greatest in the world
Give back to the ones who
Struggled with me, stayed true
Reminding me to see my only chosen destiny

And now I'm ready
Now I'm gonna sing it out loud
Sing it out just for myself
I don't even care what the world thinks 'bout how I sound

'Cause when I open my mouth
My whole heart comes out
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied
I'm singing 'till I'm winning
I'mma sing all night
'Cause when I open my mouth
There's no place to hide
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free
I'm singing 'cause I'm winning, I'mma sing for me

Sing for me, sing for me
Sing for myself, sing what I believe
Let my heart, heart come out
Right here, right now, let the rain come down
Sing for me, sing for me
Sing for myself, sing what I believe
Let my heart, heart come out
Right here, right now, make my own, my very own sound

'Cause when I open my mouth
My whole heart comes out
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied
I'm singing 'till I'm winning
I'mma sing all night
'Cause when I open my mouth
There's no place to hide
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free
I'm singing 'cause I'm winning, I'mma sing for me
