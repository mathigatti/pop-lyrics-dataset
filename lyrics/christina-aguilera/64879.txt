Paparazzi
That was the clip of all
Limp Bizkit Fred Durst on stage
Scandal, gossip


[Fred Durst]
I did it all for the nookie

[News Clips]
Hook up
Slim Shady
I want
Britney
And they had to say something real clear

[Eminem]
And they had to kick Christina Aguilera out

[News Clips]
The two of them were not fighting
What the [?] was she talking about
Not at all
And you're forced to look at yourself
Britney
Christina Britney rivalry
We're gonna let Christina tell her side of the story

Waited a long time for this, feels right now
Allow me to introduce myself, want you to come a little closer
I'd like you to get to know me a little bit better, meet the real me

Sorry you can't define me, sorry I break the mold
Sorry that I speak my mind, sorry don't do what I'm told
Sorry if I don't fake it, sorry I come too real
I will never hide what I really feel, no way oh

So here it is, no hype, no glass, no pretense
Just me
Stripped
