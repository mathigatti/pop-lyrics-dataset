In the Mondrian, mhm-mhm, in Miami
Who's Galliano, whip-whip the Armani
When it drip-drip, lick-lick like a lolly
Oh, left from Jamaica, go a foreign pan tour
Jimmy Iovine, Tom Whalley and Lyor
Keep me and Chrissy in Christian Dior
But that was before, or, for you
My name Nicki, little daddy, and you?
You can do anything you put your mind to
Way you French kiss it, "Fran√ßais, parlez-vous?"
Way you work your tongue, can I hire you?
