It seems like a lifetime
Since I felt like a prisoner of my dreams, yeah
It took such a long time
For me to realize just how to be and to listen to me


Don't go thinking I'm not thankful
'Cause me, I've got my hands full of good things, oh
And I hope I can give back a little bit of what you've given me

(CHORUS)
So thank you for standing right by me [I will always love you]
So thank you for being behind me [You are just so amazing]
And watching me grow and letting others know
That you still believe in what I'll be, ha

So people have said things in times about me
That weren't always true, ooh yeah
But you've always been there to give that extra love
To pull me through to do what I gotta do
Cause there'll always be those ups and downs
But you've always seemed to stick around and see
See me through to believe, yeah

And I hope I can give back a little bit of what you've given me
You give me all that I need, yeah

(CHORUS)
So thank you for standing right by me [I thank you for everything]
So thank you for being behind me [Thank you, Christina]
And watching me grow and letting others know
That you still believe in what I'll be [Sing it, girl]

It took awhile 'til I could do what I wanted
And now I'm so happy that it started where we started
I'm thanking God that I could be in the position
To do my own thing now and make my own decisions
And so I'm thanking you for being true
And standing by me through and through
