You can move to biggest mountain and i write through the deep seat
Let me less the sky and seems when you alright here next toi me baby
That's what love can do oh
And i stop this ..so light here on your face
When time is .. and people freezen place and only you
Only you
That's what the love can do yeah


Take my hand here we go baby
Run the world dont' let it go baby
Never saw the bad can make me
Feel like we just stop and stop the world, world
Loving this morning evvery minute yeah
Stop the world, stop the world, wtop the world
