I dream, there's nothing that's too tough
There's nothing that's hard enough
For me and you, to get through
And I know, that with your hand in mine
There's not a goal, we can't reach in time


Life can bring us down, you see
Sometimes it's been our destiny
But I foresee, possibilities
For you and me, ohh
I can hold the faith, I know
That will see us through, it all

I have had a dream
(I have had a dream)
You and I can
Get through anything
(Get through anything)
Don't you ever say never, because
I have dreamed a dream
(I have dreamed a dream)
I know, I know we can
Get passed everything, ohh no

I feel, all can become real
Nothing's too impossible
For us to do, ohh and
I see, endless opportunities
We can reach oh, if we both believe, ohh

Sometimes hoping's not enough
The paths ahead can be so tough
But if we stay, confident we'll see
A brighter day, ohh
I can hold the faith, I know
That will see us through, the end
Ohh ooh, oh yeah yeah

I have had a dream
(I have had a dream)
You and I can
Get through anything
(Get through anything)
Don't you ever say never, because
I have dreamed a dream
(I have dreamed a dream)
I know we can
Get passed everything, ohh no

I have dreamed a dream
(I have dreamed and dream)
You and I
Can get through anything
(Get through anything)
Don't you ever say never, because
I have dreamed a dream
(I have dreamed a dream)
I know, we can, oh
Get passed everything, ohh yeah oh
