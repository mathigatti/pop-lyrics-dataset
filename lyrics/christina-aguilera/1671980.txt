Do do do do dood, do do do ,do do
Do do do do dood, always coca-cola (2x)


Wherever there's a pool there's always a flirt
Anytime there's school, there'll always be homework
Wherever there's a beat, there's always a drum
Anytime there's fun there's always coca-cola... yeah.

Chorus

The stars will always shine, the birds will always sing
As long as there is thirst, there's always the real thing
Coca-cola is always the one
Whenever there is fun, there's always coca-cola

Do do do do dood, do do do ,do do (coca-cola)
Do do do do dood, always coca-cola (ooh, ooh, oooh)

Do do do do dood, do do do ,do do (doo dood do do doooh)
Do do do do dood, always coca-cola (hey eh)

Let the sun shine, let it shine.
Always, always... coca-cola
Oh always.
