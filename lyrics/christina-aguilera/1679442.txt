I am done
Smoking gun
We've lost it all
The love is gone
She has won
Now it's no fun
We've lost it all
The love is gone


And we had magic
And this is tragic
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself

I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow you left me neglected
We've found our lives been changed
Baby, you lost me

And we tried
Oh, how we cry
We lost ourselves
The love has died
And though we tried
You can't deny
We're left as shells
We lost the fight

And we had magic
And this is tragic
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself
Ooh, oh

I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow you left me neglected
We've found our lives been changed
Baby, you lost me

Now I know you're sorry
And we were sweet
But you chose lust when
You deceived me
And you'll regret it
But it's too late
How can I ever trust you again?

I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow you left me neglected
We've found our lives been changed, yeah
Baby, you lost me
