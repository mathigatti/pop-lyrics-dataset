What an amazing time
What a family
How did the years go by
Now its only me


Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Like a cat in eat stuck in a moving car
A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake
What if they say that you're a climber
Naturally, I worried if I do it alone
Who really cares, causes it's your life
You never know it cold be great
Take a chance cause you might grow
Oh, ah, oh

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for

Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Take a chance you stupid ho

Like an echo pedal, you're repeating yourself
You know it all by heart
Why are you standing in one place
Born to blossom, bloom to perish
Ya know member a out cuz of yoyr sex chromosome
I know it's so messed up, how our society all think (for sure)
Life is short, you're capable (uh-huh)

Oh, oh, oh
uh,uh
uh,uh
Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million-dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for

What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting
What you waiting for

I can't wait to go back and do Japan
Get me lots of brand new fans
Osaka, Tokyo
You Harajuku girls
Damn you've got some wicked style

Gooooooooooooooooo

Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track
