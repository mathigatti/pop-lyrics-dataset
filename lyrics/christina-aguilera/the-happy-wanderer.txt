I love to go a wandering
Along the mountain track
And as i go, i love to sing
My knapsack on my back


Valderi, valdera
Valderi, val-de ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Valderi, valdera
My knapsack on my back

I love to wander by the stream
That dances in the sun
So joyously it calls to me
Come join my happy song

Valderi, valdera
Valderi, val-de ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Valderi, valdera
My knapsack on my back

Oh may i go a wandering
Until the day i die
Oh, may i always laugh and sing
Beneath god's clear blue sky

Valderi, valdera
Valderi, val-de ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Valderi, valdera
My knapsack on my back
