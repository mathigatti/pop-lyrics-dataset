It's not so easy, lovin' me
It gets so complicated
All the things you've gotta be
Everything's changin', but you're the truth
I'm amazed by all your patience
Everything I put you through


When I'm about to fall
Somehow you're always waiting with
Your open arms to catch me
You're gonna save me from myself
From myself, yes
You're gonna save me from myself

My love is tainted by your touch
Well some guys have shown me aces
But you've got that royal flush
I know it's crazy everyday
Well tomorrow may be shaky
But you never turn away

And don't ask me why I'm cryin'
'Cuz when I start to crumble
You know how to keep me smilin'
You always save me from myself
From myself, myself
You're gonna save me from myself

I know it's hard, it's hard
But you've broken all my walls
You've been my strength
So strong

And don't ask me why I love you
It's obvious your tenderness is what I need to make me
A better woman to myself
To myself, myself
You're gonna save me from my
Myself
