When I grow up I want to be a screenwriter
I want to be a journalist
I want to be a lion
I wan to be a lion
I am a lionness
I want to be a superhero
I am a superhero


I want to be a singer
I want to be a singer
I want to be a boss
I want to be a doctor
I want to be the boss

I am strong
I am invincible
I am a leader
I am the boss of my own world
I want to be heard
I want to be heard
I will be heard
I will make myself heard

I create my own rules
I will work hard
I am nobody's princess
I want to grow up and be president
I want to be president
