I'm reaching out to touch you
in the middle of the night
and I don't know if I've been sleeping
but I hold my pillow tight


Are you real or are you my
imagination playing games?
I can set you free, you'll always be
my one eternal flame.

Your dreamy eyes,
they just won't say good-bye
well, it must be my fate
cause I just can't escape 
And the passion never dies...
Oh, dreamy eyes
no matter how I cry
I just can't reach you
dreamy eyes

You're a vision of tomorrow
and a ghost from yesterday
and I've been trying not to let you
take my breath away.

You're a summer breeze that comes and goes
but somehow lingers on
tell me how can I forget you
If you've never really gone?

Your dreamy eyes
they just won't say good-bye
well, it must be my fate
'cause I just can't escape 
And the passion never dies...
Oh, dreamy eyes
no matter how I cry
I just can't reach you
dreamy eyes.

What do I have to do
to get that close to you and your...

Your dreamy eyes
they just won't say good-bye
well, it must be my fate
'cause I just can't escape 
And the passion never dies...
Oh, I tried so hard to release you
but no matter how I cry
I just keep seeing through
dreamy eyes.
