I've been standing where you left me (left me)
Praying that you'd come and get me (get me)
But now I've found my second wind (wind)
Now I've found my second skin (skin)


Well I know what you were thinking
You thought you'd watch me fade away
When you broke me into pieces
But I gave each piece a name, a name

One of me is wiser
One of me is stronger
One of me's a fighter
And there's a thousand faces of me
And we're gonna rise up
Yeah we're gonna rise up
For every time you wronged me
Well, you're gonna face an army, army of me

Welcome to my revolution
All your walls are breaking down (down)
It's time you had a taste of losing (losing)
Time the tables turned around (round)

I see a glimpse of recognition
But it's too little it's too late, it's too late
And what you though was your best decision
Just became your worst mistake

One of me is wiser
One of me is stronger
One of me's a fighter
And there's a thousand faces of me
And we're gonna rise up
Yeah we're gonna rise up
For every time you wronged me
Well, you're gonna face an army, army of me

So how does it feel
To know that I beat you
That I can defeat you
Oh, how does it feel
'Cause it sure feels sweeter
It sure feels sweeter to me

Now that I'm wiser
Now that I'm stronger
Now that I'm a fighter
There's a thousand faces of me
And I'm gonna rise up
Yeah I'm gonna rise up
For every time you wronged me
There's a thousand faces of me

And I'm gonna rise up
Yeah I'm gonna rise up
For every time you wronged me
You're gonna face an army, army of me
