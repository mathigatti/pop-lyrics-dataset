Love can move mountains

There ain't a dream that don't have a chance 
To come true now 
It just takes a little faith baby 
Anything that we want to do, we can do now 
There ain't nothing in our way baby 


Nothing our love couldn't raise above 
We can get through the night 
We can get to the light 
Long as we got our love to light the way 

With a little faith 
Just a little trust 
If you believe in love 
Love can move mountains 

Believe in your heart 
And feel it in your soul 
Love, love can move mountains 
Baby...

Oceans deep and mountains high 
They can't stop us 
Because love is on our side 
We can reach the heavens and touch the sky 
Just believe it, believe in you and I

If we got love that is strong enough 
We can do anything, we can through anything 
'Coz through it all love will always find a way 

With a little faith... 
Just a little trust
If you believe in love 
Love can move mountains

Believe in your heart 
And feel it in your soul 
Love, love can move mountains 
Baby...

You believe in me 
I'll believe in you 
If we believe in each other 
Nothing we can't do 

If we got love that's strong enough 
Love will find a way 

With a little faith
Just a little trust
If you believe in love 
Love can move mountains

Believe in your heart 
And feel it in your soul 
Love, love can move mountains 
Baby...

Just a little trust
If you believe in love 
Love can move mountains

Believe in your heart 
And feel it in your soul 
Love, love can move mountains
