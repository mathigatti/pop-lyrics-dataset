Look at me
You may think you see
Who I really am
But you'll never know me
Everyday
It's as if I play a part
Now i see if I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart


Who, is that girl I see
Starring straight
Back at me
When will my reflection show
Who I am, inside

I am now
In a world where I have to hide my heart
And what I believe in
But some how
I will show the world, what's inside my heart
And be loved for who I am

Who, is that girl I see
Starring straight
Back at me
Why is my reflection someone
I don't know
Must I pretend that I'm
Someone else
For all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am
Inside

There's a heart that must be free
To fly
That burns
With the need to know
The reason why

Why must we all conceal
What we think
How we feel
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide

I won't pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside
When will my reflection show
Who I am, inside

Ohhh, yeah, yeah, mmmm
