I made you think you don't understand

I used to think that hapiness
Could only be something that happened to somebody else
Everybody believed, everybody but me, yeah, yeah
And I've been hurt so many times
Before that my hope was dyin', so sick of tryin'
Everybody could see, everybody but me, yeah, yeah


But then you came into my life
You opened up my softer side
And I could see into your eyes
And suddenly, I realized

I made you think (you don't understand)
All the times you didn't understand
Why you couldn't just be my man
I made you think (you don't understand)
There were many walls you had to climb
If you really wanted to be mine
I made you think (you don't understand)
After all hoops I put you through
Now I see that I'm in love with you
Now, I hope you finally understand

So many tears I had to cry
But you had many more of your own you had to dry
But you stuck it out and you're here with me now, yeah, yeah
And rememberin' the days I pushed away your love
You called my bluff and you still stayed around
Yeah, you figured me out, said, you got me down

And there's no way to lie to you
You know me better than I do
Baby, ooh, you see me through
I'd be no good without you

I made you think (you don't understand)
All the times you didn't understand
Why you couldn't just be my man
I made you think (you don't understand)
There were many walls you had to climb
If you really wanted to be mine
I made you think (you don't understand)
After all hoops I put you through
Now I see that I'm in love with you
Now, I hope you finally understand

Baby, won't you listen now?
Can't you see just what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Said, baby, won't you listen now?
Can't you see just what I'm talkin' 'bout?

Time went on, and I was wrong
To keep my distance for so long
So afraid you wouldn't stay
But you never turned away
Always right, right by my side
You're forever in my life
Don't you go, 'cause now I know
That in you I've found a home

And I could see into your eyes
And suddenly, I realized

I made you think (you don't understand)
All the times you didn't understand
Why you couldn't just be my man
I made you think (you don't understand)
There were many walls you had to climb
If you really wanted to be mine
I made you think (you don't understand)
After all hoops I put you through
Now I see that I'm in love with you

I made you think you don't understand
