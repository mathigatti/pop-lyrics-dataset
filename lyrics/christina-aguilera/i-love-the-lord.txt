I love the, the Lord
He heard my cry
And pitied every groan
Long as I, I live


And troubles rise
I'll hasten to his throne
Oh, I love the Lord
(I love the Lord)

I sure do, surely do love the Lord
He heard
(He heard my cry)
He heard my cry

And he pitied every groan!
(And pitied every groan)
Yes, he did!
Every groan

Long as I live!
(Long as I live)
Long as I, I live
And troubles rise
(And troubles rise)

Troubles rise
(I'll hasten to)
I hasten to, to, to, to, to
I'll hasten
I'll hasten to his throne

(His throne)
Know I can go
(I'll hasten to his throne)
Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!

When tears are streaming down my eyes
(I'll hasten to his throne)
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne
Yes, I will
(I'll hasten to his throne)
I'll run

I know I can go to his throne
I know I can go, I know I can go
(I'll hasten to his throne)
I'll hasten
I'm gonna run

I know I can go, I know where I can go
(I'll hasten to his throne)
I'll hasten! I'll hasten to
See, I'm gonna run!
Lord, you know I will!

(I'll hasten to his throne)
When there's nowhere to go, I know I can go to him!
I know I can run to Jesus! Oh, oh!
(I'll hasten to his throne)

I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his, his throne! Yeah, yeah, yes!
(I'll hasten to his throne)
I'll hasten
Hasten to his throne! Hey, hey!
Surely, I will
