The world seems so cold
When I face so much all alone
A little scared to move on
And knowing how fast I have grown


And I wonder just where I fit in
Hold the vision of life in my head, oh yes

I will be
Strong on my own
I will see through the rain
I will find my way
I will keep on
Traveling this road
'Till I finally reach my dream
'Till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny

I can't let go now
Even when darkness surrounds
But if I hold on
I will show the world
All the things that you never expected to see
From little old me, this Pittsburg girl

And I wonder just where my place is
Close my eyes and I remind myself this, oh yeah

I will be
Strong on my own
I will see through the rain
I will find my way
I will keep on
Traveling this road
'Till I finally reach my dream
'Till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny

It comforts me, ooh, it keeps me
Alive each day of my life
Always guiding me, providing me
With the hope I desperately need
Oh, and I gotta believe
There's something out that meant for me
Oh, I get on my knee, praying I will receive
The courage to grow and the faith to know

Then I will be
Strong on my own
I will see through the rain
I will find my way
I will keep on
Traveling this road
'Till I finally reach my dream
'Till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny
