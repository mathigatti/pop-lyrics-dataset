Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear


You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, "Juliet, baby, you're my flame"

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun's light up the daytime
Moon's light up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
