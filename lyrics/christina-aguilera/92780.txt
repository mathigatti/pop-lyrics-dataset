i dont want half hearted love affairs
i need someone, who really cares
lifes to short, to play silly games
i promised myself, i wont do that again


its got to be perfect
its gotta be worth it
to many people, take second best
but i wont take anything less
its got to be, yeah
perfect

young hearts are foolish
Christinas my name
there much to eager
to give there love away
