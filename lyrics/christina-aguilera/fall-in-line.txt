Little girls, listen closely
'Cause no one told me
But you deserve to know
That in this world
You are not beholden
You do not owe them
Your body and your soul


All the youth in the world
Will not save you from growing older
And all the truth in a girl
Is too precious to be stolen from her

It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
I wasn't made to fall in line
No, I wasn't made to fall in line, no

Show some skin
Make him want you
'Cause God forbid you
Know your own way home
Ask yourself, why it matters?
Who it flatters?
You're more than flesh and bones

All the youth in the world
Will not save you from growing older
And all the truth in a girl
Is too precious to be stolen from her

It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
I wasn't made to fall in line, no!
No, I wasn't made to fall in line
No, we weren't made to fall in line

Yeah, two, three
Right, two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March, two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?

Yeah, two, three
Right, two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March, two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?

It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this (I'm gonna pay for this)
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
'Cause I wasn't made to fall in line
(I got a fire in my veins)
(I am never gonna fall in line, oh)

One, two, three
Right, two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March, two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?

Yeah, two, three
Right, two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March, two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?
