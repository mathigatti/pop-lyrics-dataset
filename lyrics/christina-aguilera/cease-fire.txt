Inglorius soldier I stand 'til the end
A golden revolver I hold in my hand
The trigger that I never squeeze
The war that brings me to my knees
I'm tired of fighting for peace
When I am alone on the front line
I need you to stand next to me


Baby, cease fire, fire, fire
Throw down your weapons, your weapons, your weapons (throw down your weapons)
I'm on your side, on your side, on your side (I'm on your side)
So please cease fire, fire, fire
Cease fire, make it stop

Drop down your defences, I'm raising my flag
This fighting is hopeless, we need this to end
It's going too far, don't now where it began
We're hurting each other and I can't pretend
I'm trying to help you to see
The casualties that we both leave
It's all so unnecessary
Can't you hear me scream

Baby, cease fire, fire, fire (baby, cease fire)
Throw down your weapons, your weapons, your weapons (throw down your weapons)
I'm on your side, on your side, on your side (I'm on your side)
So please cease fire, fire, fire
Cease fire, make it stop

Calling out, white flag, I surrender
Hear me now, make it stop, we can do better
Pain and hurt, living in fear, wasted energy
In the end, what is it worth, what is our legacy
Calling out, white flag, I surrender
Hear me now, make it stop, we can do better
Pain and hurt, living in fear, wasted energy
In the end, what is it worth, what is our legacy

Follow me now, I'm calling out, somebody help me
I need you now, why can't you see, gotta believe me
Fighting for peace, need a release, won't you come with me
I'm on your side, swallow your pride, you can confide in me
Army of one, rise with the sun, shining for all to see
Enemies none, victories won, no negativity
We can be free, we have the key to own our destiny, yeah

Baby, cease fire, fire, fire
Throw down your weapons, your weapons, your weapons (throw down your weapons)
I'm on your side, on your side, on your side (side)
So please cease fire, fire, fire (fire)
Cease fire, make it stop
