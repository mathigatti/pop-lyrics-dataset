Christina, ya dun know nobody can test, you're da best
You know what I mean?
Ya man, let dem know dat


On a glass table, love me somethin' unstable
Kiss my lips until I can't resist, 'til I'm incapable of comin' down
(Comin' down, comin' down)
Of comin' down (come on, come on)
On a wood staircase, love me 'til I can't think straight
One on one and one by one, we come undone
So I just keep on goin' down (just go down)
Just keep on goin' down, yeah

Chills are running up my spine 'cause you got me to feel
All the thoughts I made up in my head, you've made 'em real
With the

Right moves
Right moves
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got the
Right moves

On the cold concrete, I'm warmin' up your body
Bangin' in my chest
I must confess, it ain't the only thing that's pounding, now
(Pound it out, pound me out)
Come on and pound it out, yeah

Chills are running up my spine 'cause you got me to feel
All the thoughts I made up in my head, you've made 'em real
With the

Right moves (got the right, ri-ri-ri-right moves)

Right moves

And you a trendsetter
Can't do without ya
Like an address to a letter
And the way ya do your ting
No one can do it better
Your lovin' sweeter than a melody
Me have the bass, you when you movin'
I know you swirlin' like a tsunami
When you explore me light the iPhone up
Polly Nikki ex, but my call is Safaree
Body built stronger and sexier than a million man in the US army
You got the moves
Straight up, representin' to every true lovey

Sumtime I love the way you touch me and the way how you move
The way you roll onto my body like a fire pon true
I win, dem mih nuh who da yeah proof
And gyal I'll fight over your body
Extra, extra, news

Right moves, you haffi make me lick up body sweat
Winter in my Kuma, proppa lobe you wah go get
The way you move, the way I make my body sweat
Dissa body never feel it

They say your lovin' make me feel right
Any-anytime I book you after midnight
No nutalli nuh di never follow
Show me so you wicked in the real life
