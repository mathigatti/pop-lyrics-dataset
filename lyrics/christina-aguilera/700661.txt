When im out on the road
Goin from show to show
Told my homie romeo how much i miss u so
I dont know how much longer it will be
Im missin you wantin you *ha* an i really wanna talk to you
*oh no* i left my 2-way at home still sittin on the charger
*oh no* my battery dead on my my cell phone n i really wanna call ya
J-boog lemme use your phone, gotta call my baby-girl back home
Let her know what she means to me cause weve gotta be
Chorus
Cause your my angel, your my heart girl
Cause your my evey thing, your everything i want in a woman
Your everything i need in a woman
Repeat
Verse:
I got you on the phone, you sayin you wish i was home, but then you flip
The script, to put me in the wrong,and you think im lyin when ive been
Tryin all day to talk to you, jugglin videos and photo shoots,
Baby girl dont think that one mintue goes by and i dont really wanna call
Ya, dont think that im screenin my calls or checkin my caller i.d tryna
Dodge you girl
Tryna be all i can be, a young man in this industry,you mean the world to me
You are my everything my,

Chorus

Girl i want u to know that nothing will come between you and me
Girl i want you to know that you'll always be, my everything

*rap*
Baby-girl im missin you cant wait to get home so i can hold you
Plain as love when it comes to you, faithful and true is what i stay to you
You my homie wanna chill wit you throw on some sweats wit some nike
Shoes, all get sa-ditty for me, blue-y skirt wit a mini tee,
See times been hard for me, bein on the road wit out my wifey
Lookin at my watch as time goes by, lookin at the sky as the day goes by
Wishin on these days you could fly, till the next time
