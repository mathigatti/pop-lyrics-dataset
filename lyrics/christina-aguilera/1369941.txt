Dancing 'til the morning on a velvet sky
Racing to the top with golden rays of light
I never felt so free neither so dangerous
The night was electronic painted red with lust
I move, you shake, we magnetize
A time I was exploding with no warning side?


(Chorus)
Dynamite, electrify me all night
Dynamite, just give it to me, I won't fight
Dynamite, you make me feel, it's alright
Dynamite, shine it on me

Caught up in this moment I was hypnotized
I couldn't thake this feeling, got me paralyzed
I do, I don't, think I might
My body was electric like a flash of light

Dynamite, electrify me all night
Dynamite, just give it to me, I won't fight
Dynamite, you make me feel, it's alright
Dynamite, shine it on me

A change, a change is coming
A change, a change is coming

All around me but a change is 'bout to happen
The energy has become my inspiration
If you'd take a deeper look you'll find the information
I'm only just a fragment of controlled imagination

Dynamite, electrify me all night
Dynamite, just give it to me, I won't fight
Dynamite, you make me feel, it's alright
Dynamite, shine it on me(starlight)

(O-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh) electrify me
(O-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh) I won't fight
(O-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh) just give it to me
(O-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh o-uh o-uh)

Dancing 'til the morning on a velvet sky
Dancing 'til the morning on a velvet sky
Dancing 'til the morning on a velvet sky
Velvet sky
