Have I been blind?
For the first time in my life, I feel I've opened up my eyes
Since you've arrived
Like an angel from the sky, I'm on a spiritual high


So don't you ever go away
I could never face
Losing you would kill my faith
In a higher place

What kind of world
Would it be without you?
I couldn't breathe without you here
What kind of world
Would I see without you?
I can't dream without you here

Beautiful boy
How on earth did I do something worth deserving you?
My better half
How I cherish through and through every part of you
I do

Loving you's made me whole, now I belong
I found my home
Promise me, we'll always stay
The way we are today

What kind of world
Would it be without you?
I couldn't breathe without you here
What kind of world
Would I see without you?
I can't dream without you here

I can't ever imagine
If this never would happened, would happened, would happened
I thank God everyday
Almost lost you forever
But I always remember, remember, remember
That you're my saving grace

What kind of world
Would it be without you?
I couldn't breathe without you here
What kind of world
Would I see without you?
I can't dream without you here
