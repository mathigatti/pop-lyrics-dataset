I Come Undone
Written by Rob Hoffman, Heather Holley, Anthony Mazza 


Ohh, ooh, ooh oh yeah

Used to be calm
Used to be cool
But something about you
Changed all the rules
I kept to myself
I guarded my heart
But that all fell apart

Now just like a fool
I've fallen in love with you, oh
I got these crazy feelings
All over you, oh

I come undone
I come undone
Every time I'm close to you
I come undone
I come undone
Can't help myself from falling in love

Kiss me again
Ooh, there I go
You got my heart racing
Out of control
Got butterflies
And I can't disguise
That I'm feeling so much

You intoxicate
You fascinate
You know you make me crazy
What can I say, oh yeah

I come undone (alright)
I come undone
Every time I'm close to you, ooh
I come undone
I come undone
Can't help myself from falling in love, oh

I come undone
I come undone
Any time you walk in the room, ohh
I come undone
I come undone
I can't help, I can't stop
I can't shake this crazy love

Do ya, do ya, do ya know
What you to do me
Do ya, do ya
What you do to me

Something behind your smile
Something inside your eyes
Makes me feel (makes me feel)
Love...ohh...

I come undone
I come undone
Ooh, every time I'm close to you, oh
I come undone (oh no, ohh)
I come undone
Can't help myself from falling in love, oh oh

I come undone (when you walk in the room)
I come undone (I come undone)
Any time you walk in the room, oh baby, baby now
I come undone (ooh yeah, yeah)
I come undone
I can't help, I can't stop
Can't shake this crazy thing

I come undone (oh oh, oh oh, ohh)
(Baby now, baby now, baby baby now)
I come undone
Every time I'm close to you, ohh
I come undone (alright)
I come undone (can't help myself, can't help myself)
I'm coming undone, when you're in the room
