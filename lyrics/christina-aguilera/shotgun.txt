When did you know your heart was mine?
You've told the tale so many times
There's nothing better we've got to do
With all these miles to get to where we're going to


It's a hard road honey and there ain't nobody
I'd rather be next to
It's a rough ride baby but we're gonna make it
Together, me and you
When you're tired I'll grab the wheel
And you take over when I'm done
Love is taking turns, riding shotgun

When did you know? Tell me again
My heart was yours when you walked in
You made a vow to hold it dear
And you kept your promise to me all these years

It's a hard road honey and there ain't nobody
I'd rather be next to
It's a rough ride baby but we're gonna make it
Together, me and you
When you're tired I'll grab the wheel
And you take over when I'm done
Love is taking turns, riding shotgun

Ooh, yeah
Oh yeah

It's you and me against the world
You are my man and I'm your girl
And when we're old I'll take your hand
And ask you then: when did you know?
Tell me again
