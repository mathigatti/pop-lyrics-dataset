I wanna tell you my secret
With just the sound of my breathing
I wanna know your heart’s beating
I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you


Like that
Yeah, it feels so good that I can't hold back
Like that
Hit the right spot
Make my eyes roll back

Let there be, let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna fight anymore
‘Cause I want your touch

Let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna fight anymore
‘Cause I want your touch

Want you tell me you need it
I wanna hear it repeated
Want you to take me completely
Want you to tell me
Want you to tell me

Like that
Yeah, it feels so good that I can't hold back
Said like that
Hit the right spot
Make my eyes roll back

Let there be, let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna fight anymore
‘Cause I want your touch

Let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna fight anymore
‘Cause I want your touch

Let there be, let there be love
Let there be, let there be love
Let there be, let there be love
Let there be, let there be love

Let there be, let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna fight anymore
‘Cause I want your touch

Let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna fight anymore
‘Cause I want your touch
