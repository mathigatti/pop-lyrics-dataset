She was so young with such innocent eyes
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
And all the things that your money can't buy
She thought that he was a wonderful guy
Then suddenly things seemed to change
It was the moment she took on his name
He took his anger out on her face
And she kept all of her pain locked away


Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again
So mother, I thank you (thank you)
For all that you've done and still do (still do)
You got me, I got you
Together we always pull through
We always pull through, always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

It was the day that he turned on the kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Sayin' over and over and over
You deserve much more than this

She was so sick of believin' the lies
And tryin' to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life
She could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed)
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again (he'll never hurt us again)
So mother, I thank you (thank you)
For all that you've done and still do (still do)
You got me, I got you (said you got me and I got you)
Together we always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

All of your life you have spent
Burying hurt and regret
But mama
He'll never touch us again
For everytime he tried to break you down
Just remember who's still around
It's over
And we're stronger
And we'll never have to go back again

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back (oh mother, don't look back again)
'Cause he'll never hurt us again
So mother, I thank you (and thank you for all that you've done)
For all that you've done and still do (together we always move on)
You got me, I got you
Together we always pull through
We always pull through, yeah
We always pull through, yeah
I love you, mom
