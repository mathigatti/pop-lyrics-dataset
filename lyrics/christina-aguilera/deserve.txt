Sometimes I don't think I deserve you
So I say some fucked up shit just to hurt you
But you know I do it all 'cause I love you
So, baby, tell me I'm the one that deserves you
Do I, do I, yeah, ooh
Do we, do I, yeah, ooh
Do I?


Breakfast in the mornin', laughing over pancakes
Smell the coffee burnin', forget all of the mistakes that we made
On a Tuesday when you mentioned that she called you?
Now, why you gotta go and do that?
It wasn't necessary, you run your mouth when it's unnecessary
Maybe I'm too sensitive and I find the truth scary

But we know what we have together is real special
Now why you wanna go and lose that, boy?
Can we pause for a moment before this commotion takes over?
I'm sorry, let's fix this, sometimes we can't kick the habit of being dramatic
It's almost becoming a sickness

Sometimes I don't think I deserve you
So I say some fucked up shit just to hurt you
But you know I do it all 'cause I love you
So, baby, tell me I'm the one that deserves you
Do I, do I, yeah, ooh
Do we, do I, yeah, ooh
Do I?

Put me on the jury, I will take the blame here
Tell the judge I'm guilty of instilling you with fear, by tellin' you I'm leaving
When you know that I don't mean it
Now, why I gotta go and say that?
It's only temporary, whenever we fight it's only temporary
It's passive-agressive when you say that you don't need me

But you know what we got together is real special
Now why you wanna go and lose that, boy?
Let's pause for a moment before this commotion takes over
I'm sorry, let's fix this, sometimes we can't kick the habit of being dramatic
It's almost becoming a sickness

Sometimes I don't think I deserve you
So I say some fucked up shit just to hurt you
But you know I do it all 'cause I love you
So, baby, tell me I'm the one that deserves you
Do I, do I, yeah, ooh
Do I, do I, yeah, ooh
Do I, do I, yeah, ooh
Do we, do I, yeah, ooh
Do I?
