I came into this fame wit' u by my side
I'll be leavin wit' u at the other end
Peace out


Thankyou for - the love you gave me
And i'll be thankin' you again at the end of the line, whoa,
I said please- stay, at the very start,
Now i say sorry, for all the time we're apart
I am trying, trying to help you get there everyday.

I thought that i was failin'
I'd lost all of my faith
But you told me keep tryin'
N' i tried harder everyday

And now
I'm
Here

Doesn't seem so real.. when you remember..
All the screaming and the fighting,
And the pain in my heart,
When you told me keep tryin' i took a fresh start

And look where
I am
Today.

I thank you
