Im so confused
Maybe its because ti amo
I wrote this whole thing
Just because ti amo
I sit alone and
Im playing the piano
I feel so strange
Its just because ti amo!!!


I think i wont make it through
Youre always on my mind
Please tell me you love me too
Or else im gonna die
Here is what you mean to me!
You are an angel god sent to me
And i just want you here with me
Holding you all the time!

When things go wrong
Everything seems nice to me
I dont know why
But i think its cause ti amo
I cant live without you
And i dont want to try
The reasons obvious
It is because ti amo!

You mean the whole world to me
You are my everything!
You make me fly without wings
Its just the way i feel!
What else could i ever ask?
You are the dream of a lifetime
And i want you beside me
Till the world stops to turn!

I cant describe
The way i feel inside
I dont know why
Maybe because ti amo
All my friends wonder
How i can be so lucky
To have you in my life
The answers cause ti amo!
