Come here, big boy

I'm gonna take my time so enjoy
There's no need to feel no shame
Relax and sip upon my champagne
Cos I wanna give you a little taste
Of the sugar below my waist
You nasty boy


I'll give you some ooh la la
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
I got you breakin' into a sweat
Got you hot, bothered and wet
You nasty boy
Nasty naughty boy

Baby for all it's worth
I swear I'll be the first
To blow

I'll give you that hot, sweet, sexy lovin'

Hush now don't say a word
I'm gonna give you what you deserve
Now you better gimme a little taste
Put your icing on my cake
You nasty boy

Got you hot, bothered and wet
You nasty boy
Nasty naughty boy

Baby for all it's worth
