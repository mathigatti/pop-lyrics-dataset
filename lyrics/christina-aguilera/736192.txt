Seems like it was yesterday
When I saw your face
You told me how proud you were
But I walked away
If only I knew
What I know today


I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won't be there

I'm sorry for
Blaming you
For everything
I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
By hurting you

Some days I feel broke inside
But I wouldn't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide
'Cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye
When comes to this

Would you tell me I was wrong
Would you help me understand
Are you looking down upon me
Are you proud of who I am
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes
And see you are looking back

I'm sorry for
Blaming you
For everything
I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself

If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away
It's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time

I'm sorry for
Blaming you
For everything
I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
By hurting you
