May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please shut up!
I repeat...
Will the real Slim Shady please shut up!
We're gonna have a problem here
Ya'll act like you've never heard a white person before
His rhymes are a bore
Punk kid, trying to be hardcore (yeah, whassup!).
Marshal Mathers is back worse than before
Making a snore, whining in the microphone
It's the return of the...Oh wait, no way!
You're a fool
You didn't pay money for this cd, did you?
And Dr. Dre did, everything you idiot
Without Dre's beep edits, you're as good as dead
The world's had enough of Eminem
Even his girlfriend's cheating on him
Look at him, walking around
Living off Dre, acting so cool
But he's really kind of weak though
Little twit blast me on his new cd
Why?
'Cuz i turned him down for a date
Hee hee!
As for the question of who came first
Was it Carson Daly or was it Fred Durst?
I'm sorry Slim but, this is gonna hurt
They both came closer than you ever will, jerk!
Your song gets on my nerves!
Your song gets on my nerves!
You're kinda lucky 'cuz you got more fame than you deserve
That is the message that I deliver to little kids
You can become famous and never know what talent is!
Of course they're gonna like you! Of course they do!
You're like a cartoon version of Ricky Schroeder on Silver Spoons
You ain't nothing but a product packed to be bought up,
Ya know, a year from now,
You won't be thought of.
So you write about dead animals and cannibals
And some day you'll stop dating dogs and date higher mammals!
And there's a million women just like me
That think like me
That all can see that Slim Shady is
Just a boy dealing with puberty
So if you agree, scream loudly with me!
You're Slim Shady, yes you're the real shady
You sound like Peter Brady
You get quite irritating
So won't the real Slim Shady please shut up
Please shut up
Please shut up!
