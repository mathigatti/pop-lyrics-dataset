Over the river 
And through the woods 
To Grandmother's house 
We go 
The horse knows the way 
To carry the sleigh 
Through white 
And drifted snow 


Over the river 
And through the woods 
Oh 
How the wind does blow 
It stings the toes 
And bites the nose 
As over the ground we go 

Over the river 
And through the woods 
To have a full day of play 
Oh, hear the bells 
Ringing ting-a-ling-ling 
For it is Christmas Day 

Over the river 
And through the woods 
Trot fast my dapple gray 
Spring o'er the ground 
Just like a hound 
For this is Christmas Day 

Over the river 
And through the woods 
And straight through 
The barnyard gate 
It seems that we go 
So dreadfully slow 
It is so hard to wait 

Over the river 
And through the woods 
Now Grandma's cap I spy 
Hurrah for fun 
The pudding's done 
Hurrah for the pumpkin pie
