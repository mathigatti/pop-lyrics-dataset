(Alright)

I can see ya from afar
Taking notice who you are
I know that you can see me too
But if you plan to make your move you better make it soon


Baby, baby
What's your hesitation?
Pretty soon you're gonna lose my attention
I don't know what's going on in your mind
But you're running out of time

Running out of time
Oh, you're running out of time
You're running out time
Oh, you're running, running out of time

(Something like that?)

Back to beginning
