When I'm lost in the rain
In your eyes I know I'll find
The light to light my way
When I'm scared, losing ground
When my world is going crazy
You can turn it all around, yes


And when I'm down, you're there, pushing me to the top
You're always there giving me all you've got

For a shield, from the storm
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm
I turn to you
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
I turn to you

When I lose the will to win
I just reach for you and
I can reach the sky again
I can do anything
'Cause your love is so amazing
'Cause your love inspires me

And when I need a friend, you're always on my side
Giving me faith, taking me through the night

For a shield from the storm
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm
I turn to you
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
I turn to you

For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain
For truth that will never change, for someone to lean on
For a heart I can rely on through anything
For the one who I can run to, I turn to you

For a shield from the storm
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm
I turn to you
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true

For everything you do
For everything that's true
I turn to you
