Ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me
It ain't no way for me to give you all ya need
If you won't let me give all of me
(Ooooooo) I know that a woman's duty
Is to help and love the man
And that's the way it was for me


(Ooooooo)
Oh but how can I, how can I, how can I, give ya
Give ya all the things I can
If you're tying both of my hands
Whoa ho it ain't no way (ain't no way)
(It ain't no) way-ay-ay (ain't no way)
It just ain't no way babe-bay
(Ain't no way) ain't no way baaabbey
(Ain't no way) It ain't no way-hey-hey
For you me to love you (hoooo)
If you won't let me
Stop tryin' to be someone you're not

(Oooooo)
A hard, cold and crude is a man
Who paid too much for what he got
And if you need me, to love you
Say, say yeah you do
I'll be waiting, please, please
Don't you know that I need you
Oh it ain't no way (oooo-oooo)
I tell ya that it ain't no way
It ain't no way, it ain't no way bab-ay
It just ai-ai-n't no way, it sho ain't no way
It ain't no way-ay-hey-ay for me to love you
If you won't let me (ooooo-woooo)
Ain't no way, if you won't let me
Fades
Baby no way
