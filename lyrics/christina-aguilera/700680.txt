Not hurting anymore
Yo here we go


You left the door wide open
It was getting cold
You never came home last night
And i was upset
Feeling lonley and old
So i wept and cried
You have cheated and lied

(chorus)
All i wanted was to be with you
But you wouldn't have it
You left me alone
And i got used to it
And now i'm not hurting anymore

I screamed and i tried
To get hold of myself
Get a grip girl
Because you need a new life
And all i wanted was you
But you were with your friends
And thats were it ends

Repeat chorus

I'm preparing to run away
I've packed my bags
And i'm ready to go
Then i see you
And i stay

Repeat chorus 2x
