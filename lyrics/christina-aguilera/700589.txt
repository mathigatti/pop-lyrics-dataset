What if i never knew
What if i never found you
I'd never had this feeling
In my heart
How did this come to be
I don't know how you found me
But from the moment i saw you
Deep inside my heart
I knew
Baby, you're my destiny
You and i were meant to be
With all my heart and soul
I give my love to have and hold
And as far as i can see
You were always meant to be
My destiny
I wanted someone like you
Someone that i could hold onto
And give my love
Until the end of time
But forever was just a word
Something i'd only heard about
But now you're always there for me
When you say forever
I'll believe
Baby, you're my destiny
You and i were meant to be
With all my heart and soul
I give my love to have and hold
And as far as i can see
You were always meant to be
My destiny
Maybe all we need
Is just a little faith.
Cause baby, i believe
That love will find a way.
Hey..
Oh baby, you're my destiny
You and i were meant to be
I give my love to have and hold
And as far as i can see
You were always meant to be
My destiny
