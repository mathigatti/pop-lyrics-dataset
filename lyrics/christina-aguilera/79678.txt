Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby


Hey boy don't you know
I've got something going on
I've got an invitation
Don't you keep me waiting all night long
I know you, you know
So baby don't
Pretend you won't
Keeping me guessing off you
You will or you won't
Don't wanna play that game with you baby
So listen to me

All I want is you, come over here baby
All I want is you, you know, you make me go crazy
All I want is you, now baby don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
All I want is you!
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby

I'm not just talking about your sexuality (sexuality)
But I can't help myself when you put your hands on me

Its paradise when you and I
Get close get tight
One on one
Go on all night
I wanna play that game with you baby
So listen to me

All I want is you, come over here baby
All I want is you, you know, you make me go crazy
All I want is you, now baby don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
All I want is you!
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over

Don't you wanna be the one tonight
We can do exactly what you like
Don't you wanna be just you and me
And do it oh so naturally
Got a thing for you
Got my mind made up
And I'm serious
Never been more
Baby im sure
But its real
And its better here you give me
What a girl feels
What a girl likes
What a girl needs
What a girl wants
All I want is you

Now baby don't be shy, you better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
All I want is you
All I want is you, ohh you make me go crazy
All I want is you, now baby don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right cuz
All I want is you!
