Were the bratty angels and we're here to say "listen up" listen up, listen up exc.. (x3)
We see a blonde gurl smiling at her boyfriend
People think shes special but she thinks shes not


We see a hip gurl really likes gymnastix
People think shes skinny but she thinks shes not

~chorus~
But we tell them "listen up"
This is what we've gotta do
When you look in to the mirror take a good look at you
And see someone not just special not just cute
But someone really amazing

I see a cute gurl really into make-up
People think she's pretty but she thinks shes not
I see a tomboy people think shes sporty
But she thinks shes not

~chorus~
