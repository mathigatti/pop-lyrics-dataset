Well, everybody's got an opinion now, don't they?
But it ain't no thing to me
It really don't make any different now to me
If you don't like what you see
I pay no mind to the negative kind
'Cause that's just no way to be
I don't stop to please someone else's needs
Gonna live my life for me


I'm gonna keep on, I'mma do own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing
And no matter what people say or might think
I ain't going no place, no
I'm here to stay

Gonna keep on doing my thing
'Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
'Cause I ain't going no place, no
I'm here to stay

I've never been the type to be shy
I know that some would say I'm too headstrong
But I'd rather be a woman who voices her mind
Whether you think I'm right or wrong
And I know some people wanna criticize
Makes 'em feel better about themselves
So say what you will, time will reavel
In the end that I will be here still

I'm gonna keep on, I'mma do own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing
And no matter what people say or might think
I ain't going no place, no
I'm here to stay

Gonna keep on doing my thing
'Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
'Cause I ain't going no place, no
I'm here to stay

Gotta get up, keep my head up
Gonna keep turnin' it up, never let up
If I keep stepin' it up, I'mma prove that
I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not

Gotta get up, keep my head up
Gonna keep turnin' it up, never let up
If I keep stepin' it up, I'mma prove that
I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not

No matter the pressures that face me
I believe, I believe they will see
I'll never let anyone break me
All your doubt can do now is strengthen me
And life, it ain't always that easy
Gotta fight to see past the boundaries
Crossin' the line, I will define every time
That forever is mine

I'm gonna keep on, I'mma do own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing
And no matter what people say or might think
I ain't going no place, no
I'm here to stay

Gonna keep on doing my thing
'Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
'Cause I ain't going no place, no
I'm here to stay

I'm gonna keep on, I'mma do own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing
And no matter what people say or might think
I ain't going no place, no
I'm here to stay

Gonna keep on doing my thing
'Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
'Cause I ain't going no place, no
I'm here to stay
