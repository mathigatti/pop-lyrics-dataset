I woke up this morning with a smile on my face
And nobody's gonna bring me down today
Been feeling like nothing's been going my way lately
But I decided right here, right now, that my outlook's gonna change
That's why I'm gonna
Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried everytime somebody hurt my pride
Feelin' like they won't let me live life, and take the time to look at what is mine


I see every blessing so clearly, and I thank God for what I got from above

I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can say all they wanna say about me, but I'm
I'm gonna carry on (carry on)
I'mma keep on (keep on) singin' my song

I never wanna dwell on the pain again, there's no use in relivin' how I hurt back then
Rememberin' too well the hell I felt when I was runnin' out of faith
Every step I'm 'bout to take well it's towards a better day
Cause I'm about to
Say farewell to every single lie and all the fears I've held too long inside
Everytime I felt I couldn't try, all the negativity and strife

Cause too long, I've been strugglin', couldn't go on
But now I've found I'm feelin' strong and I'm moving on

I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can say all they wanna say about me, but I'm
I'm gonna carry on (carry on)
I'mma keep on (keep on) singin' my song

Everytime I tried to be what they wanted from me
It never came naturally, so I ended up in misery
Was unable to see all the good around me, wasting so much energy on
What they thought of me than simply just rememberin' to breathe, I've learned
I'm humanly unable to please everyone at the same time
So now I find my peace of mind living one day at a time

In the end I answer to one God, comes down to one love till I get to heaven above
I have made the decision never to give in till the day I die no matter what
I'm gonna carry on, I'mma keep on singin' my song

I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can do what they wanna, say what they wanna say, oh (they can say what they wanna)
But I'm gonna (gonna) keep on (keep on)

I believe that they can take from me
But they can't take my inner peace
Say what they wanna say (wanna say)
I'm gonna sing my song
