I feel like I’ve been locked up tight
A century of lonely nights
Waiting, waiting for someone
You’re licking your lips and blowing kisses my way
That don’t mean I’m gonna give it away
Baby, oh baby


If you wanna be with me
Baby there’s a price to pay
I’m a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

The music’s playing and the light’s down low
Just one more dance and then we’re good to go
Waiting, waiting for someone
My hormones racing at the speed of light
That don’t mean its gotta be tonight
Baby, ooh baby

If you wanna be with me
Baby there’s a price to pay
I’m a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
Gotta make a big impression
Gotta like what you do

Gotta like what you do
Gotta like what you do
I’m a genie in a bottle baby
I’m a genie in a bottle baby

Come on, come on, and let me out
Come on, come on, and let me out
Come on, come on, and let me out
Come on, come on, and let me out

If you wanna be with me
Baby there’s a price to pay
I’m a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
Gotta make a big impression
Gotta like what you do

I’m a genie in a bottle baby
I’m a genie in a bottle baby

Come on, come on, and let me out
Come on, come on, and let me out (my heart is saying no)
Come on, come on, and let me out (my heart is saying no)
Come on, come on, and let me out (my heart is saying no)
Come on, come on, and let me out (my body’s saying let’s go)
Come on, come on, and let me out
