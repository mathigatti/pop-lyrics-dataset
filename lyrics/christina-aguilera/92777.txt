Over the phone, love to hear
All of the things you say to me, mmm
I just can't wait, to hear your voice
Whispering sweetly to me baby
All I may want I know you got
Ready for me to receive, oh
Making me know that you're there for me
Feels so, good inside


I like, the way
You talk to me
I like, the way
You talk to me

Making me feel, safe from harm
With your soft and silky tone, mmm
Can't help but show, how good, yes I know
That you got it going on
And never has come, or been a day
You misled me the wrong way, oh no
Knowing that you're just a, just a
A phone, call away, oh

I like, the way
You talk to me
I like, the way
You talk to me
I like, the way
You talk to me
I like, the way
You talk to me
I like, the way
You talk to me
I like, the way
You talk to me

Is that all?
Okay
