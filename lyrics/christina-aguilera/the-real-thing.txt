Baby I'm coming, better ready yourself
Be looking for me 'cause I'm the real thing


Listen

Well, tell them to step aside

'Cause you put a spell on me
And I can't help but find you
Oh, let me remind you

Baby I'm coming better ready yourself
Be looking for me 'cause I'm the real thing
And I'm coming
Baby I'm coming, better ready yourself
Be looking for me 'cause I'm the real thing

Slow and sweet
That's how I sneak up on you
And when the smoke clears
Don't say I didn't warn you
(Oh) Need I inform you?

Baby I'm coming better ready yourself
Be looking for me 'cause I'm the real thing
(Oh) and I'mma coming
Baby I'm coming, better ready yourself
Be looking for me 'cause I'm the real thing

And I'm coming
If I want you
I'm gonna get you
Ain't no question
Since I met you
If I want you
(If I want you)
I'm gonna get you
(I'm gonna get you)
Ain't no question
(Ain't no question)

Baby since I met you ooh ooh ooh
If I want you

Ain't no question
Baby since I met you
