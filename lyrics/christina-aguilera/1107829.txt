Compassion is the last thing felt for someone who's rich 
Automatically labeled as a whiny, spoiled little bitch 
Sometimes the truth is something some don't wanna ever swallow 
So instead they'd rather start a rumor mill and hope that others follow 
Not to complain, but I just feel like I can't get any clearance here 
They still expect you to smile through tears at this and that little appearance there 
Forgive me for crying, can't keep lying, 'cause I'm slowly dying from the pain I feel 
Calling for help, to them would equal to a publicity stunt even though it's so real

Extra extra, read all about it 
When they believe it's the truth 
Don't matter if you doubt it 
They want to read all about it 
Extra extra, they scream and shout it 
Extra extra, all in the headlines 
When they believe it's the truth 
Can't convince them otherwise 
They want to read all about it 
Extra extra, they scream and shout it 

I'm breathing and I'm thankful to God everyday that I still 
stand tall 
And I do my best not to stress, turn to drugs or soak in alcohol 
Nobody's perfect and I know this, trust me, I deal with the 
cant's and can's 
I just put my faith into my savior and know that I've got my supportive fans 
Not to complain, but I just feel like I can't get any clearance here

Forgive me for crying, can't keep lying, 'cause I'm slowly dying from the pain I feel

(They say) Look at her, she's so Dirrty, why won't she stop it, 
she's trying to be something she's not 
(They say) Oh My Gosh, no she didn't, she must be crazy, 
thinking she's all that when she's not so hot 
(I say) Baby, please don't misunderstand, I do what I do 
whenever I want, however I want to 
(I wish) They didn't try to understand at all, take me as I am 
or ignore, let me do what I came to do
