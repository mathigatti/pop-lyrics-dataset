When I try to describe
How I feel when you hold me
I get butterflies
I hear lullabies
It´s hard to explain


Like the scent of a rose
Or the sound of the rain
Is too precious and too wonderful
To give it a name

Too beautiful for words
A symphony inside me
Too beautiful for words
I can not take them lightly
Can you hear my silent heart

It´s on the tip of my tongue
But my lips are still sealed
Only violins
And then innocence
Can show you how I feel

And I hear them again
At the end of the day
I´m all teary eyed
When we kissed goodbye
There´s nothing I can say

Too beautiful for words
A symphony inside me
Too beautiful for words, oh
I can not take them lightly
Can you hear my silent heart

Must be a million times
I tried to express this love of mine
When it goes this deep
When it tastes this sweet
It´s not easy to define, ohh

Too beautiful for words (too beautiful)
A symphony inside me (a symphony inside of me)
Too beautiful for words (for words)
I can not take them lightly

Too beautiful for words (too beautiful ohh)
A symphony inside me (a symphony, oh)
Too beautiful for words (ohh, too beautiful baby)
I can not take them lightly
Can you hear my silent heart

Ohh yeah, yeah, oooh...
