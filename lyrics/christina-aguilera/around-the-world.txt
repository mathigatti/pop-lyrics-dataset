Tonight I'm gonna get so wild, exotic, yeah
Baby, let's explore
Imagine all the things we could do in one night, yeah
Everything and more
So tell me, tell me where you really want to go
And give me, give me what I'm asking for
From city, city, international love
Take me all around your globe

Hollywood to Japan, Tokyo to Milan
Baby, just for tonight we're making love worldwide
Brazil to Ibiza, babe, I just wanna please ya
Baby, just for tonight we're making love

All around, around, around it
All around, around, around it
All around, around the world
We're making love
All around, around, around it
All around, around, around it
All around, around the world
We're making love

We can talk dirty in a different language
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir
Or we can get erotic on a distant voyage
Rendezvous with me in my boudoir
Baby, sit back and enjoy the ride
I'mma take you places you ain't been tonight
From city, city, international love
Take me all around your globe

Hollywood to Japan, Tokyo to Milan
Baby, just for tonight we're making love worldwide
Brazil to Ibiza, babe, I just wanna please ya
Baby, just for tonight we're making love

All around, around, around it
All around, around, around it
All around, around the world
We're making love
All around, around, around it
All around, around, around it
All around, around the world
We're making love

Let me show you love, baby, let's go
Puerto Rico, over to Congo
Or we can take it down to the islands
Or the highlands, you already know
It's whatever, baby, when it's me and you
It's whenever, baby, just a ticket for two
Freak around the globe from day 'til night
You know how we do making love worldwide

Hollywood to Japan, Tokyo to Milan
Baby, just for tonight we're making love worldwide
Brazil to Ibiza, babe, I just wanna please ya
Baby, just for tonight we're making love

All around, around, around it
All around, around, around it
All around, around the world
We're making love
All around, around, around it
All around, around, around it
All around, around the world
We're making love

We're making, we're making, we're making love
We're, we're, we're making, we're making love
