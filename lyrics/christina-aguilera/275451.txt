I know
That when you look at me
There's so much
That you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find

Oh a girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me
I feel so all alone

I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me
Will you stay or will you run away

Each day
Each day I play the role of someone
Always in control
But at night
I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there
No one cares for me

Oh what's the sense of trying hard
To find your dreams
Without someone to share it with
Tell me what does it mean

I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me
Will you stay or will you run away

I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears
No
If you only knew
How much I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I run to you
But if I come to you

Tell me will you stay
Or will you run away
