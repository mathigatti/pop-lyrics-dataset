Me and you, we're different
Don't always see eye to eye
You go left and I go right
And sometimes we even fight
That don't mean that I won't need a friend, oh
You and me, we're in this 'till the end, oh


I think we're on our way
Through all the lows and highs
Need you by my side, singin'
I think we're on our way
To better days, better days, oh
Let's say we turn the page
Move on from all the times
Should've laughed not cried, feelin'
What is there more to say?
I think that we're on our way

Together we'll weather
Many storms as family
That bond is forever
Bigger than most anything
The love I feel for you grows everyday
The more we get to learn from our mistakes

I think we're on our way
Through all the lows and highs
Need you by my side, singin'
I think we're on our way
To better days, better days, oh
Let's say we turn the page
Move on from all the times
Should've laughed not cried, feelin'
What is there more to say?
I think that we're on our way

Someday soon I'll need advice
Hope you're there to shed some light
And maybe one day you'll be wanting mine
And we can, we can be there be for each other

I think we're on our way
I think we're on our way
I think we're on our way, yeah
Let's say we turn the page
Move on from all the times
We should've laughed not cried
What is there more to say?
I think that we're on our way

I think we're on our way
Through all the highs and lows
I need you by my side, yeah
I think we're on our way
To better days, better days, oh
Let's say we turn the page
Move on from all the times
Should've laughed not cried
What is there more to say?
I think that we are on our way

No more to say
No more to say
No more to say
