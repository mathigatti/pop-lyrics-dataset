Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Won't you spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Won't you, round and round, sit on my middle finger
Motherfucker, round and round, sit on my middle finger


So you run around, run around talkin' shit-a, shit-a
Keep my name up out your mouth, spit it out you bitch-a, bitch-a
Wish that you could hang around me and my clique-a, clique-a
Lime light, prime life, hope you get the picture, picture

Hold up, I got mo', mo' money than I can fold up
Hey, I see you super hatin' when I roll up
And I suggest you go and grow the fuck up
Or you can spin around in circles

Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger

I see you run around, run around like you it-a, it-a
Why you always tryin' to be up in my mixture, mixture
'Cause I'm freaky, fly, fresh and you just bitter, bitter
Shine bright, day and night, look at how I glitter, glitter

Hold up, I got mo', mo' money than I can fold up
I see you super hatin' when I roll up
And I suggest you go and grow the fuck up
Or you can spin around in circles

Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger

You use my name as your claim to fame
Got my smell of success on your breath, desperate, you're a mess
Go ahead get your press
You, no name, you're shameless
Figure-eight on my middle, try to break me but you can just

Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Won't you spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Won't you spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger
Spin around in circles on my middle, middle finger

Round and round, round and round, round and round
Motherfucker round, round and round, round and round
Motherfucker
