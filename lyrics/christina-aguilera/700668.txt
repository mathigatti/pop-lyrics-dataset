Look in my eyes
What do you see
Only me
Got nothing to hide
Seek and you'll find
Whats on my mind
This happened so fast
Not a part of my plan
So i'm leaving my heart in your hands
Haven't told you just how much i love you
Only by dreaming
I show my feelings
Haven't told you just how much i love you
Time for revealing
And i will give you something too
A love from me to you
Look in my eyes
You know me so well
Can't you tell
(that i'm) way into deep
I'm going down
So catch me now
It happened so fast
Not a part of my plan
So i'm leaving my heart in your hands
Haven't told you just how much i love you
Only by dreaming
I show my feelings
Haven't told you just how much i love you
Time for revealing
And i will give you something too
A love from me to you
I feel you
Everyday i breathe you
Every single moment from the start
I see you
Constantly i feel you
You move me so
No letting go
You smile at me
My heart is yours to keep
Haven't told you just how much i love you
Only by dreaming
I show my feelings
Haven't told you just how much i love you
Time for revealing
And i will give you something too
A love from me to you
Have i told you baby
Oooh i love you baby
I show my feelings
And i will give you something too
A love from me to you
