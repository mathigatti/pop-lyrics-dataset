You've got some nerve now, baby, don't you?
I never care about half the shit that comes out of your mouth, no
I wish that I could put a swift chokehold on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This world ain't big enough for you and your ego
So for once why don't you just


Just shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the fuck up
Keep running, running, running and running your mouth
Could you please shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the fuck up

Ha, you think you're something special, don't you
You like the sound of your voice, keep talkin' while I tune out, oh
And if you ever really wonder what I think about you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've got a million ways to show you just where you can go kiss my ass, oh
So for once why don't you just

Just shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the fuck up
Keep running, running, running and running your mouth
Could you please shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the f*ck up

Call me a bitch
Whatever you wish
Don't give a shit
Can you handle it
'Cause I flipped the script
Don't seal my lips
And if you don't like it
You can suck my, uh
You can suck my, uh
You can suck my, uh
1, 2, 3, 4

Just shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the fuck up
Keep running, running, running and running your mouth
Could you please shut up, just shut the fuck up
Shut up, just shut the fuck up
