Don't make me love you till I'm ready
Don't make me give you more than my kisses
I need you to go slow and steady
Don't make me love you till I'm ready, Oh


Why you wanna rush into my life?
Don't you wanna stop and get to know me better?
We got all the time in the world tonight
And if we're meant to be we'll be together
Stay around just slow down
Till we find out if we got what it takes

Don't make me love you till I'm ready
Don't make me give you more than my kisses
I need you to go slow and steady
Don't make me love you till I'm ready

Everything I know about you so far
Makes me believe that you're the one for me
But there's still a lot that's on my mind
And I need time before we go further
Don't you see?
So hold me, hold me
But don't be thinking I don't want you too

Don't make me love you till I'm ready
Don't make me give you more than my kisses
I need you to go slow and steady
Don't make me love you till I'm ready
(2x)

It's been a little bit of mystery
Let's wait till we have a bit of history
Behind ourselves
You don't got to be in such a rush
We can live for that moment if we trust
We'll be right here tomorrow.

Don't make me love you, love you
Don't make me give you,
I need you to go
Don't make me love you

Don't make me love you till I'm ready
Don't make me give you more than my kisses
I need you to go slow and steady
Don't make me love you till I'm ready
