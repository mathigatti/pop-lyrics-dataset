Look at the stars, I will take one down for you
No matter what the distance, I'll see it through
I'll fill you in between the sun and moon
'Til the end I'll be waiting


And whenever in night, the lights go down
I know that you'll go on to shine somehow
And even if you're miles above the clouds
'Til the end, I'll be waiting

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray we'll meet inside my dreams

So long, my little dreamer, I will miss your face
We'll always stay connected through time and space
The journey that we shared but now have to leave
Will live inside of us for eternity, yeah

Little dreamer, little dreamer
Little dreamer, little dreamer

Look through the dark, there's a compass in the sky
If ever you are lonely and question why
Remember that I'm always by your side
'Til the end, I'll be waiting

And even though we sleep light years apart
A galaxy away is not so far
Because we know the future is our star
'Til the end I'll be waiting

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray we'll meet inside my dreams
If I should go before I wake
I pray our souls will join again

So long, my little dreamer, I will miss your face
We'll always stay connected through time and space
And everything we hoped that could never be
Will live inside of us for eternity, yeah

So long, my little dreamer, I will miss your face
We'll always stay connected through time and space
The journey that we shared but now have to leave
Will live inside of us for eternity, yeah

Destiny will be a part of you, babe (will be)
I'll feel you in the atmosphere (I'll feel you)
And nothing will be left to fear (nothing left to fear)

Little dreamer, little dreamer (Ooh, said)
Little dreamer, little dreamer (Ooh oh)
Little dreamer, little dreamer (Ooh, ooh)
Little dreamer, little dreamer (Ooh, ooh)

So long, my little dreamer, I will miss your face
We'll always stay connected through time and space (little dreamer)
And everything we hoped that could never be (so mamma)
Will live inside of us for eternity, yeah (I'll see you there)

So long, my little dreamer, I will miss your face (always, always)
We'll always stay connected through time and space (ooh oh)
The journey that we shared but now have to leave (ooh)
Will live inside of us for eternity, yeah (oh ah)

I will be with you till the end
Mmm, always be waiting 'till the end
