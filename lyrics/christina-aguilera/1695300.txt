Tossing and turning makes my appetite keep growing stronger, all night long
Anticipating morning, lying I can't wait much longer, feels so strong


Our bodies touching, I just can't get enough
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh
Won't let you sleep, I gotta satisfy my needs
I need to love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh

And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside
And even though we made sweet love all night
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right

Might be late for work, but I promise that it's worth it baby
Don't go
So hungry for you, taste me and I'll taste you
There's no stopping what I'll do to get you in the mood

Our bodies touching, I just can't get enough
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh
Won't let you sleep, I want you deep inside of me
So I can love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside
And even though we made sweet love all night
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right

And I can see break of day peaking through the curtains
And I'm so certain, soon I'm gonna feel your honey drip my juices start to flow
Strawberry cream is like a dream, my fantasy is reality
When the morning comes, I know that I will too

And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind
I need sex for breakfast, stay inside (oh, oh, stay inside baby)
And even though we made sweet love all night
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right (it feels so good, inside)

And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind
Sex for breakfast (I need it, I want it), stay inside (when the morning comes)
And even though that we made sweet love all night
Sex for breakfast, feels so right (so hungry for you)

Taste me, and I'll taste you

Sex for breakfast
All done

Sex for breakfast (feels so right)
