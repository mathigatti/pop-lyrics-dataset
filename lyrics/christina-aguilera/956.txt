Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth, ohh yeah
Now long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn


Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine

Our Father, who art in heaven Hallowed be thy Name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom The power, and the glory
For ever and ever Amen

Fall on your knees, oh hear the angels voices
Oh night divine, oh night when
Christ was born Oh night divine, oh night

Ohhh...yeah yeah
Ha ha ha ha
Ohh yeah No ohh, ohh yeah
Ohh ooh, ah oh
Now ooh, ohh ooh
Oh yeah

It was a holy, holy night Ohh, oh ooh, oh ooh
(Oh holy night)
It was a holy night when Jesus Christ was born
(Oh holy night)
Holy...yes, Jesus Christ
(Oh holy night)
And the power, and the glory, yeah
(Oh holy night)
When Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ
(Oh holy night)
He was born on this night, on this night
(Oh holy night)
Jesus Christ Forever, and ever, and ever, and ever
(Oh holy night)
