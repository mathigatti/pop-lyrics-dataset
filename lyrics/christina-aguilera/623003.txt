Be hold the way our fine feathered friend 
His virtue doth parade 
Thou knowest not my dim witted friend 
The picture Thou hast made 
Thy vacant brow and Thy tousled hair 
Conceal Thy good intent 
Thou noble upright, truthful, sincere 
And slightly dopey gent 


You're my funny Valentine 
Sweet comic Valentine 
You make me smile with my heart 
Your looks are laughable 
Unphotographable 
Yet you're my favorite work of art 
Is your figure less than Greek 
Is your mouth a little weak 
When you open it to speak 
Are you smart? 
But don't change a hair for me 
Not if you care for me 
Stay little Valentine stay 
Each day is Valentine's day!
