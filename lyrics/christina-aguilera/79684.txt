I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone
To release me
You're licking your lips and blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, baby)


Oh whoa
My body's saying let's go
Oh whoa
But my heart is saying no

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
I gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come and let me out

The music's playing and the lights' down low
One more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone
Who needs me
Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, baby)

Oh whoa
My body's saying let's go
Oh whoa
But my heart is saying no

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come and let me out

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
(If you wanna be with me-me-me)
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come and let me out

Oh whoa
My body's saying let's go
Oh whoa
But my heart is saying no

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
I gotta like what you do

Oh yeah
If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come and let me out
