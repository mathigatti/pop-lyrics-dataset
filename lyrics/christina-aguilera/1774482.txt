Ooh, ooh, ooh

A guy what takes his time, I'll go for any time
I'm a fast movin' gal who likes them slow
Got no use for fancy driving, wanna to see a guy arriving in low
I'd be satisfied, electrified to know a guy what takes his time


A hurry-up affair, I always give the air
Wouldn't give any rushing gent a smile
I would go for any single who would condescend to linger awhile
What a lullaby would be supplied to have a guy who takes his time, ooh

A guy what takes his time, I'd go for any time
A hasty job really spoils a master's touch
I don't like a big commotion, I'm a demon for slow motion or such
Why should I deny that I would die to know a guy who takes his time

There isn't any fun in getting something done
If you're rushed when you have to make the grade
I can spot an amateur, appreciate a connesseur in trade
Who would qualify, no alibi, to be the guy who takes his time

Ooh, oohâ€¦
