He comes from a foreign place, an island far away
Intrigues me with every move 'till I'm breathless, I'm helpless, can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand (takes my hand)
And we dance to the rhythm of the band
I feel his fingertips grip my hips and I slip as we dip into a state of bliss
Mama used to warn me to beware those Latin lovers
She said I gave my heart too soon and that's how I became your mother
I said, ay Mama you seem to forget I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over
But I realized big brown eyes can hypnotize, when he says


I am full blood Boricua, reads the tattoo on his arm
He tells me mami I need ya and my heartbeat pumps so strong
Getting lost in el ritmo he whispers te quiero, te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation, can't help my infatuation
It's pure infatuation

Skin the color of cinnamon, his eyes light up and I melt within (melt within)
Feels so good it must be a sin
I can't stop what I started, I'm giving in (ginving in)
He brings life to my fantasies, sparks a passion inside of me (inside of me)
Finds the words when I cannot speak
In the silence his heartbeat is music to me
Mama used to warn me not to rush love with another (not to rush love)
She said I'm not trying to lecture I just care about my daughter
Ay Mama you seem to forget I never will let a man control my emotions
But when he smiles I feel like a little child, when he says

I am full blood Boricua, reads the tattoo on his arm
He tells me mami I need ya and my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)
Getting lost in el ritmo he whispers te quiero, te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation, can't help my infatuation
It's pure infatuation

Caught between my mama's words and what I feel inside
I'm wanting to explore his world but part of me wants to hide
Should I risk it, can't resist it, this has caught me by surprise
Should I let him take me to Puerto Rico
I can't hold back no more, let's go tonight

Papi hold me, say that you adore me (you adore me)
Never let go, never leave me lonely (leave me lonely)
Papi hold me, say that you adore me
Never let go, never leave me lonely

I am full blood Boricua, reads the tattoo on his arm
He tells me mami I need ya and my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)
Getting lost in el ritmo he whispers te quiero, te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation, can't help my infatuation
I can't help what I'm feeling, I'm infatuated (it's pure infatuation)
Can't help my infatuation
It's pure infatuation
