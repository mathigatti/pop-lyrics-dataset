"emptyness

Empty room
Empty faces
I look around
And i feel blind
Where did you go
And why won't you
Come back to me


Chorus:

I'm stuck here in a place
Without any love
Or comfort
I just can't feel you
But i wanna baby
I can't bear this anymore
Take away this
Emptyness

Clear expressions
Were on your face
The day you left me
In that place
It was as if you didn't care
That i was left all alone
In the cold out there

My visions blurry
And i can't hear a sound
All i have is truth babe
But i want you in my life

Chorus

Why don't you come back to me
Please come and free me
Anything but this
I just can't bear
The emptyness

End"
