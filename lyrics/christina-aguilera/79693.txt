Look at me
You may think you see who I really am
But you'll never know me
Every day, it's as if I play a part
Now I see
If I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I can not fool my heart


Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

I am now in a world where I have to
Hide my heart
And what I believe in
But somehow I will show the world
What's inside my heart
And be loved for who I am

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Must I pretend that I'm someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

There's a heart that must be free to fly
That burns with a need to know the reason why
Why must we all conceal
What we think
How we feel

Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide?
I won't pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
