What do you do
When you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?


I was naive, your love was like candy
Artificially sweet, I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web and I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed and devoured completely

Oh, and it hurts my soul cause I can't let go
All these walls are cavin' in
I can't stop my sufferin'
I hate to show that I've lost control 'cause I
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need
To walk away from, yeah

I need to get away from ya, need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away...

I should have known that I was used for amusement (for amusement)
Couldn't see through the smoke, it was all an illusion
Now I've been lickin' my wounds (lickin' my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper (deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darlin' you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

Oh, I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure and I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take leads to one mistake
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need, oh

I can't mend this torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn?
And everywhere I turn
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need
To walk away from, yeah

I need to get away from ya, need to walk away from ya

Every time I try to grasp for air
I am smothered in despair, it's never over, over, oh
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare
I let out a silent pray, let it be over, over, ooh

Inside I'm screaming, begging pleading no more

Now what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

Ooh, It hurts my soul 'cause I can't let go
All these walls are cavin' in
I can't stop my sufferin'
I hate to show that I lost control 'cause I
Keep going right back to the one thing that I need, oh

I'm about to break
And I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take leads to one mistake
I keep going right back to the one thing that I need, oh

I can't mend this torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn?
And everywhere I turn
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need
To walk away from, yeah

Dying, ooh
I said
Need to get away from ya, need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away
Only thing I need to do
Is walk away from you
Walk away
