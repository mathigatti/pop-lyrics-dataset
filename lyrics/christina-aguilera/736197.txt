Lord have mercy on my soul
For I have walked a sinful road
And I'm down on my knees
Lord have mercy on me please


Jesus
I must confess
That in all my loneliness
I've forsaken and I've sinned
Leavin' fragments of a man so broken
I could tell you what I've done
Or should I tell you where I went wrong

Well the more that I start to play, yeah
My deceitful evil ways
Keep on growin' stronger by the day

Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
For I have walked a sinful road
So I'm gonna get down on my knees
Beg forgiveness to help set me free
Lord have mercy on me please

Mother Mary full of grace
In my weakness I've lost faith
I've been careless and I have been warned
And the devil inside me is torn
God Bless the men that I have scorned

Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
For I have walked a sinful road
So I'm gonna get down on my knees
Beg forgiveness to help set me free
Lord have mercy on me please

So don't let me fool around no more
Send your angels down to guide me through that door
Well I've gone and confessed my regrets
And I pray I'm not held in contempt
I'm so lost and I need you to help me repent

Oh Lord
Have mercy on my soul
Oh, I'm beggin'
I'm pleedin'
I'm needin'
I want you to know
So I'm down upon my knees

Oh Lord
I need forgiveness
I need forgiveness
From you
