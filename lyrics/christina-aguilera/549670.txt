I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Something 'bout you caught my eye
Somethin' moved me deep inside
Don't know what you did boy but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since


Told my mother, my brother
My sister and my friends
Told the others, my lovers
Both past and present tense
That every time I see you everything starts making sense

Ain't no other man
Can stand
Up next to you
Ain't no other man
On the planet
Does what you do
You're the kinda guy
A girl finds
In a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you

Never thought I'd be alright
'Till you came and changed my life
What was cloudy now is clear
You're the light that I need here
You got what I want boy and I want it
So keep on giving it up

So tell your mother, your brother
Your sister and your friends
Tell the others, your lovers
Better not be present tense
'Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine
And no one else's

Ain't no other man
Can stand
Up next to you
Ain't no other man
On the planet
Does what you do
You're the kinda guy
A girl finds
In a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you

Ain't no other
Ain't, ain't, no other (other)
Ain't no other
Ain't, ain't, no other (lover)
Ain't no other
I, I, I need no other
Ain't no other man but you

You are there when I'm a mess
You talked me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test

Ain't no other man
Can stand
Up next to you
Ain't no other man
On the planet
Does what you do
You're the kinda guy
A girl finds
In a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you
And now I'm telling you
Said ain't no other man but you

Ain't no other man
Can stand
Up next to you
Ain't no other man
On the planet
Does what you do
You're the kinda guy
A girl finds
In a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you
