Move it to the rhythm

Dancefloor's open feelin free
Music's pumpin' to get on your feet
Take a chance and feel the beat
Get on up and gotta dace with me


Chorus:
Just be free
Now stop the moving no way
On your feet
Move it to the rhythm
Just be free
Now stop the moving no way
On your feet
Move it to the rhythm

Don't ya see you just can't fight
We'll be dancin' to the morninglight
Just keep going don't let it slip away
There's no stopping 'til tha break of day

Chorus

On your feet (3x)
Move it to the rhythm

Chorus
