Sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of this life
I found the price of love and I lost my mind
I will forgive them, all of my wrongs and my rights
I'd do it all again and won't think twice
Won't think twice


Are you devil? Are you angel?
Am I heaven? Am I hell?
I can barely find the proof to save myself
Are you water? Are you fire?
Are you filthy? Are you pure?
Oh, I thought by now I'd know, but I'm not sure

Well, you're no angel, I never asked you to be
You're my danger 'cause that's just what I need
But it still hurts me

Well, sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of my life
I found the price of love and lost my mind
I will forgive them, all of my wrongs and my rights
I'd do it all again and won't think twice
Won't think twice

My forever and my end
My forgiveness and my sin
I have sacrificed the most of my youth
Is it treason? Is it true?
That the worst I won't undo
Only enemy I have in love is you

Well, you're no angel, I never asked you to be
You're my danger 'cause that's just what I need
But it still hurts me

Well, sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of my life
I found the price of love and lost my mind
Oh, I will forgive them, all of my wrongs and my rights
I'd do it all again and won't think twice, no
Won't think twice

Were you devil? Were you angel?
It's too late to change my mind
I would do it all again and not think twice
