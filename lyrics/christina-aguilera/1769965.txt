Underneath the city lights
There is a world few know about
Where rules don't apply, no
And you can't keep a good girl down


She's going through the club looking for a good time
Gonna make that
Shake that
Money on the dime
Don't need a sugga daddy
She'll be working it just fine
Up on the table
She'll be dancing all night (hee-eey)

Babydoll just come alive
Under the spotlight
All the girls wanna fall in line

We say
He-eh-eh-hey
Here come the ladies bout to give a little show
He-eh-eh-hey
Here comes the boozie gonna show a little more

Hit it up, get it up
Won't let you rest
Hit it up, get it up
This is not a test
Hit it up, get it up
Gotta give me your best
So get your ass up
Show me how you burlesque

Hit it up, get it up
Won't let you rest
Hit it up, get it up
This is not a test
Hit it up, get it up
Gotta give me your best
So get your ass up
Show me how you burlesque

A little bit of naughty is a little bit nice
She's a whole lot of glam, sweet sugar, sex spice
Shimmy, shimmy, strut, strut
Give a little work, work
We'll be up on the table
We'll be dancing all night (hee-eey)

Everybody just come to life
Under the spotlight
All the boys wanna fall behind

We say
He-eh-eh-hey
Here come the ladies bout to give a little show
He-eh-eh-hey
Here comes the boozie gonna show a little more

Hit it up, get it up
Wont let you rest
Hit it up, get it up
This is not a test
Hit it up, get it up
Gotta give me your best
So get your ass up
Show me how you burlesque

Hit it up, get it up

Hit it up, get it up
This is not a test
Hit it up, get it up
Gotta give me your best
So get your ass up
