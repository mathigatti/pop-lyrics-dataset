Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Step right up, step right up, come closer
You won't believe your eyes behind this curtain
Witness something you've never seen before, heard before, dreamt before
The most amazing show on earth


La la la la la la la
It's the most amazing show on earth
La la la la la la la
Do you want to be widely entertained?
People to know your name?
Do you crave fame?
Well they say "things aren't always what they seem to be"
Even your greatest fantasies
You won't believe your eyes
Won't even recognise the wonderment
That lies behind the shimmer and the lights

Is it true what they say?
Is it all just fun and games?
Or is there more behind the makeup and the faces full of paint?
I ask you, do you want to come and play?
La la la la la la la
Hahahaha
Get the world to come and play
La la la la la la la
Hahahaha
So sit back, relax, fasten your seatbelts
It's going to be a bumpy ride to the other side
