Glam
Let's get glam
Glam


Walk, turn, pose, stop
Give 'em what you got
Work those hips, side to side
Get that angle right (right)

Paint your face like a movie queen
A naughty dream or a fantasy
Anything goes, gotta be the scene
Create a look, out a fashion book

Ready, set, now go

Let's get glam
Don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam
It's all in how you move
Let's get glam
Don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam
It's all in attitude
Now snap
Now snap

Here we go
Blush on, lashes long, mascara strong, strong, strong
Lips, eyes, cheeks, face
Give it style grace, grace, grace

Better be ready for your photo op
Step in the light, for your perfect close up
Be superficial, it's your one shot
Unleash the diva
Deep inside

Ready, set, now go (bitches)

Let's get glam
Don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam
It's all in how you move
Let's get glam
Don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam
It's all in attitude
Now snap
Now snap

Here we go
Runway on fire, fashion Gods inspire
Lose control, inhibitions run wild
Get on the floor
In your best couture
C'mon on and take me
Higher!

(Live, love it, breath it, work it, glam)
(Live, love it, breath it, work it, glam) ooh
(Live, love it, breath it, work it, glam) ooh ooh, oh
(Live, love it, breath it, work it, glam)
Oh!

Now snap
Now clap
Now dance
Now stop
Let's get glam (let's get glam)

Don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam
It's all in how you move
Let's get glam
Don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam
It's all in attitude (fashion is a lifestyle)

Don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam
It's all in how you move
Let's get glam
Don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam
It's all in attitude (fashion is a lifestyle)
