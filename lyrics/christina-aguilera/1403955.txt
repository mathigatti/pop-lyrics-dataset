Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I Can't help it


Love's always been my game
Play it how I may
I was made that way
I Can't help it

Men cluster to me like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame

Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I Can't help it

Fallin' in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
Can't help it

Love's always been my game
Play it how I may
I was made that way
Can't help it

Men cluster to me like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame

Fallin' in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
Can't help it

Men cluster to me like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame

Fallin' in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I Can't help it
