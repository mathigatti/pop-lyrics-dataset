Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, oh yeah


Hey there boy
Did you happen to know wherever you go
I'll follow
Ooh baby Like a cool breeze
On a summer day, hey

When you're near me
I don't know what to do
I feel like a fool
Like a schoolgirl, a true blue girl
Who wants to know, can he come out and play?

Oh yeah

You make me feel the way a woman
Is suppose to feel, oh
So let me show you, show you
My love's for real

I'll be the rain in your summer
The chill in your fall
I'll be what you want, anything at all
I got a love for all seasons
A love for all times

I'll be the fire in your winter
The sun in your spring
I'll do what you want, give you everything
I got a love for all seasons
A love for all times

I'll be there for you
Keeping you warm, through the storm
I'll guide you, stand by you
Until the stars fall from the sky, oh yeah

When you call me
I never hesitate, making you wait
For my love, never lie love
It's something that I just can't deny

I'll read your each and every feeling
When you need me to
And so now I got to let you know
This love's for you, ooh

I'll be the rain in your summer
The chill in your fall
I'll be what you want, anything at all
I got a love for all seasons
A love for all times

I'll be the fire in your winter
The sun in your spring
I'll do what you want, give you everything
I got a love for all seasons
A love for all times

You don't have to search no more
Baby you don't have to dream
Cause what I've got inside for you
Is all that you'll ever need, whoa

Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

You don't have to search no more
My heart is yours, for real, for sure
You don't have to wonder why
I'll never leave, I'll never lie

You don't have to search no more
My heart is yours, for real, for sure
You don't have to wonder why
I'll never leave, I'll never lie

I'll be the rain in your summer
The chill in your fall
I'll be what you want, anything at all
I got a love for all seasons
A love for all times

I'll be the fire in your winter
The sun in your spring
I'll do what you want, give you everything
I got a love for all seasons
A love for all times
