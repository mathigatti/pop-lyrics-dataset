There's no need for distance
No need for touch
No need for answers 'cause I've heard enough
I've just find a chair
Some place out of reach
I enter the darkness and claim my release
And open my, open my heart
Sing like a nightingale
Open my, open my hands
When no one else understands


I just close my eyes and count to ten
Breathe in twice and open them
Know where to go cause I've been there before
In my mind it is near
I escape all I fear
So by closing my eyes
I am anywhere but here

There's no need for anger
Religion or faith
One blade of grief will always remain
It's not on the paper
Or a story book
It's a place to reunite with all that was took
And open my, open my heart
Sing like a nightingale
Open my, open my hands
When no one else understands

I just close my eyes and count to ten
Breathe in twice and open them
Know where to go cause I've been there before
In my mind it is near
I escape all I fear
So by closing my eyes
I am anywhere but here

Picture a land where you never have been
Where life is eternal and evergreen
The future of happiness and certainty
You're loved and you're lost there for now and eternity

I just close my eyes and count to ten
Breathe in twice and open them
Know where to go cause I've been there before
In my mind it is near
I escape all I fear
So by closing my eyes
I am anywhere but here
