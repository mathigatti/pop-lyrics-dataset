Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then, I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed


Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then, I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed

You Are What You Are
you are beautiful no matter what they say
We Are What We Are
we are beautiful no matter what they say

To all your friends, you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left undone

You Are What You Are
you are beautiful no matter what they say
We Are What We Are
we are beautiful no matter what they say

No matter what we do
No matter what we say
We're the song inside the tune
Full of beautiful mistakes

And everywhere we go
The sun will always shine
But tomorrow we might awake
On the other side

And everywhere we go
The sun will always shine
But tomorrow we might awake
On the other side
