I wanted a lover
To show me the way love goes
To know what it felt like
To let something take control
To live the expression
I'm head over heels this time
Unafraid to be open
And thinking I'd be just fine
But I found the very end
That it all depends


'Cause love can lift you so high
Or it'll leave you to die
And it's not like you ever get to choose
(Which way that it leads you)
Ooh, it can play with your mind
Or make you feel so alive
Either way you'll survive 'cause
That's what love can do
Oh, yeah, yeah
That's what love can do

I guess now I get why
They say love is a dangerous game
'Cause when you think that you're winning
You find out that you just been been played
You give and you sacrifice
You make changes in your life
Everyone's got advice
But no one's got a clue (not even you)
And I found in the very end
That it all depends

'Cause love can lift you so high
Or it'll leave you to die
And it's not like you ever get to choose
(Which way that it leads you)
Ooh it can play with your mind
Or make you feel so alive
Either way you'll survive 'cause
That's what love can do
Ooh, oh, ooh
That's what love can do

I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Dreaming of when I believed in
Fairy tales, sunset sails, it never fails
Till reality sets in
I begin to comprehend how crazy this has been
And I can't depend on
Anyone for my happily ever after
Yeah, yeah

'Cause love can lift you so high
Or it'll leave you to die
And it's not like you ever get to choose
(Which way that it leads you)
Ooh it can play with your mind
Make you feel so alive
Either way you'll survive 'cause, ohh
That's what love can do
That's what love can do, ohh
'Cause that's what love can do, ohh yeah

Oh, ooh, hey
It can tear you apart
And it's broken, broken my heart
That's what love can do
Ooh
