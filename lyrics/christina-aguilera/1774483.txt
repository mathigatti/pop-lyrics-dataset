When he kisses me, I get that thrill
When he does that wiggle I won't keep still
I wanna a tough lover (yeah, yeah)

Tough lover (hum, hum)

The seven sisters got nothing on him
I'm talking about a lover who's fast as the wind
Everyone will talk about how he got me fixed
It ain't voodoo, it's just that twist
He will be the greatest lover that ever come to pass
Don Juan ain't got the half the chance

He's a tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (woo)
He's a tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (oh oh)

Hey, hey, heyah
He'll make me laugh, he'll make me cry
He'll be so tough he'll make Venus come alive
He'll do anything that he wants to do
Step on Jesse James's blue suede shoes, yeah

A tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (woo)
A tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (hey yeah, yeah yeah)
A tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (yeah, yeah)
A tough lover (oh oh)
