I can't believe what you did to me
Down on my knees and I need to break free
All these years, you violated me


I don't know why I can't feel inside
Trying to hide, can't make it all right
It's overkill, now I'm ready to fight (ready to fight)

I don't need nobody trying to make me over (make me over)
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Saving all your bullshit for another day

Feeling confined, like I'm being force fed
My vision's blurry and I'm lost in regrets
It's overload, and I'm out of control (out of control)

So sick and tired of being so misused (feeling so misused)
Taking me down with all your mental abuse
I said, I gotta get you out of my head

Everybody's always trying to look me over (look me over)
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Saving all your bullshit for another day
I'm the only one that can rescue me from me

Leaving the house in a quarter to five
Zipped out my boots and I'm ready to ride
And I feel so high, I feel so alive

Let down my hair, feel the wind on my skin (wind on my skin)
Crossing the border where my new life begins
And I close my eyes and take it all in

I don't need nobody trying to make me over (make me over)
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Saving all your bullshit for another day
I'm the only one that can rescue me from me

I just wanna get away
Saving all your bullshit for another day
I'm the only one that can rescue me from me

You wanna break me down
You wanna break me down
You wanna break me down
You wanna break me down
