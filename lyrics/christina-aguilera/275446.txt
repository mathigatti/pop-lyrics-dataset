I'm not, not over you 

I can't believe it's over 
It's hard to let you go 
Cause I can't sleep at night 
And that's one thing that I know 


I'm not, not over you 
I'm not, not over you 

I don't why it's over 
I don't know where to turn 
I tried to let it go 
But that's one thing that I know

I'm not, not over you 

Tell me what can I do 
When I know that we are through 
Can't get you off my mind 
Think about you all the time (all the time)
I can't get over you 
No matter what I do 
I'm not, not over you 

I know inside I gave it
I gave it all I had 
I did all I could do 
And still it hurts me so bad 

I'm not, not over you 

Tell me what can I do 
When I know that we are through 
Can't get you off my mind 
Think about you all the time (all the time)
I can't get over you 
No matter what I do 

I'm not, not over you
