She turned 15 with great expectation
her older brother knew that something was up
He caught her going through his record collection
Looking at Hedrix like a love sick pup


She begged and she pleaded til dad finally listened
He drove in the car down to Sears Roebucks
He bought her a guitar that was the beginning
Now she's down in the cellar with the amp turned up

Girls with guitars
Daddy's little angels
Girls with guitars
What's the world coming to
Girls with guitars
Mothers tend to worry about
Girls with guitars

Well, Saturday night she followed her brother
it was socks and stockings on the old gym floor
Well everyone danced to old garage covers
She was checking out riffs and memorizing chords
She didn't care at all for the football heros
She didn't even notice the basketball stars
Boys as a species were all a bunch of zeros
Except for the ones that played that guitar

Girls with guitars
She wasn't learning baby talk
Girls with guitars
She didn't go out for cheerleading
Girls with guitars
Girls with guitars
Boys get kinda nervous around
Girls with guitars

She went out to college she got her degree
Parents breathe a sigh of great relief
Daddy's thinking law school
Mama's thinking medicine
Daughter's thinking how's she's gonna break the news to them

Now there was an old Chevy van just sitting in the driveway
Filled to the gills with all her stuff
She cut a deal with her brother to drive up the highway
She figures New York City is close enough

She gets the audition from a friend of a friend
He's checking out her legs and saying this will never work
She flips on the boggie and turns to the band
Gives a little grin and blows away the jerk

Girls with guitars
Everybody's rockin'
Girls with guitars
There ought to be a song about
Girls with guitars
There just no stopping those
Girls with guitars

She gets her money for nothing and the guys for free
