Chorus
Sundown,friday twilight in the big town,party people getting ready now
Somewhere baby,i know your waiting to see this vibrating.


Verse 1
The city's in a heat wave,praying for a sun shade
Hoping that the evening will chill down the streets
And i'm a little hot too,'cause i can only think of you
Hoping that tonight you'll find out what i'm li-i-i-i-i-ike,

(chorus)

Verse 2
Don't know if you've seen me,
Don't know if your dreaming,
Hoping that tonight you'll find out who you are,
Tonight i'm gonna find you,flying on a breeze and blind you,
Take you from this club land and send us to the sta-a-a-a-a-a-ars

(chorus)

Time,no need to rush we can make it right,'cause we are meant
To be you and i,it's in the air we breathe all around,all ar-o-ound
Say your longing to 'cause i will look for you at sundown
(chorus x3)
