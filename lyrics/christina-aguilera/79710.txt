When you put your hands on me..
When you put your hands on me..


I don't know about the travel of time
And I've never seen most of the world
I don't know
Diving out of the sky
Or living like the diamonds
Of pearls

See I haven't danced to a musical tune
And I haven't noticed the flowers in bloom
I haven't smiled
When alone in my room very much
Then we touched

I just know
When you put your hands on me
I feel sexy
And my body turns to gold
I just know
When you put your hands on me
I feel ready
And I lose my self-control

When you put your hands on me..

I don't know if a doll can unwind
Or how to make a person go
I don't know how to be what you like
And simply open up the depth of my soul

So I keep my wings
And my eyes on the down
Ready for nothing
But holding my ground
I haven't used
A particular noun very much
Then we touched

I just know
When you put your hands on me
I feel sexy
And my body turns to gold
I just know
When you put your hands on me
I feel ready
And I lose my self-control

When you put your hands on me..
When you put your hands on me..

I won't notice
Or pay you no mind
Boy I couldn't care less
What you do with your time
Your fingertips on my hips
Just move me like one of a kind

When you put your hands on me
I feel so sexy
And my body turns to gold
I just know
When you put your hands on me
I feel ready
And I lose my self-control

I just know
When you put your hands on me
I feel sexy
And my body turns to gold
I just know
When you put your hands on me
I feel ready
And I lose my self-control
