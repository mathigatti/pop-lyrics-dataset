You make me feel so emotional
Woooooaaaah oooohyeah
(so emotional)
Ooooaaayeah
(so emotional)
It's either black or white
That's right
We're makin love or we're in a fight
Sometimes you make me so blue
But then it feels so good
I knew it would
You do the things that make me crazy
I want to give it to you


Chorus
You make me feel
So emotional
I can't let go i'm
So emotional
I'm sinking fast in-
To an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional(mmhhmm)

You take me high and low
You know
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go
You're such a mystery to me
Ooooh
But baby hot or cold
You got a hold
Of my imagination
I think you know what i mean
Nooowooo!

Chorus
You make me feel
So emotional
I can't let go i'm
So emotional
I'm sinking fast in-
To an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional

Bridge
Rain is falling down on me
Suddenly the sun comes out
Oooh
Sometimes north or south of love
But i'm never out (never out)
Never out
I'm so emotional!(you make me feel so-oh)
Ooh you make me feel so
(i can't let go i'm so-oh)
I'm so emotional
(i'm sinking fast into an ocean full of you)
(you make me feel so wooaaah!)

Chorus
You make me feel
So emotional
I can't let go i'm
So emotional
I'm sinking fast in-
To an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional
You make me feel
So emotional
I can't let go i'm
So emotional
I'm sinking fast in-
To an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional
You make me feel
So emotional
I can't let go i'm
So emotional
I'm sinking fast in-
To an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional
