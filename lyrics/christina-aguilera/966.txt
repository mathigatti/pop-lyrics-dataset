I was alone just because I wasn't like them
They made me excluded so cruelly
Then there was you
You stood by me
Ignored their words
You became my best friend so true


(CHORUS)
You believed in me when no one else did
You gave me the strength to move on, my friend
You will always be the one i'll remember
To give my thanks to for my success

They just did not understand what i was going through
My situation they didnt care, no, ooh
You tried to take a stand for me
When i just could not take it any longer

(CHORUS)
You believed in me when no one else did
You gave me the strength to move on, my friend
You will always be the one i'll remember
To give my thanks to for my success

I oh as I look back
I can see how childish they were
And you showed me that you were so much more then they were
I hope they can see the mistics now and not do it to another
But if they dont, i hope that person finds someone like you

(CHORUS)
You believed in me when no one else did
no hooo yeahh hhehh hooo
You will always be the one i'll remember, for my success
You believed in me when no one else did
The strength to move onn yahhh heyy
