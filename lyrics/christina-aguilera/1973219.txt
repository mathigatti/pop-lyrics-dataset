Though your heart is aching
Smile
Even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by


If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile
What's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Smile
Though your heart is aching
Smile
Even though it's breakin'
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

That's the time
You must keep on trying
Smile
What's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
