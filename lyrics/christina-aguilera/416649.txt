I know he's around 
When the sky and the ground started ringing, 
I know that he's near by the thunder I hear in advance. 


In every way, every day, I need listen myself, 
I need more him, more him, 
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance... 
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance... 

Fanny Brice sang a song like that in 1922, 
and it made her the Toast of Broadway...
