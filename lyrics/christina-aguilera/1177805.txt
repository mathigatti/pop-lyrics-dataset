This is a man's world, this is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl


See, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry heavy loads
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby boys and a baby girls
Man makes them happy 'cause man makes them toys

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

He's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitterness
He's lost

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl
