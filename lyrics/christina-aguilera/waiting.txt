Oh, For The Things You Said
If I Could’ve Knew..That I Hurt You
I Would Do Anything
For Us To Make It Through


Got Me A Smile And Save Me Tonight
I Am A Blank Page Waiting
For You To Bring Me
Oh, For The Things You Said

If I Could’ve Knew..That I Hurt You
I Would Do Anything
For Us To Make It Through
Got Me A Smile And Save Me Tonight

I Am A Blank Page Waiting
For You To Bring Me
So.. Waiting Me Waiting for me
Oh, oh, oh, oh Waiting Me.
