I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
And I'd like to know it's more than love at first sight
Well I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yea yea


And my arms need someone to hold 
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
I need love for all my life to have and to hold
Well I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yea yea yea

I don't want nothing baby
Well I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yea
