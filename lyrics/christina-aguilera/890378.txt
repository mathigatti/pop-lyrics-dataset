Climb Every Montain  
Ooh, whoa
Climb ev'ry mountain
Search high and low
Follow every 
highway
Every path you know


Ooh, yeah yeah

Climb ev'ry

Ford every stream, yeah yeah
Follow every rainbow
Til you find

A dream that will need
All the love you can give,

For as long as you live, oh

Follow every rainbow

Spoken:
It starts with a dream in your youth
With a little 
encouragement,
Discipline, and determination
We all have the 
power
Inside each of us to reach our goals
And what we feel is the 
impossible
It's all about believing in yourself
And if you can dream 
it
You can do it

Ooh whoa
Whoa oh

Ford

Climb ev'ry mountain (climb ev'ry mountain)
Ford every stream

Climb ev'ry mountain (climb every every)

Climb ev'ry mountain (climb ev'ry

Ford every stream (oh oh oh)
Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford every

Climb ev'ry 
mountain
Ford every stream
