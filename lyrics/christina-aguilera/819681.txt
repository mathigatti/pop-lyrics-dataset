Shine your light now 
This time it's gotta be good 
You get it right now (yeah) 
'Cause you're in Hollywood 


There's something in the air in Hollywood 
The sun is shining like you knew it would 
You're ridin' in your car in Hollywood 
You got the top down and it feels so good 

I lost my memory in Hollywood 
I've had a million visions, bad and good 
There's something in the air in Hollywood 
I tried to leave it but I never could 


There's something in the air in Hollywood 
I've lost my reputation, bad and good 
You're ridin' in your car in Hollywood 
You got the top down and it feels so good 

Music stations always play the same songs 
I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong 

Everybody comes to Hollywood 
They wanna make it in the neighborhood 
They like the smell of it in Hollywood 
How could it hurt you when it looks so good 

'Cause you're in Hollywood 
'Cause you're in Hollywood 
In Hollywood 

Check it out, this bird has flown 

'Cause you're in Hollywood 
'Cause you're in Hollywood 
In Hollywood 

Push the button 
Don't push the button 
Trip the station 
Change the channel
