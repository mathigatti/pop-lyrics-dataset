Can you hear it in my voice
Was it something I let slip
Does the whole world know
Isn't it obvious


I'm the one who's in control
Now I'm acting like a fool
Do my feelings show
Is my face aglow
Isn't it obvious

(CHORUS)
That I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious

Do you see my hands, they tremble
Wonder why I can't look you in the eyes
Don't know how long
I can keep this inside
Isn't it obvious

(CHORUS)
That I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious

Suddenly these emotions are in control of my heart
Can you see it in my eyes
Everyglance, every smile must give me away
And i feel so much I can't hide

(CHORUS)
That I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious
