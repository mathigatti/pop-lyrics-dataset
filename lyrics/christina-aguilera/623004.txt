Stop, slow down baby
I can tell that you're into me
Baby, it's so plain to see
I can see it in your eyes you're paralyzed every time I pass you by
And you're the kind that gets your way
Every minute, every single day
I can see it all in your face you're blown away 'cause I don't want you in my space


You're struttin' 'round here like you think that I can't do without you
You've got some nerve to think that I would give up everything

Slow down baby
And don't act crazy
'Cause you know you can look all you want
But you just can't touch (just can't touch no)
So slow down baby
I'm not your lady (lady)
Boy you're never gonna get it from me
'Cause I'm with someone

Slow it down
Slow it down
Slow, slow
Stop, slow down baby

After all of the games you play
How's it feel to finally get a taste
You can dish it out but can you take the bed you've made, go lie in it for a change
I'm not fallin' for your stupid lines
I know you've used 'em 'bout a thousand times
You say 'em like they were a nursery rhyme but I won't buy it, baby don't you even try

You're comin' 'round here like you think that everything's about you
If you knew anything you'd realize I wear a ring

Slow down baby (slow down)
And don't act crazy (crazy, yeah)
'Cause you know you can look all you want
But you just can't touch (you just can't touch, no)
So slow down baby (slow down)
I'm not your lady (your lady)
Boy you're never gonna get it from me
'Cause I'm with someone (with someone, yea)

Do you really wanna waste your time
Don't you have better things to do in life
Listen, I don't wanna get you down
But I ain't never gonna mess around
So how many ways do I have to say

Slow down baby (slow it down, yeah, yeah)
And don't act crazy
'Cause you know you can look all you want (you know that you can't touch, ooh)
But you just can't touch
So slow down baby (slow down baby)
I'm not your lady (not your lady)
Boy you're never gonna get it from me
'Cause I'm with someone
You better stop, slow down baby

So slow down baby (slow down baby)
And don't act crazy (don't act crazy)
'Cause you know you can look all you want
But you just can't touch
You just can't touch, no

Stop, slow down baby
