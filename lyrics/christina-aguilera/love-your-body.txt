I came here tonight to get you out of my mind
I'm gonna take what I find.(uh oh, yeah)
So open the box, don't need no key I'm unlocked.
And I won't tell you to stop (uh oh, yeah)


Hey boy
I don't need to know where you've been,
All I need to know is you and no need for talking
Hey boy
So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin'

All I wanna do is love your body
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
All I wanna do is love your body
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh

It's true what you heard, I am a freak, I'm disturbed
So come on and give me your worst (uh oh, yeah)
We're moving faster than slow
If you don't know where to go
I'll finish all from my own (uh oh, yeah)

Hey boy
I don't need to know where you've been,
All I need to know is you and no need for talking
Hey boy
So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin'
Say say hey

All I wanna do is love your body
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
All I wanna do is love your body
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh

I think you already know my name
I think you already know my name
Hey hey
Ha!
Alright,
Say
I think you already know my name

All I wanna do is love your body
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh

Say
Tonight's your love night, I know you want it
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
All I wanna do is love your body
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
Say, say, hey
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh.
