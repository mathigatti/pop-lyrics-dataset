Yeah Yeah
ohhh
beautiful
beautiful
beautiful
beautiful
oh No, Oh
no Matter What They Say
(No Matter What They Say)
i Am Beautiful


every Day Is So Wonderful
then Suddenly, It's Hard To Breathe
now And Then, I Get Insecure
from All The Pain, I'm So Ashamed (No)

i Am Beautiful (Beautiful)
no Matter What They Say (No Matter What They Say)
words Can't Bring Me Down (I Am Beautiful)
i Am Beautiful (Beautiful)
in Every Single Way (Every Single Way)
words Can't Bring Me Down, Oh No, Oh

to All Your Friends, You're Delirious
so Consumed In All Your Doom, Mmm
trying Hard To Fill The Emptiness
the Piece Is Gone Left The Puzzle Undone
is That The Way It Is?

i Am Beautiful (Beautiful)
no Matter What They Say (No Matter What They Say)
words Can't Bring Me Down (I Am Beautiful)
i Am Beautiful (Beautiful)
in Every Single Way (Every Single Way)
words Can't Bring Me Down, Oh No, Oh

i Am Beautiful
beautiful, Beautiful
beautiful, Beautiful

no Matter What We Do
no Matter What We Say
(No Matter What We Say)
we're The Song Inside The Tune
full Of Beautiful Mistakes
and Everywhere We Go
(And Everywhere We Go)
the Sun Will Always Shine
(Sun Will Always, Always Shine)
but Tomorrow We Might Awake
on The Other Side

i Am Beautiful (Beautiful)
no Matter What They Say (No Matter What They Say)
words Can't Bring Me Down (I Am Beautiful)
i Am Beautiful (Beautiful)
in Every Single Way (Every Single Way)
words Can't Bring Me Down, Oh No, Oh
i Am Beautiful
no Matter What They Say (No Matter What They Say)
words Can't Bring Me Down (I Am Beautiful)
i Am Beautiful
in Every Single Way (Every Single Way)
words Can't Bring Me Down, Oh No, Oh

i Am Beautiful
(No Matter What They Say)
beautiful, Beautiful
beautiful, Beautiful
beautiful, Beautiful
beautiful, Beautiful
