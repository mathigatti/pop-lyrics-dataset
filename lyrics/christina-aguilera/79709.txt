What a girl wants, what a girl needs
What a girl wants, what a girl needs


(Yeah, c'mon)

I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe
Like a rock you waited so patiently
While I got it together
While I figured it out (yeah, yeah)
I only looked but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holding hands, making plans
And it's lucky for me you understand

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowin' exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for givin' it to me

What I want is what you got
And what you got is what I want

There was a time I was blind, I was so confused
I'd run away just to hide it all from you
But baby, you knew me better, mmm
Than I knew myself, luv
They say: If you love something, let it go
And if it comes back, it's yours, and that's how you know
It's for keeps, yeah, it is for sure
And you're ready and willing to give me more than

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowin' exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for givin' it to me

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Somebody sensitive, crazy, sexy, cool like you, yeah
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
(What you got is what I want)
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
(You're so right, you're so bad)
You let a girl know how much you care about her
I swear, you're the one who always knew
You knew, you knew, you knew, you knew

Oh, I'm thanking you for bein' there for me
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
Whatever keeps me in your arms is what I need

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
(Always what I want, always what I need)
And I'm thanking you for knowin' exactly
(What I need, what I want, said you've got, yeah, yeah)
What a girl wants , what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
(Oh, baby, I thank you 'cause you know)
And I'm thanking you for givin' it

What I want is what you got
What you got is what I want

Oh, baby, oh, darling
I thank you, thank you
For givin' me what I want
And what I need

(I turn around and stare, whenever you're not there)
