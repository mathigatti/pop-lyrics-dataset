Hm, after all you put me through
You'd think I despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you make me that much stronger


Well I thought I knew you, thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff, time is up
'Cause I've had enough
You were there by my side, always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, hmm

After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for makin' me a fighter

Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realized your game
I heard you're going round playin', the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies cause you're wanting to haunt me
But that won't work anymore, no more
Uh uh, it's over
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me

I am a fighter and I (I am a fighter)
I ain't goin' stop (I ain't goin' stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (oh)
It makes me that much wiser (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (a fighter)
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter (fighter)

Thought I would forget (but I)
I remember (oh ooh)
Yes, I remember (oh oh ooh)
I remember
Thought I would forget (ooh oh)
I remember (oh ooh)
Yes I remember (ooh)
I remember

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
