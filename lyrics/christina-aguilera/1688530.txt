My girls wear lipstick while they're making my beats
They got the in their purses, Louboutins on their feet
They got no time for waiting in line
They got sex and 808 running through their dirty minds


My girls, we're running the show
My girls, we're teasing all the boys on the go
My girls, cause that's the way that we roll
My girls, so ladies step it up and take control

Now shout, my girls we're stronger than one
Now shout, and sometimes we gotta have fun (come on!)

My girls headed to the city y'all
We got Cosmo on the dash and tickets on the floor
We got Sia, and Rhonna, and Peaches too
We got Johanna and JD and we're coming for you
My girls (my girls)

My girls, we're running the show
My girls, we're teasing all the boys on the go
My girls, cause that's the way that we roll
My girls, so ladies step it up and take control

Now shout, my girls we're stronger than one
Now shout, and sometimes we gotta have fun (come on!)

My girls are screaming, and yelling, and getting loud
My girls are shaking up the party while you're getting down
My girls are singing, and dancing and having fun
My girls are cooking up a beat, and they want you to come

You ready, Christina?
I like my girls hot, sweet, tough, or playmate
808, trainable primate
Self-reliant, giant, death-defiant
No Kobe Bryant
I'll take a bullet for you
If you give me a taste
I rock a mullet or two
Yeah, below the waist
You're my BFF, you're my 606, 303
I'ma swing and handle my fix

My girls stay close when they see trouble around
They got jewels on their fingers, it's about to go down
We got no time for haters you know, we just came to party
Come on, now here we go

My girls, we're running the show
My girls, we're teasing all the boys on the go
My girls, cause that's the way that we roll
My girls, so ladies step it up and take control

Now shout, my girls we're stronger than one
Now shout, and sometimes we gotta have fun
My girls we're stronger than one
Now shout, and sometimes, now shout, we gotta have fun
