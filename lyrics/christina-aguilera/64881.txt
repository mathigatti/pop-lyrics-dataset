So, what am I not s'pposed to have an opinion?
Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled


When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what every little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors, or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout out loud!

Letting 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands higher and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Never can, never will

So, what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringing?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing

If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's OK
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sang

This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen, not heard (you can't get rid of us)
So what do we do girls? Shout out loud!

Letting 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
(We standin' our ground on this one)
Lift your hands higher and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down (check it)

[Lil' Kim]
Here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls, then he's the man
He can even give her some head or sex her off
But if the girl do the same she's a whore
But the table's about to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put their name on it
It's alright though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'

To all my girls with a man who be tryin' to mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Little Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back

[Christina Aguilera]
You're just a little boy
Think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy
All you do is annoy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things

This is for my girls!

This is for my girls all around the world

We're back again, yeah
