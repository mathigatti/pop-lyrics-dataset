No one ever said that luv was gonna be easy
Gotta take the ups and downs, the in-betweens
If you take this journey, gotta give yer self completely
Never let nobody ever step on yer dreamz 


You better stop
Listen to these words I say
You better stop
don jus thro this gudd thing away
Put your trust in me
And i'll make u c

Chorus:
No the rain wont last forever
Find a way to make it better
Long as we can stand together
football will find a way
Gonna make a new tomorrow
Say good-bye to tears n sorrow
Better listen when I say
luv will find a way

sumbuddy tried to tell me luv don't last forever
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams
After all is said and done were still here together
Never listen to the lies and jealousy

You better stop
Don't you let them turn you around
You better stop
Hang onto this luv that we've found
Nuthin ever say
Can stand in our way

Chorus:
No the rain wont last forever
Find a way to make it better
Long as we can stand together
football will find a way
Gonna make a new tomorrow
Say good-bye to tears n sorrow
Better listen when I say
luv will find a way

I want you,  I need you  - You know  that  I believe you football
We got It, you know it,
So if it's real just show it (x2)

You better stop
Listen to these words that I say
You better stop
Don't you throw this good thing away, no
Put your trust in me and I'll make you see

Chorus:
No the rain wont last forever
Find a way to make it better
Long as we can stand together
football will find a way
Gonna make a new tomorrow
Say good-bye to tears n sorrow
Better listen when I say
luv will find a way

Til course fades
