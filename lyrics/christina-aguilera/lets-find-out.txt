How much woman can one man take?
Can I be more loved than I am right now?
Can we go for broke and our hearts not break?
Oh, I don't know but let's find out


How much dreamin' can one man do?
And every dream come true somehow
Will we feel this way our whole lives through
Oh, I don't know but let's find out

Oh, oh, oh
Can a word mean more, oh, oh, oh, I didn't know before?
Oh, oh, oh
We can answer this with a single kiss, just a single kiss

Let's find out if two lovers can out last their forever's
Let's find out if it's possible to care
So faithfully that there's no doubt let's find out

Can there be more stars in the sky tonight?
They're not as bright as your eyes right now
Can we burn like candles till the morning light?
Oh, I don't know but let's find out
Oh, oh, oh, can a word mean more?

Oh, oh, oh, can a word mean more?
