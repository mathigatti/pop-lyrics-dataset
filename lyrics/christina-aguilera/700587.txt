Baby, no more, no
Hmm
This is how it happened
I saw you
My dream became reality
The minute i was by myself
Then you became a part of me
Easy come easy go was in my mind
I was holding on to the past
Then i realized you were mine
I knew that we were gonna match
I won't let nobody try to turn me
From loving you
I am more than satisfied
Nobody else is gonna do
I won't let nobody in my business
It's all about you
If you want me here i am
Cause i'm here for you more than you know
Stay with me
Don't you go
I love you tonight more than you know
Stay with me
Don't you go
I love you tonight more than you know
When i wonder how it would've been
If i never met you
I think about if for awhile
Then i let it go cause i got you
And my heart's so full of love
I can not even breathe no
You're the air to my body
You're all that i need
I won't let nobody try to turn me
From loving you
I am more than satisfied
Nobody else is gonna do
I won't let nobody in my business
It's all about you
If you want me here i am
Cause i'm here for you more than you know
Stay with me
Don't you go
I love you tonight more than you know
Stay with me
Don't you go
I love you tonight more than you know
Your the pieces to my puzzle
Without you i'm incomplete
The song to my melody
Sweeter than honey
If you add all the days of my life
Multiply by the reasons i love you
It couldn't measure up to
How much i really need you
I won't let nobody try to turn me
From loving you
I am more than satisfied
No
