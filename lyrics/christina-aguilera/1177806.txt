Hey kids, shake it loose together,
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather.
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around,
You're gonna hear electric music,
Solid Walls of sound.


Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets,
But they're weird an they're wonderful,
Oh, Beannie she's really keen
She's got electrice [eletric] boots a mohair suit,
You know I read it in a magazine,
Oh! Bennie and the Jets.

Hey kids, plug into the faithless,
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless.
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along,
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong.
