I'm thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude night
If it's wrong to love you
Than my heart just won't let me be right
'cause i've drowned in you
And i won't pull through
Without you by my side


I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
Cause i can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Baby can you feel me
Imagining i'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vivedly emblazoned in my mind
And yet your so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

I'd give my all
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'cause i can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

**guitar break

I'd give my all
Just one more night with you
I'd risk mt life to feel
Your body next to mine
'cause i can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Give my all for your love
Tonight
