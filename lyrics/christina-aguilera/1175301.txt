[Tony]: Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight


[Christina]: Steppin' out with my honey
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knockin' wood

[Tony]: There'll be smooth sailin' 'cause I'm trimmin' my sails
In my top hat and my white tie and my tails

[Christina]: Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be

[Tony]:The big day may be tonight.

[Tonny]: If I seem to scintillate
It's because I've got a date
A date with a package of
The good things that come with love

[Christina]: You don't have to ask me
I won't waste your time

[Tony]: But if you should ask me
Why I feel sublime, go

[Christina]: There'll be smooth sailin' 
'cause I'm trimmin' my sails
In my top hat and my white tie and my tails

[Tony]: Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be

[Together]: The big day may be tonight., what a night!
