A very pleasant good evening ladies and gentlemen
It is now time for the one and only
There never will be another Christina Aguilera
That's how music should sound


I've waited for some time to get inside the minds
Of every legend I've ever wanted to stand beside
It's like an endless ride, feeling the lows and highs
Of every lyric and melody, every single rhyme
So here I stand today, in tribute I do pay
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way
And so to God I pray that he will give me strength
To carry forward the gift of song in his good faith
In his good faith

I'm going back to basics
To where it all began
I'm ready now to face it
I wanna understand

What made the soul singers and the blues figures, yeah
That inspired a higher generation
The jazz makers and the ground breakers
They gave so much of themselves in dedication

So here I stand today, in tribute I do pay
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way
