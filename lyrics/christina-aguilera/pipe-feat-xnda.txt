I get loud when you put that pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
I wanna celebrate you right now, right now, right now
Got me sendin' for you all across town, cross town, cross town
I wanna celebrate you right now, right now, right now, hey


I just sent a driver, he's on his way
Shouldn't be no traffic on this time on Saturday
I just left a lit-uation popping by the High Line
Walked in, no list, fuck a go sign
Make sure that you're checkin' on your texts
Tryna hurry up and get my body out this dress
Yeah, that's right, I'm stingy with my money and my own time
But when it comes to you, I'm always on time
I need some receipts, ooh
All the shit that you said you was gon' be doin' to me last week, oh
Oh yeah, I need some receipts
Got a couple secrets that I'd really love to see if you could keep
Damn boy, you remind me of my Jeep

I get loud when you put that pipe down, pipe down, pipe down (yeah)
I wanna celebrate you right now, right now, right now (ooh)
Got me sendin' for you all across town, cross town, cross town (ooh)
I wanna celebrate you right now, right now, right now

Don't you know, don't you know
That I got that rah-rah-rah rocky boat
Bet I'll make you splash like Geronimo
If you don't like it fast, I could take it slow
Wanna show you how much I missed ya
My schedule flexible so I switched up
Permanent vacation, we should go away
Way too much for me to wanna throw away
I'm hopin' that you're racin' through the signs
I got a surprise and it ain't even Valentine
Even if you ain't, just say you are for peace of mind
Know you got it all, but you should have a piece of mine

I get loud when you put that pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
I wanna celebrate you right now, right now, right now (woo)
Got me sendin' for you all across town, cross town, cross town (yeah)
I wanna celebrate you right now, right now, right now

[XNDA &amp; Christina]
You know I got a wild imagination
I like to play the doctor, operation (yeah)
Spread it on the bed like a patient (yeah)
I'm about to show you domination (yeah)
Got the 'nana drippin' like a waterfall (drip drip)
Ooh, that nana good, I could eat it all (eat it up)
I'mma dive in, touch the ocean floor
You already know what you came here for (lay it down now)
You know that I'm grown and I'm 'bout it (and I'm 'bout it)
And I know what to do witcha body (witcha body)
Every single time that you drop it
Trust me I know what to do with it

I get loud when you put that pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
I wanna celebrate you right now, right now, right now
Got me sendin' for you all across town, cross town, cross town
I wanna celebrate you right now, right now, right now

Mmm, lay it down now
