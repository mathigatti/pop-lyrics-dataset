You know
Tonight I am feeling a little out control
Is this me?
You wanna get crazy?
'Cause I don't give a, aw!


I'm out of character, I'm in rare form
And if you really knew me, you'd know it's not the norm
'Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone, I feel brand new
And if you don't like it, fuck you

The music's on and I'm dancing
I'm normally in the corner just standing
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care 'cause this is my night

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl

I'm dancing a lot, I'm taking shots and I'm feeling fine
I'm kissing on the boys and the girls
Someone call the doctor 'cause I lost my mind
'Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone I feel brand new
And if you don't like it fuck you

The music's on and I'm dancing
I'm normally in the corner just standing
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care 'cause this is my night

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl

(1, 2, 3, 4)

In the morning
When I wake up
I'll go back to the girl I used to be
But baby, not tonight

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl

Yeah, that feels good
I needed that
Yeah, get crazy
Let's go
That's right
Come on
Give it to me now
Don't stop
