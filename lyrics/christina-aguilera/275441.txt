Break it to me gently
Let me down the easy way
Make me feel that you still love me
If it's just for one more day


Break it to me gently
So my tears won't fall too fast
If you must go, then go slowly
Let me love you til the last

The love we shared for oh, so long
Is such a big, big part of me
If you must take your love away,
Take it gradually.

Break it to me gently
Give me time to ease the pain
Love me just a little longer
'Cause I'll never never love again

If you must take your love away
Take it gradually
Break it to me gently
Give me time to ease the pain

Love me just a little longer
'Cause I'll never never love again,
'Cause I'll never, no I'll never 
Love again.
