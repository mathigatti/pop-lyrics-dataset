I don't know what it is that you've done to me... 
but it's caused me to act in such a crazy way


'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
with thoughts of loving you on my mind

I can't figure out just what to do
when the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing, it's not a phase
I want you to stay with me, by my side
I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

It's time after time after time I've tried to fight it
In my condition I don't want to be alone
'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
and the thoughts in me is you

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I'm losing control, I want you to stay with me
By my side, I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
Your love's so sweet
It knocks me off my feet

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing, it's not a phase
I want you to stay with me, by my side
I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak
