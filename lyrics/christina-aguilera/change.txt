When I was young I would look in the mirror
Didn’t know it then but now it couldn’t be clearer
I remember being filled with such wonder
Before learning that the world can be harsher


Who you love or the color of your skin
Or the place that you were born and grew up in
Shouldn’t decide how you will be treated
Cuz we’re all the same when everybody’s breathing

Waiting for a change to set us free
Waiting for the day when you can be you
And I can be me
Waiting for a hope to come around
Waiting for the day when hate is lost
And love is found
Waiting for a change, waiting for a change
(Change, change)

For all the brave and the souls who went before us
Stand tall, then proudly lift your voices
Let them know who we are and our choices
And one day we won’t have to sing this chorus

Waiting for a change to set us free
Waiting for the day when you can be you
And I can be me
Waiting for a hope to come around
Waiting for the day when hate is lost
And love is found
Waiting for a change, waiting for a change
(Change, change)

Hold on
Waiting for a change (change, change)

When I was young I would look in the mirror
Didn’t see it then but now it couldn’t be clearer
