Say goodbye
Not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say goodbye
Not knowing how to cry
You taught me that


And i'll remember
The strength that you gave me
Now that i'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you saved me
I'll remember

Inside i was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside i looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing

And i'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that i'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changed me
I'll remember

I learned
To let go
Of the illusion
That we can possess
I learned to let go
I travel in stillness
I'll remember happiness
I'll remember

And i'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that i'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changed me
I'll remember

Now i'll never be afraid to cry
Now i finally have the reason why
I'll remember
