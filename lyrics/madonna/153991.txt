Well, I know from experience that if you have to ask
For something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe in their moment of need
That they want what you want but they don't


Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry, you're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this

Waiting for you, this waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you?
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you, I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you?
Don't break my heart

It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running
From your feelings like you are now
What happened? What do I remind you of?
Your past, your dreams
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore tell me what I did to deserve this

Waiting for you, I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you?
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you, this waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you?
Don't break my heart

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry, you're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why 'cause you're gonna have to justify this

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart, baby, please don't hurt me
I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart, baby, please don't hurt me

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

Waiting for you, I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you?
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you, I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you?
Don't break my heart

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart, baby, please don't hurt me
I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart, baby, please don't hurt me

Waiting for you, I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you?
Don't break my heart

Break my heart, don't break my heart
Break my heart, don't break my heart
Break my heart, don't break my heart
Break my heart, you broke my heart
You broke my heart, you broke my heart

next time you want pussy
Just look in the mirror baby
