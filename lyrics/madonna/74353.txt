A copper.
How do ya like that boys, a copper.
And we went for it, I went for it
Treated him like a kid brother
And I was gonna split fifty-fifty with a copper.
They were there waitin' to pin a medal on him
"Come on get up, get your hands up!"
Yeah, that's it, a nice gold medal for the copper
Only maybe he's gonna get it sooner than he thinks!


Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

You think you can have my love for free
Well I've got news for you, that's not the way it's gonna be
So don't come hangin' round my door
If you're not ready to give, you're not gonna get much more

I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna, gonna have to play my way
Come on make my day

Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

Can you feel the rhythm of my mind
Boy, I've got so much to give, but I don't want to waste my time
I can't let my heart put on a show
'Til you surrender baby, you've got to let it go

I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna, gonna have to play my way
Come on make my day

Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

Drop your weapons, you'd better come clean
I've got you covered, I'll catch you when you fall to me
I'm not gonna hurt you, 'cause I'm not that kind
We're not goin' nowhere 'till you have a change of mind

"You haven't got a chance, come out with your hands up"
'Come out with your hands up', the man says
How do ya like that, ma? Heh!
Here's my answer, you dirty ...

I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna, gonna have to play my way
Come on make my day

Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
