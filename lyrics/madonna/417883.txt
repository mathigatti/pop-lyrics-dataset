It's the tearing sound of love-notes 
Casting out the gray stained windows 
And the view outside is sterile 
But I'm only two cubes down 
I'll photocopy all the things that we could be 
If you took the time to notice me 
But you can't now, I don't blame you 
And it's not your fault that no one ever does 
-Chorus- 
But you don't work here anymore 
Its just a vacant 3 by 4 
And they might fill your place 
A temporary stand-in for your face


It happens all the time 
And I can't help but think I'll die alone 

So I'll spend my time with strangers 
A condition that is terminal 
In this water-cooler romance 
And its coming to a close 
We could be in the park and dancing by a tree 
Kicking over blades we see 
Or a dark beach with a black view 
As pin-pricks in the velvet break our fall 
-Chorus- 
I know you don't work here anymore, I know you don't work here anymore 
I know you don't work here anymore, I know you don't work here anymore 
I know you don't work here anymore, I know you don't work here anymore 
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, sometimes I think I'll die alone 
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, live and breathe and die alone 
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, sometimes I think I'll die alone 
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, I'd think I'd love to die alone 

I think I'd love to die alone
