Is it the rain or is it the weather
Am I insane to wanna keep it together
Is it the moon that's affecting my brain
Is it my prayers that never made it to heaven
I'm in love with love
Anyone can see
Angels up above are watching over me


Is it the sunlight that changes the seasons
Monday through Sunday I'm looking for reasons
Is there an angel watching over my shoulder
Tricking my senses or giving me shelter
I'm in love with love
Anyone can see
Angels up above are watching over me

I'm in love with love
Is it the rain, is it the weather
Angels up above
Is it my prayers keeping us together
Is it the rain or is it the weather
Am I insane to wanna keep it together
Is it the moon that's affecting my brain
Is it my prayers that never made it to heaven

I'm in love with love
Anyone can see
Angels up above are watching over me
I'm in love with love
Anyone can see
Angels up above are watching over me

Affection is perfection
When it's done with ease
I'm in love with love
I'm in love with love
Is it the rain or is it the weather
Angels up above
Is it my prayers keeping us together
