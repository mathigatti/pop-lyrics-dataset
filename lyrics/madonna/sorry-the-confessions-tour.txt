I'm sorry
So sorry
I'm sorry
Please forgive me
I'm sorry
Je suis désolée


So sorry
Lo siento
I'm sorry
Perdóname

I've heard it all before

I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please, don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

You're not half the man you think you are
Save your words because you've gone too far
I've listened to your lies and all your stories (listened to your stories)
You're not half the man you'd like to be

I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please, don't say: Forgive me
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

Don't explain yourself 'cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak
You stayed because I made it so convenient
(Made it so convenient)
Don't explain yourself, you'll never see

I'm sorry
Gomen nasai
So sorry
Mujhe maaf kardo
I'm sorry
Sli'kha
Please forgive me

I'm sorry
Je suis désolée
So sorry
Lo siento
I'm sorry
Forgive me

Sorry, sorry, sorry
I've heard it all before

I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please, don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please, don't say: Forgive me
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

Don't explain yourself 'cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak

I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
