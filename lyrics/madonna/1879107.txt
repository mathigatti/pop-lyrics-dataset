Don't ask me to slow down
I don't wanna go down
You won't catch me lookin' back
Coz people like me don't live like that
I got dreams and I got plans
It's not what you understand
There's no bottom and no top
Coz people like me don't ever stop now


If you wanna catch up to me
You better run as fast as you can
If you wanna live up to me
You better show me that you're the man

Am I going too fast
Am I going too fast for you baby
Never gonna finish last
Am I going too fast for you baby
Mmm mmm mmm

I got dreams, I got plans
Why's it so hard to understand
There's no bottom and no top
Coz people like me don't ever stop now

If you wanna catch up to me
You better run as fast as you can
If you wanna live up to me
You better show me that you're the man

Am I going too fast
Am I going too fast for you baby
Never gonna finish last
Am I going too fast for you baby

Run run run, run for your life
I said
Run run run, but you better think twice

Am I going too fast
Am I going too fast for you baby
Never gonna finish last
Am I going too fast for you baby

Run run run, run for your life
I said
Run run run, but you better think twice
