Bells ringing inside my head
Now, I could ignore them
But I choose to live instead
So I take up into the sky
And the bells ringing
Gonna teach me how to fly


And I know that I'm alright
Cause I hear those bells ringing tonight
Yeah, I know that I'm alright
Cause I hear those bells ringing tonight

Well the earth's shaking
Underneath my feet
Now, I could run and hide
But I'd rather watch and see
How the world's changing
Before my very eyes
And the Earth shaking
Comes as no surpise

And I know that I'm alright
Cause I hear the Earth shaking tonight
Yeah, I know that I'm alright
Cause I hear the Earth shaking tonight

Ocean's roaring, miles away from me
Someone teach me how to swim
I'm gonna jump into the sea
Gonna go way down deep
Open up my eyes and see
How the Ocean's roaring
Gonna set me free

Ocean's roaring
Earth shaking
Bell's ringing tonight
(repeat)

Bells ringing, inside...
