Who is the master? Who is the slave?

Treat me like a curse
Then tell me I'm your saviour
I'm never with the stranger
I used to know so well
Waiting for your answer
Is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed
To this kind of hell?


Are you walking the dog?
'Cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control?
Is that dog walking you?
Haven't you had enough?
Now your time is up
Baby, show me your hand

Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me, what do they say?
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain

So you play madness like it's convenient
You do it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons, so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

First you say you love me
Then you want to leave me
Then you say you're sorry
You play the game so well
I bought your illusion
You're the greatest salesman
How could I refuse you
When you sold it to yourself?

Are you walking the dog?
'Cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control?
Is that dog walking you?
Haven't you had enough?
Now your time is up
Baby, show me your hand

Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me, what do they say?
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain

So you play madness like it's convenient
You do it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons, so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?
