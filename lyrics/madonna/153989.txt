(from Revelation 1:3)
Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy
And blessed are those who hear
And who keep what is written therein
For the time is near


(from Revelation 1:7)
He is coming with the clouds 
And every eye will see him
Everyone who pierced him
And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him

(from Revelation 2:1-4)
Those of you who have not learned what some call the deep things
of Satan
I know your works, I know your toil, and your patient endurance
And how you cannot hear evil men
But have tested those who call themselves apostles, but are not
And found them to be false
I know that you are enduring patiently and bearing out for my
namesake
And you have not grown weary
But I have this against you
That you have abandoned the love you had

(from Revelation 2:9-10)
I know your tribulation and your poverty
And the slander of those who say that they are Jews, but they
are not
They are a synagogue of Satan
Do not fear what you are about to suffer
Behold the devil is about to throw you into prison

Wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love
Hoping, praying for you to justify my love

(from Revelation 13:1-10)
And I saw a beast rising out of the sea with ten horns and seven
heads
And a blasphemous name upon its head
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard
Its feet were like a bear's
And its mouth was like a lion's mouth
And to it the dragon gave his power, and his throne, and great
authority
One of his heads had a mortal wound
But it seemed to have a mortal wound that was healed
And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder

Men worshipped the dragon for he had given his authority to the
beast 
And they worshipped the beast saying
"Who is like the beast and who can fight against the
beast?"
And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous
words
And it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous words against God

It was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer
And authority was given it over every tribe
And a people and tongue and nation
And all who dwell on earth could worship it in vain
If anyone has an ear let him hear
If anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go
If anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword

Wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love
Hoping

(from Revelation 21:1-8)
Then, I saw a new heaven and a new earth
And I heard a great voice from the throne saying:
"Behold the dwelling of God is with men
He will dwell with them, and they shall be his people
And God himself will be with them
He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
And death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore
For these things will have passed away

To the thirsty I will give water without price
From the fountain of the water of life
He who conquers shall have this heritage
And I will be his God and he shall be my son

But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolators, and all
liars
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and
brimstone."

(from Revelation 22:10-13)
And he said to me, he said to me:
"Do not seal up the words of the prophecy, for the time is
near
Let the evildoers still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy
And the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy
Behold, I am coming soon
I am the alpha and the omega
The first and the last
The beginning and the end."

Amen

What are you gonna do?
