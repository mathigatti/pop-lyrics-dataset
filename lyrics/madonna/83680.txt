(Children:)
Please, gentle Eva, will you bless a little child?
For I love you, tell Heaven I'm doing my best
I'm praying for you, even though you're already blessed


Please, mother Eva, will you look upon me as your own?
Make me special, be my angel
Be my everything wonderful perfect and true
And I'll try to be exactly like you

Please, holy Eva, will you feed a hungry child?
For I love you, tell Heaven I'm doing my best
I'm praying for you, even though you're already blessed

Please, mother Eva, will you feed a hungry child?
For I love you [(Che:) Turn a blind eye, Evita] Tell Heaven I'm
doing my best [(Che:) Turn a blind eye]
I'm praying for you, even though you're already blessed

(Workers:)
Santa Santa Evita
Madre de todos los ninos
De los tiranizados, de los descamisados
De los trabajadores, de la Argentina
