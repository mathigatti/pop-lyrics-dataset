Peron is everything, he is the soul, the nerve
The hope and the reality of the Argentine people
We all know that there is only one man in our movement
With his own source of light
We all feed from his light, and that is Peron

And now she wants to be Vice-President
That was the over-the-top, unacceptable suggestion
We didn't approve but we couldn't prevent
The games of the wife of the President
But to give her pretensions encouragement
She's out of her depth and out of the question
