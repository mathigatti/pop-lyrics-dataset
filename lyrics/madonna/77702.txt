(Evita, Evita, Evita)


It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still your love after all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

No llores por mi Argentina
Mi alma esta contigo
Mi vida entera, te la dedico
Mas no te alejes
Te necesito

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired

They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promise to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

No llores por mi Argentina
Mi alma esta contigo
Mi vida entera, te la dedico
Mas no te alejes

No llores por mi, Argentina
Jamas yo te he abandonado
Aunque en silencio, mi alma te grita
Hoy y por siempre
(Soy Argentina)

Soy Argentina

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

No llores por mi Argentina
Mi alma esta contigo
Mi vida entera, te la dedico
Mas no te alejes

No llores por mi, Argentina
Jamas yo te he abandonado
Aunque en silencio, mi alma te grita
Hoy y por siempre
(Soy Argentina)

Soy Argentina

No llores por mi
