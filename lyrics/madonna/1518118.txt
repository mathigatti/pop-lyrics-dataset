I think you wanna' come over, 
Yeah I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk or you sober?
Think about it, doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good then I say do it,
I don't know what you're waiting for


Feel my temperature rising
There's too much heat I'm gonna' lose control
Do you want to go higher, get closer to the fire,
I don't know what you're waiting for

Come join the party, yeah
Coz' everybody just won't do.
Let's get this started, yeah
Coz' everybody wants to party with you.

Boy you got a reputation, 
But you're gonna' have to prove it
I see a little hesitation,
Am I gonna' have to show you that
If it feels right, get on your marks
Step to the beat boy that's what it's for

Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside
But for now just come here, 
Let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance tonight

Come join the party 
It's a celebration
Anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
Coz' everybody wants to party with you

Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You look familiar?
You wanna' dance? Yeah.
I guess I just don't recognize you with your cloths on?
What are you waiting for?

Come join the party 
It's a celebration
Anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
Coz' everybody wants to party with you

Come join the party 
It's a celebration
Anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
Coz' everybody wants to party with you
