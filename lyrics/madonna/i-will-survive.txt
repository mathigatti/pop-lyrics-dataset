I am a woman and it makes me feel sad
I am a woman and I know I should be glad
I will fight back till I'm burned at the stake
Break all my bones but my spirit won't take
I am a woman and you can make me cry
But I will survive and my spirit won't die


God gave me this life
And he gave me a voice
I am a woman and I have a choice
And I choose to survive
