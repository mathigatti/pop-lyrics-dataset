If you wanna talk to me
That's exactly what you're gonna have to do
Talk to me


When we first met you had a lot to give
I said: If I was in your shoes I could not lose
But now, baby, I just don't know
I'm so confused, all this abuse is strange
'Cause you don't act like my friend and
I can't pretend I don't want this to end
My daddy said
My momma said
My sisters say
My heart says

Lose your attitude - ring my bell
Say you're sorry - ring my bell
Got something for me - ring my bell
Then you can ring my bell
Show some gratitude - ring my bell
Something nice to say - ring my bell
You appreciate - ring my bell
Then you can ring my bell

You, you really have some nerve (get it)
Playing stupid games, calling me names
And but now you ought to eat those words
Once you attack you can't take it back, it's strange
I guess off your high horse you're falling
You're calling and calling
I don't understand at all (c'mon)
My daddy said (what?)
My momma said (huh?)
My sisters say (wha'd' they say?)
My heart says

Lose your attitude - ring my bell
Say you're sorry - ring my bell
Got something for me - ring my bell
Then you can ring my bell
Show some gratitude - ring my bell
Something nice to say - ring my bell
You appreciate - ring my bell
Then you can ring my bell

Ring my, ring my bell - you can't
Ring my, ring my bell - you can't
Ring my, ring my bell - my bell
Ring my bell

When you look in the mirror 'don't know what you see
Life's not the same until you're in pain
I know it's just no good to hate
I don't want to say it might be too late for you
I'm not answering your phone call
Babe if you want more you come to my front door (c'mon)
My daddy said (what?)
My momma said (huh?)
My sisters say (wha'd' they say?)
My heart says
