I want you to know one thing
You know how this is


If I look at the crystal moon
At the red branch of the slow autumn at my window
If I touch near the fire the impalpable ash or the wrinkled body
Of the log
Everything carries me to you
As if everything that exists - aromas, light, metals
Were little boats that sail toward those isles of yours that
Wait for me

Well, now
If little by little you stop loving me
I shall stop loving you
Little by little
If suddenly you forget me
Do not look for me
For I shall already have forgotten you

If you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes
Through my life
And you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I
Have roots
Remember
That on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my arms
And my roots will set off to seek another land

But, if each day, each hour, you feel that you are destined for
Me
With implacable sweetness
If each day a flower climbs up to your lips to seek me
Ahh, my love, ahh, my own, in me all that fire is repeated
In me nothing is extinguished or forgotten
My love feeds on your love, beloved
And as long as you live
It will be in your arms without leaving mine
