Never forget who you are 
Little star 
Never forget how to dream 
Butterfly 


God gave a present to me 
Made of flesh and bones 
My life, my soul 
You make my spirit whole 

Never forget who you are 
Little star 
Shining brighter than all the stars in the sky 
Never forget how to dream 
Butterfly 
Never forget where you come from 
From love 

You are a treasure to me 
You are my star 
You breathe new life 
Into my broken heart 

Never forget who you are 
Little star 
Never forget how to dream 
Butterfly 

May the angels protect you 
And sadness forget you 
Little star 

There's no reason to weep 
Lay your head down to sleep 
Little star 

May goodness surround you 
My love I have found you 
Little star 

Shining bright 

You breathe new life 
Into my broken heart 

Never forget who you are 
(Whispered:) Little star 
Shining brighter than all the stars in the sky 
Never forget how to dream 
Butterfly 
Flying higher than all the birds in the sky 

Never forget who you are 
Little star 
Never forget where you come from 
From love 

Little star 
Little star 
(Whispered:) Little star 
From love
