Young velvet porcelain boy 
Devour me when you're with me 
Blue wish window seas 
Speak delicious fires 


I'm your candy perfume girl 
Your candy perfume girl 

Moist warm desire 
Fly to me 

I'm your candy perfume girl 
Your candy perfume girl 
I'm your candy perfume girl 
Candy, candy 

Rush me ghost you see 
Every center my home 
Fever steam girl 
Throb the oceans 

Your candy perfume girl 
Your candy perfume girl 
Your candy perfume girl 
Candy perfume girl 

Did I lie to you? 
Candy perfume girl 
Did I lie to you? 
Magic poison 

You're a candy perfume boy 
A candy perfume boy 
You're a candy perfume boy 
You're candy 

Candy perfume girl 

The sacred nerve is magic poison 
It's candy, it's candy 

I'm your candy perfume girl 
I'm your candy perfume girl 
Boy, girl, boy, girl, boy 
Candy
