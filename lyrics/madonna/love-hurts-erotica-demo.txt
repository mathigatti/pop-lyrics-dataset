My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'll be your loved one darling
Turn off the light


I'll be your sorceress, your heart's magician
I'm not a witch, I'm a love technician
I'll be a guiding light in your darkest hour
I'm gonna change your life, I'm like a poison flower

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love
I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love
I'll teach you how to... ooh

Love hurts, love hurts
Do you remember the time
Love hurts, love hurts
When we fell in love

Close your eyes, don't be scared
Let's put the blindfolds on, let's see what's under there
I have a special chair, it has a special strap
And there's a special hook, it's called my special trap

Because you're bad, you're gonna get it good
Bow down to lick my boots
Because you know you should

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love
I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love
I'll teach you how to

Love hurts, love hurts
Do you remember the time
Love hurts, love hurts
When we fell in love

We could use the cage
I've got a lot of rope
I'm not full of rage
I'm full of hope

This is not a crime and you're not on trial
Bend over baby, I'm gonna make you smile
I'll light the candles, 'til they're nice and soft
And when they start to drip, I'm gonna get you off

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love
I'll hit you like a (...) truck
I'll give you love
I'll teach you how to

Love hurts, love hurts
Do you remember the time
Love hurts, love hurts
When we fell in love

Love hurts, love hurts
Do you remember the time
Love hurts, love hurts
When we fell in Love
