I should have seen the sign way back then
When she told me that you were her best friend
And now she's rolling, rolling, rolling
And you were stolen, stolen, stolen


She started dressing like me and talking like me
It freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night
What's that about?

I just want to be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast and love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment, 'cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same, it won't be the same

I should have seen the sign when you were here
Under a different light, it's all so clear
She was stealing, stealing, stealing
And now you're feeling, feeling, feeling

She started dyeing her hair
And wearing the same perfume as me
She started reading my books
And stealing my looks and lingerie

I just want to be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast and love you in the shower
The thrill is momentary, 'cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same, it won't be the same

She is licking her lips
And she's batting her eyes
She's not me

She's got legs up to there
And such beautiful hair
She's not me

Oh, devoted for life
Make a beautiful wife
She's not me

If you spend some more time
I guarantee you will find
She's not me
I know I can do it better

If someone wants to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make up all the things you lack
You're gonna have to watch it

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same, it won't be the same

Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me, and she never will be

Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me, and she never will be

Got a funny way of showing your feelings
I guess it was some bullshit saying you love me, love me
Guess my expectation hit the ceiling
When it come back it would just trust me, trust me
Wendy

She's not me
She's not me
She's not me, and she never will be

She's not me
She's not me
She's not me, and she never will be

She never will be
Never will be
Never will be
Never will be

Never will be
Never will be
Never will be

Never will be
Never will be
Never will be

Never will be
Never will be
Never will be

She's not me and never will be
Never will be
Never will be
Never will be

She's not me
Never will be
Never will be
Never will be

She's not me, and she never will be
