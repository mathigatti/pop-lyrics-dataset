Mmmmm... Hey little girl, when you grow up
Don't make the same mistakes I did
Learn to say no, I've had enough
Then nothing and no one can harm you


Follow your heart
And you'll be fine
Follow your dreams
And take all of the time that you need

Little girl never look back
Don't let your memories haunt you
Learn to be strong
All on your own
Make sure you get what you wanted

Follow your heart
And you'll be fine
Follow your dreams
And take all of the time that you need

Little queen, wearing your crown
Leave all your sadness behind you
Don't waste your time, suffering fools
One day prince charming will find you

Mmmmmm... Hey little girl, when you grow up
Don't make the same mistakes I did
Learn to say no, I've had enough
Then nothing and no one can hurt you

Follow your heart
And you'll be fine
Follow your dreams
And take all of the time that you need
