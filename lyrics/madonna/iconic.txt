I'm the best the world has ever seen
(I'm the best ever!)
I'm somebody you'll never forget
Cause I work hard and sweat in my tears
(Can't be stopped!)
I'm never falling again and if I did, I'd come back


[Madonna]
If you try and fail, get up again
Destiny will choose you in the end
If you don't make the choice
And you don't use your voice
Someone else will speak for you instead

What you want is just within your reach
But you gotta practice what you preach
You pay with sweat and tears
And overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

I can't, icon - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are, who you are

Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

Iconic

Ironic

Tell me I'm no good and I'll be great
Say I have to fight and I can't wait
Standing in the wings
A butterfly that stings
I will rise above cuz it's my fate

I can't, icon - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are, who you are

Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

Born to be a superstar
That's exactly what you are
Born to be a superstar
That's exactly what you are

[Chance The Rapper]
Alright
Firefly change when they catch ya
Wanna put ya in their net for their light glow
Yellow brick highway
Paparazzi piled up on the high road
They just turned the Sun into an idol
They just want to see how high the sky go
Just to find how it feel to fall back
Madonna said I remind her of Michael

Steady blowin' up my head
Blowin' up my head
Put it on your wall
Put me in the school book
Put me in your laws
Put me in the desk
And in the synagogues

Firefly glow when they catch ya
Wanna catch ya when ya lights go dim
Wanna turn you to a letter in their logo
Wanna stick you in a jar with a pen
You an icon

[Madonna]
I can't, icon - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are, who you are

Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be
