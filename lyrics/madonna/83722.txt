Bitch

You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
How many licks does it take?
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
Which leg do you want me to break? You'll be sorry


Here she comes, little miss
Thinks she can have what she wants in a blink of an eye
Here she comes, acts like she's your best friend
Then you turn your back and she's off with your guy

She's a thief of hearts
What will happen to the thief of hearts?
What she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts, someone please arrest her
She's a thief of hearts, no one ever takes what's mine

And gets away with it
Not this time

Here she comes, acting all dejected
So you give advice and she gives you her poison
Here she comes, Little Miss Black Widow
First she spins her web and she's stealing your boyfriend

She's a thief of hearts
What will happen to the thief of hearts?
What she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts, someone please arrest her
She's a thief of hearts, no one ever takes what's mine

Thief of hearts, bitch

You'll do it, you'll take it, you'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it, you're over, you can't take it
You'll do it, you'll take it, you'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it, you're over, you can't take it

You can't take it, not what's mine
I could break you, 'cause what you've done is a crime
Bitch, he's mine

Here she comes, little miss
Thinks she can have his child, well, anybody can do it
Here she comes, little Susie ho-maker
Thinks she'll get respect if she screws it

And she's a thief of hearts
What will happen to the thief of hearts?
What she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts, someone please arrest her
She's a thief of hearts, no one ever takes what's mine

Bitch, you'll do it, you'll take it, you'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it, you're over, you can't take it
You'll do it, you'll take it, you'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it, you're over, you can't take it

You can't take it, not what's mine
You'll be sorry, 'cause what you've done is a crime

She's a thief of hearts
Thief of hearts, what she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Thief of hearts, no one ever takes what's mine

She's a thief, thief, she's a thief
Thief of hearts, no one ever takes what's mine

You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
How many licks does it take?
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
Which leg do you want me to break?

Stop, bitch
Now sit your ass down
