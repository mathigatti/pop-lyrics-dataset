I spent all night waiting up
It's gonna be the last night I wait up for you
Spent a long time wakin' up
Used to think that I was not enough for you
Now I see that I'm just way too much
You got your hands full, I'm misunderstood
Now I see that I'm who I can trust
And you got a lot of room, you tryin' to make it good


But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Say now if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on trying to do it, baby
I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me cray-ay-ay-ay-zy
And I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me por tão lo-o-o-ouca
Você não vai me por tão louca

I bent my knees for you like a prayer
My God, look at me now
Pill off my weakness layer after layer
Nothing left for me to keep 'round
I'm a force that I won't tame, babe
Can't go through this and stay the same, babe
I've seen a lot of stranger things, babe
And I'll never look at you the same

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Say now if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on trying to do it, baby
I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy
And I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me por tão lo-o-o-ouca
Você não vai me por tão louca

Eu te amo
Mas não deixo você me destruir
I put you on a pedestal with statues, they can fall
Felt so safe, I let you drive me straight into the war
Paid the hell you dealt me, thought you felt me
Was never good at games, now I'll just forget your name

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Say now if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on trying to do it, baby
I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me cray-ay-ay-ay-zy
And I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me por tão lo-o-o-ouca
Você não vai me por tão louca
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy

Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me cray-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy
And I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me por tão lo-o-o-ouca
Você não vai me por tão louca
