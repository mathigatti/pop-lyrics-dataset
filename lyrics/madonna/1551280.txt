I traded fame for love without a second thought
It all became a silly game, some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for, wanted it so badly
And running, rushing back for more, I suffered fools so gladly
And now I found I changed my mind
I found a new religion


Face of truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love

I travelled around the world looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms feeling so alone
I have had so many lovers who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt fulfilled
And now I found I changed my mind
I found a new religion

Face of truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love

I had a change of heart
I want a brand new start
No venus faces, far off places, trinkets I can't buy
No handsome stranger, heavy danger, drugs that I ain't tried
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal, no laughter in the dark
No one night stand, no far off land, no fire that I can't start

Face of truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
My substitute for love
