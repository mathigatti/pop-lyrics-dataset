Anytime is not over now,
So what are you waiting for?
Why wait for someone to show you how?
They may want that you want more


No boundaries, no limits
If there's excitement, then I'm in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me

Give me a record, I'll break it
Give me a chance to go and I'll take it
No beginning, no ending,
On and on

Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on and on,
On and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on and on,
On and on

Infinity, Infinity,
Infinity, Infinity,
Infinity,
On and on
(repeat)

They say if is never less
What goes up is gonna happy before
But if you catch too much what people say
and it wouldn't amount to much at all

No boundaries, no limits
If there's excitement, then I'm in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me

Give me a record, I'll break it
Give me a chance to go and I'll take it
No beginning, no ending
On and on

Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on and on,
On and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on and on,
On and on

Infinity, Infinity,
Infinity, Infinity,
Infinity,
On and on
(repeat)
