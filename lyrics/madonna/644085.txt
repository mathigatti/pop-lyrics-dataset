Get out of bed and you look in the mirror
And the hate in your head doesn't get any clearer
The boss man says:"You gonna lose your job,
You gonna lose your pay if you're late", late


And then the weather man says:
"It's gonna be sunny", and it starts to rain
And you don't think it's funny
So you visit your friend, but there's no one home
And you don't have a dime
And you can't even call her on the phone

So get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

Your stomach's so empty and you need some food
So you distract yourself, but it just doesn't do any good

You think about going home, but it can't be the same
Cause they'll never change they don't wanna know
About the "sin" in you, and the wasting of time
They wanna grab your hair and pull you in line

So get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

Pick yourself off the ground no one can push you around
Don't let it get you down, you get up
Pick yourself off the ground no one can push you around
Don't let it get you down, you get up
Pick yourself off the ground no one can push you around
Don't let it get you down, you get up
Pick yourself off the ground no one can push you around
Don't let it get you down, you get up

So get up, up...

Another day goes by and you look in the mirror
And the hate in your head is a little bit clearer
And you realize, that all those silly things
That used to get you down
Were just a test to see if you could get up

So get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

Pick yourself off the ground no one can push you around, you get up
Pick yourself off the ground no one can push you around, you get up, up...

So get up (Pick yourself off the ground)
Get up (Pick yourself off the ground)
Get up (Pick yourself off the ground, get up)

Get up (Pick yourself off the ground)
Get up (Pick yourself off the ground)
Get up (Pick yourself off the ground)
Get up (Pick yourself off the ground, get up)
