Us kids don't know what we're talking about
That we're too young to understand how the government works
We call BS!

I'm going through it
Yeah, I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it
I can't break down now
I can't take that now

Died a thousand times
Managed to survive
I can't break down now
I can't take that (I can't take that)

I rise
I rise
I rise up above it, up above it
I rise
I rise
I rise
Up above it all

There's nothing you can do to me that hasn't been done
Not bulletproof, shouldn't have to run from a gun
River of tears ran dry, let 'em run
No game that you can play with me, I ain't one

'Cause I'm going through it
Yeah, I know you see the tragic in it (alright)
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it
I can't break down now
I can't take that now (I can't take that)

Died a thousand times
Managed to survive (I managed to survive)
I can't break down now
I can't take that (I can't take that)

(Rise)
I rise (I rise)
I rise (rise)
I rise up above it, up above it (rise)
I rise (I rise)
I rise (rise)
I rise
Up above it all
I managed to survive

Freedom's what you choose to do with what's been done to you
No one can hurt you now unless you want them to (unless you want)
No one can hurt you now unless you love 'em too (BS!)
Unless you love 'em too

'Cause I'm going through it
Yeah, I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it (magic in it)
I can't break down now
I can't take that (I can't take that)

(Rise)
I rise (I rise)
I rise (rise)
I rise up above it, up above it (rise)
I rise (rise; gonna rise up)
I rise (rise; gonna get up)
I rise
Up above it all

Yeah, we gonna rise up
Yeah, we gonna rise up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yes, we can
We can get it together
We'll rise up, we can get it together

Yeah, we gonna rise up
Yeah, we gonna rise up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yes, we can
We can get it together
We'll rise up, we can get it together
