Without a sound I took her down 
and dressed in red and blue I squeezed 
Imaginary wedding gown 
That you can't wear in front of me 
A kiss goodbye, your twisted shell 
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet 
Lets say goodbye, the hundreth time 
And then tomorrow we'll do it again 


I dragged her down I put her out 
And back there I left her where no one could see 
And lifeless cold into this well 
I stared as this moment was held for me 
A kiss goodbye, your twisted shell 
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet 
Lets say goodbye, the hundreth time 
And then tomorrow we'll do it again
