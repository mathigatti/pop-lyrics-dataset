Land of the free
(uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)


I looked all around the world
Nobody has it better than we do
One thing i don't understand
Why don't we help more people
Cause we can

(uh huh, uh huh)

Why are we separated?
Defined by our greed and hatred
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting
Why aren't we all together
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

(uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)

How many tragedies
Will we see before we come together
(uh huh)
It's easy to forget
We have the power to make things better
(uh huh, uh huh)

I have a dream
But dreams are not for free
We all need to change
Or just repeat history

Why are we separated?
Defined by our greed and hatred
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting
Why aren't we all together
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

Just repeat history (repeat several times)
