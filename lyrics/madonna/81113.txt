It's your honesty
With you I have no choice
When you talk to me
I could make love to your voice
It's the things I see
When I look into your eyes
It's your honesty 
Pulling me closer to you baby
You know you drive me crazy


You are one of a kind
And I want you to be mine, oh mine
Pulling me closer to you
You have a special quality
You're bringing out the best in me
You have a special quality
You are pulling me closer to you

It's your honesty 
With you I have no choice
When you talk to me
I could make love to your voice
It's the things I see
When I look into your eyes
It's your honesty
Pulling me closer to you baby
You know it just gets better

This is the way it should be
You know the truth will set you free, so free
Pulling me closer to you
You have a special quality
You're bringing out the best in me
You have a special quality
You are pulling me closer to you

It's your honesty 
With you I have no choice
When you talk to me 
I could make love to your voice
It's the things I see 
when I look into your eyes
It's your honesty 
Pulling me closer to you baby 

Keeping touch my little body 
Embrasse moi mon amour
pour ce soir, pour toujours
Keeping touch my little body
dis-moi la vérite
oui je sais toujours 

You have a special quality 
You're bringing out the very best in me 
You have a special quality 
You are pulling me closer to you…
Honesty
