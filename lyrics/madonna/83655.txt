Chorus:

Was it just a dream?
Did I feel your devotion?
Dreams are never what they seem
Did we just go through the motions?


I keep your photograph by my bed to remind me
That I was part of your life
I say my prayers to the sandman
That he'll find me fast asleep

Sleep has always been kind
And in my dreams you'll always be mine
But in the morning when I wake
I remember that my heart does ache

(chorus, repeat)

I admit that I did my bit to deceive you
But sometimes I was afraid
That this day would come
How could you just leave me all alone now

I have always been strong
So I know that I can go on
But right now I feel so dead inside
Oh sleep come to me, cause that's where I hide

(chorus, repeat)

All that I have, all I ask
All my dreams, they fade so fast
Don't wake me up, not today
All my dreams will fade away

And I want him, and I need him
I can't live and I'd die just to see him
Just to feel his hands on my face
Smell his skin, and his warm embrace
Cause it's all that I have
And it's fading so fast

Mmmm, mmmm
Uh, uh huh

Now I have always been strong
So I know that I can go on
But right now I feel so dead inside
Oh sleep come to me, cause that's where I hide

(chorus, repeat)

All that I have, all that I ask
All my dreams, they fade so fast
Don't wake me up, not today
All my dreams will fade away

[Was it just a dream?]
And I want him, and I need him
I can't live and I'd die just to see him
Don't wake me up, not today
All my dreams will fade away

[Was it just a dream?]
All that I have, all that I ask
All my dreams, they fade so fast
Don't wake me up, not today
All my dreams will fade away
