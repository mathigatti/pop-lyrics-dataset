I tried to change but I couldn't help myself
I am to blame, I used to be someone else
No one got through, nothing came inside the gate
You made me feel when my heart was set on hate


I convinced myself that I was invincible
But I didn't know that feelings can lie too
You exposed my deepest wound, but I felt so safe
Didn't know that you had never loved me

Every time you say good-bye
It feels like the end of the world
Every time I start to cry
I feel like the most tragic girl

You were so good at pretending that you care
I was alone, even with you standing there
You made me doubt everyone that cared for me
I shut them out so that you'd be all I see

I convinced myself that I was invincible
But I didn't know that feelings can lie too
You exposed my deepest wound, but I felt so safe
Didn't know that you had never loved me

Every time you say good-bye
It feels like the end of the world
Every time I start to cry
I feel like the most tragic girl

Every time you say good-bye
It feels like the end of the world
Every time I start to cry
I feel like the most tragic girl
