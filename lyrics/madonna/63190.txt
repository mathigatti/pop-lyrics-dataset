(What you looking at?)

Strike a pose
Strike a pose
(Vogue, vogue, vogue)
(Vogue, vogue, vogue)


Look around
Everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go
(Look around)

You try
Everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know
(Life that you know)

When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called dance floor
And here's what it's for, so

Come on, vogue (vogue)
Let your body move to the music
(Move to the music) hey, hey, hey

Come on, vogue (vogue)
Let your body go with the flow
You know you can do it (go with the flow)

All you need is your own imagination
So use it, that's what it's for
(That's what it's for)

Go inside for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door
(Open up the door)

It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping, it will give you new life
You're a superstar
Yes, that's what you are, you know it

Come on, vogue (vogue)
Let your body groove to the music
(Groove to the music) hey, hey, hey

Come on, vogue (vogue)
Let your body go with the flow
You know you can do it (go with the flow)

Beauty's where you find it
Not just where you bump and grind it
Soul is in the musical
That's where I feel so beautiful
Magical
Life's a ball, so get up on the dance floor

Come on, vogue (vogue)
Let your body move to the music
(Move to the music) hey, hey, hey

Come on, vogue (vogue)
Let your body go with the flow
You know you can do it (go with the flow)

Vogue (vogue)
Beauty's where you find it
(Move to the music)

Vogue (vogue)
Beauty's where you find it
(Go with the flow)

Let your body move to the music
Ooh, you've got to just
Let your body go with the flow
Ooh, you've got to
