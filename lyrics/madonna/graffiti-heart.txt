If graffiti on the wall changed
Anything at all
Then it would be illegal
If scars could go away
What would your body say
Don't ever hide your feelings


Oh, oh, oh
Don't ever try to take my freedom
Oh, oh, oh
Your imperfections, this world needs them
Whadya got, show me your basquiat
He didn't keep it all to himself
Even with Keith
Out on the street he died
Fighting so you can do it as well

Love is pain and pain is art
Show me your graffiti heart
Love is pain and pain is art
Show me your graffiti heart

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Frida showed her feelings
Painting from the ceiling
Back in the beginning
Nothing's what it seems
She didn't paint her dreams
Just do her own reality

Oh, oh, oh
Don't ever try to take our freedom
Oh, oh, oh
Your imperfections, this world needs them

Whadya got, show me your basquiat
He didn't keep it all to himself
Even with Keith
Out on the street he died
Fighting so you can do it as well
Love is pain and pain is art
Show me your graffiti heart
Love is pain and pain is art
Show me your graffiti heart

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

If graffiti on the wall changed
Anything at all
Then it would be illegal
