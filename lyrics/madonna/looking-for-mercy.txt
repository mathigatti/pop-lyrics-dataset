Every night before I close my eyes
I say a little prayer that you'll have mercy on me
Please dear God, to live inside the divine
Not like I want to die
Teach me to forgive myself, outlive this hell


Is it really love if it hurts?
Is it really pain if it’s inside?
On the outside I'm strong
Hold my hand, please sympathize
Hard enough tryna forgive
Hard enough tryna live
Please don't criticize (yeah)
Please, please sympathize (yeah)

Somebody to teach me to love
Somebody to help me rise above
I need to survive
I’m looking for
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
I'm looking for, I'm looking for love
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
I'm looking for, I'm looking for mercy

Every night before I close my eyes
I say a little prayer that you'll have mercy on me
Please dear God, to live inside the divine
Not like I want to die
Teach me to forgive myself, outlive this hell

Is it really faith if I'm weak?
Can you tell the truth when you live lies?
I'm just looking for the signs
Hold my hand, please sympathize
Hard enough tryna forgive
Hard enough tryna live
Flawed, flawed by design (yeah)
Please, please sympathize

Somebody to teach me to love
Somebody to help me rise above
I need to survive
I’m looking for (looking for, looking for, looking for, looking for mercy)
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
I’m looking for, I'm looking for love
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
I’m looking for, I'm looking for mercy

Somebody to teach me to love
Somebody to help me rise above
I need to survive
I'm looking for
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
I'm looking for, I’m looking for love
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
I'm looking for, I'm looking for mercy
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
I'm looking for, I'm looking for love
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
Looking for, looking for, looking for mercy
I'm looking for, I'm looking for mercy
