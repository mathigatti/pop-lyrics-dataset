You've been sanctified
And I've been tried
Guilty by association


You've been canonized
And I've been fried
Guilty by association

All the little loonies
With a salient obsession
Come out from the boonies
With their sharpies and their guns
And we're loaded with questions

Guilty by association
Guilty by association

You've been idolized
And I've been tried
(Spoken:) [I've been tried]
Guilty by association

You've been terrorized
And I've been fried
Guilty by association

All the little loonies
With a salient obsession
Come out from the boonies
With their sharpies and their guns
They're all loaded with questions

Loaded with questions
