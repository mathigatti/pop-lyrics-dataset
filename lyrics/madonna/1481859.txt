My love's a revolver
My love's a revolver


Oops, I guess I shot ya
My finger's on the trigger
I had a bullet with your name on it
Click-click

I'm a sex pistol
My love should be illegal
Real deal, baby
I'm no counterfeit
Click-click

Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
E-o-e-o
My body's fully loaded
And I've got more ammo

Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
E-o-e-o
You're an accessory to murder, 'coz

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?

You've been hit by a smooth criminal
A bad girl I gotcha crying to your mama
Saying I cant believe it

I've seen your type bring a knife into a gun fight
Caught up in the law right
I think I'm in love aye

Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
E-o-e-o

I let it bang bang

I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang

Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?

I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang

I line 'em up and watch them fall

Bang.
Tha shooting name is wayne
The victim didn't complain she just screamed shoot again.
I gave her extra rounds. My barrel twist around.
I am Mr. shoot 'em down. I leave hearts on tha ground.
My love-using weapon. And yes I use it well.
Then I let the rose petals cover up the bullet shells.
I never shoot and tell. I only shoot to kill.
And the vest ain't gonna help it even if you're laying still

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer

I line 'em up and watch them fall

I shoot 'em bang bang
