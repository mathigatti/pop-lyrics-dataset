(Che:)
Goodnight and thank you Huevo
She is in every magazine
Been photographed, seen, she is known
We don't like to rush, but your case has been packed
If she's missed anything, you could give her a ring
But she won't always answer the phone 


(Eva:)
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But we have pretended enough
It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves

(Che:)
Which means ...

Chorus:

(Che and Eva:)
There is noone, noone at all
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female
Who hasn't an eye on, in fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don't blame them, you're the same

(Che:)
Goodnight and thank you Emilio
You've completed your task
What more can we ask of you now?
Please sign the book on the way out the door
And that will be all, if she needs you she'll call
But I don't think that's likely somehow

(Eva:)
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But when we were hot, we were hot
I know you'll look back on the good times we've shared
Which means ...

(chorus, substituting "blame her" for "blame
them", sung only by Che)

(Eva:)
There is no soap, no soap like Zaz
No detergent, lotion, or oil with such power in the shower
It's the mother and father of luxury lather
The talk of the bath, the great ointment
One little frolic with new Zaz carbolic
You're scented, you'll be sent

(Che:)
Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon
We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio
We'll think of you every time she's on the air
We'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way
So do up your trousers and go

(Eva:)
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
The decline into silence and doubt
Our passion was just too intense to survive

(Che:)
Which means ...

(Lovers:)
This is a club I should never have joined
Someone has made us look fools
Argentine men call the sexual shots
Someone has altered the rules

(Eva:)
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes
Is all very well but every girl knows

(Che:)
She needs a man she can monopolize
With fingers in dozens of different pies

(Lovers:)
