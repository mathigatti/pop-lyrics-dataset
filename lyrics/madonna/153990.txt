Verse:

Won't you come inside, and lay down next to my fire
Can you feel my heartbeat, let me show you my desire
First you have to tell me please, uh huh
Gonna bring you to your knees, uh huh
Gonna make you scream for more
Come inside and lock the door
And let down, let down
Let down your guard


Chorus:

Ahh, ah oww, come inside
Ahh, ah oww, baby it's all right [it's all right]
Ahh, ah oww, come inside
Ahh, ah oww, baby it's all right [it's all right]

This is not a one-night stand
I care for you, please understand
Baby won't you come inside
I'll take you for a little ride

I wanna touch you there, uh huh
Run my fingers through your hair, uh huh
Gonna take you for a ride
But you have to come inside
And let down, let down
Let down your guard

(chorus)

Ahh, ah oww
Ahh, ah oww [it's all right]
Ahh, ah oww
Ahh, ah oww [it's all right, it's all right, it's all right]

(verse)
(chorus)

Ahh, ah oow, cause I wanna touch you there
Ahh, ah oww, run my fingers through your hair
Ahh, ah oww, gonna take you for a ride
But you have to come inside
And let down
Let down your guard

Ahh [it's all right], ah oww, first you have to tell me please,
uh huh
Gonna bring you to your knees, [it's all right], uh huh
Gonna make you scream for more
Come inside and lock the door
And let down
Let down your guard [it's all right]
