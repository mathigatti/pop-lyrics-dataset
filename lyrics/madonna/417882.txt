Without a sound I took her down 
and dressed in red and blue I squeezed 
Imaginary wedding gown 
That you can't wear in front of me 
A kiss goodbye, your twisted shell 
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet 
Lets say goodbye, the hundreth time 
And then tomorrow we'll do it again 


I dragged her down I put her out 
And back there I left her where no one could see 
And lifeless cold into this well 
I stared as this moment was held for me 
A kiss goodbye, your twisted shell 
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet 
Lets say goodbye, the hundreth time 
And then tomorrow we'll do it again 

I never thought it'd be this way 
Just me and you, we're here alone 
And if you stay, all I'm asking for is 
A thousand bodies piled up 
I never thought would be enough 
To show you just what I've been thinking 

And I'll keep on making more 
Just to prove that I adore 
Every inch of sanity 
All I'm asking for is, all I'm asking for is 

These hands stained red

From the times that I've killed you and then 
We can wash down this engagement ring 
With poison and kerosene 
We'll laugh as we die 
And we'll celebrate the end of things 
With cheap champagne 

Without, without a sound 
And I wish you away
