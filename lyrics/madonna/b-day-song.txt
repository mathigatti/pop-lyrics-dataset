And the beat goes on
I'm a happy girl
It's my birthday song
In my happy world


I know it's gonna be a good day
oh, yeah, today is my birthday

Huh!

And the beat goes on
(And the beat goes on)
I'm a happy girl
(I'm a happy girl)
It's my birthday song
(oh, yeah, it's my birthday)
In my happy world
(In my happy world)

Light my candles
Gotta make a wish
Wrap up the present
And seal it with a kiss

Give me a spanking
Start the day off right (ooh wee!)
Cause it's my day
You're gonna sing my song tonight

And the beat goes on
(And the beat goes on)
I'm a happy girl
(I'm a happy girl)
It's my birthday song
(oh, yeah, it's my birthday)
In my happy world
(In my happy world)

I know it's gonna be a good day
oh, yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl (I'm a happy girl)

My type of party there's no hangover
So grab your things you better come over
We get high and we still stay sober
We throw it down
And then we gonna start over
My type of party there's no hangover

And the beat goes on
(And the beat goes on)
I'm a happy girl
(I'm a happy girl)
It's my birthday song
(oh, yeah, it's my birthday)

In my happy world
(In my happy world)

I want a diamond
Don't give me a fake (that's what I said)
Then I'll let you lick
The frosting off my cake (yeah)

Give me a spanking
Start the day off right (woo-oo!)
Cause it's my birthday
You'll be singing my song tonight

And the beat goes on
(Na na na na, na na na na na na)
I'm a happy girl
(Na na na na, na na na na na na)
It's my birthday song
(Na na na na, na na na na na na)
In my happy world
(Na na na na, na na na na na na)

I know it's gonna be a good day
oh, yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl
In my happy world

I know it's gonna be a good day
oh, yeah, today is my birthday
I'm a happy girl

(It's my birthday everyday!)

(Na na na na, na na na na na na)
You'll be singing my song tonight
(Na na na na, na na na na na na)
You'll be singing my song tonight

(Na na na na, na na na na na na)
You'll be singing my song tonight
(Na na na na, na na na na na na)
You'll be singing my song tonight
