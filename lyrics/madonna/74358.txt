He's a pretender, he knows just what to say
He's a pretender, yeah, you meet him every day
He's a pretender, that fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love


It was so strange the way he held my hand
I wanted more than just a one night stand
He had a way of making me believe
That he was mine and that he'd never leave

I know that I should take my friend's advice
'Cause if it happened once, you know it happens twice
If there's a chance then I know I've got to try
I'll make him dance with me, I'll make him tell me why
He's a pretender
He's a pretender

I'm not afraid to fall a hundred times
And I'll believe in all your silly lies
I'd like to think that I could change your mind
Don't say that I am blind, I know all about your kind

He's a pretender, yeah, you meet him every day
He's a pretender, that fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

I like the way he moved across the floor
And when he danced with me I knew he wanted more
But in the dark, things happened much too fast
I should've stopped him then, I knew it wouldn't last

I know that I should take my friend's advice
'Cause if it happened once, you know it happens twice
If there's a chance then I know I've got to try
I'll make him dance with me, I'll make him tell me why
He's a pretender
He's a pretender

I'm not afraid to fall a hundred times
And I'll believe in all your silly lies
I'd like to think that I could change your mind
Don't say that I am blind, I know all about your kind

He's a pretender, yeah, you meet him every day
He's a pretender, that fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love
