[And I'm not sorry]
[It's human nature]
[And I'm not sorry]
[It's human nature]


And I'm not sorry [I'm not sorry]
It's human nature [It's human nature]
And I'm not sorry [I'm not sorry]
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me [it's human nature]

You wouldn't let me say the words I longed to say
You didn't want to see life through my eyes
[Express yourself, don't repress yourself]
You tried to shove me back inside your narrow room
And silence me with bitterness and lies
[Express yourself, don't repress your self]

Did I say something wrong?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
[I musta been crazy]
Did I stay too long?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't speak my mind
[What was I thinking]

And I'm not sorry [I'm not sorry]
It's human nature [It's human nature]
And I'm not sorry [I'm not sorry]
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me [it's human nature]

You punished me for telling you my fantasies
I'm breakin' all the rules I didn't make
[Express yourself, don't repress yourself]
You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
[Express yourself, don't repress yourself]

Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know you couldn't talk about sex
[I musta been crazy]
Did I have a point of view?
oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about you
[What was I thinking]

And I'm not sorry [I'm not sorry]
It's human nature [It's human nature]
And I'm not sorry [I'm not sorry]
Not your bitch don't hang your shit on me [it's human nature]

Express your self, don't repress your self
Express your self, don't repress your self
Express your self, don't repress your self
[I couldn't talk about]
Express your self, don't repress your self
Express your self, don't repress your self
Express your self, don't repress your self

Did I say something true? [Ooops! Hey Britney]
Did I have a point of view?

Did I say something wrong?
or Did I stay too long?

And I'm not sorry [I'm not sorry][fuck you]
It's human nature [It's human nature][fuck you again]
And I'm not sorry [I'm not sorry]
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me [it's human nature]

I'm not your bitch

She's not your bitch

[It's Britney Bitch]

Don't hang your shit on me [it's human nature]
