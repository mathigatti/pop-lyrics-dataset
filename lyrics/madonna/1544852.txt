You look familiar...
You wanna' dance? ...Yeah.


Come join the party, yeah
Let's get this started, yeah

I think you wanna' come over
Yeah I heard it through the grapevine.
Are you drunk or you sober? 
Think about it, doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good then I say do it,
I don't know what you're waiting for

Boy you got a reputation
But you're gonna' have to prove it
I see a little hesitation
Am I gonna' have to show you that if it feels right

Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside
But for now just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance tonight

No more hesitation
Coz' everybody wants to party with you
