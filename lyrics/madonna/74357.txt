You, you make my life much brighter
You're always on my mind
You, you make my load much lighter
True love is hard to find


Sometimes I feel I have to get away
I change my mind when I look in your eyes
And when those clouds come in and try to darken our days
I'll always want you to

Stay, stay darlin'
Stay, stay darlin'
Stay, stay darlin'
You know you gotta
Stay, stay darlin'

You saw through my lies and deception
Yeah I was losing my way
You, you gave my life some direction
And now I'm ready to say

I know there's bound to be some hard times ahead
I'd be a fool to believe
But if you go I'd rather think of dying instead
I never want you to

Leave, stay darlin'
Stay, stay darlin', you know you gotta
Stay, stay darlin'
Stay, stay, please stay darlin'

When you walked out my door
I knew you'd be back for more
Let's leave the past behind
True love is so hard to find

Don't be afraid
It's gonna be all right
'Cause I know that I can make you love me
Love me, love, love, love, love me, love me

When you walked out my door
I knew you'd be back for more
Let's leave the past behind
I'll always want you to

Stay, stay darlin'
Stay, stay darlin'
Stay, stay darlin'
Stay, stay, please stay darlin'

And then we can scoop, scoop, scoop
Scoodooly be bop yeah
And then we can scoop, scoop, scoop
Scoodooly be bop yeah
And then we can scoop, scoop, scoop
Scoodooly be bop yeah
And then we can scoop, scoop, scoop
Scoodooly be bop yeah

I want you to
Stay, stay darlin'
Stay, stay darlin'
Stay, stay darlin', you know you gotta
Stay, stay please stay darlin'

You know you've got to stay
I think about you night and day
You know you've got to stay
I can make you love me
Love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me
