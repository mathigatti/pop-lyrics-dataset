[Excertos de "Family Affair"]
One child grows up to be 
Somebody that just loves to learn 
And another child grows up to be 
Somebody you'd just love to burn 
Mom loves the both of them 
You see it's in the blood 
Both kids are good to Mom 
"Blood's thicker than mud" 
It's a family affairâ€¦


Keep, keep it together

[Backing vocals]
It's a family affair, it's a family affair 
It's a family affair, it's a family affair

Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever

I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face

I'm tired of sharing all the hand me downs
To get attention I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said listen, you will always have a home

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

I hit the big time but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Just givin' to get something
Always wanting something back

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
'Cause blood is thicker than any other circumstance

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
'Cause blood is thicker than any circumstance

Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
