Are you drunk or you sober? Think about it, doesn't matter
and if it makes you feel good then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for

Boy you got a reputation, but you're gonna' have to prove it
I see a little hesitation
Am I gonna' have to show you that if it feels right
Get on your marks
Step to the beat boy that's what it's for

Hey-ey-ey

When it gets too hot we can go outside

An invitation to the dance of life

Coz' everybody wants to party with you

What are you waiting for?
Nobody's gonna show you how
Why wait for someone else
To do what you can do right now?

Give me a bassline and I'll shake it
Give me a record and I'll break it
There's no beginning and no ending
(You wanna' dance?)
Give me a chance to go and I'll take it
(Yeah)

I guess I just don't recognize you with your clothes on (laughs)
What are you waiting for?
