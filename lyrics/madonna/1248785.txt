You are who you are
And I wouldn't want to change anything
In spite of all the pain that love can bring
Tell me what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

You thrill me
Surround me you feel me
You set me
You put me in a trance
You feel me
Disarm me you take me
You thrill me
You put me in a trance

(All over me, all over me)
(All over me, all over me)

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body (3x)
Erotic, erotic

(All over me, all over me)
(All over me, all over me)

You are who you are
And I wouldn't want to change anything
In spite of all the pain that love can bring
Tell me what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

You thrill me
Surround me you feel me
You set me
You put me in a trance
You feel me
Disarm me you take me
You thrill me
You put me in a trance
