Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I'm dreaming you are here with me
Can feel your body close to me
But every time you are touching me 
I lose some kind of tension


Through shady lights you talk to me
Your shadow's all that I can see
But when you're looking down on me
It's like you've lost your attention

Lies in your eyes
See the lies in your eyes
Oh no don't tell me about it
Lies in your eyes
See the lies in your eyes
Oh yeah, I wanna get out

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

We're through there's nothing left to say
Love passes, slipping out of the way
Why can't you say it straight to me
That you've lost your attention

Around, I wanted you near me
Those sounds you would not hear
And all those lonely nights
It's like you don't care

Lies in your eyes
See the lies in your eyes
Oh no don't tell me about it
Lies in your eyes
See the lies in your eyes
Oh yeah, I wanna get out

Say to me
Would you run
Cause you don't wanna be
Kept waiting here forever
You're plain to see
(You're plain to see, but love was faster)
Lies

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Lies in your eyes
See the lies in your eyes
Oh no don't tell me about it
Lies in your eyes
See the lies in your eyes
Oh yeah, I wanna get out

Lies in your eyes
See the lies in your eyes
Oh no don't tell me about it
Lies in your eyes
See the lies in your eyes
Oh yeah, I wanna get out.
