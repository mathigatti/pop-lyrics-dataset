I'm gonna tell you about love
Let's forget your life
Forget your problems
Administration, bills and loans
Come with me
Come with me


In the evidence of it's brilliance
In the evidence of it's brilliance

In the demonstration of this evidence
Some have called it religion
This is not a coincidence
Would you like to try?

Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try

Let me be your guide
Put aside your pride
Future lovers hide
Love inside their eyes

In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

Love controlled by time
Future lovers shine
For eternity
In a world that's free

Put away your past
Love will never last
If you're holding on
To a dream that's gone

I'm gonna tell you about love
Would you like to try?

In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

There's no love like the future love
Come with me

Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love

Ooh, it's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good

Ooh, I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love

I feel love
I feel love
I feel love

Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try

Love controlled by time
Future lovers shine
For eternity
In a world that's free

I feel love
I feel love
