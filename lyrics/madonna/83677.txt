There is no such thing as revenge
You will not give as good as you got
There is no such thing as an eye for an eye
If you think you're the giver, you're not


There is no such thing as regret
There is no point in placing the blame
Hate destroys the one who hates 
And everyone suffers the same

What you see
Is not necessarily what you get
Eyes are the window to the soul
Take your judgements
And let them go

There is only love and respect
To thine own self be true 
When you point the finger
There are three fingers pointing back at you

What you see 
Is not necessarily what you get 
Eyes are the window to the soul 
Take your judgements 
And let them go
Let them go
Let them go
Let them go

Recognize that God is alive in everyone 
Recognize that love lives in us all

What you see 
Is not necessarily what you get 
Eyes are the window to the soul 
Take your judgements 
And let them go
Let them go
Let them go
Let them go

What you see 
Is not necessarily what you get 
Eyes are the window to the soul 
Take your judgements 
And let them go
Let them go
Let them go
Let them go
