Oh my God
Oh my God
(Girl gone wild), oh my God
(Girl gone wild), oh my God
(Girl gone wild), oh my God
(Girl gone wild), oh my God


Oh, my God
I'm heartly sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of heaven
And the pain of hell
But most of all, because I love Thee
And I want so badly to be good
