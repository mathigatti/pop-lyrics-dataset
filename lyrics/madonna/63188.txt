You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore


When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay
Another home

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
(Love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

In the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see
The loneliness inside me
Why'd ya have to go away? (Away)
Don't you know I miss you so
I need your love

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
(Love don't live here anymore)
Don't live here anymore
No no
Don't, don't live here anymore

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
No, Don't live here anymore
Love don't live (love don't live here anymore)
Here anymore
You don't live here anymore
