You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen, when your heart's not open


You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken, when your heart's not open

Open? (6x)

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you, my heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen, when your heart's not open

Mmm-mm-mm...
Mmm-mm-mm...
Mmm-mm-mm...
Mmm-mm-mm... You're frozen, when your heart's not open

When your heart?s not open
Open your heart, It's not that hard?(2x)

Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard? When your heart's not open

When your heart's not open (3x)
You're frozen, when your heart's not open
