It's a beautiful life
But I'm not concerned
It's a beautiful dream
But a dream is earned
I can dress like a boy
I can dress like a girl
Keep your beautiful words
'Cause I'm not concerned


'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is
'Cause your world is
Up in flames

It's a beautiful plan (hmm)
But I'm not concerned (oh, yeah)
It's a beautiful game (hmm)
That I never learned
People tell me to shut my mouth (shut your mouth)
That I might get burned
Keep your beautiful lies (hmm)
'Cause I'm not concerned

'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is
'Cause your world is

I will not denounce the things that I have said
I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
I am not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe you
God is on my side and I'll be fine
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake, it's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?
I won't give in

They are so na√Øve
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know
But we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air
It's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie
The wind that's beginning to howl?

It's a beautiful life
