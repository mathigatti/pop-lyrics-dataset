I am tired of children, 
I am tired of adolescents, 
What I want now are men, 
That might make me happy, 
And I can do what you like, 
Get off of my face, 
You are not old enough, 
You either insure top me! 


[CHORUS]

Stay on top of me ... 
Make moves pleasuring, 
I ... on top of me, 
Take me to another dimension, 
Licking me for fun, 
I love you and wish you, 
But exit from the top of me! 

I want to use you, why do I ... 
Let us do not stop ever, 
Now it is time to play, 
What are we going to do? 
Mia play of cat or snake-blind? 
That play snake-serpent? 
I have many ideas, 
Just depends on you ...

[CHORUS]

Stay on top of me ... 
Make moves pleasuring, 
I ... on top of me, 
Take me to another dimension, 
Licking me for fun, 
I love you and wish you, 
But exit from the top of me!
