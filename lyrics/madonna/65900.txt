Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?


I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song

This type of modern life is it for me?
This type of modern life is it for free?
So, I went into a bar looking for sympathy
A little company I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said it's always been the same
This type of modern life is not for me?
This type of modern life is not for free?

American life
I live the american dream
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream

I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life is it for me?
This type of modern life is it for free?

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

American life
I live the american dream
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream

I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I tried to find a friend
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
Fuck it

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

Oh, fuck it!
Oh, fuck it!
Oh, fuck it!

I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shot
It goes right through my body
And you know
I'm satisfied

I drive my mini cooper
And I'm feeling super-doper
Yo they tell I'm a trooper
And you know I'm satisfied

I do yoga and pilates
And the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies
And you know I'm satisfied

I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysic's shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied

I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?

I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not christian and I'm not a jew
I'm just living out the american dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name?
