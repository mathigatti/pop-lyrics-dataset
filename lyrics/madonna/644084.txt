Hey Kid, aren't ya going?
I didn't mean just "Say Goodbye"
But you were supposed to be gone this morning
did you come to watch me cry?


Chorus:

Cause I'm drowning in an ocean of your love
I'm drowning in an ocean of your love
I'm drowning in an ocean of love
I'm drowning in an ocean of your love

Now I know that to be together
Doesn't always make things right
But I'd like you to beleive forever
That I could love you with all my might

Chorus:

Cause I'm drowning in an ocean of your love
I'm drowning in an ocean of your love
I'm drowning in an ocean of love
I'm drowning in an ocean of  love

Oh come on drown me in an ocean of your love
Come on drown me in an ocean of your love
Come on drown me in an ocean of love
Come on drown me in an ocean of love

Now you stand here with indecision
Rigid on your lips and your eyes
Are you going to make me happy?
Or are you going to watch me cry

Oh come on drown me in an ocean of your love
Come on drown me in an ocean of your love
Come on drown me in an ocean of love
Come on drown me in an ocean of love
