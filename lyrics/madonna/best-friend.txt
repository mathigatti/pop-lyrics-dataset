I miss your brain, the way you think
But I don't miss the way you used to drink
I miss our talks, the universal law
You had a way of seeing through my flaws


It's so confusing, I thought I met my match
An intellectual with talent what a catch
You always said we'd be better off as friends
It was inevitable that it would end

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waitin' for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

Still I have no regrets
Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

I miss the countryside where we used to lay
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit
I miss the good times I don't miss all of it

You'd write me poetry
You had a way with words
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waitin' for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

Still I have no regrets
Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

Yet I have no regrets
Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that it had to end
I lost my very best friend
Not gonna candy coat it
And I don't want to pretend

I put away your letters
Saved the best ones that I had
It wasn't always perfect
But it wasn't always bad

Still I have no regrets
Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

Yet I have no regrets
Cause I survived the biggest test
I will not lie and I can't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that it had to end
