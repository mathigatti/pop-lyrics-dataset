(Magaldi:)
On this night
On this night
On this night of a thousand stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays forever more


(Eva:) Magaldi
(Magaldi:) Eva Duarte
(Eva:) Your act hasn't changed much
(Magaldi:) Neither has yours

(Peron:)
I stand here as a servant of the people
As we come together for a marvelous cause 
You've shown by your presence, your deeds and applause
What the people can do, true power is yours
Not the government's, unless it represents the people

(Che:)
One always picks the easy fight
One praises fools, one smothers light
One shifts from left to right
