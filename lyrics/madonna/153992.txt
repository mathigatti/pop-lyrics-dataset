Warm inside

I'd like to direct your attention
To something that needs directing to
A lot of people talk about
Dining in and eating out
I guess that's what this song's about


I know this is not a dining room conversation
And you don't have to listen if you don't have the time
But let me remind you
In case you don't already know
Dining out can happen down below

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn
A different kind of kiss

So won't you
Go down
Where it's warm inside
Go down
Where I cannot hide
Go down
Where all life begins
Go down
That's where my love is

Now what could be better than a home cooked meal
How you want to eat it
Depends on how you feel
You can eat all you want
And you don't get fat
Now where else can you go for a meal like that
It's not fair to be selfish and stingy
Every girl should experience eating out
Sometimes when I come home from a hard day at work
I swear it's all I can think about

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn
A different way to kiss

So won't you
Go down
Where it's warm inside
Go down
Where I cannot hide
Go down
Where all life begins
Go down
That's where my love is

Colonel Sanders says it best
Finger lickin' good
Let's put what you've learned to the test
Can you make a fire without using wood

Are you still hungry?
Aren't you glad we came?
I'm glad you brought your raincoat
I think it's beginning to rain

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn
A different way to kiss

So won't you
Go down
Where it's warm inside
Go down
Where I cannot hide
Go down
Where all life begins
Go down
That's where my love is

Where it's warm inside
Go down
Where I cannot hide
Go down
Where all life begins
Go down
That's where my love is
That's where my love is

Come inside
That's where all life begins
It's warm inside
