Just one of those days
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around
I need to think about it
Can't get my head around
I need to think about it)
And all of those things
That used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around
I need to think about it
Can't get my head around
I need to think about it)


Remembering the very first time
You caught that some ones' specials eye
And all of your care dropped
And all of the world just stopped

(I hope)

I want to go back to then
Got to figure out how, got to remember when
I felt it, it thrilled me
I want it, to fill me

Just one of those days
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around
I need to think about it
Can't get my head around
I need to think about it)
And all of those things
That used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around
I need to think about it
Can't get my head around
I need to think about it)

You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And everything in life just goes wrong
Feels like nobody's listening
And something is missing

(I hope)

I want to go back to then
Got to figure out how, got to remember when
I felt it, it thrilled me
I want it, to fill me

Just one of those days
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around
I need to think about it
Can't get my head around
I need to think about it)
And all of those things
That used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around
I need to think about it
Can't get my head around
I need to think about it)

I remember when
You were the one
You were my friend
You gave me life
You were the Sun
You taught me things
I didn't run
I fell to my knees
I didn't know why
I started to breathe
I wanted to cry
I need a reminder
So I can relate
I need to go back there
Before it's too late

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body grooving
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body grooving
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body grooving
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body grooving

Just one of those days
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around
I need to think about it
Can't get my head around
I need to think about it)
And all of those things
That used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around
I need to think about it
Can't get my head around
I need to think about it)
