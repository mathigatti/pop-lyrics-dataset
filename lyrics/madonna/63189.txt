Take a bow
The night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Light are low
The curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)


Say your lines
But do you feel them
Do you mean what you say
When there's no one around (no one around)
Watching you, watching me
One lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why (why oh why)
The show is over, say good-bye
Say goodbye (bye bye)
Say goodbye

Make them laugh
It comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile
All the world loves a clown
(Just make 'em smile, the whole world loves a clown)

Wish you well
I cannot stay
You deserve an award
For the role that you played (role that you played)
No more masquerade
You're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why (why oh why)
The show is over, say goodbye
Say goodbye (bye bye)
Say goodbye

All the world is a stage (world is a stage)
And everyone has their part (has their part)
But how was I to know
Which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break
You'd break, you'd break, you'd break
You'd break my heart

I've always been in love with you (always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why (why oh why)
The show is over, say goodbye
Say goodbye (bye bye)
Say goodbye

Say good-bye
