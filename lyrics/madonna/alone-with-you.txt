Don't you treat like I'm anybody
Not average, I'm not everyone
You criticize me like you're something special
But you're not


This is who I am, not ordinary
If you want the prize, better pay the price
Pointing out all the flaws in me like you were perfect
But you're not

There you go
Didn't you make a convenient exit
I'd rather be on my own
I'd rather be all alone
There's something you didn't know

Here you come
Trying to make a convenient entrance
I'm turning my heart into stone
I'd rather be all alone
Than be alone with you

Try to shoot me down, it'll ricochet
You can't escape, always hear my name
I'd like to raise the glass to all your arrogance (look it up)

Call it what you want, you're history
I'll never understand, you're a mystery
You lied with every kiss and all comes down to this

There you go
Didn't you make a convenient exit
I'd rather be on my own
I'd rather be all alone
There's something you didn't know

Here you come
Trying to make a convenient entrance
I'm turning my heart into stone
I'd rather be all alone
Than be alone with

I'd rather be all alone
Now I'm free
I'd rather be all alone

I'd rather be all alone
Now I'm free
I'd rather be all alone
You can't handle me
