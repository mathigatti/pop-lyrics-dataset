My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'll be your loved one darling
Turn off the light
I'll be your sorceress, your heart's magician
I'm not a witch, I'm a love technician


I'll be a guiding light in your darkest hour
I'm gonna change your life, I'm like a poison flower

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
(repeat twice)
All over me (repeat 3 times)

We could use the cage
I've got a lot of rope
I'm not full of rage
I'm full of hope
This is not a crime and you're not on trial
Bend over baby, I'm gonna make you smile

Light the candles, 'til they're nice and soft
And when they start to drip, I'm gonna get you off

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
(repeat twice)
All over me (repeat 3 times)

Give it up, do as I say
Give up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

I could bring you so much pleasure

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
(repeat twice)
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my ...

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
(repeat twice)
All over me

Only the one that hurts you can make you feel better
Only the one that inflicts pain can take it away

Erotica
