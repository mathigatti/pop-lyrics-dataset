I told you I don't want you all the time
Cause you're not mine
I'm not in love, but I'm in light
So far it's working fine
But when I need you down, I'm desperate
I'm a little child
Just like an animal, down on my knees
And beggin'


Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me

Open the door, unlock me
We've got tonight, so rock me now

I'm in my bed, and I'm obsessed
And I am wide awake
I need someone like you to come
And put me in my place
Cause in the day, I can't be tamed
Boy, you don't wanna know
But in the night, my hands are tied
You tell me where to go

Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me

Open the door, unlock me
We've got tonight, so rock me now
Open the door, unlock me
We've got tonight, so rock me now

Rock me now
Rock me now

Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me

You and me, sitting on a tree
You be the daddy, I'll be the baby
