I'm gonna show you
That good guys don't always win
I'm gonna show you
The brighter side of living in sin


So when you're six feet under
You won't wonder why
Just 'cause you got a halo
Don't mean that you can fly

If you thought it was over
You're way off track
You made a blunder, and

You put me back
Back in business
This ain't no hit or miss
I'm gonna get my way

'Cause you put me back
Back in business
You're my first witness
And I'm here to stay

I'm gonna show you
Good guys always finish last
Speaking of virtue
Being nice is a thing of the past

When I want something done
I'll say it with a gun
Just 'cause you're an angel
Don't mean you're having fun
I just wanted to thank you
For what you lack
Hope they don't hang you

'Cause you put me back
Back in business
This ain't no hit or miss
I'm gonna get my way

'Cause you put me back
Back in business
You're my first witness
And I'm here to stay

A tisket, a tasket
You've lost your yellow basket
(You don't know if you want to hit me or kiss me)
I just wanted to thank you for what you lack
Hope they don't hang you

'Cause you put me back
Back in business
This ain't no hit or miss
I'm gonna get my way

'Cause you put me back
Back in business
You're my first witness
And I'm here to stay

(He's back in business now)
Give me a hand and I'll take a bow
(He's back in business now)
Bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah
(He's coming back in style)
Give me an inch and I'll take a mile
(He's back and why oh why)
Bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah

(He's back in business now)
Give me a hand and I'll take a bow
(He's back in business now)
Bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah
(He's coming back in style)
Give me an inch and I'll take a mile
(He's back and why oh why)
Bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah
