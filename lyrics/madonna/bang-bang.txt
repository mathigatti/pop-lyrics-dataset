I should've known
When we met at the late show
You and me, dangerous
Sittin' way too close
2am, at my door
Where you dropped me off
Tell me how in the hell
Did I end up


With my hand on the barrell
It's time that you paid
I want you to clean up
The mess that you made

Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell?

Bang Bang
Put my gun down on the table
Before you try to blow my mind
I used to think it was you
Who was so unstable
But now I'm sure I'm close behind

B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom
B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom
B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom
B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom

I thought you were good
You painted me bad
Compared to the others
The best thing I had
But then I discovered
It couldn't get worse
You're buildin' my coffin
You're drivin' the hearse

I thought it was you
I loved you the most
But I was just keepin'
My enemies close
I made a decision to never look back
So how did you end up with all of my jack?

Woahh-oh-oh
Bang Bang

I should've known
You were too good to be true
You were hidin' both your horns
And I was such a fool
It's not a race
Wasn't trying to beat you
Trip me up, shut me down
When I was with you

Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell?

Bang Bang
Put my gun down on the table
Before you try to blow my mind
I used to think it was you
Who was so unstable
But now I'm sure I'm close behind

B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom
B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom
B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom
B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom

I thought you were good
You painted me bad
Compared to the others
The best thing I had
But then I discovered
It couldn't get worse
You're buildin' my coffin
You're drivin' the hearse

I thought it was you
I loved you the most
But I was just keepin'
My enemies close
I made a decision I had to employ
So how did you end up with all of my toys?

Woahh-oh-oh
Bang Bang

I'm not your brother, not your lover
And I'm not your friend
Now that it's over you're another
Kind of different
A new person
Your time is up
And that's my blood in your dixie cup

B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom
B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom
B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom
B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom

Bang Bang Boom
But bang bang boom
Bang Bang Boom
