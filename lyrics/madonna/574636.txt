I don't wanna say goodbye

There are some who believe that I owe them something
But they're wrong, I owe nothing to no one but myself
And there are some who say they created me
But only my parents will have that acclaim
I took it from there, I am to blame


Up
Down, up, up, up
Down, up, up, up
Down, up, up, up
(repeat)
