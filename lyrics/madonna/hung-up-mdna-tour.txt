Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly


So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up
I don't know what to do

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up

Ring ring ring goes the telephone
The lights are on but there's no-one home
Tick tick tock it's a quarter to two
And I'm done
I'm hanging up on you

Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
I'm heartly sorry for having offended Thee
Forgive me
You'll be sorry

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly (Please forgive me)

So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up

Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up
Waiting for your call, waiting for your call
I'm fed up
