As quiet as it is tonight
You'd almost think you were safe
Your eyes are full of surprises
They cannot predict my fate


Waiting underneath the stars
There's something you should know
The angels they surround my heart
Telling me to let you go

I barely couldn't, I barely couldn't recognize
But I played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I’ll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

It's like over and over
You're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy

Now that it's over
You can lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I’m sober, no more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do, I do, I do

You almost fooled yourself this time
Let all the saints be praised
You hide your sadness behind your smile
And you keep your lost heartbreaks

The steps that edge along the ledge
It's much higher than it seems
But I’ve been on that ledge before
You can't hide yourself from me

I barely couldn't, I barely couldn't recognize
But I played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I’ll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

It's like over and over
You're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy

Now that it's over
You can lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I’m sober, no more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do, I do, I do

It's like over and over
You're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy

Now that it's over
You can lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I’m sober, no more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you
The devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you
The devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do, I do

You, you, you, you
The devil wouldn't recognize you, you you, you, I do
You, you, even the devil wouldn't recognize you, you
I do
