Hey you
Don't you give up
It's not so bad
There's still a chance for us


Hey you
Just be yourself
Don't be so shy
There's reasons why it's hard

Keep it together
You'll make it all right
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets would envy what we do
This could be good
Hey you

Hey you
Open your heart
It's not so strange
You've got to change
this time

Hey you
Remember this
None of it's real
Including the way you feel

Keep it together
We'll make it all right
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets would envy what we do
This could be good
Hey you

Save your soul, little sister
Save your soul, little brother

Hey you
Save yourself
Don't rely on anyone else

First love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else

But you must first love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first...

Hey you
There on the fence
You've got a choice
One day it will make sense

Hey you
First love yourself
Or if you can't
Try to love someone else

Keep it together
We'll make it all right
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets would envy what we do
This could be good
Hey you

First love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else

But you must first love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first...
