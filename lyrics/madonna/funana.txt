Let's go dancing
Let’s go dancing


No more crying, no more yelling
No more waiting, no more figting
Times are all changing, we all need freedom
More understanding, 'cause our hearts are bleeding

Nao funana, nao funana
Nao, nao funana, nao funana

No more sirens, no more sickness
No more hunger, no more sadness
Tonight we go dancing, our souls are starving
Let's get together, happiness my darlin’

Let's go dancing
Let's go dancing

We need Elvis and Bob Marley
We need Whitney, we need James Brown
Tonight we go dancing, out souls are starving
Let's get together, happiness my darlin'

Nao, nao funana, nao, nao funana
Nao, nao funana, nao funana

Let's go dancing
Let's go dancing
Let's go dancing
Let’s go dancing

Nao funana, nao funana
Nao, nao funana, nao funana

We need Aretha and George Michael
We need Bowie, we need 2Pac
And Avicii and Mac Miller
Freddie Mercury, Prince Rogers Nelson

Let’s go dancing
Let's go dancing
Let’s go dancing
Let's go dancing
