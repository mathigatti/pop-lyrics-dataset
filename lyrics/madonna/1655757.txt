Under the strobe lights, we can let go of it all
After midnight, partying until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight, just stay right by
my side
So let's enjoy this celebration
Come join the party, it's a celebration


Let's get this started, no more hesitation
Cause everybody wants to party with you
Celebration
I think you wanna come over

Yeah I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk or you sober?
Think about it, doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good then I say do it


I don't know what you're waiting for
Feel my temperature rising
There's too much heat, I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher?
Get closer to the fire
I don't know what you're waiting for
Under the strobe lights, we can let go of it all
After midnight, partying until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight, just stay right by my side
So let's enjoy this celebration


Come join the party, it's a celebration
Cause everybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
Cause everybody wants to party with you
Celebration
Boy you got a reputation
I see a little hesitation
And Madonna have to show you that
If it feels right, get on your marks
Step to the beat boy, that's what it's for
Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside
But for now just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life
Under the strobe lights, we can let go of it all
After midnight, partying until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight, just stay right by my side
So let's enjoy this celebration
Come join the party, it's a celebration
Cause everybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation

I got you burning up girl coz Im on fire
Turn it up girl u cant deny
Ain't enough words to make me fly
I got the bang bang boogie to make you high.
I know they told you that I was trouble break it down girl I aint gonna lie
used to wanna come closer to me or are u shy
Let me wrap my arms around you baby girl
Couldn't match this night if I searched all around the world
Spinning you round in a circle in the middle of the dance floor.

Under the strobe lights, we can let go of it all
After midnight, partying until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight, just stay right by
my side
So let's enjoy this celebration]
