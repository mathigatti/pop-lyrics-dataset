If you go away
On this summer day
Then you might as well
Take the sun away
All the birds that flew
In the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
When the day was young
And the nights were long
When the moon stood still
For the night bird's song
.
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away...
.
But if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
We'll sail on the sun
We'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees
And worship the wind
.
But if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To hold in my hand
.
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away...


But if you stay
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
That I love so much
.
But if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To hold in my hand
.
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away...
.
If you go away
As I know you must
There is nothing left
In this world to trust
Just an empty room
Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your face
Though I would have been the shadow
Of your shadow
If you might have kept me
By your side
.
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away...
.
If you go away
If you go away...

Please, don't go away.
