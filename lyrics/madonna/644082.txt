Take a look around
At all people everywhere
So much energy and excitement in the air
And the time is right
To get together with the people you know
So sing out loud and clear don't be affraid
To let your feelings show


Are you ready for it?
Rockin' steady for it
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Rockin' steady for it
Are you ready for it?

You know the time is right
To make the world a better place to be
So don't worry yourself, just take a stand
And let yourself be free
Because there's too much sadness
And confusion out here on the street
And we can change the situation
If we just get in the driver's seat

I've got a one track mind
I'm gonna have a good time
Are you ready for it?
I said, a ready set go
Tell everyone you know
That you're ready for it
