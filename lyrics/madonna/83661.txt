Je suis prête. Vous êtes prêts aussi?
I am ready. Are you ready also? 


Are you wasting my time
Are you just being kind
Oh no baby, my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time
Are you just being kind
Don't give me one of your lines

Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind [losin' your mind]
Oh no baby [yeah]

Are you wasting my time [wasting my time]
Are you just being kind
Oh no baby, my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time [time, time, time]
Are you just being kind
Don't go give me one of your lines

Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong [did you wrong]
This is not a love song

Ooh, are you just being kind [what]
Am I losing my mind
Yeah
Don't [wait]

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
And those who run seem to have all the fun
But am I wasting my time [she's so fine]
Are you just being kind

Come tell me what all your enemies told you
Sugar, never ever did I do you wrong
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind [losin' your mind]
Oh no baby [yeah]

Are you wasting my time [wasting my time]
Are you just being kind
Oh no baby, my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time [time, time, time]
Are you just being kind
Don't go give me one of your lines

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
That's how I feel, don't fog my mind
Mean what you say or baby I am gone
This is not a love song

Oooh, are you just being kind
Embrasse moi [what]
Am I losing my mind
Pour la dernière fois
Yeah

Hug me

For the last time

Love song, love song
Don't try to tell me what your enemies taught you
I'm gone but I just want you to know [love song]
That this is not a love song that I want to sing
