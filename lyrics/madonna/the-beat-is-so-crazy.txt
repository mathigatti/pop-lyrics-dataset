Some nights, all alone
Thoughts of you come creepin' in
Temporarily insane
Cause you're never gonna change, no


We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought
We'd be happily forever

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh


Never thought I was the type to hang around
Lied to myself constantly
Bout the person I thought you would be
Who's to blame, I guess it's me
I cause my own misery
Tit for tat, this and that
I needed my own life back
Now here I am
I'm so happy it's time to move on

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh

We had, we had, we had, we had
(Are you listening?)
We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought, we'd be happily forever

I'd always thought (what you want her to do?) now here I am
I'd always thought (why can't you listen?) we'd be happily forever

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
