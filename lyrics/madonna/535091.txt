(Peron has just won a sweeping victory in the 1946 Presidential
election. This is the first public appearance by Peron and Eva
since that triumph.)


(Announcer:)
People of Argentina
Your newly elected President, Juan Peron

(Crowd chanting:)
[Peron Peron ... ]

(Peron:)
Argentinos, Argentinos
We are all workers now
Fighting against our common enemies
Poverty, social injustice
Foreign domination of our industries
Reaching for our common goals
Our independence, our dignity, our pride

Let the world know that our great nation is awakening
And that its heart beats in the humble bodies
Of Juan Peron and his wife
The first lady of Argentina, Eva Duarte de Peron

(Crowd chanting:)
