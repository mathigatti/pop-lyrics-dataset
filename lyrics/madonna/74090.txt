I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love
I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me


With you I'm not a little girl, with you I'm not a man
When all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand
You see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak
You see that I am silly, and pretentious and a freak

But I don't feel too strange for you
Don't know exactly what you do
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why

And I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And gives me hope that there could be
A person that loves me

Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe)
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe)
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

With you I'm not a fascist, can't play you like a toy
And when I need to dominate, you're not my little boy
You see that I am hungry for a life of understanding
And you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding

You bring me to my knees while I'm scratching out the eyes
Of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise
And right while I am kneeling there
I suddenly begin to care
And understand that there could be
A person that loves me

Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe)
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe)
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

Love is understanding
It's hard to believe life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an S.O.S.
Stop me from drowning baby I'll do the rest

Rescue me, rescue me
Your love has given me hope (your love has given me hope)
Rescue me, rescue me
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope (baby throw out your rope)

Rescue me, rescue me
Your love has given me hope (your love has given me hope)
Rescue me, rescue me
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope (baby throw out your rope)

Ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding
Ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding

Love is understanding
It's hard to believe life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an S.O.S.
Rescue me, rescue me

It's not my business to decide
How good you are for me
How valuable you are
And what the world can see
Only that you try to understand me
And have the courage to love me for me

I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe that you can rescue me
I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe that you can rescue me

I'm singing I believe
I believe that you can rescue me
I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me

I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love
I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love

I'm singing, I'm singing, I believe
I believe that you can rescue me
Hey hey, hey hey
R.E.S.C.U.E. me
Only you can rescue me

Hey hey, hey
(I believe you can rescue me)
(I believe in the power)
(I believe you can rescue me)
