(Che:)
Tell me before I waltz out of your life
Before turning my back on the past
Forgive my impertinent behavior
But how long do you think this pantomime can last?


Tell me before I ride off in the sunset
There's one thing I never got clear
How can you claim you're our savior
When those who oppose you
Are stepped on, or cut up, or simply disappear?

(Eva:)
Tell me before you get onto your bus
Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me, say,
Alter the time-honored way the game is played?

Tell me before you get onto your high horse
Just what you expect me to do
I don't care what the bourgeoisie say
I'm not in business for them but to give all my descamisados
A magical moment or two

(Both:)
There is evil, ever around, fundamental
System of government quite incidental

(Eva:)
So what are my chances
Of honest advances?
I'd say low
Better to win
By admitting my sin
Than to lose with a halo

(Che:)
Tell me before I seek worthier pastures
And thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
To have no impossible dream?

(Eva:)
Allow me to help you slink off to the sidelines
I'll mark your ado with three cheers
But first tell me who'd be delighted
If I said I'd take on the
The world's greatest problems
From war to pollution?
No hope of solution
Even if I lived for one hundred years

(Both:)
There is evil, ever around, fundamental
System of government quite incidental

(Eva:)
So go, if you're able
To somewhere unstable
And stay there
Whip up your hate
In some tottering state
But not here, dear
Is that clear, dear?

Oh what I'd give for a hundred years!
But the physical interferes
Every day more
Oh my Creator!
What is the good of the strongest heart
In a body that's falling apart?
A serious flaw I hope you know that
