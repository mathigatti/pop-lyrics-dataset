MUSIC LIFE

[CHORUS]

Music is life, 
Music is poetry, 
Music is sex, 
Music is fantasy, 
And do not forget that, 
The next time you insult me! 


No matter the situation, 
No matter the question, 
You still pursuing me, 
I will lose control, 
Short of my life, 
You never entered into it ... 
Short of my face, 
I do not have time to play ... 

[CHORUS]

Music is life, 
Music is poetry, 
Music is sex, 
Music is fantasy, 
And do not forget that, 
The next time you insult me! 

Oh no ... 
You again, I am crazy, 
I think something is wrong, 
You are wrong! 
Does not understand? 
I am Madonna, and who insulting me, 
Paid dearly, and now you will see ... 
Not insulte the music, 
I will lose the head ... 

[CHORUS] 2X

I am not here to play, 
I do not have time for their fantasies, 
The music is life, 
Short of my face!

[CHORUS]2X

Music is life, 
Music is poetry, 
Music is sex, 
Music is fantasy, 
And do not forget that, 
The next time you insult me!
