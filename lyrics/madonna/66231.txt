I'll never be an angel
I'll never be a saint it's true
I'm too busy in surviving
Whether it's heaven or hell
I'm gonna be living to tell


So here's my history
No risk, no glory

A little up and down and
All around, it's all about survival

I'll never be an angel
I'll never be a saint it's true
I'm too busy surviving
Whether it's heaven or hell
I'm gonna be living to tell

So here's my question
Does your criticism have you caught up
In what you cannot see
Well if you give me respect
Then you'll know what to expect

A little up and down and
All around, it's all about survival

I'll never be an angel
I'll never be a saint it's true
I'm too busy surviving
Whether it's heaven or hell
I'm gonna be living to tell

So here's my history
No risk no glory

A little up and down and
All around, it's all about survival
A little up and down and
All around, it's all about survival
A little up and down and
All around, it's all about survival

I'll never be an angel, survival
I'll never be a saint it's true
Survival
