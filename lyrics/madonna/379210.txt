Needing, needing
All at once comes the silence
Begging, pleading
No more emotional violence


The withdrawal into pain
The result to never need again
Is this love?
I think not
I want out

This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
(This love affair)
It's so sad
(This love affair)
What we had
Gone, gone, gone

Bleeding, bleeding
Then comes the recognition
Anger seething
I don't need your permission
And I don't know who you are
And this thing has gone too far
Is this love
I think not
I want out

You're in too deep
You cannot keep
The promises you made
Our happiness was brief
The end of love
The end of grief

Gone, gone, gone
And I don't know who you are
And this thing has gone too far
Is this love
I think not
I want out
Gone, gone, gone
This love affair is over
Gone, gone, gone
