Sitting on a park bench
Thinking about a friend of mine
He was only twenty three
Gone before he had his time
It came without a warning
Didn't want his friends to see him cry
He knew the day was dawning
And I didn't have a chance to say goodbye


In this life, I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?
What for?

Driving down the boulevard
Thinking about a man I knew
He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself
Said that we're all made of flesh and blood
Why should he be treated differently?
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

In this life, I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case?
Ignorance is not bliss

In this life, I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case?
Ignorance is not bliss

Have you ever watched your best friend die?
(What for?)
Have you ever watched a grown man cry?
(What for?)
Some say that life isn't fair
(What for?)
I say that people just don't care
(What for?)
They'd rather turn the other way
(What for?)
And wait for this thing to go away
(What for?)
Why do we have to pretend?
(What for?)
Some day I pray it will end

I hope it's in this life
I hope it's in this life time

I hope it's in this life
I hope it's in this life time
