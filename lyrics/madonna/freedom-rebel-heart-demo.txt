Every revolution starts inside a broken heart
Every new beginning starts when something falls apart
Can't you hear a voice inside that's calling out your name
What you risk is what you learn, nothing is in vain


Freedom

Freedom

Learn to live your life in the pursuit of happiness
Never take for granted, freedom is a privilege
Prison is a state of mind we build around ourselves
Take responsability, you can't blame someone else

Freedom

We all need a hero
Are you willing to fight for what you believe in
We all need a hero
Are you willing to die for what you believe in

I walk in the footsteps of giants
Remember a man who had a dream
I stay in the shadow of those who gave their lives
So we can be free

Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you
Be the change you wanna see in the world (freedom)
You cannot, you cannot blame what you see happening in the world to anybody else (freedom)
It's time that we all stand together (freedom)
One for all and all for one (freedom)
We all play the same part (freedom)
We all want to be loved (freedom)

I want to start a revolution of love
I want to start a revolution of love
Freedom
