(Ricky Martin:)
Be careful with my heart
You could break it
Don't take my love for granted
Things could change


Sometimes I go insane
I play the fool and you'll agree
I'll never be the same
Without you here with me

Chorus:

Cuidado [Please be careful]
Con mi corazon
Me siento
Algo desnuda
Cuidado [Please be careful]
Es mi corazon
Mi corazon

(Madonna:)
Be careful with my heart
You could break it
Don't take my love for granted
Things could change

Sometimes I go insane
I play the fool and you'll agree
I'll never be the same
Without you here with me

Chorus2:

Cuidado [Please be careful]
Con mi corazon
Carino
No me lastimes
Cuidado [Please be careful]
Es mi corazon
Mi corazon

(Madonna:) If I could reach out to you
(Ricky Martin:) Nothing will stop me
(Madonna:) Take your head in my hands
(Ricky Martin:) Tell me what would you do
(Madonna:) Kiss your eyes, sing you to sleep
(Ricky Martin:) Your voice sounds like a lullaby
(Madonna:) Is my heart this time to keep?
(Ricky Martin:) Is my heart to keep?
