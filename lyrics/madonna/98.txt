Where do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all
You believed in me
I believed in you


Certainties disappears
What do we do for a dream to survive
How do we keep all our passions alive?
As we used to do

Deep in my heart
I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me
You must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance
And I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

Deep in my heart
I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me
You must love me

You must love me
