There was a time when I was happy in my life
There was a time when I thought I'd live forever
There was a time when I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice


Oh, mother, why aren't you here with me?
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes, father, you know, I'm not so free

Nobody else could ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else, I guess, could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

Oh, mother, why aren't you here with me?
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes, father, you know, I'm not so free

Chorus [2x]:
I got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

Spoken:
My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away

They couldn't take my loneliness
I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work
I used to think he was a jerk

I didn't know his heart was broken
And not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of

I made a vow that
I would never need another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage
A victim of a kind of rage

[Excertos de "Intervention"]
I got to save my baby
Because he makes me cry
I got to make him happy
I got to teach him how to fly
I got to take him higher
Way up like a bird in the sky
I got to calm him down now
I got to save his life
I got to give it up
I got to give it up

I got to give it up
Find someone to love
Find someone that I can care for

I got to give it up
Find someone to love
Find someone that I can care for

I got to give it up
I got to give it up
I got to give it up
I got to give it up
I got to let it go
I got to give it up
I got to let it go

Oh mother
Oh father
I got to give it up

Oh mother
Oh father
I got to give it up
