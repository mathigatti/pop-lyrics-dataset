You're copycat, get back
I'm always on your mind
Take a photograph like that
Always ahead of my time
I'll give you a heart attack, bumbaclat
Where is my royalty?
You're a pretty girl, I'll give you that
Stealing my recipe


Here we go again, in your fantasy
You can try it all, but you can't beat me
You can walk the walk, even talk the talk
But you'll always be two steps behind me
In my shadow, two steps behind me
Out of ammo, you're never gonna be on my level
Two steps behind me, in my shadow, you're just a wannabe me

Like a sister all messed up
Who's gonna help you out?
It's an ugly look princess
What are you all about?
Did you study me hard enough, trying to be a bust?
Yeah that's cool and all now get in line
Tickets are gonna cost

Here we go again, in your fantasy
You can try it all, but you can't beat me
You can walk the walk, even talk the talk
But you'll always be two steps behind me
In my shadow, two steps behind me
Out of ammo, you're never gonna be on my level
Two steps behind me, in my shadow, you're just a wannabe me

Never gonna be me
Just a wannabe me
Just a wannabe me
Never gonna be me
Just a wannabe me
