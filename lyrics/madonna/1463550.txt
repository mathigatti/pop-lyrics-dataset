Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this


Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no, no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down
[You'll never come down]

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on (get move on)
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own
[Baby on your own]

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
[You've got to make him]
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

Come on ladies

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
He'll be back on his knees

To express himself
[You've got to make him]
Express himself
Hey hey

Express what he's got, what he's got

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down
[You'll never come down]

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Come on ladies
Express yourself
You've got to make him]
Express himself
Hey, hey,
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

Over and over and over and over and over
Express yourself
Express yourself

Deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
[Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there]
And my mama made me learn this song
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
And deeper I go

The deeper I go
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
[Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there]
And my mama made me learn this song
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Oh Deeper and deeper!
Oh deeper and deeper!
Oh suck man!

Uh yeah!
Uh yeah!
Uh yeah!
Uh yeah!
Uh yeah!
