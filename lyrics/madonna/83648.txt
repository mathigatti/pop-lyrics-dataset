(Eva:) Colonel Peron
(Peron:) Eva Duarte


(Eva and Peron:)
I've heard so much about you

(Eva and Peron:)
I'm amazed, for I'm only an actress [a soldier]
Nothing to shout about [One of the thousands]
Only a girl on the air [Defending the country he loves]

(Eva:)
But when you act, the things you do affect us all

(Peron:)
But when you act, you take us away from the squalor of the real
world
Are you here on your own?

(Eva:)
Yes, oh yes

(Peron:)
So am I, what a fortunate coincidence
Maybe you're my reward for my efforts here tonight

(Eva:)
It seems crazy but you must believe
There's nothing calculated, nothing planned
Please forgive me if I seem naive
I would never want to force your hand
But please understand, I'd be good for you

I don't always rush in like this
Twenty seconds after saying hello
Telling strangers I'm too good to miss
If I'm wrong I hope you'll tell me so
But you really should know, I'd be good for you
I'd be surprisingly good for you

I won't go on if I'm boring you
But do you understand my point of view?
Do you like what you hear, what you see
And would you be, good for me too?

I'm not talking of a hurried night
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it gets too light
That's not the reason that I caught your eye
Which has to imply, I'd be good for you
I'd be surprisingly good for you

(Peron:)
Please go on, you enthrall me
I can understand you perfectly
And I like what I hear, what I see, and knowing me
I would be good for you too

(Eva:)
I'm not talking of a hurried night
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it gets too light
That's not the reason that I caught your eye
Which has to imply, I'd be good for you
