Eva:)
Hello and goodbye, I just unemployed you
You can go back to school
You've had a good run, I'm sure he enjoyed you
Don't act sad or surprised, let's be friends, civilized


Come on little one, don't sit there like a dummy
The day you knew would arrive is here, you'll survive
So move, funny face

I like your conversation, you've a catchy turn of phrase
You're obviously going through some adolescent phase

(Mistress:)
So what happens now?
So what happens now?
Where am I going to?
(Peron:) You'll get by, you always have before
(Mistress:) Where am I going to?
