Oh, all I want to know
All I want


With just a touch of my burning hand
I send my astro zombies to rape the land
Prime directive, exterminate
The whole human race

And your face drops in a pile of flesh
And then your heart, heart pounds
Till it pumps in death
Prime directive, exterminate
Whatever stands left

All I wanted to say
And all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you

And all I wanted to say
And all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you

Oh, all I want to know
All I want

With just a touch of my burning hand
I'm gonna live my life to to destroy your world
Prime directive, exterminate
The whole fuckin' race

Then your face drops in a pile of flesh
And then your heart, heart pounds
And it pumps in death
Prime directive, exterminate
The whole fuckin' place well

All I wanted to say
And all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you

And all I wanted to say
And all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you

Oh, all I want to know
All I want to know
All I want to know
All I want oh
Go
