(Love won't wait)
(Love won't wait)


When I first saw your face
I knew that I couldn't hesitate
You said, "Baby don't go too fast
If we do then it may not last"

Time went on and I waited for you
I didn't know what else I could do
I thought that we'd always be together
You said, "Hold on, it just gets better"

And I believed you
I kept holding on
You think that I could never leave you
You think I'm not that strong, you know

Love won't wait
(Love won't wait)
Forever and a day
[Love won't wait)
Love must live in the here and now
Don't ask me how, I know
(Love won't wait)

(Love won't wait)
(Love won't wait)

So here I am with my heart on my sleeve
You said, "Baby put your trust in me"
But I have come to the end of the line
And you have taken up all of my precious time

I need to be something special to you
Everybody's somebody's fool
Won't be a fool, no you got me all wrong
You won't know what you had til it's gone

And I believed you
I kept holding on
You think that I could never leave you
You think I'm not that strong, you know

Love won't wait
(Love won't wait)
Forever and a day
[Love won't wait)
Love must live in the here and now
Don't ask me how, I know
(Love won't wait)

Love takes time
(Love takes time)
And you've been taking too long
(Way too long)
And time never waited for anyone
Don't wait too long or I'll be gone
(Love won't wait)

There wasn't anything that I wouldn't do
You led me on, you even said, "I love you"
How can we go on when it's tearing us apart
Are you going to break my heart

'Cause I believed you
I kept holding on
You think that I could never leave you
You think I'm not that strong, you're wrong

(Love won't wait)
(Love won't wait)

Love won't wait
(Love won't wait)
Forever and a day
[Love won't wait)
Love must live in the here and now
Don't ask me how, I know
(Love won't wait)

Love takes time
(Love takes time)
And you've been taking too long
(Way too long)
And time never waited for anyone
Don't wait too long or I'll be gone
(Love won't wait)

How much longer can I wait for you
Can I keep holding on
I've got to be strong
Got to say good-bye
(Love won't wait)

How much longer can I wait for you
Hesitate for you baby
I've got to be strong
Got to say good-bye

Good-bye
