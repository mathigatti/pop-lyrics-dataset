Come over here!

Some girls they like candy
And others they like to grind
I'll settle for the back of your hand
Somewhere on my behind


Treat me like I'm a bad girl
Even when I'm being good to you
I don't want you to thank me
You can just spank me, Mmm

Some guys like to sweet talk
And others they like to tease
Tie my hands behind my back and Ooh I'm in ecstasy
Don't slobber me with kisses
I can get that from my sisters
Before I get too cranky
You better

Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Good spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky

Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Hood spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky, guy

Ooooh

Please don't call a doctor
'Cause there's nothing wrong with me
I just like things a little rough and you better not disagree
'Cause I don't like a big softie (No)
I like someone mean and bossy
Let me speak to you frankly
You better

Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Good spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky

Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Hood spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky, guy

Ooooh yeah

What about? Yeah
That's an interesting
Ooooh
My bottom hurts just thinking about it

(She wants you to)
Treat me like I'm a bad girl
(She needs you to)
Even when I'm being good to you
I don't want you to thank me
(Don't thank her)
You better

Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Good spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky

Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Hood spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky, guy

(Hanky panky) Oooh, yeah
(Good spanky) Get the picture?
(Don't wanna cry, I just wanna)

That's the way I came into this world
The doctor said: Lady, she's a beautiful girl
He gave me a spanky and the doctor smiled
So give it up, honey, 'cause I want it
Yeah
