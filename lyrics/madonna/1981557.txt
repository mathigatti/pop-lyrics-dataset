L-U-V Madonna!
Y-O-U You wanna?


I see you coming and I don't wanna know your name
L-U-V Madonna!
I see you coming and you're gonna have to change the game
Y-O-U You wanna?

Would you like to try?
Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got
Maybe you'll do fine
As long as you don't lie to me
And pretend to be what you're not

Don't play the stupid game
Cause I'm different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world

Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away

L-U-V Madonna!
Y-O-U You wanna?

Keep trying don't give up, it's if you want it bad enough
L-U-V Madonna!
It's right in front of you, now tell me what you're thinking of
Y-O-U You wanna?

In another place, at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine
Burgundy is fine
Let's drink the bottle, every drop

Don't play the stupid game
Cause I'm different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world

Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away

[Nicki Minaj]
Give me all your love, boy
You could be my boy, you could be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
Cuz it's time for change, like a missile or a noise
I'm Roman, I'm Barbarian and I'm Conan
You was sleeping on me, you were dozing
Now move, I'm going in

You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need (Now move)
Now it's up to Y-O-U
Are you the one, shall we proceed?

[M.I.A]
Licks, I'm so swag shit
No one will get you this
It's supersonic, bionic, Uranian
So, I wreck them off tricks, let's pay that it sticks
I'mma say this once, yeah, I don't give a shit

Don't play the stupid game
Cause I'm different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world

Give me all your love and give me your love
L-U-V Madonna!
Give me all your love and give me your love
Y-O-U You wanna?

Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away
