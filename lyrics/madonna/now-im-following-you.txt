Oh Dear

Let's dance
You can do a little two-step
I'll go anywhere that you step to
'Cause I'm following you
My feet might be falling out of rhythm
Don't know what I'm doing with them
But I know I'm following you


Unlikely as it is to me
On the floor with two left feet
Let's boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat
But who's counting?
Encore, once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too
Now I'm following you

Take it away, boys

(On the run)
(Be the one)
(On the run)

Yeah
Calling Dick Tracy, calling Dick Tracy
Come here Tracy, this is Sam
What are you doing up there?
I'll tell ya

Calling Dick Tracy, calling Dick Tracy
Do you read me, Tracy?
To tell you the truth Tracy, I don't know
Find out

An unexamined life is not worth living
Come over here, come over here, come over here
Let's dance
You can do a little two-step
I'll go anywhere that you step to
'Cause I'm following you

My feet, my feet
My feet might be falling out
Encore, once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too
Now I'm following you
But who's counting?

(Ten million)
(Twenty million)
(Thirty million)
What about Dick Tracy? (Forty million)
Dick, that's an interesting name (Fifty million)

Dick Dick (Sixty million) Dick
Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick (Seventy million) Dick
Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick (Eighty million) Dick Dick Dick
Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick (Ninety million)
Dick

My bottom hurts just thinking about it

Unlikely as it is to me
On the floor with two left feet
Let's boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat
But who's counting?
Encore, once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too
Now I'm following you

Would you knock it off please?
Thank you!
