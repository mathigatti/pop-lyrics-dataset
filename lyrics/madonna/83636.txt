"No" is just a word
That people say when they're afraid
And if you say "no" to me
Then I will fight you till I'm free


Say freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"
Say freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"

'Cause "no" is just a word
That people say when they can't cope
And if you say "no" to me
Then I will fight you till I'm free

Freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"
Freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"

'Cause "no" is just a word
That people say when they are lost
And if you say "no" to me
Then I will fight you till I'm free

Say freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"
Freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"

Say freedom, brotherhood
