I went down to the local bar
To buy my daddy a big cigar
When I got home he was dead
Somebody shot him in the head


Oh dear daddy
You are not gonna see me grieve
Cause you´ve brought out the worst in me

Yep, It's all true
It's true. It makes me cry

When the funeral it was through
I had myself a barbecue
Daddy's bones they sure tasted good
I would´ve killed him myself if only I could

Oh dear daddy
You are not gonna see me sad
Cause everything you did was bad
