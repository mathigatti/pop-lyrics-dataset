I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall


A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then it will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside you can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew, then
Will I ever have the chance again?

If I ran away I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear
The beating of my heart?

Will it go cold? (Will it go cold?)
The secret that I hide, will I grow old?
How would they hear?
When will they learn?
How would they know?

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?
