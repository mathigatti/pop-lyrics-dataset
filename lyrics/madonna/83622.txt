(Eva:)
I don't expect my love affairs to last for long
Never fool myself that my dreams will come true
Being used to trouble I anticipate it
But all the same I hate it, wouldn't you?


Chorus:

(Eva:) So what happens now?
(Che:) Another suitcase in another hall
(Eva:) So what happens now?
(Che:) Take your picture of another wall
(Eva:) Where am I going to?
(Che:) You'll get by, you always have before
(Eva:) Where am I going to?

Time and time again I've said that I don't care
That I'm immune to gloom, that I'm hard through and through
But every time it matters all my words desert me
So anyone can hurt me, and they do

(chorus)

Call in three months time and I'll be fine, I know
Well maybe not that fine, but I'll survive anyhow
I won't recall the names and places of each sad occasion
But that's no consolation here and now.

(chorus, with Che's lines being sung by the starlets)
