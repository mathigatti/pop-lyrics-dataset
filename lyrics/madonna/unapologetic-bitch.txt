Woke up this morning feeling good that you were gone
Hurt for a while, but I'm finally moving on
Said it, Did it, Hit it, Quit it
Then you let it go
See you tried to call me, but I blocked you on the phone
It took a minute, but by now I'm feeling strong
It almost killed me, but I'm better off alone
Now you say it that you're sorry, I don't wanna know
Better face the fact you had to go


It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometime you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometime you know I gotta call it like it is
You know you never really knew how much you loved me 'til you lost me
Did you?
You know you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Oh, fuck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

I know youd like it if I stayed home and cried
But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why:
When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
When the gun was loaded you were never on the side
I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
Said it, Did it, Loved it, Hated it
I don't care no more
Tell me how it feels to be ignored?

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometime you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometime you know I gotta call it like it is
You know you never really knew how much you loved me 'til you lost me
Did you?
You know you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Oh, fuck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Wo-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wo-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Wo-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Wo-oh

It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometime you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometime you know I gotta call it like it is
You know you never really knew how much you loved me 'til you lost me
Did you?
You know you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Oh, fuck you


It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometime you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometime you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an
