Universe is full of stars
Nothing out there looks the same
You're the one that I've been waiting for
I don't even know your name


I'm in a trance
I'm in a trance

Cosmic systems intertwine
Astral bodies drip like wine
All of nature ebbs and flows
Comets shoot across the sky
Can't explain the reasons why
This is how creation goes

I don't want nobody else (Body else)
All the others look the same (The same)
Galaxies are sliding into view
I don't even know your name

I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning baby out of control

I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning baby out of control

I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

Kiss me, kiss me
Kiss me, kiss me

I like to singy singy singy
Like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy
I like to rhumba rhumba rhumba
Dance to a samba samba samba

I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning baby out of control

I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning baby out of control

I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

Trance, I'm in a trance
Universe is full of stars
Nothing out there looks the same
You're the one that I've been waiting for
I don't even know your name
