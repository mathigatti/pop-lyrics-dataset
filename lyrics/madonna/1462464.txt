Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body


That's what all the boys say
Satin sheets and luxuries so fine, oh yeah
All your suits are custom made in London
But I've got something that you'll really like

Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love
All over your body, all over your body
In my love
All over, all over
From your head down to your toes 

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're o.k.
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light, that's right
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

'Cause we're living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie, but
I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

'Cause we're living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material girl
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world(x4)

Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right you to see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material girl
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Oh material...
Oh material...
Oh material...
Oh material girl

I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Oooh, oooh, oooh

Sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Like a virgin, ooh, ooh
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, baby
Can't you hear my heart beat
For the very first time?
