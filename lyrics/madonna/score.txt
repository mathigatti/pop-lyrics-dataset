Boy let's sweat and I'll work your body, body
I'm on it, on it
All night
When I call the play, you can run it, run it
I love it, love it
All night


All stars, go far
I let you in my office like a point guard
Close up, close up
You can make the finals if you play hard
You can be my baller, baby
Let the game begin
I can be your coach and baby, teach you how to win

Boy let's sweat and I'll work your body, body
I'm on it, on it
All night
When I call the play, you can run it, run it
I love it, love it
All night

Pull, up, shoot, score
Make the crowd go wild
Fast, break, back door
Put it up in style
Pull, up, shoot, score
Make the crowd go wild
Fast, break, back door
Put it up in style

Half time, you're mine
Meet you at my bleachers kissing courtside
Bench you, send you
Straight into the locker room to quench you

Boy let's sweat and I'll work your body, body
I'm on it, on it
All night
When I call you to play, you can ride it, ride it
I love it, love it
All night

Ah take it down, take it down
Ah take it down, take it down
Ah take it down, take it down
You wanna score?

Ah take it down, take it down
Ah take it down, take it down
Ah take it down, take it down
You want more?

Ah take it down, take it down
Ah take it down, take it down
Ah take it down, take it down
You wanna score?

Ah take it down, take it down
Ah take it down, take it down
Ah take it down, take it down
You want more?

Ah take it down, take it down
Ah take it down, take it down
Ah take it down, take it down
You wanna score?
