Cherish
Cherish


So tired of broken hearts
And losing at this game before I
Start this dance I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance

You are my destiny
I can't let go, baby can't you see?
Cupid, please, take your aim at me

Cherish the thought of always
Having you here by my side
Oh, baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life

I'm always singing it
Cherish the strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And, baby, I'll perish the thought of ever leaving
I never would

I was never satisfied with
Casual encounters I can't
Hide my need for two hearts
That bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be

Romeo and Juliet
They never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate
My point of view

Cherish the thought of always
Having you here by my side
Oh, baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life

I'm always singing it
Cherish the strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And, baby, I'll perish the thought of ever leaving
I never would

Who? You!
Can't get away I won't let you
Who? You!
I could never forget to
Cherish is the world I use
To remind me of your love

Together
You're giving it to me
Boy, keep giving me all
All, all your joy
Give me faith
I will always cherish you

Romeo and juliet
They never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate
My point of view

Who? You!
Can't get away I won't let you
Who? You!
I could never forget to
Cherish is the world I use
To remind me of your love

Cherish the thought of always
Having you here by my side
Oh, baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life

I'm always singing it
Cherish the strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And, baby, I'll perish the thought of ever leaving
I never would

Cherish
Give me faith
Give me joy
My boy, I will always cherish you

Give me faith
Give me joy
My boy, I will always cherish you

Cherish your strength
Can't get away, I won't let you
Perish the thought
I could never forget to

Cherish the thought
Can't get away
Can't get away

Cherish the joy
Can't get away
Can't get away
Cherish your strength
Can't get away, I won't let you

Perish the thought
I could never forget to
Cherish the thought
Can't get away
Can't get away

Cherish the joy
Can't get away
Can't get away
