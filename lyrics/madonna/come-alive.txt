I'm in the sky where I ought to be and
I been watching you
Rocket ship takin' off and that
Now I'm onto you
Mouth closed, I don't want you opinion
Who you talking to?
Stand up now, I don't wanna blend in
Why you want me to?


They say we’re like Vietnam
And all want is peace peace peace peace
See the world
Haven't seen all
I wanna see, see, see

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream, dream, it's alive
Come alive, come and

I can't react how you thought I'd react
I would never for you
Front line, I won't stay on the back
'Cause you want me to
Mouth closed, I don't want you opinion
Who you talking to?
Stand up now, I don't wanna blend in
Why you want me to?

They say we’re like Vietnam
And all want is peace peace peace peace
See the world
Haven't seen all
I wanna see, see, see

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream, dream, it's alive
Come alive, come and

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come and

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come and

Who you talking to?
Who you talking to?

I'm in the sky where I ought to be and
I been watching you
Rocket ship takin' off and that
Now I'm onto you
Mouth closed, I don't want your opinion
Who you talking to?
Stand up now, I don't wanna blend in
Why you want me to?

They say we're like Vietnam
And all I want is peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace
See the world, haven't seen it all
I wanna see, see, see, see, see dreams

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dreams and it's alive
Come alive, come and

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dreams and it's alive
Come alive, come and

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come and

Front line, I won't stand on the back
Front line, I won't stand on the back
Come alive, come alive
