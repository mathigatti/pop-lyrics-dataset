Chorus:

You, you make my life much bright, baby
You're always on my mind
Don't you know you, you make my load much light, baby
True love is hard to find


You came along when I was losing my way
You touched my heart and now I'm ready to say
That all your sweetness callin' back ugly skies
And now I've fallen for the look in your eyes

I couldn't ask for more
You're what I'm looking for
Oh

(chorus)

Sometimes I feel I have to get away
I change my mind when I look in your eyes
And when those clouds come in to darken our day
You're never gonna hear me say good-bye

I couldn't ask for more
You're what I'm looking for
Oh

(chorus)
Don't you know
(chorus)

(Spoken:)
C'mon baby
Don't be shy
Don't you know
If you don't
I'll show you how
Don't you know?

Uh, oww, uh, oww
Uh, oww, uh, oww

(Spoken:)
Tainted love

Oh

(chorus)

Don't you know
