I can give you everything that you want
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my pole
You can't buy this at no luxury store
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my pole


There's a place you gotta go before I let you take it all
It's like a drug, it should be illegal

Baby you should get down low
And drink my precious alcohol
You look so thirsty, I think you need it

Kiss it better, kiss it better
(Don't it taste like holy water)
Make it wetter, make it wetter
(Don't it taste like holy water)
Kiss it better, make it wetter
(Don't it taste like holy water)
Kiss it better, kiss it better

I can't teach you all the things you don't know
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my pole
It's where like make it something you wanna own
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my pole

There's something you gotta hit
It's sacred and immaculate
I can let you in heaven's door

I promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation deep within
We can do it here on the floor

Kiss it better, kiss it better
(Don't it taste like holy water)
Make it wetter, make it wetter
(Don't it taste like holy water)
Kiss it better, make it wetter
(Don't it taste like holy water)
Kiss it better, kiss it better

Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water
(Bless yourself and genuflect)
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water
(If you like it, please confess)

Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water
(Bless yourself and genuflect)
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water
(Yeezus loves my pussy best)

Holy water, holy water, holy water
Holy water, holy water, holy water
Holy water, holy water, holy water
Holy water, holy water, holy water
Holy water, holy water

Ladies with an attitude
Don't just stand there, don't, don't, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, let's get to it
Strike a pose, there's nothing to it

What are you looking at?
Come on Vogue
Let your body move to the music
(Move to the music)
Come on Vogue

Let your body go with the flow
(Go with the flow)
You know you can do it
Come on Vogue
Let your body move to the music
(Move to the music)
Come on Vogue
Vogue
Let your body go with the flow
(Go with the flow)
You know you can do it
