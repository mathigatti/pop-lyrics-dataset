Shake your head (x5)

You can't argue with death
You can't break a burly sailor's neck
You can't drink ava from plastic glasses


You can't sue Buddah for libel
You can't rewrite the Bible
You can't hits homers like Babe Ruth
And you can't put your finger on the truth

Shake Your Head
Uh uh uh uh

You can't sing underwater
You can't have the boss' daughter
You can't make missles out of mud
And you can' purify bad blood
Let's go to bed!

Uh let's go to bed!
Shake your head
