Come, come into my arms
Don't refuse me, the world will fall apart
If you could see, see into my eyes
You'd be with me in this paradise


Don't wanna live for tomorrow
Let's live tonight like it is the last

Can you love me like the world is ending?
Hold me like it's Armageddon
Don't stop 'cause nothing lasts forever
You can save me, never let me go
And make me indestructible
Nothing lasts forever

Take, take me to the stars
Universal love is what we are
Trust me, put your hand in mine
I'll be with you 'til the end of time

Don't wanna live for tomorrow
Let's live tonight like it is the last

Can you love me like the world is ending?
Hold me like it's Armageddon
Don't stop 'cause nothing lasts forever
You can save me, never let me go
And make me indestructible
Nothing lasts forever

Can you love me like the world is ending?
Hold me like it's Armageddon
Don't stop 'cause nothing lasts forever
You can save me, never let me go
And make me indestructible
Nothing lasts forever
