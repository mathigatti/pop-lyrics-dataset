Chorus: 
This used to be my playground [used to be] 
This used to be my childhood dream 
This used to be the place I ran to 
Whenever I was in need 
Of a friend 
Why did it have to end 
And why do they always say 
Don't look back 
Keep your head held high 
Don't ask them why 
Because life is short 
And before you know 
You're feeling old 
And your heart is breaking 
Don't hold on to the past 
Well that's too much to ask 


(chorus) 

No regrets 
But I wish that you 
Were here with me 
Well then there's hope yet 
I can see your face 
In our secret place 
You're not just a memory 
Say goodbye to yesterday 
Those are words I'll never say [I'll never say] 

This used to be my playground [used to be] 
This used to be our pride and joy 
This used to be the place we ran to 
That no one in the world** could dare destroy 

This used to be our playground [used to be] 
This used to be our childhood dream 
This used to be the place we ran to 
I wish you were standing here with me 

This used to be our playground [used to be] 
This used to be our childhood dream 
This used to be the place we ran to 
The best things in live are always free 

Wishing you were here with me...
