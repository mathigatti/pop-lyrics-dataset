My love's a revolver
My love's a revolver


Oops I guess I shot ya
My finger's on the trigger
I had a bullet with your name on it
Click click
I'm a sex pistol
My love should be illegal
Real deal baby
I'm no counterfeit
Click click

(I)
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
My looks can kill
E-O-E-O
My body's fully loaded
And I got more ammo
(I)
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
My looks can kill
E-O-E-O
You're an accessory to a murder cause

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

I let it bang bang

You've been hit by a smooth criminal
A bad girl
I got you cryin' to your mama
Sayin'
I can't believe it
I seen ya tight
Bring ya knife into a gun fight
Caught up in love right
Think I'm in love, I

(I)
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
My looks can kill
E-O-E-O
My body's fully loaded
And I got more ammo
(I)
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
My looks can kill
E-O-E-O
You're an accessory to a murder cause

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

I let it bang bang

Bang
The shooter name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain
She just screamed
'shoot again'
I gave her extra rounds
My barrel twist around
I am Mr. Shoot 'em down
I leave hearts on the ground
My love is a weapon
And yes I use it well
Then I let the rose petals
Cover up the bullet shell
I never shoot and tell
I only shoot to kill and
That vest ain't gonna help ya
Even if it's made of steel

(I)
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

I let it bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang

I shoot em up and watch 'em fall

I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang

I shoot em up and watch 'em fall
