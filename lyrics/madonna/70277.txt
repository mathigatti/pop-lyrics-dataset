You locked your heart
You make up with tears and stars in your eyes
You gave it all to someone that
Cannot love you back


Your days are packed
With wishes and hopes for the love that you've got
You waste it all to someone that
Cannot love you back

Someone that cannot love

Love, ain't this enough?
You push yourself down
You try to take comfort in words
But words
They cannot love
Don't waste hem like that
Cus they'll bruise you more

You secretly made
Castle of sand that you hide in the shade
But you cannot hold the tides that break them
And you build them all over again

You talk all these words
You make conversations that cannot be heard
How long until you notice that
No one is answering back

Someone that cannot be love

Love, ain't this enough?
You push yourself down
You try to take comfort in words
But words
They cannot love
Don't waste hem like that
Cus they'll bruise you more

Love, love, ain't this enough?
This pushing around
To find little comfort in words
But words
They cannot love
Don't waste them like that
Cus they Â¿ll bruise you more
You know they'll bruise you more
Words they will hurt you more
