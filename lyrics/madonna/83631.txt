My guy is really something
He's sensitive and shy
My guy is such a bumpkin
It doesn't take much to make him cry
If you hurt someone helpless
It's like taking away all his toys
He's just a cry baby boy


My guy is sentimental
He's always feeling blue
He can be so temperamental
And I don't know what I should do
If you step on a little bug
He cries all over the floor
He's just a cry baby bore

I don't want to hurt his feelings
But his outbursts have me really
Boo-hoo-hoo-ing all the time
If I turn out like him
I think I'm gonna cry, baby
La, la, la, la, la, la
He's such a cry baby
La, la, la, la, la, la

(And I'll tell you something else)

My guy is such a wet noodle
He's always teary-eyed
He acts like a real cock-a-doodle
He can't even tell you why
If you just play him a sappy song
He acts like his doggie just died
He's just a cry baby guy

(No kidding, oh dear)

My guy is such a whiner
He's worse than baddie so
A cockroach seen in the diner
And the tears flow out of the blue
And if I ask him to knock it off
He goes and cries in the can
He's such a cry baby man

I don't want to hurt his feelings
But his outbursts have me really
Boo-hoo-hoo-ing all the time
If I turn out like him
I think I'm gonna cry, baby
La, la, la, la, la, la
He's such a cry baby
La, la, la, la, la, la

I love a cry baby
La, la, la, la, la, la
He's such a cry baby
La, la, la, la, la, la

Would you knock it off please?
Thank you
