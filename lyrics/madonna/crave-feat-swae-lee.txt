I'm tired of being far away from home
Far from walking home
Far from where it's safe
Hope it's not too late
Rush, rush, rush on you
Love, love, love on you
Love you like a fool
Put my trust in you


'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade
I don't think we should play with this
Said: Come, come get me straight
I don't think we should wait for this
'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous

Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should play with this
Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should wait

'Cause I'm just me (yeah)
That's all I can be (ooh)
Something real (yeah)
Something I can feel
You know I just can't change
This is how I'm made
I'm not afraid
Take me to the place

'Cause you're the one I crave (crave)
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade
I don't think we should play with this
Said: Come, come get me straight
I don't think we should wait for this
'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous

Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should play with this
Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should wait

You're on me, I don't think you should wait (wait)
You're on me, one pull up away (away)
You're down to ride, ride me like a wave (ride, yeah)
I gave you a sensation (ooh)
A loner, days we used to chase
It's do or die, yeah, my love life can get crazy (crazy)
It's on the line, girl, you're risking everything
It's over-x-rated

Ran so far to try to find
The thing I let and there it was
Inside (-side) of (of) me (me)
Ran and ran and ran so fast
A thing to last and there it was
I hear (hear) you (you) breathe (breathe)

'Cause you're the one I crave (crave)
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade
I don't think we should play with this
Said: Come, come get me straight
I don't think we should wait for this
'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous

Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should play with this
Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should wait

It's on the line, girl, you're risking everything
