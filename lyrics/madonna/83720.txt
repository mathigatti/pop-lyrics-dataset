Should have left you standing right where you stood
Should have let you go, should have had the sense to know
Like a train you'd come, and I'd lose my place
Now I'm on this trip, I took a fall from grace


Chorus:

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

I've had a map laid out from the day I was born
But the roads are blocked, and the paper is worn
And all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to laugh, never taught to let go

(chorus)

My conscience is clear I know right from wrong
That's a lie I know nothing except that you're gone
But there's more to learn from the look in your eyes
That trip round this world, the stars in the sky

Now all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to live, never taught me to let go

(chorus)

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, Lord knows I've tried
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

[Nowhere to hide]
[No place to run]
[Nowhere to hide]
