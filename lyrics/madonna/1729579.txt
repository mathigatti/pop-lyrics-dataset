I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you


I was beat incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
'Cuz, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Whoa-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Feels so good inside
When you kiss me
And you touch me
And you hold me
Feels so good inside
