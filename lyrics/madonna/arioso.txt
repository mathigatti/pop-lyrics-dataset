Everyone's an authority
On who and what is good for me
Who I see, what I wear


Everyone's a specialist
On where I've been
And who I've kissed
Choices I should make
The lovers I should take

Everyone's a connaisseur
How do they know?
What makes them so sure?
Do they know what's right for me?

Everyone's a know-it-all
But will they be there
To catch me when I fall
Or have they just come along for the show?

The me nobody knows
Just what it's like, nobody sees
If they could just walk along in my shoes for a while
Then they could see just what it's like

Everyone's a specialist
On where I've been
And who I've kissed
Choices I should make
The lovers I should take

The me nobody knows
Just what it's like, nobody sees
If they could just walk along in my shoes for a while
Then they could see just what it's like

The me nobody knows
Just what it's like
The me nobody knows
Just what it's like

Mmmm
Mmmm

If they could just walk along in my shoes for a while
