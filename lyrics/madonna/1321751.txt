Dance, you're not fightin g
Dance, you're not lying
Dance, you're not cheating
Dance, you're only triggering your senses


You're not dieing
Dance, you're not crying
Dance, you're not killing yourself
You're only triggering your senses
You're only triggering your senses

Dance is a lovely friend
Dance to your heart's content
Dance and we don't pretend
Dance is your only friend

When you're on the street
To a different beat
When you're feeling down
When there's no one else around

Dance, you're not taking
Dance, you're not hating
Dance, you're not killing yourself
You're only triggering your senses
You're only triggering your senses

Madonna - Triggering

Dance, you're not fightin g
Dance, you're not lying
Dance, you're not cheating
Dance, you're only triggering your senses
You're not dieing

Dance, you're not crying
Dance, you're not killing yourself
You're only triggering your senses
You're only triggering your senses

Dance is a lovely friend
Dance to your heart's content
Dance and we don't pretend
Dance is your only friend
When you're on the street
To a different beat
When you're feeling down
When there's no one else around

Dance, you're not taking
Dance, you're not hating
Dance, you're not killing yourself
You're only triggering your senses
You're only triggering your senses

I hip, I hip
I hip it hop
And you don't stop
You get on your feet
You do the hip hop
To the different beat
I know you don't stop
When  you're on the street
You not feeling down
And there's no one else around
You get on your feet
And dance to the broken beat

When you're on the street
To a different beat
When you're feeling down
When there's no one else around
When there's no one else around
Dance, you're not fighting
Dance, you're not lying
Dance, you're not cheating
Dance, you're only triggering your senses
You're not dieing
Dance, you're not crying
You're not killing yourself
You're only triggering your senses
You're only triggering your senses
Triggering your senses
Triggering your
Dance...
