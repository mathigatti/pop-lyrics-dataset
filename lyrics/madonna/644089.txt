It feels so nice to say your name
You captured me you're not the same
Your standing near it makes no sense
I lose all my self confidence


And I know about your reputation
Baby, I don't care
You're such a sweet sensation

Chorus:

Won't you take me for your lover
I don't want to have another
Won't you take me for your lover
I don't want to have another
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you

You don't know what you've done to me
I'm growing weaker at the knees
You knowI know I took my chance
When I tossed the dice
I didn't think it would be this nice

I'll never fall in love
I'm much to cleaver
But you stole my heart
And I'm yours to keep forever

(chorus)
Someone like, just won't do oh no
I don't want them anyway

I want you...
