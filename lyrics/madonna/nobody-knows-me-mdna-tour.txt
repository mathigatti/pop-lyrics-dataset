I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine


I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realise
How many times I've died

I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me

This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me (don't want a social disease)
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me

I don't want no lies (nobody knows me)
I don't watch TV (nobody knows me)
I don't waste my time (nobody knows me)
Won't read a magazine (nobody knows me)

I don't want no lies (nobody knows me)
I don't watch TV (nobody knows me)
I don't waste my time (nobody knows me)
Won't read a magazine (nobody knows me)

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Li-li-like you know me

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Li-li-like you know me

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Li-li-like you know me
Li-li-like you know me
