It's a special time

I put in the hours, you can count on it
Knowledge is power, you can trust no bitch
You can trust no bitch, they can flip the switch
Knowledge is power, you can trust no bitch


Know me
Wipe your tears and console me
That he ain't good enough for me
Shake those insecurities
Listen
I got more intuition
I see right through your "stick-together, girls-forever, man-snatching" tricks
Monday you call me up about friday
And then disappear until sunday
Back here tryin' to talk your shit

I put in the hours, you can count on it
Knowledge is power, you can trust no bitch
You can trust no bitch, they can flip the switch
Knowledge is power, you can trust no bitch

Drama
Ever heard about karma
Just a word about trauma
That's what you have coming to you
Besties
Had your hands on his testies
Hope you loved every second of your violated std's
Girlfriend
You just did me a favour
I know human behaviour
Time to elevate my shit

I put in the hours, you can count on it
Knowledge is power, you can trust no bitch
You can trust no bitch, they can flip the switch
I put in the hours, you can trust no bitch

And by the way, you're as cheap as your weave
(And as fake as your tits)
