(Madonna:)
Pride's that splendid liar
Sworn enemy of love


(Jennifer:)
Kept my lips from saying
Things my heart was thinking of

(Madonna:)
But now my pride you've humbled
I've cast it to the winds

(Jennifer:)
Broken, beaten, sick at heart

(Both:)
Our compassion begins

(Madonna:)
We played the game of 'stay away'
But it costs more than I can pay
Without you I can't make my way
I surrender dear

(Jennifer:)
I may seem proud, I may act gay
It's just a pose, I'm not that way
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender dear

(Madonna:)
Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game
Lending a spice to the wooing

(Both:)
But I don't care who's to blame

(Madonna:)
When stars appear
(Jennifer:)
When stars appear
(Madonna:)
And shadows fall
(Jennifer:)
And shadows fall
(Madonna:)
Why then you'll hear
(Jennifer:)
Why then you'll hear
(Both:)
My poor heart call
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender dear
