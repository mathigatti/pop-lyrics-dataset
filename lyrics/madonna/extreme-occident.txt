I went to the far right
Then I went to the far left
I tried to recover my center of gravity


I guess I'm lost
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most
Was that I wasn't lost

I came from the Midwest
Then I went to the Far East
I tried to discover my own identity

I guess I’m lost
I paid a handsome cost
The thing that hurt the most
Was that I wasn't lost
I wasn't lost

No, I wasn't lost
It was a different feeling
A mix of lucidity and craziness
But I wasn't lost, you believe me
I was right, and I've got the right
To choose my own life like a full circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle
Aquilo que mais magoa
É que eu não estava perdida
Aquilo que mais magoa
É que eu não estava perdida

I guess I'm lost
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most
Was that I wasn't lost
I wasn't lost
