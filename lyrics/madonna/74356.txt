Hurry up, I just can't wait
I gotta do it now I can't be late
I know I'm not afraid I gotta get out the door
If I don't do it now I won't get anymore


You try to criticize my drive
If I lose I don't feel paralyzed
It's not the game it's how you play
And if I fall I get up again now

I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over

Got past my first mistake
I'll only give as much as I can take
You're never gonna see me standin' still
I'm never gonna stop 'till I get my fill

It doesn't matter who you are
It's what you do that takes you far
And if at first you don't succeed
Here's some advice that you should heed

You get up again, over and over
You get up again, over and over
You get up again, over and over
You get up again, over and over

I'm not afraid to say
I hear a different beat, oh
And I'll go out in the street, yeah
And I will shout it again
From the highest mountain

Hurry up, Hurry up
Hurry up, Hurry up

Hurry up, I just can't wait
I gotta do it now I can't be late
I know I'm not afraid I gotta get out the door
If I don't do it now I won't get anymore

You try to criticize my drive
If I lose I don't feel paralyzed
It's not the game it's how you play
And if I fall I get up again now

I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over

I'm not afraid to say
I hear a different beat, oh
And I'll go out in the street, yeah
And I will shout it again
From the highest mountain

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Shout it, shout it, shout it, ah

Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over

I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over

Hurry up, Hurry up

I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
