Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're OK
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away


They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (that's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

'Cause we're living in a material world
And I, I'm a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I, I'm a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie, but
I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

'Cause we're living in a material world
And I, I'm a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I, I'm a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world

Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right you to see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I, I'm a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I, I'm a material girl

Living in a material world
And I, I'm a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I, I'm a material girl

Living in a material world
And I, I'm a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I, I'm a material girl

A material
A material
A material
A material world

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
