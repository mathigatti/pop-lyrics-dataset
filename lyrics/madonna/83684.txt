Hear me, I'm knocking at your door
Could it mean I'm coming back for more
Could it be I could not stay away
Now all I wanna do is say
Ooh ooh ooh ooh


I got to tell you how I feel
It's getting oh so dark out here
The moonlight is shining on my skin
Now open up and let me in
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Shine a light in your window
Oooh, I'm here in the shadow
I saw your face in the doorway
Oooh, turned around and it slipped away

My body's shaking with the cold
I'm feeling tired, feeling old
And I see your fire burning bright
Now please wake up for me tonight
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Shine a light in your window
Oooh, I'm here in the shadow
I saw your face in the doorway
Oooh, turned around and it slipped away

Hear me, I'm knocking at your door
And you're in the doorway no more
I'll stay right here at your door
