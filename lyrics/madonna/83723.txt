I'm gettin' tired of waitin' around
I feel like I'm always trackin' you down
I don't wanna point my finger at you
But there's somethin' you're forgettin'
Here's what you better do


You better think of me
I know you want to, baby
Think of me
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll think of me
Oh yeah

You walk in and you see me cryin'
You apologize say you lost track of time
I'm not gonna cry anymore
You're gonna lose me too if you don't know
What's good for you

Think of me
I know you want to, baby
Think of me
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll think of me
Oh yeah

Tell me what I did to you
To make you treat me so badly
If you wanna see me anymore
If you don't wanna see me walking out the door

You better think of me
I know you want to, baby
Think of me
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll think of me
Oh yeah

You better think of me
Think, think, think of me
You know you're drivin' me crazy
You better, you better
You better think of me
Oh yeah

(Think) Stop wastin' all my time
(Think) You know it could have been so fine
(Think) Hey boy, I'm waitin' on a sign
Don't you know there's someone else
Stop thinkin' of yourself

You better think of me
I know you want to, baby
Think
You know you're drivin' me crazy
Think
Think, think, think of me

You better think of me
Think, think, think of me
(Think) Stop wastin' all my time
(Think) You know it could have been so fine
You better, you better

You better think of me
I know you want to, baby
Think
You know you're drivin' me crazy
Think
Think, think, think, think of me
You better, you better
You better think of me

(Think) Stop wastin' all my time
(Think) You know it could have been so fine
(Think) Hey boy, I'm waitin' on a sign
