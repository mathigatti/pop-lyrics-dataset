Put your head on my shoulder, baby
Things can't get any worse
Night is getting colder
Sometimes life feels like it's a curse


I can't carry these sins on my back
Don't wanna carry any more
I'm gonna carry this train off the track
I'm gonna swim to the ocean floor

Mmmmm
Crash to the other shore
Mmmmm
Swim to the ocean floor

Children killing children
While the students rape their teachers
Comets fly across the sky
While the churches burn their preachers

We can't carry these sins on our back
Don't wanna carry any more
We're gonna carry this train off the track
We're gonna swim to the ocean floor

Mmmmm
Crash to the other shore
Mmmmm
Swim to the ocean floor

Let the water wash over you
Wash it all over you
Swim to the ocean floor
So that we can begin again
Wash away all our sins
Crash to the other shore
Mmmmmm

I can't carry these sins on my back
Don't wanna carry any more
I'm gonna carry this train off the track
I'm gonna swim to the ocean floor

Mmmmm
Crash to the other shore
Mmmmm
Swim to the ocean floor

We can't carry these sins on our back
Don't wanna carry any more
We're gonna carry this train off the track
We're gonna swim to the ocean floor

Crash to the other shore
Swim to the ocean floor
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
