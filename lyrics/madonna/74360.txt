I turned around too late to see the fallen star
I fell asleep and never saw the sun go down
I took your love for granted
Thought luck was always on my side
I turned around too late and you were gone


Chorus:

So give me one more chance
Darlin' if you care for me
Let me win your love
'Cause you were always there for me
If you care for me,
Be there for me

I like to play the queen of hearts and never thought I'd lose
I rolled the dice but never showed my hand
I planned it out so perfectly,
So you'd never leave a girl like me
I was a fool, but now I understand

(chorus)

Here is the law of the land
You play with fire and you'll get burned
Here is the lesson I've learned
That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

(chorus, without last two lines)

Gimme one more chance
Tell me that it's not too late
Let me win your love
Darlin' please don't hesitate
If you care for me,
Be there for me

Give me one more chance
