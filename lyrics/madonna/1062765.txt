I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
I didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you
I was beat incomplete
I've been had, I was sad and blue
But you make me feel, uh
Yeah, you make me feel shiny and new


(Christina Aguilera)
Like a virgin, uh!
Touched for the very first time, oh
Like a virgin, ha!
When your heart beats next to mine, oh oh oh yeah

(Britney Spears &amp; Christina Aguilera)
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
