Here comes the sun
(here comes the sun)
I'm tired of coming undone
(oh, coming undone)
There's been so much darkness
Too much of the time
I think it's a sign
(must be a sign)


Here comes the rain
(Here comes the rain)
Wash away all the pain
(wash away the pain)
Coming together, going apart
I want you to stay
(Hope you wanna stay)


Always the bride's maid, never the bride
Two steps behind, you've got too much pride
Always supporting, never the star
Get it together, cause the beat goes on

On and on and on the beat goes (8x)


Here comes my hand...
(here comes your hand)
Take it while you can...
(take it while you can)
Ill throw you some rope
if it will give you hope
want you to understand....
(understand)

Here comes your smile
(here comes your smile)
Hope it stays for awhile
(stays for awhile)
You know its contagious
It might sound outrageous
But I feel so alive...
(feel so alive)


Always the bride's maid, never the bride
Two steps behind, you've got too much pride
Always supporting, never the star
Get it together, cause the beat goes on

On and on and on the beat goes (8x)


I can't keep waiting for you
I can't keep waiting [take it down]
Anticipating with you

You keep me Waiting [take it up]
I can't keep waiting for you
I can't keep waiting [take it down]
Anticipating with you
You keep me Waiting


Always the bride's maid, never the bride
Two steps behind, you've got too much pride
Always supporting, never the star
Get it together, cause the beat goes on

On and on and on the beat goes (8x)


I can't keep waiting for you
I can't keep waiting [take it down]
Anticipating with you
You keep me Waiting [take it up]
I can't keep waiting for you
I can't keep waiting [take it down]
Anticipating with you

Cause see the beat goes on


Always the bride's maid, never the bride
Two steps behind, you've got too much pride
Always supporting, never the star
Get it together, cause the beat goes on

On and on and on the beat goes (8x)

I can't keep waiting for you
I can't keep waiting [take it down]
Anticipating with you
You keep me Waiting [take it up]
I can't keep waiting for you
I can't keep waiting [take it down]
Anticipating with you

Cause see the beat goes on
