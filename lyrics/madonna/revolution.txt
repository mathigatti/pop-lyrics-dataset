I'm a poet
You're a thief
Welcome to my side of the street
Drink my wine
Free the best
We're all fighters


In the revolution
It's calling out your name
It's a constitution
And struggles all the same
Who can you blame?
The revolution

It's our job
We have no choice
Change the system
Use your voice
Don't look back, no regrets
Strap your boots on

It's a revolution
It's calling out your name
It's a constitution
Struggles all the same
Who can you blame?
The revolution

Ain't no stopping us today
Better watch out
You're in the way
We're the children of the future
Haven't your heard?

'Bout the revolution
And it's calling out your name
In a constitution
And our struggles all the same
Who can you blame?
The revolution

Ain't no stopping us today
Better watch out
You're in the way
We're the children of the future
Haven't your heard? 'bout the revolution
