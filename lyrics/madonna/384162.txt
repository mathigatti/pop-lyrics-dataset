What you gonna do when your love is gone?
Who you gonna play when the game has ended?
Where you gonna go when the bird has flown?
How you gonna play when you're all alone?


Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love

What you gonna do when you're on your own?
What you gonna have when you got no place to call your own?
What you gonna try when your cover is blown?
How you gonna fly when your wings are broken? 

Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love

Don't let it get you down 
Keep the fighting spirit 
And turn your head around
Don't let it take you in
Keep the fighting spirit 
And you'll begin again

Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love
