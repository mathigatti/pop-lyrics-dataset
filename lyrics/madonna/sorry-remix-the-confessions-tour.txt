Speak
Don't say forgive me
(forgive me)
Don't say you're sorry
I can't take it anymore
Can't take it, can't take it
Can't take it, can't take it anymore


I've listened to your lies and all you stories
Talk
And I, and I can't take it anymore
Can't take it, can't take it
Can't take it, can't take it anymore

Don't say forgive me
I've heard it all before 

Don't say you're sorry
I've seen it all before
And I (And I)
I've heard it all before

Don't talk, don't speak
Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
Don't

Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
Don't talk, don't speak (sorry, sorry)
