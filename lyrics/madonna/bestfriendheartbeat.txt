You know I feel it in my heartbeat!
I feel it in my heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
My heartbeat!


You know I feel it in my heartbeat!
I feel it in my heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
My heartbeat!

I miss your brain
The way you think
Think! Think! Think!
Think! Think! Think!
But I don't miss
The way you used to drink
Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
Universal law!
Seeing through my flaws!
Flaws! Flaws! Flaws!

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you! Compared to you! Compared to you! Compared to you!

You know I feel it in my heartbeat!
I feel it in my heartbeat!
My heartbeat!

You know I feel it in my heartbeat! I feel it in my heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
My heartbeat!

I miss the countryside where we used to lay
Lay! Lay!

The smell of roses on a lovely
Love-love-lovely su-su-summer day
Day! Day! Day!

Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much! Challenged! Challenged!
Challenged! Challenged!

Challenged! Intellectual

We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch!

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you! Compared to you!
Compared to you! Compared to you!

You know I feel it in my heartbeat! I feel it in my heartbeat!
My heartbeat!

You know I feel it in my heartbeat!
My heartbeat! Feel like I lost my very best friend!

You know I feel it in my heartbeat! I feel it in my heartbeat!
My heartbeat!

You know I feel it in my heartbeat!
My heartbeat!
Feel like I lost my very best friend!
It's so sad that it had to end
