When did your name
Change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hairs stand up
On the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere
Between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out


When did your name
Change from language to magic?
I write it again on the back of my hand
And I know it sounds tragic
Your name's like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
(I'm addicted to your love)
I'm addicted to your love

I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your
I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your love

Now that your name
Pumps like the blood in my veins
Pulse through my body igniting my mind
It's like MDMA
And that's o.k.
Your name's like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love

I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your
I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your love

I need this exchange
I don't care if you think that I'm strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I'm willing to take this chance
I need to dance

Your name's like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love

I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your
I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your love

MDNA, MDNA
