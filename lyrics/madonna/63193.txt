I ran from my house that cannot contain me 
From the man that I cannot keep 
From my mother who haunts me, even though she's gone 
From my daughter that never sleeps 
I ran from the noise and the silence 
From the traffic on the streets 


I ran to the treetops, I ran to the sky 
Out to the lake, into the rain that matted my hair 
And soaked my shoes and skin 
Hid my tears, hid my fears 

I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees 
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me 

I ran past the churches and the crooked old mailbox 
Past the apple orchards and the lady that never talks 
Up into the hills, I ran to the cemetery 
And held my breath, and thought about your death 

I ran to the lake, up into the hills 
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still 
And I saw the crumbling tombstones 
All forgotten names 

I tasted the rain, I tasted my tears 
I cursed the angels, I tasted my fears 

And the ground gave way beneath my feet 
And the earth took me in her arms 
Leaves covered my face 
Ants marched across my back 
Black sky opened up, blinding me 

I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees 
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me 
I ran to the lakes and up to the hill 
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still 

And I smelled her burning flesh 
Her rotting bones 
Her decay 

I ran and I ran 
I'm still running away
