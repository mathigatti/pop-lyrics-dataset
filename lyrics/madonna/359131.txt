The actress hasn't learned the lines you'd like to hear.
She's sad for her country.
Sad to be defeated by her own weak body. Evita! Evita! Evita!I want to tell the people of Argentina
I've decided I should decline
All the honors and titles you've pressed me to take
For I'm contented let me simply go on
As the woman who brings her people to the heart of Peron!Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder
For you to see me
I'm Argentina
And always will beHave I said too much? There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know that every word is true
