Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the wind not to blow
Cause you said so, humm


Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time, no, no
Let it fall by the way
But don't leave me where I lay down

Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not but
Please, don't tell me to stop

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who bout' that life?
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Cause we run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody

Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
Cause we came to have so much fun now
Got somebody here might get some now

If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a hell no?
Cause we gonna go all night
Till we see the sunlight, alright

Tell me love isn't true
(Cause we won't stop)
It's just something that we do
(Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who bout' that life?)

Tell me everything I'm not but
(And we can't stop
And we won't stop)
Please don't tell me to stop
(Cause we run things, things don't run we)
Don't ever tell me to stop
(Don't take nothing from nobody)

Please, don't (And we won't stop)
Please, don't
(Can't you see it's we who own the night?)
Please, don't tell me to stop
(Can't you see it's we who bout' that life?)

Don't you ever
(And we can't stop
And we won't stop)
Don't you ever tell me to stop
(Cause we run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody)

Please don't
Please don't
Please don't tell me to stop
Don't you ever
Don't you
Ever
Don't ever tell us to stop

Don't you ever
Please don't
Please don't
Please don't tell me to stop
Don't you ever
Don't you
Ever
Don't ever tell us to stop

Don't you ever
