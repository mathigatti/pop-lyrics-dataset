Dark eyes on a dangerous face
You are a beautiful killer
We pass by the same old place
You are a beautiful killer


You don't have a life
You have blood on your hands
You can't sleep at night
And I don't understand
I don't know much about you
Are a wanted man

You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down
Cause you're a beautiful killer
With a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won't leave a trace

Do you know the reasons why
You are a beautiful killer
Hurt yourself but you never die
You are a beautiful killer

I like your silhouette
When you stand on the street
Like a samurai you can handle the heat
Makes me wanna pray for a haunted man

You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down
Cause you're a beautiful killer
With a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won't leave a trace

Can't really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that's what you've been dreaming about
Cause you're a beautiful killer
With beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

(Beautiful killer)
Can't change the past
Good guys always finish last
(Beautiful killer)
What happens now
I need to know how the story goes
Are we together?
I'll love you forever

You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down

You can call my name and I'll be around
Maybe I'll let you shoot me down
Cause you're a beautiful killer
With a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won't leave a trace

Can't really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that's what you've been dreaming about
Cause you're a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

You're a beautiful killer
But you'll never be Alain Delon
