You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
Cause I'm a bad bitch


We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping, make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah, we'll be drinking and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us

I just wanna have fun tonight
(Blow up this shit tonight)
Pull me under the flashing light
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh
Let me blow up this house tonight
(Gonna blow up)
(Blow)

We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch I'm madonna

Bitch, bitch I'm madonna
Bitch, bitch I'm madonna

We're jumping in the pool and swimming with our clothes on
I poured a beer into my shoe and got my freak on
The neighbor's pissed and says he's gonna call the five-o
If they show up then we are gonna give a good show

I just wanna go up tonight
Pull me under the flashing light
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh
Let me blow up this house tonight
(Gon' blow up)
(Blow)

Uhh, beep-beep, bitch move

We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch I'm madonna

Who do you think you are
You can't mess with this lucky star
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh
Who do you think you are

Hold up with my nose up
And that rose up in that thang up
I'm froze up, but my stove up
Cause he eatin' like it's his dinner
I run shit, I don't fall back
Cause I'm on track, I'm a sprinter
I'm bossed up, I got em awestruck
It's not a toss up, I'm the winner
Beep-beep, bitch move
'Fore I bang bang with that uz
That's miu miu on my shoes
Ain't got a thing left for me to prove
It's that bottle service all night
It's that poppin' urban just right
It's that go hard or go home zone, bitch
I'm madonna, these hoes know

We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch I'm madonna

We do it like this
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
Cause I'm a bad bitch
Who do you think you are (x4)
(Cause I'm a bad bitch) (x4)

Go hard or go home zone, bitch
I'm madonna, these hoes know
