What are you waiting for?
Nobody's gonna show you how
Why wait for someone else
To do what you can do right now?


Got no boundaries and no limits
If there's excitement, put me in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me

Don't stop me now
Don't need to catch my breath
I can go on and on and on

When the lights go down
And there's no one left
I can go on and on and on

Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now

They say that a good thing never lasts
And then it has to fall
Those are the the people that did not
Amount to much at all

Give me a bassline and I'll shake it
Give me a record and I'll break it
There's no beginning and no ending
Give me a chance to go and I'll take it

Don't stop me now
Don't need to catch my breath
I can go on and on and on

When the lights go down
And there's no one left
I can go on and on and on

Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now

Watch this

Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid
Don't stop it (what?)

Get what they say?

They'd do it too
If they were you
You done it all before
It ain't nothing new

You're only here to win
