Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries


I know how it feels to be the talk of the town
I'm not gonna let you go and run around
I need to know that you'll be true to me
'Cause that's the way, that's the way it's got to be

Why can't you give your promise to me
Is love so blind that you cannot see
I'm trying hard not to walk out the door
Know that I, know that I, know that I can't take no more

Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries

No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you anyway
And if you're so sure that I'm not your kind
How come you can, how come you can just walk away

In the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, how can I, how can I keep holding on

Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries

I see the look in your eyes
I know you're hurting inside
Let me try
To make you love me again
I'll say that I knew you when
You were mine
You were mine

Each time
In the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, how can I, how can I keep holding on

I see the look in your eyes
I know you're hurting inside
Let me try
To make you love me again
I'll say that I knew you when
You were mine
You were mine

Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
Each time you break my heart again
Well I can say I knew you when [each time]
You were mine

Each time you break my heart again
Well I can say I knew you when [each time]
You were mine
Each Time you break my heart
Each Time, don't break my heart
