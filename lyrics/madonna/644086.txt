No time for love
No time...


I did not mean to make
My problems your concern
I know that time is money
It's just hard for me to learn
And it may seem a joke
For me to ask you for your help
Do you keep your heart inside a jar
Up on a shelf?

Chorus:

You got
No time
Time for love
No time for love
You got
No time
Time for love
No time

I know what goes around
Will come around as well
But how much time
Have I got left inside this hell?
I know that I can learn
A Lesson from a fool
What can I hope to learn
From someone that's so cruel?

Chorus:

You got
No time
Time for love
No time for love
You got
No time
Time for love
No time for love

Love (repeat 4 times)
