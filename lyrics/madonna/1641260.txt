Don't run away, come closer
I'll take you away from sadness
Let me lift you out of the darkness
Let me sooth your soul


The shadow of your smile stays on my mind
And every song I hear reminds me of you

Every breath, every step, I'm closer to you
Every day (every day), everything (everything) reminds me of you
I can't forget you at all

Don't be afraid, come to me
I know that you've been hurt and you're scared
Let me fill your heart up with gladness
Let me take you there

Everything you say stays in my heart
Everything I do, I'm thinking of you

Every breath, every step, I'm closer to you
Every day (every day), everything (everything) reminds me of you
I can't forget you at all

Love means letting go of fear
And I have nothing but love for you, my dear

I can't forget

Every breath (every breath), every step (every step), I'm closer to you
Every day (every day), everything (everything) reminds me of you
Every breath (every breath), every step (every step), I'm closer to you
Every day (every day), everything (everything) reminds me of, of you
I can't forget you at all
I won't forget you at all
