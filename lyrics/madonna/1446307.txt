Yes I will 
I'm the one 
I can take 
Overcome 
And embrace 
All this, misery and pain 


Take me by the hand lead me down the road 
Loosen my grip and lighten my load 
Help me take the path less traveled by, 
Help me understand the reason why 

Dear father, forgive me 
I dont know what i've done 
Dear father, please guide and protect me 
I'll return when my battle is won 

Dear father 
Yes you are 
Yes you will 
Your the one 
With me still 
Give me strength 
To undo 
All the hurting people do 

Take me by the hand lead me down the road 
Loosen my grip and lighten my load 
Help me take the path less traveled by, 
Help me understand all the reasons why 

Dear father 
Forgive me 
Dont know what ive done 
Dear father, please guide and protect me 
I'll return when my battle is won 

Without your help dear father (repeat 7 times) 

I would be all alone, in the dark 
No one to comfort me, listen to my heart 

Take me by the hand, lead me down the road 
Loosen my grip and lighten my load 
Help me take the path less traveled by 
Help me understand all the reasons why 

Dear father 
Forgive me 
Dont know what ive done 
Dear father, please guide and protect me 
I'll return when my battle is won
