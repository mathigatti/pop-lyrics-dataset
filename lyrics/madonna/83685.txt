Shoo bee doo bee doo
Ooh la la


When I look in your eyes
Baby here's what I see
I see so much confusion
And it's killing me

When I look in your eyes
Baby here's what I see
I see so much confusion
And it's killing me

Well I can't take it anymore, baby
Why don't you dry your eyes, try and realize
Love can open any door, and maybe
If you trust in me, I can make you see

Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la
Come to me baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la
Don't say maybe
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la
Come to me baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la

I can see you've been hurt before
But don't compare them to me
'Cause I can give so much more
You know you're all I see

Well I can make it on my own, baby
But I'd rather share all the love that's there
I don't want to be alone, and maybe
You will see the light, baby spend the night

Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la
Come to me baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la
Don't say maybe
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la
Come to me baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la

Come here to me baby

Well I can't take it anymore, baby
Why don't you dry your eyes, try and realize
Love can open any door, and maybe
If you trust in me, I can make you see

Shoo bee doo bee doo
Shoo bee doo bee doo, baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo
Shoo bee doo bee doo, baby

Shoo bee doo bee doo
Shoo bee doo bee doo, baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo
Shoo bee doo bee doo, baby

Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la
Come to me baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la
Don't say maybe
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la
Come to me baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la

Come to me baby (shoo bee doo bee doo)
Pretty darling (oh la la)
Don't say maybe

Come to me baby (shoo bee doo bee doo)
Pretty darling (oh la la)
Don't say maybe

Come to me baby (shoo bee doo bee doo)
Pretty darling (oh la la)
Don't say maybe

Come to me baby Ooh

Shoo bee doo bee doo
Shoo bee doo bee doo baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo
Shoo bee doo bee doo baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo
Shoo bee doo bee doo baby
