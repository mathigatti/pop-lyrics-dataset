One, two. One, two, three, four
(Take a day)
All I wanna do is have some fun
(Take a day)
Two is always gonna be better than one
(Take a day)
Come and sit with me I’m not the son
(Take a day)
Drink some wine until the day is done


Let me turn this beat around
Put my feedback on the ground
When the groove begins to play
Makes me wanna
Uh, don’t wanna live my life with no regrets
I wanna do some things you won’t forget
So dedicated I hope that you can make it
Take a day with me, get away with me

[…] As the sun that shine
Let’s stay in the clouds with this glass of wine
Can you imagine?
Hope you don’t mind me askin’
Take a day with me, run away with me
Or we can just a bang, bang, bang
Or we can just a bang, bang, bang

One, two. One, two, three, four
(Take a day)
I’ve been waited my whole life for this
(Take a day)
This is my moment, can I steal a kiss?
(Take a day)
Twenty-four hours we can get this done
(Take a day)
I like to start with some homeless fun

Baby let’s get to the groove
I can show you my best moves
Make this go away
This time we have got to…
Uh, don’t wanna live my life with no regrets
I wanna do some things you won’t forget
So dedicated I hope that you can make it
Take a day with me, get away with me

[…] As the sun that shine
Let’s stay in the clouds with this glass of wine
Can you imagine?
Hope you don’t mind me askin’
Take a day with me, run away with me
Or we can just a bang, bang, bang
Or we can just a bang, bang, bang
Take a day, take a day, take a day, take a day

One, two. One, two, three, four
Uh, don’t wanna live my life with no regrets
I wanna do some things you won’t forget
So dedicated I hope that you can make it
Take a day with me, get away with me

[…] As the sun that shine
Let’s stay in the clouds with this glass of wine
Can you imagine?
Hope you don’t mind me askin’
Take a day with me, run away with me
Or we can just a bang, bang, bang
Or we can just a bang, bang, bang
U’re so nasty
