Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I’ve been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away


I’ve been swimming in the ocean
Till I’m almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

And we can do drugs
And we can smoke weed
And we can drink whiskey
Yeah we can get high
And we can get stoned

And we can sniff glue
And we can do E
And we can drop acid
Forever been lost with no way home

Yeah we can run
And we can hide
But we won’t find the answers
If you’ll go down and you’ll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we could travel all together
And make the devil pray

Ooh, save my soul, save my soul, save my
Devil's here to fool ya

Mother Mary, can't you help me?
Cuz I’m gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have all flown away

The ground beneath my feet’s getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on, but I’m getting weaker
Watch me disappear

And we can do drugs
And we can smoke weed
And we can drink whiskey
Yeah we can get high
And we can get stoned

And we can sniff glue
And we can do E
And we can drop acid
Forever been lost with no way home

Yeah we can run
And we can hide
But we won’t find the answers
If you’ll go down and you’ll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we could travel all together
And make the devil pray

Ooh ooh ooh sing hallelujah
Ooh ooh ooh save my soul
Ooh ooh ooh the devil was here to fool ya
Until my story’s told

I said oooh sing hallelujah
Oooh, save my soul
Oooh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told
