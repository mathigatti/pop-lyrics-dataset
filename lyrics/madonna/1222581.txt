I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe those things that I have seen
I looked to the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away


All my dreams, they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

You always love me more
Miles away
I hear it in your voice
We are miles away
You're not afraid to tell me
Miles away
I guess we're at our best
We are miles away

So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away

When no one's around, then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart

Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
But it's now distance love

You always love me more
Miles away
I hear it in your voice
We're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me
Miles away
I guess we're at our best
We're miles away

So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away

I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone you'll realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you

You always love me more
Miles away
I hear it in your voice
We're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me
Miles away
I guess we're at our best
We're miles away

You always love me more
Miles away
I hear it in your voice
We're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me
Miles away
I guess we're at our best
We're miles away

So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
