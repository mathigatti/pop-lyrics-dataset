This is not a love song
Bye bye baby


I keep on waiting, anticipating
But I can't wait forever
You say you love me
You're thinking of me
But we're never together

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
This time we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

You had your chances
All your romances
And now I just don't want you
I know I love you because I hate you
And now I'd rather haunt you

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

You're so beautiful
What makes you feel exciting?
What wakes you up inside?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say bye bye

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

I don't wanna keep the bright flame
Of your ego going
So I'll just stop blowin' in the wind
To love you is a sin
Adios

Uh this is not a love song

I'd like to hurt you

What excites you?
What turns you on?
What makes you feel good?

Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say goodbye
Bye bye

The first time
And the last time
You can forget about it baby

Forget the rules
Forget the fools
Forget your fears
Forget my tears
You can forget about it baby

Bye bye baby bye bye
You can forget about it baby
'Cause it's the first time
And the last time
You'll ever see me cry

You fucked it up
