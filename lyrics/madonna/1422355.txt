Ladies (9x)

With an attitude
Fellows
That were in the mood
Don't just stand there
Let's get to it
Strike a pose
There's nothing to it

Don't just stand there
Let's get to it
Strike a pose
There's nothing to it

Vogue

Look around
Everywhere
You turn
Is heartache
It's everywhere
That you go
(Look around)
You try everything
You can to escape
The pain of life
That you know
(Life that you know)

When all else fails
And you long to be
Something better
Than you are today
I know a place
Where you
Can get away
It's called
A dance floor
And here's
What it's for So

Chorus:
Come on, vogue
Let your body
Move to the music
(Move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue
Let your body go
With the flow
(Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

All you need
Is your own imagination
So use it
That's what it's for
(That's what it's for)
Go inside
For your
Finest inspiration
Your dreams
Will open the door
(Open up the door)

It makes no difference
If you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it
Will give you new life
You're a superstar
Yes
That's what you are
You know it

Come on, vogue
Let your body
Groove to the music
(Groove to the music)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue
Let your body go
With the flow
(Go with the flow)
You know you can do it
