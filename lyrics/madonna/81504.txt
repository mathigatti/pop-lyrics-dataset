Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy
Please, be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying


The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe
Please

Papa, don't preach
I'm in trouble deep
Papa, don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
I'm gonna keep my baby

He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice
Please

Papa, don't preach
I'm in trouble deep
Papa, don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
I'm gonna keep my baby

Daddy, daddy, if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love, so, please

Papa, don't preach
I'm in trouble deep
Papa, don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby
I'm gonna keep my baby

Papa, don't preach
I'm in trouble deep
Papa, don't preach
I've been losing sleep
Papa, don't preach
I'm in trouble deep
Papa, don't preach
I've been losing sleep
I'm gonna keep my baby

Don't you stop loving me, daddy
I know, I'm keeping my baby
