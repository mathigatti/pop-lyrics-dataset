Dreamin' your whole life away
You never know what's comin'
You live from day to day


Spent all your time
Makin' sure you look just right
Someone asked you a question
But you don't even have the time

Uh oh you're society's boy
You make some little rich girl a toy
My mistake didn't think that you'd be
Another victim of a high.. society

All dressed up..
And no where to go
You spent all of your money
And you've got nothin' to show

You've got so much to offer
Oh it's just a cryin' shame
You can't buy love with your money
It's not the same
Oh

Uh oh you're society's boy
You make some little rich girl a toy
My mistake didn't think that you'd be
Another victim of a high.. society

Your high.... society..
You can't give.. your love to me..
Your high.. society..
You can't give.. your love to me...
