I, yi yi yi (repeat 3 times)

Chorus:

I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too,
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you


Da da, da da, da da da

I'll give you all the love I want in return
But half a love is all I feel, sweet darling
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me no more
But I'm gonna change your mind
Some way, somehow

(chorus)

Da da, da da, da da da

One way love is just a fantasy
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life
Oh baby, don't you wanna care?
Ain't it lonely out there?

(chorus)

I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too,
Want me baby, just like I want you.
Da da, da da, da da da

(Spoken:)
I want you, the right way
Want me baby
Don't play with something you should cherish for life
