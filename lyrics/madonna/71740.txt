I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover


I don't know where I stand with you
I never ever make any plans with you
I don't know what I mean to you
The only thing I know is I dream of you

And all that I know (all that I know)
Is I just don't understand (just don't understand)
Why my, hmmmm, happiness always lies
In the palm of your hand, but

I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

Sometimes I know what you're thinking next
But wouldn't it be better if I loved you less?
Sometimes I think that I made you up
But wouldn't it be better if I gave you up?

And all that I know (all that I know)
Is I just don't understand (just don't understand)
Why my, hmmmm, happiness always lies
In the palm of your hand, but

I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

Are you surprised?

Tell me whatcha want, tell me whatcha need
Tell me whatcha want, tell me whatcha need
I, I betcha I, I give you whatcha need
Take a walk within me, venture through the dark sea
Can't you see? I need you beside me
Don't you see? I want you to want me

And all that I know (tell me whatcha want, tell me whatcha need) (all that I know)
Is I just don't understand (just don't understand)
Why my, hmmmm, happiness (tell me whatcha want, tell me whatcha need) always lies
In the palm of your hand, but

I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

Are you surprised?

I could be your sister, I could be your mother

But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

Are you surprised? Are you?
