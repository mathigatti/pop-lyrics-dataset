The madness of love
And what we'll do for it
Two walk through the fire
And just go through with it
To cancel your doubt
And fly into the sun
To go without
And feel like you're the lucky one


The mad things we do for love
We're caught in a world of lies
I just had the strangest dream
We won't get to do this twice

Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Jas kana medess medess pala latte (repeat)

The madness of love
And where we'll go for it
To travel the world
And lose control for it
To give it away
And never hesitate
Just knowing one day
It will reciprocate

The mad things we do for love
The heavens are falling through
I'm caught in the world of lie
There's nothing that I can do

Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Jas kana medess medess pala latte (repeat)

It's a mad mad world
All the things you make me feel
It's a mad mad world
Had a drink so I could forget
It's a mad mad world
All the noise inside of my head
It's a mad mad world
I would never change this moment
It's a mad mad world
All the things you make me feel
It's a mad mad world
Had a drink so I could forget
It's a mad mad world
All the noise inside of my head
It's a mad mad world
I would never change this moment


Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Jas kana medess medess pala latte (repeat)
