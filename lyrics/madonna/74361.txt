Despair, regret, and tenderness
Is what I feel for you
I loved you from the very start
What else could I do


You read my mind, you made me cry
Time stood still
And now I know the reasons why
Time stood still

Maybe you're the next best thing to happen
All the things we might have been

A flame becomes a fading light
That burns inside my heart
And like a castle in the sand
It had to fall apart

You made me laugh, you gave me hope
It's over now
Our happiness went up in smoke
It's over now
