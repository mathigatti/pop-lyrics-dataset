I've got to tell you what I'm feelin' today
You strike my fancy in a most peculiar way


Ah you can make 24 hours into quite a day
My heart attacks my equilibrium
It feels so natural though we've only just begun
Ah I can't wait 24 hours seem so far away

24 hours 24 hours 24 hours
24 hours 24 hours 24 hours seem so far away

I can't wait another day to have you here
I'm afraid if I wait too long you might disappear

I've got to pull you into what you're doin' to me
You've got what it takes to be my fantasy
Ah you can make 24 hours into quite a day

24 hours 24 hours 24 hours
24 hours 24 hours 24 hours seem so far away

I can't wait another day to have you here
I'm afraid if I wait too long you might disappear

24 hours 24 hours 24 hours
24 hours 24 hours 24 hours seem so far away

24 hours 24 hours 24 hours
24 hours 24 hours 24 hours seem so far away
