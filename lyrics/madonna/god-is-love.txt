If God is love and love is God
Then why you're actin' like it's not
Everyone's afraid to change
Different doesn't make it strange


Who decides what's right or wrong?
Religion shouldn't separate
Or tell us who we're supposed to hate
We can't deny the way we're made

Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, I what
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
The truth is like the air you're breathing

Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, what you
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
Never stop, never stop

If God is love and love is God
No magician sitting in the cloud
Never let us a set of rules
Determine what you say or do

Red's the colour we all bleed
It's all agree to disagree
It's in every holy book
Love your neighbor like you should

Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, I what
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
The truth is like the air you're breathing

Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, what you
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing

Don't you ever stop

Moses had to lead the people
Couldn't be slaves forever in egypt
Jesus didn't die for your sins
So you could treat other people like shit

Mohammed heard, give your call
And have to save the people from falling
All the prophets say the same words
God is love and love should come first

Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, I what
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
The truth is like the air you're breathing

Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing
In what, what you
What you believe in
Never stop, never stop
Never stop believing

Don't you ever stop
