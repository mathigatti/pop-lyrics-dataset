I have read somewhere in a book
That you can change your destiny
If you work enough
You can change your lucky
Tell me where I have to be
So I can find this liberty


Don't push me to the left
Don't push me to the ritht
I don't wanna have to fight
Cause I know the justice is coming right

Gather up your hose
Gather up your dreams
Just to stay alive is harder than it seems
I lay awake at night wondering what to do
Then this thought, it came to me
We're all changed to the red and blue

Don't push me to the left
Don't push me to the ritht
I don't wanna have to fight
Cause I know the justice is coming right

Don't push me to the left
Don't push me to the ritht
Just push me straihg ahead
And you'll find the justice is coming right

To the left
To the right
Have to fight
coming right

To the left
To the right
Straight ahead
Coming right

I have learned nothing is for free
If my ship goes down
Noone's gonna come for me
Soldiers, they take arms
And ready for the slaughter
God forgive us all our sins
We were once your sons and daughters

Don't push me to the left
Don't push me to the ritht
I don't wanna have to fight
Cause I know the justice is coming right

Don't push me to the left
Don't push me to the ritht
Just push me straihg ahead
And you'll find the justice is coming right

To the left
To the right
Have to fight
Coming right

To the left
To the right
Straight ahead
Coming right
