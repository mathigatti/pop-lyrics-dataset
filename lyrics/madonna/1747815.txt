Hey, little girl
When you grow up
Don't make the same mistakes I did


Learn to say no
I've had not
And nothing and no one can harm you

Follow your heart and you'll be fine
Follow your dreams and take all over time that you need

Little girl
Never look back
Don't let your memories hunt you

Learn to be strong
All on your on
Make sure you get what you want

Follow your heart and you'll be fine
Follow your dreams and take all over the time that you need

Little queen
Wearing your crown
Leave on your sadness behind you

Don't wast your time
Suffering fools
Wanted prince charming will find you

Hey, little girl
When you grow up
Don't make the same mistakes I did

Learn to say no
I've had not
And nothing and no one can hurt you

Follow your heart and you'll be fine
Follow your dreams and take all over time that you need
