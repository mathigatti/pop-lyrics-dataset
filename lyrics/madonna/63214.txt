Hey Mr. DJ
Put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby


Do you like to boogie woogie
Do you like to boogie woogie
Do you like to boogie woogie
Do you like my acid rock

Hey Mr. DJ
Put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby

And when the music starts
I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy

Music, music, music
Music makes the people come together
(Never gonna stop)
Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel
(Never gonna stop)

Don't think of yesterday
And I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie woogie
Uh uh

It's like riding on the wind
And it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in
Got to have it everyday

Music makes the people come together
(Never gonna stop)
Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel
(Never gonna stop)

Hey Mr. DJ
(Never gonna stop)

Do you like to boogie woogie
Do you like to boogie woogie
Do you like to boogie woogie
Do you like my acid rock
