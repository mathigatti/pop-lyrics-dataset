I'm no stranger to deception
I have lied and been lied to
I'm no paragon of virtue
But I wanna be with you
I have never been a righteous soul
And I don't pretend I am (I hope you don't, I hope you don't)
But I walk the line when I'm with you (with you)
'Cause you make me believe I can (come on up)


But we're running out of options (option)
And we're running out of time (out of time)
And I don't know if it's you or me (or me)
But it's time to speak your mind (yeah)

Because I'm travelling across the sky
When you're with me, your hand in mine
Our honesty will make us fly
And we'll be travelling across the sky

Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

I'm not good at keeping quiet (quiet)
And I can't keep this tied down (don't tie it down, tie it down)
But it's got to count for something (yeap)
That we're still hanging around ('cause I'm with you, baby)
If you need an explanation for (yeah)
What's false and what is true (you gotta talk it to me)
Than I'd rather stop the world than think
That I could not be with you (talk to me, talk to me)

But we're running out of options (option)
And we're running out of time (out of time)
And I don't know if it's you or me (or me)
But it's time to speak your mind (yeah)

Because I'm travelling across the sky
When you're with me, your hand in mine
Our honesty will make us fly
And we'll be travelling across the sky

Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh (Travelling across the sky)
Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh (Travelling across the sky)
Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh (Travelling across the sky)
Across the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh (Travelling across the sky)
