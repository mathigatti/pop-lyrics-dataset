And it feels like
And it feels like
Feels like home


Life is a mystery everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like

And it feels like
And it feels like
Feels like home

Life is a mystery everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

And it feels like
And it feels like
Feels like home

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying

I close my eyes
Oh, God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

And it feels like
And it feels like
Feels like home

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery

Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer
No choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer
I'll take you there (I'm gonna take you there)
It's like a dream to me 

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

And it feels like
And it feels like
Feels like home

And it feels like
And it feels like
Feels like home
