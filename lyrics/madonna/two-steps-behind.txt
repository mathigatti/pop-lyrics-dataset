You're copycat, get back
I'm always on your mind
Take a photograph like that
Always ahead of my time
I'll give you a heart attack, bumbaclat
Where is my royalty?
You're a pretty girl, I'll give ya that
Stealing my recipe


Here we go again
In your fantasy
You can try it all
But you can't be me
You can walk the walk
Even talk the talk
But you'll always be
Two steps behind me

In my shadow
Two steps behind me
Out of ammo, you're never gonna be
On my level
Two steps behind me
In my shadow
You just wanna be me

Like a sister all messed up
Who's gonna help you out?
It's a ugly look, princess
What are you all about?
Did you study way hard enough?
Trying to be a bust?
Yeah that's cool and all now get in line
Tickets are gonna cost

Here we go again
In your fantasy
You can try it all
But you can't be me
You can walk the walk
Even talk the talk
But you'll always be
Two steps behind me

In my shadow
Two steps behind me
Out of ammo, you're never gonna be
On my level
Two steps behind me
In my shadow
You just wanna be me

Never gonna be me
Just wanna be me
Just wanna be me
Never gonna be me
Just wanna be me

Here we go again
In your fantasy
You can try it all
But you can't be me
You can walk the walk
Even talk the talk
But you'll always be
Two steps behind me

In my shadow
Two steps behind me
Out of ammo, you're never gonna be
On my level
Two steps behind me
In my shadow
You just wanna be me

Never gonna be me
Just wanna be me
Just wanna be me
Never gonna be me
Just wanna be me

Just wanna be me
