No one loves you more than me
Baby we got history
Let's move forward, don't look back
I'll make up for what you lack


Don't you hear me calling
Can't you see I'm falling
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'

Satisfy ya, entertain ya
Light your fire, that's my nature

Baby let's not hesitate
I'd like to negociate
I can make your dreams come true
Here is what you gotta do

Don't you hear me calling
Can't you see I'm falling
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'

Let me ask you something
If I speak my mind
You think you're ready to hear it
Okay come with me

Don't close the door
Cause I love you more
Stay here with me
Where you're supposed to be
When we're together
It's thunder and lightning
The way I love you is frightening
Just watch out for what you say
If we just communicate
Everything will be okay

Don't you hear me calling
Can't you see I'm falling
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'

Satisfy ya, entertain ya
Light your fire, that's my nature
I want to satisfy ya, entertain ya
Light your fire, that's my nature

You heard it, that's my nature
Take it back

I'm calling for you baby
I'm calling, guess I'm crazy
I'm falling for you baby
I'm falling, guess I'm crazy

I'm calling for you baby
I'm calling, guess I'm crazy
I'm falling for you baby
I'm falling, guess I'm crazy

I'm calling for you baby
I'm calling, guess I'm crazy
I'm falling for you baby
I'm falling, guess I'm crazy
