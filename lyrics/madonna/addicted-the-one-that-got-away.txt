I'm under your spell
Pulled me in, took me down with your poisonous touch
You brought me to hell
Watch me burn with a fever that I love so much


You're watching me crawl
I get your kicks, take your fist
Put it right through the wall

The drug that I crave
You're so clever, you're the devil
Watch it slip it away

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and started to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

Your truth is a lie
Bitter fruit, bitter sweet
But, oh, so divine
Now that I've had a taste
Like a moth to a flame, I'm addicted to pain

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and started to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted to the one that got away

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and started to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted to the one that got away
