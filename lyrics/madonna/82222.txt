There's a hole in my heart, no one else can fill it
There's a feeling I have, no one can replace
There's a taste in my mouth, no one else can give me
There's a song that I hear, no one can erase
Why would I want them to?
I'm still looking back at you
Why would I want them to be you?


You will always be a part of me
What you love can never let you go
You will always be inside of me
Like a flower you grow

There's a strange melody, sends me straight to heaven
There's a voice in my head, no one else can hear
There's a prayer that I say, always brings me closer
To the presence of you, to always have you near

No one can take your place
I'm still looking at your face
No one can take the place of you

You will always be a part of me
What you love can never let you go
You will always be inside of me
Like a flower you grow
Like a flower you grow

Why would I want them to?
I'm still looking back at you
Why would I want them to be you?

You will always be a part of me
What you love can never let you go
You will always be inside of me
Like a flower you grow

You will always be a part of me
What you love can never let you go
You will always be inside of me
Like a flower you grow
