I feel it
It's coming


Rain
Feel it on my fingertips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love is coming down like
Rain
Wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real

Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time, I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain
Feel it on my fingertips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love is coming down like
Rain
Wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

When you looked into my eyes
And you said goodbye, could you see my tears?
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds
Bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light
I'll wait for the sun till I feel your

Rain
Feel it on my fingertips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love is coming down like
Rain
Wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say, "never go away"

Waiting for the hardest thing
It's strange, I feel like I've known you before
I tell myself if I believe in you
And I want to understand you
In the dream of you more and more
With all my heart and all my soul
When I'm with you
That by sheer force of will
I feel like a magical child
I will raise you from the ground
Everything strange
And without a sound you'll appear
Everything wild
And surrender to me, to love

Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time, I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like

Rain
Feel it on my fingertips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love is coming down like
Rain
Wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

Rain
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain

Stuck on a mountain top
Waiting for you to call my name
Rain
