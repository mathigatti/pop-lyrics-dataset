Miss you most of all
When all those autumn leaves start to fall
Drifting by my window
They come up over the wall


Why does a good thing have to do end
Can't see it happen where and when
Cycle of change can be so cruel
I've got no one to blame I'm just a fool, you know

Hold on they keep on telling me
Something's good is gonna come
Bread and gold has put its spell on me
And old man winter's gonna come
You know he keeps on blocking off the sun

Miss you most of all
When they burn those bonfires tall
Smoke and ashes fill the air and the
Harvesters are everywhere
No time to waste, let's drink the wine
Don't let the fruit rot on the vine
When the sun is big and fiery it goes, you know
That is the time I miss you the most, they say

Hold on they keep on telling me
Something's good is gonna come
Bread and gold has put its spell on me
And old man winter's gonna come
You know he keeps on blocking off the sun

Cold wind is howling and there's
Darkness creeps in our bones
Seasons change, why didn't we
Come on bring that summer back to me

Hold on they keep on telling me
Something's good is gonna come
Bread and gold has put its spell on me
And old man winter's gonna come
You know he keeps on blocking off the sun

Tell me why does he always have to come?
