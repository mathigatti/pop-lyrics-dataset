History

Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh
I looked all around the world
[I looked all around the world]
Nobody has it better than we do
[Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh]
One thing I don't Understand
Why don't we help more people
Cause we can.
[Uh huh, Uh Huh]


Why are we seperated?
Defined by our greed and hatred
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting.
Why aren't we all together
Lets end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting.
[Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh]

How many tragedies
[How many tragedies]
Will we see before we come together
[Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh]
It's easy to forget
We have the power to make things better
[Uh Huh, Uh Huh]

Why are we seperated?
Defined by our greed and hatred
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting.
Why aren't we all together
[Why don't we unite]
Lets end this fight forever
[Let's give up the fight]
Why are we still divided?
[I don't understand]
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

I have a dream
But dreams are not for free
We all need to change
Or just repeat History
If we were one
Well it's easier said then done
We can play a part
Make a brand new start
Come together
Live forever
[Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh]
