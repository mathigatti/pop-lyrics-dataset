Just one kiss on my lips
Was all it took to seal the future
Just one look from your eyes
Was like a certain kind of torture


Once upon a time
There was a boy and there was a girl
Just one touch from your hands
Was all that took to make me fall turn

Forbidden love
Always supposed to be together
Forbidden love
Forbidden love

Forbidden love
We sealed our destiny forever
Forbidden love
Forbidden love

Just one smile on your face
Was all it took to change my fortune
Just one word from your mouth
Was all I needed to be certain

Once upon a time
There was a boy and there was a girl
Hearts that intertwine
They lived in a different kind or world

Forbidden love
Always supposed to be together
Forbidden love
Forbidden love
Forbidden love
We sealed our destiny forever
Forbidden love
Forbidden love

Just one kiss
Just one touch
Just one look

Forbidden love
Always supposed to be together
Forbidden love
Forbidden love

Forbidden love
We sealed our destiny forever
Forbidden love
Forbidden love

Forbidden love
Always supposed to be together
Forbidden love
Forbidden love

Forbidden love
We sealed our destiny forever
Forbidden love
Forbidden love

Just one kiss (five)
Just one touch (four)
Just one look (three)
Just one word (two)
One
