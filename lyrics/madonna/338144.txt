Now I can tell you about success, about fame
About the rise and the fall of all the stars in the sky
Don't it make you smile?
That it will be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?


Now I can tell you about the place I belong
You know it won't last long
And all those lights they will turn down
That it will be
Let it be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?

Now I can see things for what they really are
I guess I'm not that far
I'm at the point of no return
Just watch me burn!

That it will be
Just let it be
Oh let it be
Then it will be (Just let it be)
Just let it be (That it will be)
Oh let it be (Won't you let it be?)
Let it be (Won't you let it be?)

Now I can tell you the place that I belong
It won't last long
The lights, they will turn down

Oh let it be
Oh let it be
Oh let it be (Won't you let it be?)
Oh let it be (You've got to let it be)
Just let it be (Anyone can see)
Won't you let it be? (That it will be)

Just watch me burn
Oh let it be
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?
Won't you let it be? (Just let it be)
Oh let it be (Let it be)
Just let it be (Won't you let it be?)
Won't you let it be? (Won't you let it be?)
Won't you let it be?

Now I can tell you
Tell you tell youâ€¦
About success, about fame
About fame, about fame
About fame

Won't you let it be?
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?
