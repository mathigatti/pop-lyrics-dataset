(Don't you feel sorry, don't you feel sorry...)

Broken like a crooked smile
A little hunched over but I walked that mile
I've woken from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen


Don't you feel sorry for me
'Cause I'm right where the universe wants me to be
A lesson that I needed to learn
But that doesn't mean that it doesn't burn

Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry for me
'Cause I won't change my story
Don't take all my glory
Don't you feel sorry for me

Tied up with leather and rope
A little bit of medicine to give me hope
I'm empty like a smoking gun
It's gonna take a while to heal the damage done

Don't you feel sorry for me
'Cause I'm right where the universe wants me to be
A lesson that I needed to learn (A lesson that I needed to learn)
But that doesn't mean that it doesn't burn

Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry for me
'Cause I won't change my story
Don't take all my glory
Don't you feel sorry for me

(A lesson that I needed to learn)
No pain, no gain, no defective parts
No dirty business, no forgiveness, no broken heart

(Don't you feel sorry)

Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry for me
'Cause I won't change my story
Don't take all my glory
Don't you feel sorry for me

Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry for me
'Cause I won't change my story
Don't take all my glory
Don't you feel sorry for me
