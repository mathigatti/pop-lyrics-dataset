Just take me with all my stupid flaws
Changing me is like shooting in the dark
Patience please, I'll never be as perfect as you want me to
Believe me, I want it just as bad
Forgive me, wish I could change the past
Take it cause I'll never be as perfect as you want


I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars, with all my beautiful scars
Love me with all of my flaws, my beautiful scars

Don't judge me, just gotta let me be
Accept me although I'm incomplete
My imperfections make me unique
That's my relief

I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars, with all my beautiful scars
Love me with all of my flaws, my beautiful scars

Never says never, anything is possible
Always been a rebel, overcoming obstacles
I can't give you perfect but I can give you forever

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
I think they're beautiful

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars, with all my beautiful scars
Love me with all of my flaws, my beautiful scars
My beautiful scars, my beautiful scars
