Some girls can do anything
Whole world hanging on a string
She's flawless, so fresh and clean
(Like a virgin, sweet and clean)


Some girls got an attitude
Fake tits and a nasty mood
Hot shit when she's in the nude
(In the naughty naked nude)

Some girls got a sexy slur
One drink and its all a blur
Cash now if you wanna flirt
(Cash or credit it's gonna hurt)

Some girls going off the deep end
Some girls living for the weekend
Some girls like to get the freak on

Some girls make a scene
Shoot their mouth and talk obscene
Crying in the limousine
(Crying in the limousine)
Some girls make you feel
Like a rocket, hard as steel
Some girls only ever like to tease
(Some girls only like to tease)

Some girls are not like me
I'm everything you ever dreamed of
I got you begging: Baby, please
I got you begging: Baby, please

Some girls want to call the shots
Come first, wanna be on top
Gotta work til you hit the spot
(Spot, spot, spot)

Some girls have a filthy mouth
All talk and they never stop
Just take and it's not enough
(Too much is never enough)

Some girls make a scene
Shoot their mouth and talk obscene
Crying in the limousine
(Crying in the limousine)
Some girls make you feel
Like a rocket, hard as steel
Some girls only ever like to tease
(Some girls only like to tease

Some girls are not like me
I'm everything you ever dreamed of
(Your worst nightmare)
I got you begging: Baby, please
I got you begging: Baby, please

(A wet dream
Are you big and hard enough?)

Wrap your arms around my neck
It's time to deal so cut the deck
If you want to play this game with me

I'm not like all the rest
Some girls are second best
Put your lovin' to the test you'll see

Some girls are not like me
I never wanna be like some girls
Some girls are just for free
I never wanna be like some girls

Some girls are not like me
I'm everything you ever dreamed of
I got you begging 'baby please'
I got you begging 'baby please'
(Got their fuck-me-porn-star heels on)

Some girls are not like me
I'm better than you ever dreamed of
I got you, baby, on your knees
I got you begging 'baby please'

Some girls are not like me
I never wanna be like some girls
(Got their fuck-me-porn-star heels on)
Some girls are just for free
I never wanna be like some girls

(Gettin' freakay)
