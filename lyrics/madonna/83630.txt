Crimes of passion
Give me such a sweet reaction
Oh, crimes of passion
Give me so much satisfaction


Don't play dumb with me, I know you know the score
I wait impatiently, tonight I'm yours
Show you what it's like to have your cake and eat it too
I think you'll like what I'm gonna do, oh

Crimes of passion
Give me such a sweet reaction
Oh, crimes of passion
Give me so much satisfaction

I'm not the type of girl who likes to settle down
Some people say that I just want to fool around
Once I get a taste I want more
I'm like a baby in a candy store, oh

Crimes of passion
Give me such a sweet reaction
Oh, crimes of passion
Give me so much satisfaction

There's no reason to feel guilty
It's too late now, what's done is done
If you can keep it a secret, darlin'
We can have some fun

I always want the things that I can't get
I don't believe in rules that you can't bend
Even when you say you've got someone at home
Tell her tonight that she's on her own
There's no reason to feel guilty
It's too late now, what's done is done
If you can keep it a secret, darlin'
We can have some fun

Ohh

Crimes of passion
Give me such a sweet reaction
Oh, crimes of passion
Give me so much satisfaction

Oh, crimes of passion (sweet reaction)
Give me such a sweet reaction (so much satisfaction)
Oh, crimes of passion (sweet reaction)
Give me so much satisfaction
Oh, crimes of passion (sweet reaction)
Give me such a sweet reaction (so much satisfaction)
Oh, crimes of passion (sweet reaction)
