Strike a pose
Strike a pose
Vogue, vogue, vogue
Vogue, vogue, vogue


Don't just stand there
Don't, don't, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there
Don't, don't, don't just stand there

Ladies, ladies, ladies
Let's get to it
Strike a pose
There's nothing to it

Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor, and here's what it's for, so

Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music (move to the music)
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow (go with the flow)
You know you can do it

All you need is your own imagination
So use it that's what it's for (that's what it's for)
Go inside, for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door (open up the door)
It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it will give you new life
You're a superstar, yes, that's what you are, you know it

Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music (move to the music)
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow (go with the flow)
You know you can do it

Don't just stand there, let's get to it
Strike a pose, there's nothing to it

Vogue, vogue, vogue
Vogue, vogue, vogue

Strike a pose, there's nothing to it
