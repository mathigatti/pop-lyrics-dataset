I lived my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say: Told you so, told you so
Why can't you be like the other girls?
I said: Oh, no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever be


Thought I belong to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
I tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said: Oh, no, I want more
That's not what I'm looking for!

So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow, I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depths
Of my rebel heart

I spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say: Look at you, look at you!
Trying to be so provocative
I said: Oh, yeah, that was me
All the things I did just to be seen

I've grown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go, I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said: Oh, yeah, this is me!
And I'm right here where I wanna be

I said: Hell, yeah! This is me
Right where I'm supposed to be

So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through darkness, somehow, I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in my rebel heart

So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through darkness, somehow, I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depths
Of my rebel heart
