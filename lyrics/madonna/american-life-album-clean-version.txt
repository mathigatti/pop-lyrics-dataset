Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?


I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song

This type of modern life - Is it for me?
This type of modern life - Is it for free?
So, I went into a bar looking for sympathy
A little company - I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said it's always been the same
This type of modern life - Is not for me?
This type of modern life - Is not for free?

American life
I live the american dream
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream

I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life - Is it for me?
This type of modern life - Is it for free?

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

American life
I live the american dream
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream

I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I tried to find a friend
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

Oh (4x)

I'm drinking a Soy latte
I get a double shot
It goes right through my body
And you know
I'm satisfied

I drive my mini cooper
And I'm feeling super-doper
Yo they tell I'm a trooper
And you know I'm satisfied

I do Yoga and Pilates
And the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies
And you know I'm satisfied

I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysic's --- is dope
And if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied

I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?

I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name?
