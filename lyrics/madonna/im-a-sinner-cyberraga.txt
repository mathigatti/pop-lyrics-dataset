Like the sun, like the light, like a flame
Like a storm, I burn through everything
Like a bomb in the night, like a train
Thundering through the hills, let it rain


Ah woo-oo, ah woo-oo
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
Ah woo-oo, ah woo-oo
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

All the boys, all the boys and girls wanna be like us tonight
All the boys, all the boys and girls ride the magic bus tonight

I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I like it that way

Like the moon with no light of my own
Search the sky for a place to call home
I woke up with my head in the fire
Get my kicks when I'm walking the wire

Ah woo-oo, ah woo-oo
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
Ah woo-oo, ah woo-oo
I'm a sinner, I like it that way

All the boys, all the boys and girls wanna be like us tonight
All the boys, all the boys and girls ride the magic bus tonight

I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I like it that way

I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner, praise the Lord
I like it that way

Hail Mary, full of grace
Get down on your knees and pray
Jesus Christ hanging on the cross
Died for our sins
It's such a loss

St. Christopher, find my way
I'll be coming home one day
St. Sebastian, don't you cry
Let those poison arrows fly

St. Anthony, lost and found
Thomas Aquinas, stand your ground
All the Saints and Holy Men
Catch me before I sin again

Oh oh woah, oh oh woah
I'm a sinner
I like it that way
Oh oh woah, oh oh woah
I'm a sinner
I like it that way

I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I like it that way
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
I like it that way

You're a sinner, you're a sinner
You're a sinner you like it that way
We're all sinners, we're all sinners
We're all sinners
