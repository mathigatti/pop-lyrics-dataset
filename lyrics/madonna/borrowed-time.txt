Do we need to start a war?
Do we need to take a side?
If we open up our eyes
Realize that we are dying


Is it all worth fighting for?

It all comes down to
Who's wrong or right
Who's black or white
It doesn't matter what you're bleeding for
Straight or bi
Your God or mine
It doesn't matter underneath it all

Cause we're only here to love
Like there's no tomorow
So let's live each moment like
Our time is only borrowed

(Our time is only borrowed)

(Our time is only borrowed)

Do we need to build a bomb?
Do we need to fire a gun?
If you have to stand your ground
It's a war that can't be won

Is it all worth dying for?
It all comes down to

Who's rich or poor
Virgin or whore
It doesn't matter what you're praying for
Death or life
Your truth or mine
It doesn't matter underneath it all

Cause we're only here to love
Like there's no tomorow
So let's live each moment like
Our time is only borrowed

(Our time is only borrowed)

It all comes down to
Who's rich or poor
Virgin or whore
It doesn't matter what you're praying for
Death or life
Your truth or mine
It doesn't matter underneath it all

Cause we're only here to love
Like there's no tomorow
So let's live each moment like
Our time is only borrowed

(Our time is only borrowed)

(Our time is only borrowed)
