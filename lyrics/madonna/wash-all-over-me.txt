In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between


Life is a like a desert
An oasis to confuse me
So I walk this razors edge
Will I stand or will I fall

Turned a blind eye
Tried to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Torn between the impulse to stay or running away
From all this madness

Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it go
Let it wash all over me

Over me, let it wash all over me
Over me, let it wash all over me

All of my illusions
Could be shattered in a second
You could thread a needle
With a teardrop from my eye

It's a cruel injustice
To be witness to the things I see
Looking for the answer
When it's right in front of me

From the tower of Babylon
Where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me

Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me

Over me, let it wash all over me
Over me, let it wash all over me
