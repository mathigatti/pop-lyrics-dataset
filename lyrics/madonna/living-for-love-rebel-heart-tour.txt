This will be a revolution requiring further
Of not worrying about winning other people's approval
Of not wishing you were someone else
But perfectly content to be who you are


(Come on, living for love)
Someone unique and rare
And fearless
I want to start a revolution of love

First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong

I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart

Living for love, living for love (I'm gonna carry on)
Living for love, living for love, I'm living for love
Living for love, living for love (love's gonna lift me up)
Living for love, living for love (love's gonna lift me up)

(I'm gonna carry on)
I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best and it's not you

You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down
Not falling apart, once was lost now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

Took me to heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache I'm gonna carry on

Living for love, living for love (I'm gonna carry on)
Living for love, living for love, I'm living for love
Living for love, living for love (love's gonna lift me up)
Living for love, living for love (love's gonna lift me up)

Lord lift me up
Up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, up
Lord lift me up
Up, up, up, up
Love's gonna lift me up

Up, up, up, up
Lord lift me up
Up, up, up, up
Love's gonna lift me up
I'm gonna carry on

(I'm not giving up)
(Love's gonna lift me up)
