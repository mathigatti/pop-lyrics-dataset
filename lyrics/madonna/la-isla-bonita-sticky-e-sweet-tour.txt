Last night I dreamt of san Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away


Tropical the island breeze (tropical the island breeze)
All of nature wild and free (all of nature wild and free)
This is where I long to be (this is where I long to be)
La isla bonita

Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, merava pala late
Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, merava pala late

I fell in love with san Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, merava pala late
Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, merava pala late

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, merava pala late
Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, merava pala late

Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, merava pala late
Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, merava pala late

Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, merava pala late
Lela lela lela, lela pala tute
Jas kana meres, merava pala late

Lela pala tute
