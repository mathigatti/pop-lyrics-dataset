My heart is a wasteland
My soul is a ghost town
This bed is sinking sand
And we're both going down
Your words are like arrows
They're aimed at the core of all my doubt
And the battle since the day my heart fell out


Can I undo every wrong
If I promise I'll be strong

Angels cry, throw the halos from the sky
Angels fall, from heaven
Angels sigh, make the sun refuse to shine
Angels fall, from heaven

When we fall out of love (love, love, love)
When we fall out of love (love, love, love)
When we fall out of love (love, love, love)
When we fall out of love (love, love, love)

My mind is a war zone
The silence hits harder than grenades
I never meant to put a noose around your face
Our beautiful kingdom, once was a paradise we reigned
You took my crown, I brought you down
We're both to blame

Can I undo every wrong
If I promise to be strong
Angels cry, throw the halos from the sky
Angels fall, from heaven
Angels sigh, make the sun refuse to shine
Angels fall, from heaven

When we fall out of love (love, love, love)
When we fall out of love (love, love, love)
When we fall out of love (love, love, love)
When we fall out of love
(Angels cry, angels sigh, angels die, angels die)
(You're my angel, you're my angel)
