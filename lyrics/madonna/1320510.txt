How can I be sure you're
Telling me the truth?
In this house of games
You never show your cards


You claim madness
It's become convenient
I don't wanna hear your
Angry words again

You hear voices
Tempting you to leave me
Then you're sorry
You hold me in your arms

You have demons
Nothing can control them
Who can blame you?
If you're not in charge

[Chorus 1]
Is this love? I think not
I wanna get off this Mary-Go-Round
History will repeat itself
And I won't let you take me down

Treat me like a curse then
Tell me I'm your saviour
I'm living with the stranger
I used to know so well

Waiting for your answer
Is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed
To this kind of hell?

You hear voices
Tempting you to leave me
Then you're sorry
You hold me in your arms

You have demons
Nothing can control them
Who can blame you?
If you're not in charge

[Chorus 2]
Is this live? I think not
I wanna get off this Mary-Go-Round
History will complete itself
And I won't let you break me down

I like to get to know you
You could warm up your hands on my heart
I've got so much to show you
But for now it's just one decor
