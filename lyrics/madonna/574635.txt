I live at the top of the hill
No one keeps me here against my will
I don't need no safe neighborhood
I got to feel good my own way, yeah
It's not like I don't have a choice
When you're alone you make your own choice
If you were me you'd be stayin' here too
Well that's somethin' you'll do your own way, yeah
And then I walk outside and there ain't no one around
And I never see the shit on the ground
And I never want to make a sound
More than I do now
I got away from the talk that's cheap
I care about the company I keep
If being good make it understood
I don't want to stand in your way, yeah
And then I walk outside and there ain't no one around
And I never see the shit on the ground
And I never want to make a sound
More than I do now
