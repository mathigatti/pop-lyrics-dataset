Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell
Bang bang
Bang bang


I thought you were good
But you painted me bad
Compared to the others
You're the best thing I had
Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

I thought it was you, and I loved you the most
But I was just keeping my enemies close
Made a decision, I would never look back
So how did you end up with all of my Jack
Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead (in the head)

Bitch out of order
Bat out of hell
Fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell
Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

I made a decision, I would never look back
So how did you end up with all of my Jack
Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

Bang bang, shot you dead
Shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead
And I have no regret

Bang bang, shot you dead (in the head)
Bang bang, shot you dead
Shot my lover in the head

And then I discovered, it couldn't get worse
You were building my coffin
You were driving my hearse
Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, in the head

I thought it was you, and I loved you the most
But I was just keeping my enemies close
I made a decision, I would never look back
So how did you end up with all of my Jack
Bang bang, shot you dead (in the head)

Bang bang, shot you dead
Shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead
And I have no regret

Bang bang, shot you dead (in the head)
Bang bang, shot you dead
Shot my lover in the head

(I need you to die for me, baby)

You have to die for me, baby
That's right, you have to die for me, baby
How could I move on with my life
If you didn't die for me, baby?
If you didn't die for me, baby?
I need you to die for me, baby!

Bang bang, shot you dead
Shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead
Shot my lover in the head

Bang bang, shot you dead
Shot my lover in the head
Now my lover is dead
And I have no regrets
(He deserved it)

And I'm going straight to hell
And I got a lot of friends there
And if I see that bitch in hell
I'm gonna shoot him in the head again
Cuz I want to see him die
Over, and over, and over, and over
And over, and over, and over, and over
Now drive, bitch!
I said drive, bitch!
And while you're at it, die, bitch!
That's right, drive, bitch
Now drive, bitch!
I said drive, bitch!
And while you're at it, die, bitch!
That's right, drive, bitch

Now if you're gonna act like a bitch
Then you're gonna die like a bitch
