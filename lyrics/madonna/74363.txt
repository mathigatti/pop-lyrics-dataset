I can't lock my door
Oh, I don't have no privacy
The only thing that's mine
Is what's inside of me


When I've had enough
A little voice inside
It says you've got to be tough
You've got to take it in stride

Sometimes I am foolish
I let it get the best of me
At least I know that my mistakes
Are my responsibility
And

Chorus:

I just have to laugh to keep from crying
I just have to laugh to keep from crying

I don't have a dime
Oh, to buy those pretty things
But I hear all the evidence
You know it all sounds the same

But I'm still waiting
I've got my hands open wide
You know my dream isn't fading
I keep it hidden inside
Oh

(chorus)

I just have to laugh to keep from crying
I keep on trying

My friends don't understand
Oh, they think I've lost my mind
And I'm choking back the tears
I've got to swallow my pride

(chorus)

I just have to laugh, ah
La, ah
Lo, oh
La, ah
