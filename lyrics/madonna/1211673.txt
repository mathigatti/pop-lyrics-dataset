(Justin:)
Hey Madonna, I'm takin' it to the club
Go, uh
Feels good
Uh uh


(Madonna:)
Move your body
Catch me from across the floor
Everybody's watchin'
But I just want to give you more
Don't care 'bout nothin'
I've fallin' for your love in the worst way

(Justin:)
So move closer
'Cause I can feel your body rise
The heat from you
And I just start to fantasize
We're all alone now
And I don't care what people have to say

(Madonna:)
You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And prove ourselves to the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl
I want to dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's prove ourselves to the world

(Madonna &amp; Justin:)
Do it, do it
Let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the break of dawn
Do it, do it
While the night is young
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the lights go on

Now we're in our zone
Do you want to take it further?
'Cause before it's too long
I'm gonna start to wonder
Are you a one trick pony
Or do you want to keep running this race?

(Madonna &amp; Justin)
I'm so into you
I've heard it all before
So what should I do?
I told ya, catch me on the floor
Don't spoil this moment
'Cause talk is cheap
I don't have time to waste

(Madonna:)
You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And prove ourselves to the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl
I want to dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's prove ourselves to the world

(Madonna &amp; Justin:)
Do it, do it
Let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the break of dawn
Do it, do it
While the night is young
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the lights go on

Now dance
Oh
Dance
Oh
Dance
Do you want to take it further? (oh)
Just dance

Oh
Ca-ca-ca-catch me on the floor
Oh
Ca-ca-ca-catch me on the floor
