You are who your are... (and I)
Wouldn't want to change a thing... (in spite of)
All the pain that love can bring.... (so tell me)
What can I do..?
I'm so in love with you...


You thrill me, surround me
You fill me....
You send me
You put me in a trance....

You feel me
Inside me you take me
(romance)
You fill me
You put me in a trance....
