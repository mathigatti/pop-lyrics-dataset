They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision


Like Robin Hood they were rebels
Some say they kept their company with the devil
Nobody knows such of graces
But they could make them tremble in higher place

They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision

They fought frustrations with laughter
Made men forget just what they were running after
They laugh without any purpose
Taught them to trust their feelings beneath the surface

They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision
They had dirty faces
They had dirty faces

Black is white
And day is night
Wrong can be right
In best light
Life is a game, it's a perfect place
For angels and dirty faces
Dirty faces

They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision

Black is white
And day is night
Wrong can be right
In best light
Life is a game, it's a perfect place
For angels and dirty faces
Dirty faces

They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision

They had dirty faces
Oh, oh, oh
They had dirty faces
Oh, oh, oh

They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision

They had dirty faces
Oh, oh, oh
They had dirty faces
Oh, oh, oh
