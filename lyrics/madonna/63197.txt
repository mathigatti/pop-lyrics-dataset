Zephyr in the sky at night
I wonder
Do my tears of mourning
Sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone


And I feel
Like I just got home
And I feel

And I feel
Like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light
She's flying
Trying to remember
Where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when
Earth shall be as one

And I feel
Like I just got home
And I feel

And I feel
Like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Zephyr in the sky at night
I wonder
Do my tears of mourning
Sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone

And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Then gone for
Someone else shall be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe

And I feel
And I feel
And I feel
Like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
She's flying
Quicker than a ray of light
I'm flying
