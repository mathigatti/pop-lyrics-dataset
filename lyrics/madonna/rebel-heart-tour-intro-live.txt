Medieval warrior bitch goddess
That's what I'm going for
Blood, sweat and tears
(Blood, sweat, tears)
When you are prepared for anything
You are prepared for war


This is the beginning of a crazy ride
The great thing about the war that we fight every night
Is that we bring no harm to people
We just bring love, inspiration
And people need it
Blood, sweat and tears
This is it, people
It's showtime

I'm a woman, I'm a blonde
I have tits and an ass, and an insatiable desire to be noticed
Come on, baby. Show us your ass
Shake it for us, baby
Do that dance you do so well for us, baby
Okay,. But I still want to start a revolution
Somebody's got to

(Born to be a superstar)
(That's exactly what you are)

There's too much beauty in the world going to waste
Too much talent going unnoticed
Too much creativity being crushed beneath
The wheel of corporate branding and what's trending

But it's time to wake up
And I looked into the eyes of people and I saw helplessness
I saw hopelessness
I saw humans searching for a way out

Watch me, people
I am great and I am somebody
I've been up and down so many times
No one could ever stop me cause I'm somebody
I am beautiful!

Because when those fascist dictators
Posing as righteous men come for you
With their big leather boots to shut you up
To put a gag in your mouth

You better be prepared to fight for what you believe in
You better be prepared to die for what you believe in
I want to start a revolution
Are you with me?
