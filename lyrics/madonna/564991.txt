Your love is like liquid
It fills me, it chills me
Can't hold it, control it
It runs from my touch


It slips through my fingers
The taste of, it lingers
Your love is like liquid

I want it so much

Liquid love
Pouring down like rain
Liquid love
Let it wash all over me

Your love is like liquid
It drenches, it quenshes
It drowns me, surrounds me

It lies on my skin
It flows through my veins
Just like warm summer rain
Yes your love is like liquid
I feel it within

Liquid love
Pouring down like rain
Liquid love

Let it wash all over me

Liquid love
Flowing through my veins
Liquid love love love love

Liquid love

My heart was frozen
Till you came and melted it

Now my heart is molted
Turning into
Liquid love
Pouring down like rain
Liquid love
Let it wash all over me
Liquid love
Flowing through my veins
Liquid love, liquid, liquid, liquid

Liquid love
Pouring down like rain
Liquid love
Let it wash all over me
Liquid love
Liquid love
Liquid love

flowing through my veins
