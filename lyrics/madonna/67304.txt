I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realise
How many times I've died


I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up

This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire

I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up

It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care?
What the world thinks of me
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

No one's telling you how to live my life
But it's a setup, and I'm just fed up

It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care?
What the world thinks of me
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

Nobody knows me
(It's no fun but the damage is done)
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like, like you know me
(Don't want your social disease)
Like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me
(Don't want your social disease)

Nobody knows me
(I don't want no lies)
Nobody knows me
(I don't watch TV)
Nobody knows me
(I don't waste my time)
Like you know me
(Won't read a magazine)
Nobody knows me
(I don't want no lies)
Nobody knows me
(I don't watch TV)
Nobody knows me
(I don't waste my time)
Like you know me
(Won't read a magazine)

Don't want your social disease
