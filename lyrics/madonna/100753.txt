Why's it so hard to love one another
Why's it so hard to love
Why's it so hard to love one another
Why's it so hard to love


What do I have to do to be accepted
What do I have to say
What do I have to do to be respected
How do I have to play

What do I have to look like to feel I'm equal
Where do I have to go
What club do I have to join to prove I'm worthy
Who do I have to know

I'm telling you brothers, sisters
Why can't we learn to challenge the system
Without living in pain
Brothers, sisters
Why can't we learn to accept that we're different
Before it's too late

What do I have to learn to know what's right for me
What do I have to know
What am I going to do when I feel righteous
Where do I have to go

Who should get to say what I believe in
Who should have the right
What am I going to do with all this anger
Why do I have to fight

I'm telling you brothers, sisters
Why can't we learn to challenge the system
Without living in pain
Brothers, sisters
Why can't we learn to accept that we're different
Why's it so damn hard

Bring your love, sing your love
Wear your love, share your love
Bring your love, sing your love
Wear your love, share your love

Bring your love, sing your love
Wear your love, share your love
Bring your love, sing your love
Wear your love, show your sister how
(Why's it so damn hard)

Brothers, sisters
What do I have to say
Brothers, sisters
How do I have to play
Brothers, sisters
Who should have the right
Brothers, sisters
Why do I have to fight

Why's it so hard to love one another
Love your sister, love your brother
Why's it so hard to love one another
Love your sister, love your brother
Why's it so hard to love one another
Why's it so hard to love

I'm telling you brothers, sisters
Why can't we learn to challenge the system
Without living in pain
Brothers, sisters
Why can't we learn to accept that we're different
Why's it so damn hard

Sing your love, share your love
Before it's too late
Sing your love, share your love
Before it's too late
Sing your love, share your love
Before it's too late
Sing your love, share your love
Ahh

Love your brother now, show your sister how
Love your brother now, show your sister
Love your brother now, show your sister how
Love your brother now, show your sister
