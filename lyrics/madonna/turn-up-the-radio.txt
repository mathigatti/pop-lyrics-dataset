When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of a maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane


There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind in your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

It was time that I opened my eyes
I'm leaving the past behind
Nothing's ever what it seems
Including this time and this crazy dream

I'm stuck like a moth to a flame
I'm so tired of playing this game
I don't know how I got to this stage
Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying

To turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

I just wanna get in my car
I wanna go fast and I gotta go far
Don't ask me to explain how I feel
Cause I don't wanna say where I'm going

Turn up the noise and turn up the volume
Don't have a choice
Cause the temperature's pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape
With a person just like you

Buzzing around like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun if that's all that we do
Gotta shake up the system
And break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio
Until the speakers blow!

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
There's some things you don't need to know
Just let me turn up the radio

Turn up the radio
Let me turn up the radio
Let me turn up the radio
