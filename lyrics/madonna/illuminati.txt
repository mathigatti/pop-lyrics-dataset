It's not Jay-Z and Beyonc√©
It's not Nicki or Lil Wayne
It's not Oprah and Obama
The Pope or Rihanna
Queen Elizabeth or Kanye
It's not pentagrams or witchcraft
It's not trying to s-stack for cash
Black magic or Gaga
Gucci or Prada
Riding on a golden cat


The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, truth and light
The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secrets inside
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati

It's the enlightenment that started it all
The founding fathers wrote it down on the wall
And now the media's misleading us all
To right and to wrong
It's time to dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

Behind the curtain of the New World Order
It's not platinum encrypted corners
It's not Isis or the phoenix, pyramids of Egypt
Don't make it into something sordid
It's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
It's not the government of the United States
It's not Bieber or LeBron
Clinton or Obama
Or anyone you'd love to hate

The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, truth and light
The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secrets inside
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati

You know that everything that glitters ain't gold
So let the music take you out of control
It's time to feel it in your body and soul
Come on, let's go
We're gonna dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

It's like
It's like
It's like everybody in this party's shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party's shining like Illuminati

Like everybody in this party's shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party's shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party's shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party's shining like Illuminati

Everybody in this party's shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party's shining like Illuminati
