I'm gonna tell you about love
Let's forget your life
Forget your problems
Administration, bills and loans
Come with me


In the evidence of its brilliance

In the demonstration of this evidence
Some have called it religion
This is not a coincidence
Would you like to try?

Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
Let me be your guide
Put aside your pride
Future lovers hide love inside their eyes

In the evidence of its brilliance

Not controlled by time
Future lovers shine for eternity
In a world that's free
Put away your past
Love will never last
If you're holding on to a dream that's gone

I'm gonna tell you about love
Would you like to try?

In the evidence of its brilliance

There's no love like the future love

Come with me

Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride their ambitions high
Would you like to try?

(In the evidence of its brilliance) (repeat)

Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride their ambitions high
Would you like to try?

Brilliance

In the evidence of its brilliance
