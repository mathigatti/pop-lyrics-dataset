He runs through the streets and his socks goin down
And his eyes they burn as they touch the ground
Baseball cap holds out the pain
Sad no one hears today


Goes through the house and he looks for food
He feels so bad but he knows he's good
He lays down on the kitchen floor
He ain't hungry no more

Little boy lost
Little boy lamb
How much does it cost
To understand

Little boy say oh
Why do you cry
How much would you pay
To know why

Sometimes at night he wets his bed
And his dreams play tricks inside his bed
He wakes up cold turns on the light
There's no one here tonight oh

Little boy lost
Little boy lamb
How much does it cost
To understand

Little boy say
Why do you cry
How much would you pay
To know why
