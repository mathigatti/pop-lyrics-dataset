Just listen to that, the voice of Argentina
We are adored, we are love 
Statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants 
We shall see little man


I am only a simple woman who lives to serve Peron in his noble crusade to rescue his people!
I was once as you are now! And I promise you this.. we will take the riches
from the oligarchs only for you -for all of you!
And one day you too will inherit these treasures! Descamisados!
When they fire those cannons, when the crowds sing of glory,
it is not just for Peron, but for all of us!
All of us! Things have reached a pretty pass
When someone pretty lower class
Can be accepted and admiredBut our privileged class is dead!
Look who they are calling for now!
