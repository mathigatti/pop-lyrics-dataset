I don't wanna talk about it
Even if you scream and shout it
Words are nothing, till they're actions
I can't get no satisfaction


With your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun
To have your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun

Tell your tales to someone else
Or better keep them to yourself
I've heard your stories
All before you're always
Walking out the door

With your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun
To have your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun

So get out the door with
Your love on the run
Get out the door, you're just no fun
Get out the door with your love on the run
You're just no fun on the run

You would think I've had enough
Of all your games, had just too much
I should have known when I first met you
I'm trying so hard to forget

Your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun
To have your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun

So get out the door with
Your love on the run
Get out the door, you're just no fun
Get out the door with your love on the run
You're just no fun on the run
I Say
Get out the door with your love on the run
Get out the door, you're just no fun
Get out the door with your love on the run
You're just no fun on the run

Your love on the run
On the run you're just no fun
Just no fun on the run
On the run you're just no fun
