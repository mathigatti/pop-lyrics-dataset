All work and no play
Makes Dick a dull dull boy
Career gets in the way
Square jaw oooh
Such a handsome face
Why do you have to save the human race?


Life of crime, no it never pays
Clean up the streets and make your secret get-away
All alone, in your room with your radio
No one to hold you, had to let her go

You're a man with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't take time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (on the run)
Oh God, let me be the one (be the one)
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun

All boss and no brains
Bullies and thugs, they take up all your time in vain
Can't let go, someone cries and you hear the call
Who's gonna catch you, don't good guys ever fall?

You're a man with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't take time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (on the run)
Oh God, let me be the one (be the one)
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun

All alone, in your room with your radio
No one to hold you, I would never let you go

You're a man with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't take time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (on the run)
Oh God, let me be the one (be the one)
'Cause I can show you some fun
And I don't mean with a gun, no

You are a man with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't take time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (on the run)
Oh God, let me be the one (be the one)
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun
Take it out of your hand

Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't take time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (on the run)
Oh God, let me be the one (be the one)
Show you some fun
Gimme that gun
