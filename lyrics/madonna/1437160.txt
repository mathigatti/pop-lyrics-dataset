Tall and tan and young and lovely 
The girl from Ipanema goes walking 
And when she passes, each one she passes goes "a-a-ah!" 
When she walks she's like a samba that 
Swings so cool and sways so gentle, 
That when she passes, each one she passes goes "a-a-ah!" 
Oh, but I watch her so sadly 
How can I tell her I love her? 
Yes, I would give my heart gladly 
But each day when she walks to the sea 
She looks straight ahead not at me 
Tall and tan and young and lovely 
The girl from Ipanema goes walking 
And when she passes I smile, but she doesn't see 
She just doesn't see 
No she doesn't see
