This isn't what it seems
It’s like I'm living inside a dream
But I'm just dancing
Dancing with myself
You're from a different time
And I know that you can read my mind
But I'm still dancing
Dancing with myself


I'm not alone
I'll be dancing with this vision
I've made my decision
Won’t let you go
And my favorite part is left inside my heart
Holding you close
Because your energy is still a part of me
You know I love you the most
I'm not ashamed to say
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you

I feel your phantom touch
It's a pleasure, I need so much
Let's go dancing
Dancing with myself
Heaven’s too far away
And my desire will make you stay
I'll keep on dancing
Dancing with myself

I'm not alone
I'll be dancing with this vision
I've made my decision
Won't let you go
And my favorite part is left inside my heart
Holding you close
Because your energy is still a part of me
You know I love you the most
I'm not ashamed to say

I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go
