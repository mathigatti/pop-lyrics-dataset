Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never ever ever gonna let it go


Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me...

Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along
What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever lovin' anybody else

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me...

Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understrand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me...

Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

Mmm-mmm My baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm My baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm My baby's got a secret for me...
