Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the Lower East Side
I threw my tag around, let b-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize, my every single move
But then I realized, I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise, when I became the news


I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered

I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified, you know I had to take it there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered

I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

[Nas]
In 1994, I came through the door
With that raw beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolinas
Pops from Natchez
In QB is where I started flowin'
But I was scared the cops gon' kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl
Then I got married happily of course
Then that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick 'em don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule or "too big to lose"
Now who's the fool?
And I never been happier, no lie
I'm just your humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson, Imma ride
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trappers, any rapper
Any politician, beautician or musician
Anybody, saw many bodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tossers either dead or jail
Not many option on the block I came from
And I turned to world rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I'm goin' right back to the block I came from
One

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered

I came, I saw, I conquered 
I came, I saw, I conquered
I came, I saw, I conquered
I came, I saw, I conquered
