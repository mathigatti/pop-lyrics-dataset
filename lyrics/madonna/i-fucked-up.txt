I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't


I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way
If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back I'd have no fear
If I took another path
Things would be so different, but they're not

I could have just kept my big mouth closed
I could have just done what I was told
Maybe I should have turned silver into gold
But in front of you
I was cold

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
And somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I thought we were indestructible
I never imagined we could fall
Do you wanna know how to make out loud
Telling your plans

We coulda bought a house with a swimming pool
Fill it up with Warhols
It would be so cool
Could have gone riding stallions in the countryside
With a pack of  Great Danes
Racing eye to eye
We could have toured the world in a private jet
Run naked on the beach all soaking wet
We could have climbed a mountain, seen a perfect sunrise
Written our names across the sky
We could have gotten drunk and driven on the Autoban
We could have got ourselves arrested in Sal de Mar
We could have lived life crazy til the day we die
Instead I made you cry

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
Je suis désolée
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not ashamed to say
I wish I could have you back,
Maybe one day,
Or not
