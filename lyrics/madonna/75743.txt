All my people in the crowd
Grab a partner, take it down!


It´s me against the music
Uh uh
It´s just me
And me
Yeah

C´mon
Hey Britney?
Are you ready?
Uh uh, are you?

No one cares
It´s whippin´ my hair, it´s pullin´ my waist
To hell with stares
The sweat is drippin´ all over my face

No one´s there
I´m the only one dancin´ up in this place
Tonight I´m here
Feel the beat of the drum, gotta get with that bass

I´m up against the speaker, tryin´ to take on the
music
It´s like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in a zone, I wanna get in a zone
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your
rhythm
Tryin´ to hit it, chic-a-taa
In a minute I´m a take a you on, I´m a take a you
on

Hey, hey, hey

CHORUS
All my people on the floor
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people wantin´ more
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya
All my people round and round
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya

So how would you like a friendly competition
Let´s take on the song
It´s you and me baby, we´re the music
Time to party all night long

We´re almost there
I´m feelin´ it bad and I can´t explain
My soul is bare
My hips are movin´ at a rapid pace
Baby feel it burn
From the tip of my toes, runnin´ through my veins
And now´s your turn
Let me see what you got, don´t hesitate

I´m up against the speaker, tryin´ to take on the
music
It´s like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in a zone, I wanna get in a zone
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your
rhythm
Tryin´ to hit it, chic-a-taa
In a minute I´m a take a you on, I´m a take a you
on

Hey, hey, hey

All my people on the floor
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people wantin´ more
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya
All my people round and round
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya

Get on the floor, baby lose control
Just work your body and let it go
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey Britney
We can dance all night long

Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control
Come over here I got somethin´ to show ya
Sexy lady, I´d rather see you bare your soul
If you think you´re so hot, better show me what you
got

All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
C´mon Britney lose control, watch you take it down

Get on the floor, baby lose control
Just work your body and let it go
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey Britney
We can dance all night long

All my people on the floor
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people wantin´ more
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya
All my people round and round
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya

All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
C´mon Britney take it down, make the music dance
All my people round and round, party all night long
C´mon Britney lose control, watch you take it down
