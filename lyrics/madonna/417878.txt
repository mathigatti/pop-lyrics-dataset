Oh, you look so tired
Mouth slack and wide
Ill-housed and ill-advised
Your face is as mean
As your life has been


Crash into my arms
I WANT YOU
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse
I know you

And I know a place
Where no one is likely to pass
Oh, you don't care if it's late
And you don't care if you're lost
And oh, you look so tired
(But tonight you presume too much)
Too much, too much
And if it's the last
Thing I ever do
I'M GONNA GET YOU

Crash into my arms
I WANT YOU
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse
I know you

Crash into my arms
I WANT YOU
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse
I know you
Oh ...
