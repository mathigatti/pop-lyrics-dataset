Party, pa-party rock
Party, pa-party rock
Party, pa-party rock


Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world

Give me all your luvin', give me your luv
Give me all your luv today
Give me all your luvin', give me your luv
Let's forget about time and dance our lives away

L-U-V, Madonna!
Y-O-U, you wanna?
L-U-V, Madonna!
Y-O-U, you wanna?

Give me all your luvin', give me your luv
Give me all your luv today (give me all your luv)
Give me all your luvin', give me your luv
Let's forget about time and dance our lives away

[Nicki Minaj &amp; (Madonna)]
(Give me all your luv)
Give me all your luv, boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say I'm sicker rhyme
Because it's time for a change, like a nickel or a dime
(Give me all your luv)
Oh! I'm Roman, I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan
You were sleepin' on me, you was dozin'
Now move! I'm goin' in (woah)

[LMFAO]
Yo, I'm trojan
Pin you on the mat, Hulk Hogan
Take to the max, then go again
My slogan
I'm sexy and I know it, show it
Baby girl, it's your moment
Work it, twerk it, own it
Gimme your love, devote it, oh

Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world

Give me all your luvin', give me your luv
(L-U-V, Madonna; give me all your luv)

L-U-V, Madonna!
Y-O-U, you wanna?
L-U-V, Madonna!
Y-O-U, you wanna?

[LMFAO]
Hold up!
Baby girl, your man look tore up
You should be with me 'cause I'm swole up
Knock it up the park â€“ home run
Word to Young Money, I'm on one
A Milli, calmest guy, I am, I know Willy
Like a virgin, but not really
Can't, can't breathe without your love
Don't kill me, so

Give me all your luvin', give me your luv
Give me all your luv today
Give me all your luvin', give me your luv
Let's forget about time and dance our lives away

Dance our lives away
Dance our lives away
L-U-V, Madonna! (Party, pa-party rock)
Dance our lives away
Y-O-U, you wanna? (Party, pa-party rock)
Dance our lives away
