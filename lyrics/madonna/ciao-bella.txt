Sometimes
Sometimes I despair
Sometimes I have hope
Sometimes I don't know
Sometimes I feel pushed
Bella, ciao


Have you ever been to the land where you can find yourself?
Have you ever been to a place where you can rest yourself?
All the noise just disappears, rain will wash away the sadness
All our lives we work in vain, for a little touch of grace
Bella, ciao

Sometimes I despair
Sometimes I have hope
Sometimes I don't know
Sometimes I feel happy

Bella, ciao
Sometimes I feel happy
Bella, ciao

Have you ever been to the land where you can find yourself?
Have you ever been to a place where you can rest yourself?
All the noise just disappears, rain will wash away the sadness
All our lives we work in vain, for a little touch of grace
Bella, ciao
