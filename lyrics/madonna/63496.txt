I'm gonna wake up, yes and no
I'm gonna kiss, some part of
I'm gonna keep this secret
I'm gonna close my body now


I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day, another day
I guess I'll die another day, another day
I guess I'll die another day, another day
I guess I'll die another day

Sigmund Freud
Analyse this
Analyse this
Analyse this, this, this...

I'm gonna break the cycle
I'm gonna shake up the system
I'm gonna destroy my ego
I'm gonna close my body now

I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go

For every sin, I'll have to pay
I've come to work, I've come to play
I think I'll find another way
It's not my time to go

I'm gonna avoid the clich√©
I'm gonna suspend my senses
I'm gonna delay my pleasure
I'm gonna close my body now

I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day


I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go

(Laugh)

(Spoken)
I need to lay down

I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
