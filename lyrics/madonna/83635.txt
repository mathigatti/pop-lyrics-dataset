You give me
You give me fever


Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

Listen to me baby, hear every word I say
No one can love you the way I do
'Cause they don't know how to love you my way

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

Bless my soul I love you, take this heart away
Take these arms I'll never use
And just believe in what my lips have to say

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago

You give me fever, fever
You give me, you give me fever

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said Julie, baby, you're my flame
He gave her fever

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Fever, with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, daddy, oh, don't you dare

He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Misses
Daddy, won't you treat him right

Fever, when you kiss them
Fever, if you live and learn
Fever, 'til you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
