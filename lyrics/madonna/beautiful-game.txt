It's a beautiful plan
But I'm not concerned
It's a beautiful game
That I never learned
People tell me to shut my mouth
That I might get burned
Keep your beautiful lies
'Cause I'm not concerned


'Cause your world is 
Such a shame
'Cause your world's up 
Sex with fame
'Cause your world's in
So much pain
'Cause your world is, 'cause your world is
