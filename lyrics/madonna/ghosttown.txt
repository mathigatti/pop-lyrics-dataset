Maybe it was all too much
Too much for a man to take
Everything's bound to break
Sooner or later, sooner or later


You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh
I know you're scared tonight
Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh
I'll never leave your side

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

When the world gets cold
I'll be your cover
Let's just hold
Onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on

This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh
I know you're scared tonight
Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh
I'll never leave your side

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

When the world gets cold
I'll be your cover
Let's just hold
Onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

I know we're alright
Cause we'll never be alone
In this mad mad, in this mad mad world
Even with no light
We're gonna shine like gold
In this mad mad, in this mad mad world

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

When the world gets cold
I'll be your cover
Let's just hold
Onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
