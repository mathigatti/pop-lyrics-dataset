Now I can tell you about success, about fame
About the rise and the fall of all the stars in the sky
Don't it make you smile?


Now I can tell you about the place I belong
You know it won't last long
And all those lights they will turn down

Let it will be
Oh, let it be
You got to let it be
Won't you let it be?

Now I can see things for what they really are
You know I'm not that far
I'm at the point of no return
Just watch me burn

Oh, let it be
You got to let it be
Won't you let it be?

Won't you let it be?
You got to let it be
Anyone can see
Let it will be

Just watch me breath

Now I can see things for what they really are
You know I'm not that far
I'm at the point of no return

Just watch me burn

You got to let it be
Won't you let it be?
You got to let it be, yeah

Won't you let it be?
You got to let it be
Anyone can see
Let it will be
