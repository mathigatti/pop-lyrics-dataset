I don't give a fu-u-u-u
I don't give a fu-u-u-u
I don't give a fu-u-u-u
I don't give a fu-u-u-u


Wake up ex-wife
This is your life
Children on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messengers, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multi-task
Connecting to the Wi-Fi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweetin' on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure

I'm gonna be OK
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right

I'm moving fast can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don't give a

You were so mad at me
Who's got custody
Lawyers suck it up
Didn't have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
Ride my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the biters have to go
Standing in the front row

I'm gonna be OK
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don't give a

I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself
And I swallowed my light
I tried to become all
That you expect of me
And if it was a failure
I don't give a

I don't give a fu-u-u-u
I don't give a fu-u-u-u
I don't give a fu-u-u-u
I don't give a fu-u-u-u

(NICKI RAP)
Shots fire
Anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire
You don't hear them bums or nothin', that's fire
Tell 'em, catch buyer
In the Bugatti ten years and one tire
Ayo Madonna, maybe I say you original don dada
In that, yeah Gabbana, and the, yeah Prada
We material girls, ain't nobody hotter'
See I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cutting them checks, I was his boss!
Yo, I don't give a fuck
Curse nor bless you, never let them stress you
I ain't a businesswoman, I'm a business, woman!
And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman

I'm gonna be OK
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don't give a

There's only one queen
And that's Madonna
Bitch!

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
