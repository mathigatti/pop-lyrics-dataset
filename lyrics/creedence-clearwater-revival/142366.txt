When the sky is gray
And the moon is hate
I'll be down to get you
Roots of earth will shake


Sinister Purpose
Knocking at your door
Come and take my hand

Burn away the goodness
You and I remain
Did you see the last war?
Well, here I am again

Sinister Purpose
Knocking at your door
Come and take my hand

I can set you free
Make you rich and wise
We can live forever
Look into my eyes

Sinister Purpose
Knocking at your door
Come and take my hand
