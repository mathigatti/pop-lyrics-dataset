Yes, my baby left me, never said a word
Was it something I done, something that she heard?
You know she left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me, never said a word
But, I stand at my window, wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman, hate to say goodbye
You know she left me, I say, she left me
My baby even left me, never said goodbye


Help me, boy!
And now, one of these mornings
Lord, it won't be long
You'll look for me and, baby
Daddy he'll be gone

You know she left me, I say she left me
My baby even left me, never said a word
Now, I stand at my window, wring my hands and moan
All I know is that the one
I love is gone

My baby left me, I say she left me
My baby even left me, never said goodbye
My baby even left me, never said goodbye
