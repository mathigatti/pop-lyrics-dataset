Tombstone Shadow, stretching across my path
Tombstone Shadow, stretching across my path
Ev'ry time I get some good news, ooh
There's a shadow on my back
Saw the gypsy man, 'way down in San Berdoo
Said, I saw the gypsy man, 'way down in San Berdoo
Five dollars on the table, ooh
Keep me 'way from my tomb
Oh! Oh!


Said I got thirteen months of bad luck
Bound to be some pain
Don't you do no trav'ling
Fly in no machines
Tombstone Shadow, stretching across my path
Ev'ry time I get some good news, ooh
There's a shadow on my back

The man gave me a luck charm, Cost five dollars more
Said: Put some on your pillow, and put some on your door
He said: Take a long vacation, ooh
For thirteen months or more
Oh, Lord!

Tombstone Shadow, stretching across my path
Tombstone Shadow, stretching across my path
Ev'ry time I get some good news, ooh
There's a shadow on my back

Oh, oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord
