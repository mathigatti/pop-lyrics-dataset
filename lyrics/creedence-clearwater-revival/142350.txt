Well, get down, woman, before I have to go
Well, get down, woman, before I have to go
You know, ya hurt me with your bad mouth
An' I just don't wanna know
Well, slow down, baby, and gimme a little time
Well, slow down, baby, and gimme a little time
If you want me hanging 'round
Gotta give me some peace of mind


Oh, get down, boy

Well, get back, woman, before you bring it down
Well, now, get back, baby, before you bring it down
Or you can tell it to the wall
Without me hanging around
