Moli-I-I-I-na, where you goin' to?
Moli-I-I-I-na, where you goin' to?


She's daughter to the mayor
Messin' with the sheriff
Drivin' in a blue car
She don't need umbrella

Moli-I-I-I-na, where you goin' to?
Moli-I-I-I-na, where you goin' to?

She's comin' in the mornin'
Lookin' a disaster
Drivin' in the prowl car
Spent the night in jail

Moli-I-I-I-na, where you goin' to?
Moli-I-I-I-na, where you goin' to?
Oh!

Sheriff gonna go far
Drivin' to the state house
If she makes a million
Papa can retire

Moli-I-I-I-na, where you goin' to?
Moli-I-I-I-na, where you goin' to?
Moli-I-I-I-na, where you goin' to?
Moli-I-I-I-na, where you goin' to?
