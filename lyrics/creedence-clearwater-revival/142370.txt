You know the night time, oh, is the right time
To be with the one you love.
I said the night time, ooh, is the right time
To be with the one you love.
I said the night time, ooh, is the right time
To be with the one you love.
Baby, I said a baby, Baby, come on and drive me crazy, Lord,
You know I love you; always thinkin' of you.
Hey, baby; oh, I said a baby.
You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love.
Aaaah!


I said the night time oh, is the right time
To be with the one you love.
I said the night time, ooh, is the right time
To be with the one you love.
I said the night time oh, is the right time
To be with the one you love
