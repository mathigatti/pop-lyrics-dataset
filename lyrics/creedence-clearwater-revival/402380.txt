Was Ridin' along side the highway, rollin' up the country side.
Thinkin' I'm the devil's heatwave, what you burn in your crazy mind?
Saw a slight distraction standin' by the road
She was smilin' there, yellow in her hair
Do you wanna? I was thinkin', would you care?


Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?

Cruisin' on thru the junction, I'm flyin' 'bout the speed of sound
Noticin' peculiar function, I ain't no roller coaster show me down
I turned away to see her, woa! She caught my eye
But I was rollin' down, movin' too fast
Do you wanna? She was thinkin' can it last

Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?

Was busted up along the highway, I'm the saddest ridin' fool alive
Wond'ring if you're goin' in my way, won't you give a poor boy a ride?
Here she comes a ridin', Lord, she's flyin' high
But she was rollin' down, movin' too fast
Do you wanna? She was thinkin' can I last

Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?
