If maybe you'd move over
Gave someone else a chance to try their luck
Instead, you run up closer
Try'n to grab a page before they close the book


It was over 'fore it started, seemed so long when we began
Hope you take it like a friend
It's a shame to see you cryin', wouldn't think to way back when
Looks like I'll never hear the end

Thought you had the honor
Took special pride in all your well laid plans
Forgot about the others
We moved out t'ward the light showin' empty hands

It was over 'fore it started, seemed so long when we began
Hope you take it like a friend
It's a shame to see you cryin', wouldn't think to way back when
Looks like I'll never hear the end

Ah, put the boot down! Mm-hm!

Love to be the winner
Gather up your chips in time to cash 'em in
We're all lookin' thinner
Playin' cards too close for either one to win

It was over 'fore it started, seemed so long when we began
Hope you take it like a friend
It's a shame to see you cryin', wouldn't think to way back when
Looks like I'll never hear the end

Woa oh oh oh
It's a shame to see you cryin', wouldn't think to way back when
Hope you take it like a friend
Yeah eah eah eah
