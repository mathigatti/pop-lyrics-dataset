Late last night I went for a walk
Down by the river near my home.
Couldn't believe with my own eyes
And I swear I'll never leave my home again!


I saw a man walking on the water
Coming right at me from the other side.
Calling out my name; "do not be afraid!"
Feet begin to run, pounding in my brain
I don't want to go; I don't want to go.

No, no, no, no, no...
I don't want to go.

Mmmmmmm.
