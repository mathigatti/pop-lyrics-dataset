He take the thunder from the mountain
He take the lightning from the sky
He bring the strong man to his bended knee
He make the young girls mama cry


You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump and run
You got to hidey hidey-hide
The old man's down the road

He got the voices speakin' riddles
He got the eye as black as coal
He got a suitcase covered with rattlesnake hide
And he stand right in the road

You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump and run away
You got to hidey hidey-hide
The old man's down the road

He make the river call your lover
He make the barking of the hound
Put the shadow across the window
When the old man comes around

You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump and run again
You got to hidey hidey-hide
The old man's down the road

The old man is down the road
The old man is down the road
