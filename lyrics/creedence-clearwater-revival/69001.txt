Woke up early feelin' light, (shame, it's a shame.)
Somebody got to me last night, (shame, it's a shame.)
Sat down for a friendly duel, (shame, it's a shame.)
With one-eyed jacks 'n' jokers, too, (shame, it's a shame.)


Chorus:
Ooh, sailor man, (shame, it's a shame.)
Ooh, sailor man. (shame, it's a shame.)

Poormouth henry turned on me, (shame, it's a shame.)
Said, "boy, i'm gonna pick you clean." (shame, it's a shame.)

Chorus
Oh!

Henry said, "don't you mess that pile," (shame, it's a shame.)
Had three aces 'n' he had five. (shame, it's a shame.)

Chorus

Shame, it's a shame.
(repeat 5x)
