Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
seekin' my fame and fortune
lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you will know the tune


Oh Lord, stuck in on Lodi up again

I rode in on a Greyhound
I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friends

Oh, Lord, stuck in on Lodi up again

The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connection
Ran out of songs to play
I came into town on a one-night stand
Looks like my plans fell through

Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar
For every song I've sung
And every time I've had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know I'd catch the next train
Back to where I live

Oh, Lord, stuck in on Lodi up again

Oh, Lord, Stuck in on Lodi up again
