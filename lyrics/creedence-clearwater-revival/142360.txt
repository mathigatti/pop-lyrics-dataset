The sun came up and pushed away the clouds.
Stumbled back to my room, really don't know how.
I won't wake up 'til this afternoon,
Been out walkin' all night again.
Stranger here try'n' to have fun.
Far from home; it's just begun.
CHORUS:


Give out the warm, it comes back cold.
Oh, God, I need someone to hold.

The coffee's cold, it's gonna have to do.
My feet are shot, feelin' hungry too.
People don't have a thing to say.
Feel your dignity slip away.
Won't wake up 'til this afternoon.
Waste of time 'cause there's nothing new.

CHORUS

CHORUS

A city nice as this one should be kind.
It pushed me down, really don't know why.
When I wake up this afternoon,
Another day to make it through,
Might get lucky and find a dime,
Things don't change, gonna give up tryin'.

CHORUS

CHORUS

Give out the warm, it comes back cold.
