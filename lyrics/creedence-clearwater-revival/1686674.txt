Big wheels keep on turnin'.
Carry me home to see my kin.
Singin' songs about the south land,
I miss my family once again.
I think it's a sin.
Yes.


Well, I heard Mr. Young sing about her.
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down,
But I hope Neil Young will remember
A southern man don't need him around
Anyhow.

Sweet home Alabama,
Where the skies are so blue.
Sweet home Alabama,
Lord, I'm comin' home to you.

In Birmingham, they love the gov'ner.
Now, we all did what we could do.
Now, Watergate does not bother me.
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell me truely.

Sweet home Alabama,
Where the skies are so blue.
Sweet home Alabama,
Lord, I'm comin' home to you.
Now, come on
