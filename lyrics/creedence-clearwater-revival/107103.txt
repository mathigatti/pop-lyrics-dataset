There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend


Ooh!
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the gettin's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

Oooh!
You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for a good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

Yeah!
Oooh!
Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Come along, come along with me

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Yeah!
Do do doo do
