Put a candle in the window,
'Cause I feel I've got to move.
Though I'm going, going,
I'll be coming home soon,
Long as I can see the light.
Pack my bag and let's get moving,
'Cause I'm bound to drift a while.
When I'm gone, gone, you don't have to worry long,
Long as I can see the light.


Guess I've got that old trav'lin' bone,
'Cause this feeling won't leave me alone.
But I won't, won't be losing my way, no, no
'Long as I can see the light.

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, Yeah!

Put a candle in the window,
'Cause I feel I've got to move.
Though I'm going, going,
I'll be coming home soon,

Long as I can see the light.
Long as I can see the light.
Long as I can see the light.
Long as I can see the light.
Long as I can see the light.
