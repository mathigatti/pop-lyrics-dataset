You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
And oo I wanted you forever more
Now I´m not one that gets around
I swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before


I said ´Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou
I´m so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou
We´d never part
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart´

I saw your lips I heard your voice
believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn´t make me stay away
I thought about a moonlit night
My arms about good an´ tight
That´s all I had to see for me to say
