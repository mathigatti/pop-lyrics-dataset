I have some good time, i have some bad time.
But it seem i get movin’ my shift of the worst time.
There ain’t no place in this whole wide world, for one lonely boy.
It seem i ain’t never, never gonna find no calls for jobs.
Some people get rich, i would only get poor.
Some people love to have a good time and won’t let me in the door.
I’ve been halfway around this world and nothing did i have.
But now it seem my turn has come, a time for me to grab.


You got to get it before it gets you.
Oh you got to get it before it gets you.
Lord, you got to get it before it gets you and everything will be
Alright.
Some people try and never have found, i turned the whole world upside down.
Gonna get it before it gets you.
Oh i say you got to get it before it gets you.
Oh try to get it before it gets you.
