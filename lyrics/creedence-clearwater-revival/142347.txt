Find me out awalkin', time the whistle starts acallin',
Maybe stoppin' early, knockin' at your door.
Take so long to answer, Lord knows it ain't the milkman
Could be stoppin' early, sellin' Door To Door.
Here's my latest sample; like to show you how to use it.
First, you pull the curtain while I spread some here.
Wipe the surface gently, try to use a circle motion,
Safe for all your problems, and my price is fair.


This stuff'll get the stain out if you use it loosely wadded;
This here'll take the pain out and won't mess your hair.
Place your order early 'cause you know I'm in a hurry;
Your neighbor's in her doorway, won't you sign right here.

Place your order early 'cause you know I'm in a hurry;
Your neighbor's in her doorway, won't you sign right here.
Man is on the last train, all that work and no play,
Could be stoppin' early, knockin' at your door.

Time for me to head on; pack my kit and 'So long';
Catch you bright and early sellin' Door To Door.
This stuff'll get the stain out if you use it loosely wadded;
This here'll take the pain out and won't mess your hair.

Place your order early 'cause you know I'm in a hurry;
Your neighbor's in her doorway, won't you sign right here.
Place your order early 'cause you know I'm in a hurry;
Your neighbor's in her doorway, won't you sign right here.

Place your order early 'cause you know I'm in a hurry;
Your neighbor's in her doorway, won't you sign right here.
