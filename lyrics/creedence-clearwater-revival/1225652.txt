Goodbye, Joe, me gotta go, me, oh, my, oh
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me, oh, my, oh
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou


Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou

Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin'
kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style and go hog wild, and be gayo
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou

(Oh, guitar)

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou

(Oh, Lord!
Hang tight, ooh Lord!
Ah, take it out
He's comin', ah!)
