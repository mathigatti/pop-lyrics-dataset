Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.
You say I've been buying another woman clothes,
But you've been talking to someone else.
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago.

Your mama said, "Son, Don't call my daughter no more."


Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.
You say I've been buying another woman clothes,
But you've been taking money from someone else.

Come on back home, baby; try my love one more time.
Come on back home, baby; try y love one more time.
You've been gone away so long, I'm just about to lose my mind.

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.

You say I've been buying another woman clothes,
But you've been talking to someone else
