It's just a thought
But I've noticed somethin' strange
Gettin' harder to explain
All the years are passin' bye and bye
Still I don't know what makes it go
Who said to wait and you'll see?


It's just a thought
But I wondered if you knew
That the song up there is you
They can't take it from you
If you don't give it away
Don't give it away; ooh (it's given away.)

It's just a thought
But the word has come too late
That a bad idea will take
Just about a lifetime to explain
And don't you see
Good one's gonna be much longer
Who's gonna wait, just to see?
