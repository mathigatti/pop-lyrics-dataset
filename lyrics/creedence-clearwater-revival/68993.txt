Keep on Choogling
Keep on Choogling
Keep on Choogling
Choogling,
Choogling.


Maybe you don't understand it.
But if you're a natural man,
You got to ball and have a good time
And that's what I call Choogling.

Here comes Mary looking for Harry,
She gonna choogle tonight.
Here comes Louie, works in the sewer,
He gonna choogle tonight.

CHORUS:
(primal screaming)

CHORUS

If you can choose it, who can refuse it,
You all be choogling tonight.
Go on, take your pick, right from the git go,
You gotta choogle tonight.

CHORUS
