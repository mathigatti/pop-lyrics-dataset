Bet you're wondering how I knew
About your plans to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before?
Between the two of us guys, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say, when I found out yesterday


I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

You know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself that you found someone else
Instead

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

People say you " Hear from what you see
Not not not from what you hear. "
I can't help being confused
If it's true, won't you tell me dear?
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy that you knew before?

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
