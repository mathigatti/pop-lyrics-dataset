Now, when I was just a little boy
Standing to my daddy's knee
My poppa said, "son, don't let the man get you
Do what he done to me"


'Cause he'll get you
'Cause he'll get you now, now
And I can remember the fourth of July
Running through the backwood, bare

And I can still hear my old hound dog barking
Chasing down a hoodoo there (2x)

(3x)
Born on the Bayou

Wish I was back on the Bayou
Rolling with some Cajun Queen
Wishing I were a fast freight train
Just a choogling on down to New Orleans

(3x)
Born on the Bayou

Do it, do it, do it, do it
Oh, Lord
Oh, get back boy

I can remember the fourth of July
Running through the backwood bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barking
Chasing down a hoodoo there (2x)

(3x)
Born on the Bayou

All right! Do, do, do, do
