Lock the door, sun's a fallin'.
Poke the fire, don't let the cold in.
Gonna try to sail away from the rest of my life.


Found a boat to make the break in.
Filled with hope 'bout the step I'm takin'.
Gonna try to sail away from the rest of my life.

Spent a long time list'ning to the captain of the sea,
Shoutin' orders to his crew; No one hears but me.

Cast away, tide's a runnin'
Hoist the sail, strong wind's comin'.
Gonna try to sail away from the rest of my life.

Spent a long time list'ning to the captain of the sea,
Shoutin' orders to his crew; No one hears but me.

Lock the door, sun's a fallin'.
Poke the fire, don't let the cold in.
