You took me runnin'
Up a wrong way street
When we got there
You said, "Can't you read ?"
I must be blind
But now and then I see
Another number
Where mine used to be


Chorus:

You keep on changin' your face
Like a Chameleon
You keep on changing your face
Like a Chameleon

I say what's up
And you say it's down
I see triangles
And you say it's round, round, round
Saw an empty glass
You said it's full
Lord, it's so hot
Then you come on cool, cool

Chorus
