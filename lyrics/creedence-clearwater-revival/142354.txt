I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop
The things that you're doing
I said: Watch out!
I ain't lying, yeah!
I ain't gonna take none of your
Fooling around


I ain't gonna take none of your
Putting me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
All right!

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop
The things that you're doing
I said: Watch out!
I ain't lying, yeah!
I ain't gonna take none of your
Fooling around

I ain't gonna take none of your
Putting me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
All right!
And I took it down
