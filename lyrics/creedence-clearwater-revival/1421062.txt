Jeremiah was a bullfrog, he was good friend of mine.
I never understood a single word he said but I helped him to drink
his wine. He always had some mighty fine wine. Sing it Joy to the
world...all the boys and girls now , joy to the fishies in the deep blue
sea and joy to you and me.


And if i were the king of the world , i tell you what i would do. Id throw
away the cars and the bars and the wars and id make sweet love to you.
Sing it: Joy the the world , all the boys and girls , joy to the fishes
in the deep blue sea , joy to you and me.

Yah know I love the ladies , love to have my fun ... Im a hard knock
flyer and a rain bow rider ... a strait shootin son of a gun , i said a
strait shootin sun of a gun.

Joy to the world , all the boys and girls , joy to all the fishies in the
deep blue sea , joy to you and me.

Joy to the world , all the boys and girls , joy to the world joy to you
and me

Joy to the world , all the boys and girls , joy to the fishies in the deep
blue sea joy to you and me.

Joy the the world , all the boys and girls , joy to the world , joy to you
and me.

Joy to the world , all the boys and girls , joy to the world , joy to you
and me.
