Last night
I saw a fire burning on
The palace lawn
O'er the land
The humble subjects watched in mixed
Emotion


Who is burnin'?
Who is burnin'?
Effigy
Who is burnin'?
Who is burnin'?
Effigy

Last night
I saw the fire spreadin' to
The palace door
Silent majority
Weren't keepin' quiet
Anymore

Last night
I saw the fire spreadin' to
The country side
In the mornin'
Few were left to watch
The ashes die

Why?
Why?
Why?
Effigy
