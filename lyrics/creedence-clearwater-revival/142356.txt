Just got home from Illinois
Lock the front door, oh boy!
Got to sit down
Take a rest on the porch
Imagination sets in
Pretty soon I'm singin'


Doo, doo, doo
Lookin' out my back door

There's a giant doing cartwheels
A statue wearin' high heels
Look at all the happy
Creatures dancing on the lawn
A dinosaur Victrola
List'ning to Buck Owens

Doo, doo, doo
Lookin' out my back door

Tambourines and elephants
Are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride
On the flyin' spoon?
Wond'rous apparition
Provided by magician

Doo, doo, doo
Lookin' out my back door

Tambourines and elephants
Are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride
On the flyin' spoon?
Bother me tomorrow
Today I'll buy no sorrows

Doo, doo, doo
Lookin' out my back door

Forward troubles Illinois
Lock the front door, oh boy!
Look at all the happy
Creatures dancing on the lawn
Bother me tomorrow
Today I'll buy no sorrows

Doo, doo, doo
Lookin' out my back door
