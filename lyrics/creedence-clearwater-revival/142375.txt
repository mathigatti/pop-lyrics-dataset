When you are alone,
You come back cryin' and you want to go home;
For someone forgettin' it seems
Like you're lettin' it take you away from me.
Was your idea to pack up and go.
You said you had no life of your own.
Movin' in was not too hard to do.
Ya got second thoughts; you're gonna have to choose.


What are you gonna do ?
Forget about your mother and think about you.
For someone forgettin' it seems
Like you're lettin' it take you away from me.

Told you all the secrets that were mine.
The good things that I picked up overtime.
Won't accept the reason why you're here;
Talk things out; overcome the fear.

Thought that I was all that you need,
You told me things I wanted to believe.
You know that leaving me would be wrong;
Stay with me, I'll help you to be strong.
