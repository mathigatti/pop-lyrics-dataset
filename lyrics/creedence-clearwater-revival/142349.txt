Hey, look over yonder out in the rain
Soakin' wet fever in my brain
Now, I ain't certain which way to go
But I got to move, sure


Feelin' blue, blue, blue, blue, blue
Feelin' blue, blue, blue, blue, blue
Feelin' blue, blue, blue, blue, blue
I'm feelin' blue, I'm feelin' blue

Hey, look over yonder behind the wall
They're closin' in I'm about to fall
Now I'm no coward, but I ain't no cool
Feel it in my bones, my book is due

Feelin' blue, blue, blue, blue, blue
Feelin' blue, blue, blue, blue, blue
Feelin' blue, blue, blue, blue, blue
I'm feelin' blue, I'm feelin' blue

Hey, look over yonder, up in the tree
There's a rope hangin' just for me
Without a warnin', without a warnin'
Things are pilin' up to break me down

Feelin' blue, blue, blue, blue, blue
Feelin' blue, blue, blue, blue, blue
Feelin' blue, blue, blue, blue, blue
I'm feelin' blue, I'm feelin' blue

Hey, look over yonder, out in the street
People laughin' by, walkin' easy
Now, I'm no sinner, but I ain't no saint
If it's happy, you can say I ain't

I'm feelin' blue
