Early in the evenin' just about supper time
Over by the courthouse they're starting to unwind
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp


Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel; tap your feet

Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile
Blinky, thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel; tap your feet

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel; tap your feet

You don't need a penny just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner there's a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel; tap your feet

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel; tap your feet

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel; tap your feet
