Well, take me back down
Where cool water flow, yeah
Let me remember things I love


Stopping at the log where catfish bite
Walking along the river road at night
Barefoot girls dancing in the moonlight

I can hear the bullfrog calling me
Wonder if my rope's
Still hanging to the tree
Love to kick my feet
Way down the shallow water
Shoe fly, dragon fly
Get back to your mother
Pick up a flat rock
Skip it across Green River

Well

Up at Cody's camp
I spent my days, oh
With flat car riders
And cross-tie walkers

Old Cody Jr took me over
Said, you're gonna find
The world is smouldering
And if you get lost
Come on home to Green River

Well

Come home
