Playin' a pavilion on the outskirts of town,
Playin' where my roller derby rolls.
Just a part time music man, a nobody at the plant,
I'm tearin' up the country with a song.


Mom and papa told me "son, you gotta go to school;
Only way to make the fam'ly proud."
I paid no attention, left my books at home,
Rather play my music real loud.

Tearin' up the country with a song.
Tearin' up the country with a song.
I paid no attention, left my books at home,
Rather play my music real loud.

Play it loud, now! woo!

Tearin' up the country with a song.
Tearin' up the country with a song.
I paid no attention, left my books at home,
Rather play my music real loud.

Ran into a dry spell, seemed nowhere to go.
Good luck turned the tide, i'm on my way.
I remember loadin' big trucks when the summer sun was hot,
You know i could still be there, but i'm not.

Tearin' up the country with a song.
Tearin' up the country with a song.
I remember loadin' big trucks when the summer sun was hot,
You know i could still be there, but i'm not.

Tearin' up the country with a song.
I'm tearin' up the country with a song.
I remember loadin' big trucks when the summer sun was hot,
You know i could still be there, but i'm not.
