I'm lookin' for a reason to stay
I'm all wound up and tied in knots today
I'm lookin' for a reason not to go
When the morning comes, I'll be on my way


Ev'ry night I ask myself again
Just what it was that made our dream begin
It seemed like a good idea way back then
But I'm wond'rin' now what daydream took me in

I'm lookin' for a reason to stay
I'm all wound up and tied in knots today
I'm lookin' for a reason not to go
When the morning comes, I'll be on my way

Yesterday I tried once more to find
A way to share the trouble on my mind
It seems like you turn away ev'ry time
I used to like it here, I can't remember why

I'm lookin' for a reason to stay
I'm all wound up and tied in knots today
I'm lookin' for a reason not to go
When the morning comes, I'll be on my way

I'm lookin' for a reason to stay
I'm all wound up and tied in knots today
I'm lookin' for a reason not to go
When the morning comes, I'll be on my way
