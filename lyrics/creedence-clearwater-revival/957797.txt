What would you have me do
Just turn and walk out on you
And leave you standing there
Pretending I don't care
When you know as well as I
that would be nowhere
shouldn't I be with you


What would you have me say
After I walk away
would it be the end
or just a second wind
for the good old song that we use to call pretending
shouldn't I be with you

It's not the first time that you had me turn away
I don't know it won't be the last time
But you got to say you got to

Should we make a brand new start
or are you gonna break my heart
and leave me standing there
pretending I don't care
When you know as well as I
that would get us nowhere
will it be the end
or just a second wind
for the good old song that we use to call pretending
shouldn't I be with you
shouldn't I be with you
