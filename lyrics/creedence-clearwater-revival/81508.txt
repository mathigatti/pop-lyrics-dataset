First thing I remember was asking papa why
For there were many things I didn't know
And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand
Saying someday you'll understand


Well I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes

Well, time and tears went by and I collected dust
For there were many things I didn't know
When daddy went away he said "try to be a man"
And someday you'll understand

Well I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes

And then one day in April, I wasn't even there
For there were many things I didn't know
A son was born to me; mama held his hand
Saying someday you'll understand

Well I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes

Think it was September, the year I went away
For there were many thing I didn't know
And still I see him standing trying to be a man
I said, someday you'll understand

Well I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes
