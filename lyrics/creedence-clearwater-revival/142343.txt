Traffic in the city turns my head around.
No, no, no, no, no.
Backed up on the freeway, backed up in the church,
Ev'rywhere you look there's a frown, frown.
CHORUS:


Com, commotion,
Git, git, git, gone.
Com, commotion,
Git, git, git, gone.

People keep atalking, they don't say a word.
Jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw.
Talk up in the White House, talk up to your door,
So much going on I just can't hear.

CHORUS

Hurrying to get there so you save some time.
Run, run, run, run, run.
Rushing to the treadmill, rushing to get home,
Worry 'bout the time you save, save.

CHORUS
