It's getting late
I'll be on my way
Seems that you have nothing left
To say
But now that you
Have had a few
Words that were lost have found
Their way
I love, adore you
Awake, but in the night
Deceive you and leave you
Sleeping wild


I love you, adore you
Awake, but in the night
Deceive you and leave you
Sleeping wild
