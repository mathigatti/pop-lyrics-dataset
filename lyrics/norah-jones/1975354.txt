And now it's half past midnight,
She calls his name
Afraid that in the morning,
That nothing will change
And well, where are the things
That we fought for?
Well, where is the love?
And well, where are the
Answers you told us,
Would come from up above?


This is how the world is...3x
...in a whisper

She says she'd like to tell you,
Just where they met
She says she's tryin',
But she can't remember yet
Sometimes when she's at home,
And she's all alone
She thinks she hears him call her,
On the telephone
And she says:
Well, where is the love that you promised?
Well, where have you gone?
I've searched for you, but when i get near,
You leave me on my own

This is how the worlds is...3x
...in a whisper

Someday she'll try to find him,
But where should she look?
Should she look in a city, or in a book?
And well, where are the things
That we fought for?
Well, where is the love?
And well, where are the
Answers you told us, would
Come from up above?

This is how the world is...7x
