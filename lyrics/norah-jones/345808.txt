I've had to think of a way to survive since you said it's over
Told me good-bye
I just can't make it one day without you unless i pretend that
The opposites true
Rivers flow backwards
Valleys are high
Mountains are level
Truth is a lie
I'm perflectly fine
And i don't miss you
The sky is green and the grass is blue


(break)

How much can a heart and a troubled mind take
Where is that fine line before it all breaks
Can one end their sorrow just cross over it
And into that relm of instantive bliss
There's snow in the tropics
There's ice on the sun
It's hot in the artic
And crying is fun
And i'm alright now and i'm over you
And the sky is green
And the grass is blue

And the rivers flow backwards and my tears are dry
Swans hate the water and eagles can't fly
But i'm alright now that i'm over you
And the sky is green and the grass is blue
And i don't love you and the grass is blue
