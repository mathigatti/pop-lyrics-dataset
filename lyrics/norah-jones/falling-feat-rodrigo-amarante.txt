I reach the top
(I reach the top)
The top of the trees
(The top of the trees)
I hear a sound
(I hear a sound)
The wind in the leaves
(The wind in the leaves)


But light turns into rain
I try to stay up high
It's calling, calling
I know it can be found
But I can hardly hold
I'm falling, falling

I'm laying low
(I'm laying low)
Beneath the vines
(Beneath the vines)
I hear a sound
(I hear a sound)
Of clouds going by
(Of clouds going by)

The Sun is coming out
I turn away but still
It's calling, calling
I know it can be found
And I can only hope
I'm falling, falling
