I really can't stay
(Baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away
(Baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been
(Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice
(I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)


My mother will start to worry
(Beautiful what' your hurry)
And father will be pacing the floor
(Listen to that fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry
(Beautiful, please don't hurry)
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
(put some records on while I pour)

And the neighbors might think
(Baby it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink?
(No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how
(Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break the spell
(I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I ought to say no, no, no sir
(Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
(What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)
I really can't stay
(Baby don't hold out)
Baby but it's cold outside

I simply must go
(but Baby it's cold outside)
The answer is no
(but baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been
(How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm
(Look out that window, man that's hard)

My sister will be suspicious
(Gosh, your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door
(Waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is so vicious
(Gosh, your lips are delicious)
Well maybe just a cigarette more
(Oh, never such a blizzard before)

I've got to go home
(Baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your coat
(It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand
(I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see
(How can you do this thing to me)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
(Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied
(If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay
(Get over that old lie)
Baby but it's cold outside
