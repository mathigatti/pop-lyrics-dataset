Crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
I know you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you would leave me for somebody new


Worry, why do I let myself worry ?
Wondering what in the world did I do ?

Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
Oh i'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

Worry, why do I let myself worry ?
Wondering what in the world did I do ?

Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
Oh i'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
