I'm alone, but I feel alright
In the summertime and the fall
In the spring when the house is dark
Doesn't bother me at all


I know, I know, it's in the light
The shadows start to move
There's a hurt in the wintertime
Makes it hard for you

There's a dream, a dream I had
That makes me sad on the road
That the sun keeps running from
Everyone I love

I know, I know, I know I'm leaning
I'm leaning on you
It's hard, I know, I know there isn't
Much that you can do
I know, I know, I know I'll make it
I'll make it through
In the wintertime, there's a kind of light
I only get from you

I know, I know, it's only light
It's only light to you
But there's a thing called the wintertime
I can't make it through

I know, I know, I know I'm leaning
I'm leaning on you
It's hard, I know, I know there isn't
Much that you can do
I know, I know, I know I'll make it
I'll make it through
In the wintertime, there's a kind of light
I only get from you
