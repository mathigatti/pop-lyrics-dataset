You've ruined me now
But I liked it but I'm ruined
Do you have a plan?
'Cause I'm in your hands


You've ruined me now
Though I liked it now I'm ruined
I had no choice
When I heard your voice

I know you said
Can't be misled
Now I'm the one
Whose face is red

You've ruined me now
Though I liked it now I'm ruined
Your chocolate eyes
Like buttons of lies

You've ruined me now
Though I liked it now I'm ruined
I'm trying to part
With what's in my heart

You've ruined me and how
I thought I liked it but I'm ruined
My whole world's now
Turned upside down

I heard me say I'm going away
But now I write you everyday
You heard me say I'm going away
But I'm on the floor outside your door

You've ruined me now
You've ruined me now

You've ruined me now
But I liked it but I'm ruined
Do you have a plan?
'Cause I'm in your hands
