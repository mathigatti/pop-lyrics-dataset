Day breaks in your head
And you're finally alone
I'll find a way to make it through
But it keeps raining in your heart


Time follows you around
Ticking slowly at your nerves
It's amazing that we made it through
Cause it keeps raining in your heart
Raining in your heart
Maby you should go away
If the love we had is meant to stay
Find a place to call your own
No need to roam around the rooms
That once made up a home

Day breaks in my head
And I find myself alone
Hope you find a way to make it through
Cause it keeps raining in my heart
Raining in my heart
Raining in my heart
