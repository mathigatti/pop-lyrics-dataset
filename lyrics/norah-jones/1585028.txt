If all we talk about is money
Nothing will be funny, honey
And now that everyone's a critic
It's makin' my mascara runny
If we only talk about the "Heathers"
Making it together is crazy
If we don't get a new situation
For our busted nation, we're lazy


But it's gonna be
It's gonna be
Please make it be
It's gonna be

Now if a princess becomes human
Don't stone her on a talk show, you'll ruin
'Cause there's a fine line between a skewer
And a decent sense of humor
Aim at the ones who've really hurt us
They should be arrested for murders
But then all the cameras were turned on
Some skinny naked blonde eating burgers

But it's gonna be
It's gonna be
It's gonna be
It's gonna be

It's gonna be
It's gonna be
Please make it be
Let's make it be

It's gonna be
It's gonna be
It's gonna be...
