And then there was you
And then there was you, my dear
I thought love was a game one would win or would lose
Until I found you
Until I found you, my dear
I thought love was a shame so I threw it away
And then there was you


I thought I was right
But now it seems I was wrong
I just waited so long and I feared love had gone
And then there was you
