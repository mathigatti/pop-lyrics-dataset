Miriam
That’s such a pretty name
I’m gonna say it when
I make you cry


Miriam
You know you done me wrong
I’m gonna smile when
You say goodbye

Now I’m not the jealous type
Never been the killing kind
But you know I know what you did
So don’t put up a fight

Miriam
When you were having fun
In my big pretty house
Did you think twice?

Miriam
Was it a game to you?
Was it a game to him?
Don’t tell me lies

I know he said it’s not your fault
But I don’t believe that’s true
I’ve punished him for being too weak
Now I’ve saved the best for you

And I’m trying not to hurt you
‘Cause you might not be that bad
But it takes a lot to make me go this mad

Oh Miriam
That’s such a pretty name
And I’ll keep saying it
Until you die

Miriam
You know you done me wrong
I’m gonna smile when
You say goodbye

You know you done me wrong
I’m gonna smile when
I take your life
Mmm, mmm, mmm
