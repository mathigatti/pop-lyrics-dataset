December come to me
I hope I can see
You not just in dreams


I will let you be
Why can't you believe
How much you really mean

December won't you come
Back with snow even sun
Don't say that it's done

I will carry you home
Take you from the loneliest
Place you have known

I will carry you home
Take me from the loneliest
Place I have known
