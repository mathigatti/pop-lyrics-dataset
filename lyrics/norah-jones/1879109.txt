If your ship's coming my way darling turn around
If he's back, you tank your seaway, put your anchor down
And if anyone's been asking
I'm looking, I'm looking for traction on my own


I'll take all your belongings, I'll put it in the yard
Bury all your letters, rip up the postcards
I won't need them where I'm going
The distance keeps growing
Till I'm gone

You should be safe
It could be good for you
You better be careful now
Now that I'm gone

You should be safe
Just let it be good for you
You better be careful now
Now that I'm gone

I'm going home on the phone now
Oh it's been awhile
Well you got me up at night
With my hopes so high
I don't know what I'm after
It feels like such a disaster
When I'm OK

You should be safe
Just let it be good for you
You better be careful now
Now that I'm gone
You should be safe
Just let it be good for you
You better be careful now
Now that I'm gone
Now that I'm gone
