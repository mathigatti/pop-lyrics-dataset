Oh Loretta she's a barroom girl
Wears them sevens on her sleeve
Dances like a diamond shines
Tell me lies I love to believe
Her age is always 22
Her laughing eyes a hazel hue
Spends my money like water falls
Loves me like I want her to


Oh, Loretta, won't you say to me
Darling, put your guitar on
Have a little shot of booze
Play a blue a and wailing song
My guitar rings a melody
My guitar sings, Loretta's fine
Long and lazy, blonde and free
And I can have her any time

Sweetest at the break of day
Preattiest in the setting sun
She don't cry when I can't stay
At least not till she's all alone
Loretta, I won't be gone long
Keep your dancing slippers on
Keep me on your mind a while
I'll be back, babe, to make you smile
