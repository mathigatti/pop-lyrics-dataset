Went out on a limb
Gone too far 
Broken down at the side of the road
Stranded at the outskirts and sun's creepin' up


Baby's in the backseat
Still fast asleep
Dreamin' of better days
I don't want to call you but you're all I have to turn to

What do you say
When it's all gone away ?
Baby I didn't mean to hurt you
Truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart
No matter how hard you resist it
It never rains when you want it to

You humble me Lord
Humble me Lord
I'm on my knees empty 
You humble me Lord
You humble me Lord
Please, please, please forgive me

Baby Teresa got your eyes 
I see you all the time
When she asks about her daddy
I never know what to say

Heard you kicked the bottle
And helped to build the church
You carry an honest wage 
Is it true you have somebody keeping you company ?

What do you say
When it's all gone away ?
Baby I didn't mean to hurt you
Truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart
No matter how hard you resist it
It never rains when I want it to

You humble me Lord 
Humble me Lord
I'm on my knees empty 
You humble me Lord
You humble me Lord 
Please, please, please forgive me
