I never wanted to be taken
But now I'm feeling so left out
So I don't care where I go
I'm leaving
Yeah, I'm leaving


Got about a half a tank left
That could do but only if I'm lucky
But either way
I'm leaving
Oh, I'm leaving

On my way to paradise
A little voice says,
"Don't think twice
And don't look back if you want things to change"

Ah, ah
Guess I'll have to love you from afar, ah
It's okay, 'cause all I need's my car
Out on the road, out on the road
Out on the road, out on the road I go

Out on the road, out on the road
Out on the road, out on the road

Takes about a week to get there
Maybe two if I stop to sleep it off
But I can't sleep
So I'm leaving
Yeah, I'm leaving

Keep on driving through the night
I find myself a slice of life
To show me that I'm heading the right way

And ah, ah
Guess you'll have to love me from afar, ah
It's okay, 'cause all I need's this car
Out on the road, out on the road
Out on the road, out on the road I go

Out on the road, out on the road
Out on the road, out on the road I go

Out on the road, out on the road
Out on the road, out on the road
