People can’t be hand-made
But he keeps slaving away
At a stone that’s too hard to break
A girl who’s too lost to save


So you tried to replace me
But you didn’t get far
And I tried to repay you
But I only got scarred

She’ll be breaking your fall
And I’ll be building new walls
But this time I’ll have to make sure
To add a window for you to come back

And we tried to be faithful
But didn’t get far
Now all we’ll be left with is 4 broken hearts
I tried to erase you
But didn’t get far enough away from you
Because you still can break my heart
