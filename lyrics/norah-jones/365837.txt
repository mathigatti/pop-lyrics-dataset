Let me tell you 'bout a boy I know
He is my baby and he lives next door
Every morning before the sun comes up
He brings my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love him so


When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know he'll go with me until the end
Ev'rybody asks me how I know
I smile and tell them he told me so
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah I just love him so

Now if I call him on the telephone
And tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four,
I hear him on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
He kisses me and he holds me tight
He tells me "baby everything's all alright"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
