Well first you gotta wanna get off
Bad enough to wanna get on him in the first place
And you better trust in your lady luck
Pray to God that she don't give up on you right now


Live fast
Die young
Bull rider
Hey hey

One hand hold is all you got
It's you and the bull against the clock and a cross crowd
And just upon a spinnin' ton
Nothin' else you've ever done can pull this way

You're just outside the buckin' shoot
Lose a spur you lose your seat and you lose yourself
By now he's buckin' mean and dirty
Slingin' mud and cowboy boots and kickin' clowns

No fools
No fun
Bull rider
Hey Hey

You gotta feel the way he's movin'
You gotta watch his head
And brace yourself for anything that a friend of you might dead

You know the art of hangin' loose hangin' just as tight
Well there's something like a hurricane dancin' with the kite

Live fast
Die young
Bull rider
Hey hey

Well the rodeo is more than rough
It's a fact of life it's tough to cut his fever ass

It's drinkin' beer and pullin' trailers
Tighten may on barreled razors and horse's buck

No fools
No fun
Bull rider
Hey hey

Live fast
Die young
Bull rider
Hey hey
