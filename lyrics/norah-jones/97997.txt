There's a place that I know, where the sycamores grow 
And daffodils have their fun 
Where the cares of the day seem to slowly fade away 
And the glow of the evening sun 
Peace, when the day is done 


If I go there real late; let my mind meditate 
On everything to be done 
If I search deep inside; let my conscience be my guide 
Then the answers are sure to come 
Don't have to worry none 

When you find peace of mind, leave your worries behind 
Don't say that it can't be done 
With a new point of view, life's true meaning comes to you 
And the freedom you seek is won 
Peace is for everyone 
Peace is for everyone 
Peace is for everyone
