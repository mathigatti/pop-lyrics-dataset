I'll go back to Manhattan,
As if nothing ever happened.
When I cross that bridge, as if this don't exist.
Have a prince who is waiting,
and a kingdom downtown.
I'll go back to Manhattan,
as if nothing ever happened


Don't have to speak at all.
One look in your eyes,
and I won't have to fall,
don't have to speak at all.

Brooklyn holds you
and holds my heart too.
What a fool i was to think i could live in both worlds.

Don't have to speak at all.
One look in your eyes,
and I won't have to fall,
don't have to speak at all.

I should go back to Manhattan,
It's just a train ride away.
I know nothing about leaving,
but I know i should do it today.
