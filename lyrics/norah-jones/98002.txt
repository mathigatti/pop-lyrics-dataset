I can't stop myself from callin'
Callin' out your name
I can't stop myself from fallin'
Fallin' back again


In the mornin'
Baby in the afternoon

Dark like the shady corners
Inside a violin
Hot like to burn my lips
I know I can't win

In the mornin'
Baby in the afternoon

I tried to quit you but I'm too weak
Wakin' up without you I can hardly speak at all

My girlfriend tried to help me
To get you off my mind
She tried a little tea and sympathy
To get me to unwind

In the mornin'
Baby in the afternoon

Funny how my favorite shirt
Smells more like you than me
Bitter traces left behind
Stains no one can see

In the mornin'
Baby in the afternoon

You're gonna put me in an early grave
I know I'm your slave whenever you call

I can't stop myself from callin'
Callin' out your name
I can't stop myself from fallin'
Fallin' back again

Fallin' back again
Fallin' back again
Fallin' back again
Fallin' back again
