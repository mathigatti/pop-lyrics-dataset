I am the runner, you are the chaser
My twin in flames 'til we meet again
I am the lost, you can't be found
My twin in flames, lift me from the ground


You are the hider, I am the seeker
My twin, I'm in flames, I'm rolling about
I have a name, you call me by none
My twin, I'm on fire, come put me out

As God is my witness, I try to be strong
But my twin, I'm on fire, don't string me along
Wake you from slumber, you fall so hard
Twin, we're in flames, we've gone too far

My pockets are empty, your heart is stripped bare
My twin in flames, we're not even there

Can't see past the border or smoke
My twin enflamed who I'm sorry I woke
The circle continues as plain as can be
My love, let me go, I should let you be

You are the runner, I am the chaser
My twin in flames 'til we meet again
