I forgot, oh oh
I say it for the first time, oh oh
I forgot, oh oh
I say it again


Ai saudade wabi sabi mono no aware
Bollywood n' Kamikaz, Nintendo to Atari
Oompa Loompa says we can't forget
But you forgot, oh oh

I said it for the first time, oh oh
I can't be what I'm not
I'll say it for the third time, oh oh
I forgot, oh oh
I'll say it again

In Oaxaca, Waxahachie, Rio de Janeiro
Saskatoon n' Kalamazoo and San Junipero
Land of Oz is waiting for us even if
I forgot, oh oh

You say it for the first time, oh oh
You can't face what you're not
I'll say it for the fourth time, oh oh
I forgot, oh oh
We'll say it for the last time, oh oh

We forgot, oh oh
We'll say it again, oh oh
We forgot, oh oh
We'll say it again, oh oh
We forgot, oh oh
We'll say it again, oh oh
Oh oh
