What did you say? 
I know I saw you singin' 
But my ears won't stop ringin' 
Long enough to hear those sweet words 
What did you say? 


End of the day, the hour hand has spun 
But before the night is done 
I just have to hear those sweet words 
Spoken like a melody 

All your love is a lost balloon 
Rising up through the afternoon 
Till it could fit on the head of a pin 

Come on in 
Did you have a hard time sleepin' 
Cause the heavy moon was keepin' me awake 
And all I know is I'm just glad to see you again 

See my love is like a lost balloon 
Rising up through the afternoon 
And then you appeared 

What did you say? 
I know what you were singin' 
But my ears won't stop ringin' 
Long enough to hear those sweet words 
And your simple melody 
I just have to hear those sweet words 
Spoken like a melody 
I just wanna hear those sweet words.
