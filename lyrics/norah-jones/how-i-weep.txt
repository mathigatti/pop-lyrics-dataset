How I
How I
Weep for the loss
And it creeps down my chin
For the heart and the hair
And the skin and the air
That swirls itself around the bare


How I weep
How I weep
How I weep and I sleep
And I march and I dance
And I sing and I laugh and I laugh
And I laugh
But inside
But inside
Inside I weep
Inside I weep and I weep
For a loss
That's so deep
That it hardens and turns into stone

There it stays
And rolls through bones
Till they crumble
And the earth doesn't spin
It's got no way to win
And the stars stare down with sad clown faces
And they taunt me
They taunt me
So I run and I run and I run and I run
But I've nowhere to go except into the sun

And I weep for the loss and the loss weeps for me
The loss weeps for me
Then it whacks me straight into my stomach at night
It's a hard blow to take with all of its might
And it tries to be sorry, it tries to be sweet
Then it runs out the door as if on two feet

And I stand there and wonder when will I be free
Then I realized I held it, it never held me
It had to hurt me to finally be gone
'Cus I made the mistake of dragging it on
And I wonder what kind of person am I
Who weeps for a loss but can't tell it goodbye

How I
How I weep
How I weep
How I weep

How I
How I weep
How I weep
How I weep
