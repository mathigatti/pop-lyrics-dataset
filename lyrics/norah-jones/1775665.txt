Treat me like a fool,
Treat me mean and cruel,
But love me.


Break my faithful heart,
Tear it all apart,
But love me.

If you ever go,
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue,
Crying over you, dear only.

I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart
Beatin' so close to mine

If you ever go,
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue,
Crying over you, dear only.

I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart
Beatin' so close to mine

If you ever go,
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
Beggin' on knees,
All I ask is please, please love me
