Norah Jones:
Life is filled with gray
But now he comes to me
Please fall away
Hip hop is playing again
And it's bangin too
Gonna bang for you
Dont stop this feeling I feel
I just wanna run out all day for you and breathe for you at least
Im soo into your rich history
Tell me a story and take me away
C'mon and take me oooo
C'mon and take me with u


Chorus:

Life is, better
Now that, now that Ive found you
Life is, better
Now that, now that Ive found you
Life is, better
Now that, now that Ive found you
Life is, better
Now that, now that Ive found you
Life is, better
Now that, now that Ive found you
Life is, better
Now that, now that Ive found you
Life is, better
Now that, now that Ive found you
Life is, better
Now that, now that Ive found you

One step at a time, a man walked on the moon
One record got played Kool Herc said boom
One minute young man, your time come soon
