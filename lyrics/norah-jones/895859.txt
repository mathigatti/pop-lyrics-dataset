You've got a famous last name
But you're not to blame
Baby I see you for who you are


A one time apple queen
And a one time tramp
And an old time movie star

You're a shell picker
Of the pickiest kind
But you always find the ones to keep

And in or out of bed
You keep you're head wide open
'Cause ya don't only dream when you're asleep

Like a child, you remember
But I forget all my dreams

I used to think
That someday I'd relax a little
And be more like you

Then I realized
How silly that thought was
Needed to stand in my own shoes

And from over here
I can see you cry
Don't even try to pretend

'Cause he's hurt you
So many times
Baby, don't go back again

Like a child, you forget
But I remember everything and every sting

And through all the games
We'll both stay the same
As we've always been
Through the fat and thin
Until the end
Until the end
