It's him or me
That's what he said
But I can't choose
Between a vegan and a pot head
So I chose you, because you're sweet and you give me lots of lovin' and you eat meat
And that's how you became
My only man of the hour


You never lie
And you don't cheat
And you don't have any baggage tied to your forefeet
Do I deserve, to be the one, who will feed you breakfast, lunch, and dinner and take you to the park at dawn
Will you really be
My only man of the hour

I know you'll never bring me flowers
Flowers they will only die
And though you'll never take a shower together
I know you'll never make me cry
You never argue
You don't even talk
And I like the way you let me lead you when we go outside and walk
Will you really be
My only man of the hour?
My only man of the hour.
My only man of the hour.
