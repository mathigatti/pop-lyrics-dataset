Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights of town
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
When the lights have lost their glow, you're gonna cry, cry, cry
Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone
I lie awake at night and wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
Soon your sugar-mammas will all be gone
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call to me but I'm gonna tell you: "Bye, bye, bye,"
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry,
When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you
You'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and you gonna ask me why, why, why?
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me there,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
