Your toy balloon has sailed
In the sky now,
But now it must fall to the ground.
Now your sad eyes reveal
Just how badly you feel.
There is no easy way down.


The view from the cliffs
Must have been exciting,
And up to the peaks,
You were bound.
Now you're stranded alone
And the past is unknown
And there is no easy way down.

And now it isn't very easy
When you find yourself on your own.
No it isn't very easy
When each road you take,
Is one more mistake,
There's no one to break, your fall,
Lead you back home.

We all like to climb
To the hieights of love dear
Where our fantasy world can be found
But you must know in the end
When it's time to decend
That there is no easy way down.

I know it isn't very easy,
When you find yourself out on your own.
No it isn't very easy
When each road you take,
Is one more mistake,
There's no one to break,
Your fall,
And lead you back home

We all like to climb
To the heights of love dear,
Where our fantasy world can be found
But you must know in the end
When it's time to decend
That there is no easy way down.

There is no easy way down.
