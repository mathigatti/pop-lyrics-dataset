I've flown around the world on a place
I've settled revolutions in SPain
The North Pole I have charted
But I can't get started
With you


Round the golf course I'm under par
And all the movies want me to star
i've got a house and a show place
But I can't get no place
With you

You're so supreme
Lyrics I write to you
They scheme
Just for the sight of you
Dream both day and night of you

And what good dos it do
In 1929 ?
But now  I'm down hearted
Can't get started
With you
