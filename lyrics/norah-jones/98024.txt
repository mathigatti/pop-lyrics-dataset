Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall,
Layin' soft upon my skin,
Like the shadows on the wall.


Come and lay down by my side
'Till the early morning light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night.

I don't care what's right or wrong,
I don't try to understand.
Let the devil take tomorrow.
Lord, tonight I need a friend.

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight.
And it's sad to be alone.
Help me make it through the night.

I don't care what's right or wrong,
I don't try to understand.
Let the devil take tomorrow.
'Cause, tonight I need a friend.

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

I don't want to be alone
Help me make it through the night
