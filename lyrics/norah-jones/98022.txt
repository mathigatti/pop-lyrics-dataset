I don't believe the things I'm seein' 
I've been wonderin' 'bout some things I've heard 
Everybody's crying mercy 
When they don't know the meaning of the word 



A bad enough situation 
Is sure enough getting worse 
Everybody's crying justice 
Just as soon as there's business first 

Toe to toe, touch and go 
Give a cheer and get your own souvenir 

Well you know the people running round in circles 
Don't know what they're headed for 
Everybody's crying peace on earth 
Just as soon as we win this war 

Straight ahead, gotta knock em dead 
So pack your kit, choose your own hypocrite 

You don't have to go to off-Broadway 
To see something plain absurd 
Everybody's crying mercy 
When they don't know the meaning of the word 

Nobody knows the meaning of the word
