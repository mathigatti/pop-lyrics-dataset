Sunrise, sunrise
Looks like morning in your eyes
But the clock's held 9:15 for hours


Sunrise, sunrise
Couldn't tempt us if it tried
'Cause the afternoon's already come and gone

And I said, hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
To you?

Surprise, surprise
Couldn't find it in your eyes
But I'm sure it's written all over my face

Surprise, surprise
Never something I could hide
When I see we made it through another day

And I say, hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
To you?

And now the night
Will throw its cover down
Hmm, on me again
Ooooh, and if I'm right
It's the only way to bring me back

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
To you?

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
To you?
