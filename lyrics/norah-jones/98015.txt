Are you lonesome tonight ? 
Do you miss me tonight ? 
Are you sorry we drifted apart ?
Does your memory stray to a bright summer day
When Ikissed you and called you sweetheart


Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there ?
Is your heart filled with pain ?
Shall I come back again ?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight ?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there ?
Is your heart filled with pain ?
Shall I come back again ?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight ?
