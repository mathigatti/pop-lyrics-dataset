She, she came from the land of the cotton,
Land that was nearly forgotten by everyone,
And she worked and she slaved so hard,
A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun,
Oh, but she sure could sing,
Oh, she sure could sing.


Then He looked down and He took a little pity,
The whole town swore He decided,
He'd help her some,
And He didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty,
For deep inside His heart He knew,
She was the only one,
Oh but she sure could sing,
Yea, she sure could sing.

She had faith, she had believing,
She led all the people together in singing,
And she prayed every night to the Lord up above
Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah,
They use to walk singing songs by the river,,
Even when she knew for sure,
She had to go away,
And she never knew what her life had to give her,
And never had to worry about it,
For one single day,
My but she sure could sing,
Oh yes, sure could sing.

She had faith, she had believing,
Led all the people together in singing,
And she prayed every night to the Lord up above,
Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah,
She, she came from the land of the cotton,
Land that was nearly forgotten by everyone,
And she worked and she slaved so hard,
A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun,
Oh, but she sure could sing,
My, she sure could sing,
Oh, but she sure could sing,
Oh, but she sure could sing.
