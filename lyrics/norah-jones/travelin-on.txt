You could never be a face in the crowd
So you're travelin' on, travelin' on out
Well you know i'll never say it out loud
I'll be travelin' on, travelin' with you


Hey, I'm too weak it's too much to fight off
A past so strong
But now, I don't think too much all the time
I'll just try to keep up

Hu ouh
Can't believe what's happenin' now
Hu ouh
I can't believe it's happenin' now

If you notice that I'm fallin' behind
I'm takin' my time, takin' it all in
So call me when you get where you're goin'
I'll keep travelin' on, travelin' to you

Hey, don't be too hard on yourself
I'll be ok
Cuz we won't leave this place any worse
Than when we came

Hu ouh
I can't believe it's happenin' now
Hu ouh
I can't believe what's happenin' now
Hu ouh
I love the way it's happenin' now
