You might find me a little undone
You might drive me mad
All the voices tell me to run
But I know what we had
If I try to escape you
Which way should I go?
Pull the red tape off of my lips
No one has to know


Say no more
All the lies will wash up on the shore
Stay with me
I'll pretend you're everything I need

Take the bullet out of that gun
I'll bare you my soul
Everything you want to know
Swallow me up whole
If I call you a stranger
Will you play the part?
Even if you disappear
I'll hold you in my heart

Say no more
All the lies will wash up on the shore
Stay the night
I'll pretend that I put up a fight

Say no more
All the lies will wash up on the shore
Stay the night
I'll pretend that I put up a fight

You might find me a little undone
You might find me strange
All the voices tell me to run
Maybe I'm deranged
Maybe I'm deranged
