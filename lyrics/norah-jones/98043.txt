Well I said from the first
That I, I'm the worst kind of guy
For you to be around
Tear me apart
Including this old heart
That is true
And never ever let you down


You should'nt stick with me
You trust me too much, you see
Take all the pain
It's yours anyway
Get out kid

Oh put the blame on me
You ought to pass, you see
Oh somewhere outside
I threw
Love aside
And now
It's a tragedy

I said from the first
That I, I'm the worst kind of guy
For you to be around
