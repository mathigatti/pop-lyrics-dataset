Here we are out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight


Here we are in the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone
From the frigid air
Two sleepy people
With nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember
The nights we used to linger in the hall
Father didn't like you at all
Remember the reason why we married in the fall
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

Well, here we are
Just about the same
Foggy little fella
Drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Well, here we are
Gee, don't we look a mess
Lipstick on my collar
And wrinkles in my dress
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Here we are
Crazy in the head
Gee your eyes are gorgeous
Even when they're red
Two sleepy people who know very well
They're too much in love to break the spell

Do you remember the nights
We used to cuddle in the car
Watching every last fading star
Remember the doctor said your health was under par
And you my little snooks
Were ruining your looks

Well, here we are
Keeping up the pace
Let meets tomorrow
Slap us in the face
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to
Say goodnight
