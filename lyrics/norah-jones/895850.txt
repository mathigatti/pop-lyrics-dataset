I'm too foggy today,
To know what you're sayin',
Your lips are moving so fast,
And i just keep praying,
For them to slow down,
So i can make some sense,
Of the words that are pouring out,
Of your crooked spout.


Last night was a record to be broken,
It broke all over the kitchen floor,
Oh no don't you go,
I'm coming back with a rag,
To wipe away the haze from the days,
We've forgotten all about.

So be my somebody tonight,
Be the one who'll hold me tight,
Honey, please, please,
Cuz i've been so all alone,
And no one will pick up the phone,
So honey, please stay.

I held your head up, do you remember?
When you wanted to make a blanket outta me,
Oh i can't lie ... i been keeping score,
And it's your turn to wring me out,
And lay me down to dry.

So be my somebody tonight,
Be the one who'll hold me tight,
Honey, please, please,
Cuz i've been so all alone,
And no one will pick up the phone,
So honey, please stay,
Honey, please stay,
Honey, please stay.
