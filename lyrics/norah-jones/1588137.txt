hey shall we wade through the room for the street
and finally to me
he asked me what i'm drinking
my friend johnny tugging on my sleeve
asked if i wanna leave
and what i'm really thinking is


why can't it be easy, easy
why don't you leave me, leave me, leave me be

i can't see us swaying
i can't hear what you're saying

i'm sitting here stuck
and plastered to my seat
i think of a reason to leave
when you finally start speaking

i'll take a a long stroll
walked down washington street
half asleep on my feet
half aware if i'm dreaming

i'll go home alone
a sinking stone
a switched-off telephone
i'll go on briefly
a frozen breeze
a fallen down factory

i still see us swaying
but i can't hear what you're saying

i just lost the plot
got a little copped
been a little knocked
i just hit a wall
had a little fall
i felt a swinging wrecking ball

and why should that be
why don't you tell me
why don't you tell me

i'm sure you'll tell me
why don't you tell me
i guess you'd tell me
tell me
