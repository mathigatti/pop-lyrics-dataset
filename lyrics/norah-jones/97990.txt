Drivin' at night, you feel as if you're blind
The sun is gone and it's stuck in your mind
You look to the morning with expectation
Anticipation


When you feel the dark coming and you know that it's here
You feel your spirit sing, you know there's nothing to fear
I'm here by your side, i've got no where to go
So take your time, drive slow, listen to radio
Talk if you want, if you don't just change the station
I got patience

I tell myself wait
Wait 'till the sun goes down
Wait and you'll come around
And you'll smile for everyone
I'll make you a place
A place where the shadows fall
Can be anyone or no one at all
Just tell me what you want

I know sometimes you feeel the need to beware
i know that you're scared that I care
But I wonder who you're with when you turn out the lights
Who do you think of at night

When you feel the dark coming and you know that it's here
I've been there before and you've got nothing to fear
i'll make you a place where the shadows fall
And you can be anyone or no one at all
We'll take solace from the burning sun
Let me be there for you just this once

I tell myself wait
Wait 'till the sun goes down
Wait and you'll come around
And smile for everyone
I'll make you a place
A place where the shadows fall
Can be anyone or no one at all
Just tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
