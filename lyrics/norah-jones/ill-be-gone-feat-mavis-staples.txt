There's a place far from here
Gonna make it my home
It's where I belong


When I get where I'm going
I'll be gone, I'll be gone

When my heart
Gets so tired
That it can't keep time
Don't you cry

When I get where I'm going
I'll be gone, I'll be gone

Wish I could tell you that the sun was gonna shine
I got a feelin' that I still won't change my mind
Runnin' out of time

There's a place
On a mountain
You can take my bones
When I go home

When I get where I'm going
I'll be gone, I'll be gone

I wanna tell you that it's all gonna be just fine
But I don't wanna waste any more of your time
You didn't waste mine
