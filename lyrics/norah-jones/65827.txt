Come away with me in the night
Come away with me and I will write you a song
Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us with their lies


And I wanna walk with you
On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
So won't you try to come

Come away with me and we'll kiss
On a mountain top
Come away with me and I'll
Never stop loving you

And I wanna wake up with the rain
Falling on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is for you

To come away with me in the night
Come away with me
