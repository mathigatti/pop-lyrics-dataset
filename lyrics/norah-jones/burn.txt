The plot begins with you
And me in darklit rooms
Your cigarette cuts through
I wear it like perfume


The melody gives way
We silently behave
The story never ends
Is torn up into shreds
I see it in your eyes
Invitation lies
Book pages left to turn
Our chapters we should burn

The melody gives way
We silently behave
The story never ends
Is torn up into shreds

I see it in your eyes
And in the lies
Book pages left to turn
Our chapters we should burn
