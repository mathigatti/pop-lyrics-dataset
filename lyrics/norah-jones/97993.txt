The current is strong from what I've heard
It'll wisk you down the stream
But there never seems to be much time


My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water

Daydreamed on the bank again
I was swimming with the fish
And I thought this time that it may be true

(But) My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water

Walked a mile just to find the edge
Some place low enough to step right in
Now I'm here and I can't begin - to move

Walked a mile just to find the edge
Some place low enough to step right in
Now I'm here and I can't begin - to move

The spoiled sun up over there
It always has to have its way
And I know that the river's there to shelter me

My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
