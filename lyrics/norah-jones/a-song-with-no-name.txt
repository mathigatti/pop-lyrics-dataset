Do I love you too much?
Do I hold you too tight?
Have you had enough?
Shake me off in the night


If I had a gun
If I had a knife
If I had your love
If I was your wife

If I go on my own
And I see you in my dreams
And I hope to again
I have silently schemed

If I had a gun
If I had a knife
If I was the one
If I was your wife
