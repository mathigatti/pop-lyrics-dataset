In the dark
It's just you and I
Not a sound
There's not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart
In the dark


Now in the dark, in the dark
I get such a thrill
When he presses his fingertips
Upon my lips
And he begs me to please keep still
In the dark

But soon
This dance will be endin'
And you're gonna be missed
Gee, I'm not pretendin'
'Cause I swear it's fun
Fun to be kissed

In the dark
Now we will find
What the rest
Have left behind
Just let them dance
We're gonna find romance
Lord, in the dark
