The leaves are brown, came tumbling down, remember
That september, in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember
That september, in the rain


To every word of love I've heard you whisper
All the raindrops seem to play a sweet refrain
Though spring is here, to me it's still september
That september, in the rain

The leaves are brown, came tumbling down, remember
That september, in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember
That september, in the rain

To every word of love I've heard you whisper
All the raindrops seem to play a sweet refrain
Though spring is here, to me it's still september
That september, in the rain
That september, in the rain
