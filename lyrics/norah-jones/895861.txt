We met in a place I used to go
Now I just walk by it for show
Can't bear to go in without you, you know?
Wish I could
Wish I could


But Annie is standing in the door
With a look on her face I can't just ignore
She tells me that her heart is sore
And pulls me in
She pulls me in

She says "Love in the time of war is not fair
He was my man but they didn't care
Sent him far away from here
No goodbye
No goodbye"

I don't tell her that I once loved you too
Or about all the things we used to do
I kiss her hair and think of you
Walking down
The road you found

We met in a place I used to go
Now I only walk by it slow
Can't bear to go in without you, you know?
Wish I could
Wish I could
Wish I could
Wish I could
