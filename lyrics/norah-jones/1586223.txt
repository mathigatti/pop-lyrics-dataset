Something 'bout the way he touched me
Was so slow
The way he put his arms around me
Even though


I'm feeling lonely
I'm feeling lonely

Don't understand the words he said
Made me do wrong
But now there's nothing else in my head
And though it's strong
I wish he'd leave me alone
I wish he'd leave me

Cuz I know
Trouble will follow
But I have to go
I have to go

Cuz I know
Trouble will follow
But I have to go
But I have to go

It makes me think that I don't know me
So unsure
When I remember all the things he showed me
And I want more
I'm feeling lonely
Oh I'm feeling lonely
