Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


Were you watching
When I dropped the seeds from the window?
Were you watching
When I built walls from paper and glue?
Were you watching
When the flowers bloomed in the springtime?
Were you watching
Darling, where were you?

Were you listening
When there was nothing more to say?
Were you listening
I sang sad songs, anyway
Were you hiding
When our love was in the deepest danger?
Were you watching
As we slowly turned into strangers?

Were you watching?
Were you watching?
Were you watching?
Were you watching?

Were you watching
When the flowers died in the winter?
Were you watching
When I burned the walls of paper and glue?
Were you watching
Darling, where were you?
Were you watching
Darling, where were you?

Darling, where were you?
Darling, where were you?
Darling, where were you?
Mmm
