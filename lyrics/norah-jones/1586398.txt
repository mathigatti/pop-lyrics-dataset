Hush now watch the stars fall
into a fire wall
I am waiting here
waiting for you to come home


Sinking embers glow
Melting icy snow
I am waiting here,
waiting for you to come home

And I watch them burn
when will I ever learn
If I wait it doesn't mean
you will return

(repeat)

Now all the stars have gone
faded into cracks of dawn
and I'm still waiting here
waiting for you to come home
I'm waiting here
Waiting for you to come home
