Don't Miss You At All

As I sit and watch the snow fallin' down
I don't miss you at all
I hear children playin', laughin' so loud
I don't think of your smile
So if you never come to me
You'll stay a distant memory


Out my window, I see lights going dark
Your dark eyes don't haunt me
And then I wonder who I am
Without the warm touch of your hand

And then I wonder who I am
Without the warm touch of your hand

As I sit and watch the snow fallin' down
I don't miss you at all
I don't miss you at all
I don't miss you at all
