Stella came on a midnight train
Travelled through a drizzlin rain
I paced for hours by the station door
How I did pine as I waited for her


A thumb on the bass
A brush on the drum
A bow on the fiddle
We'll play all night long
Play all night by the firelight
Until the break on dawn

Slow motion and the train stops short
She's under his arms in her vinyl coat
A dream came true when I tucked her 'neath mine
I played her like a songbird divine

A thumb on the bass
A brush on the drum
A bow on the fiddle
We played all night long
Played all night by the firelight
Until the break of dawn
That night I played for Stella
I sang this song
