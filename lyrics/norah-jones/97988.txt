I couldn't make a change
I might have known you had found
Another love
I sat at home all night
Bask in the lonely pale
Of my bedstand light


But through a tear in a curtain
In a cheap motel
I saw with jealous eyes
You made the call to lie
Deceptively yours

I saw a black cloud
I didn't hear a sound
Only the shell on the ground
There was a scream somewhere
And in the thick night air
I put the pedal down
As the sirens wailed
And I sat alone and prayed
Not knowing what was to come

But through a tear in a curtain
In a cheap motel
I saw with jealous eyes
You made the call to lie
Deceptively yours

I tried not to believe
The scene that I could see
It felt like days passed by
Before I turned away
I felt a dizzy sway
And the gun in my hand
Stood before a judge

He cleared his throat to say
"I won't give you no bail"
Shackled with chains of love
I knew that I had bought
My own coffin nails

I hear your sweet voice calling out my name
As I stare from a six foot cell
And from beyond I heard the words
Deceptively yours
