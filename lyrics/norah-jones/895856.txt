She walked by the ocean
And waited for a star
To carry her away


Feelin' so small
At the bottom of the world
Lookin' up to God

She tries to take deep breaths
To smell the salty sea
As it moves over her feet

The water pulls so strong
And no-one is around
And the moon is looking down

Sayin'
Rosie, come with me
Close your eyes and dream

The big ships are rollin'
And lightin' up the night
And she calls out, but they just pass her by

The waves are crashin'
But not making a sound
Just mouthing along

Sayin'
Rosie, come with me
Close your eyes and dream
Close your eyes and dream
Close your eyes and dream
