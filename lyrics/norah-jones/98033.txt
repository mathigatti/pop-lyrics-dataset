It's another lonely evening
And another lonely town
But I ain't too young to worry
And I ain't too old to cry
When a woman gets me down
Got another empty bottle
And another empty bed
Ain't too young to admit it
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head


That's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna ride on
Ride on, ride on
Standing on the edge of the road
Thumb up in the air
One of these daysi'm gonna
Change my evil ways
'Till then I'll just keep dragging on

I broke another promise
And I broke another heart
But I ain't too young to realize
That I ain't too old to try
try to get back to the start
And it's another red light nightmare
Another red light street
And I ain't too old to hurry
Cause I ain't too old to die
But I sure I'm hard to beat

But I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm gonna do

Ride on, ride on
Ride on, ride on
i'm gonna change my evil ways
One of these days
'Till then I'll just keep dragging on

I'm gonna change my evil ways
One of these days
'Till then I'll just keep dragging on
'Till then I'll just keep dragging on
