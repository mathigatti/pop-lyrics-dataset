When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
Your daddy's leavin' home today
I think he's gone to stay
We packed up all our bags
And drove out to winnipeg


When we got to Winnipeg
I checked in to school
I wore white bucks on my feet
When I learned the golden rule
The punches came fast and hard
Lying on my back in the school yard

Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied

Well pretty soon I met a friend
He played guitar
We used to sit on the steps at school
And dream of being stars
We started a band
We played all night

Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied

Oh canada
We played all night
I really hate to leave you now
But to stay just wouldn't be right
Down in hollywood
We played so good

The businessmen crowded around
They came to hear the golden sound
There we were on the sunset strip
Playing our songs for the highest bid
We played all night
The price was right

Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied

Well, all that glitters isn't gold
I know you've heard that story told
And I'm a pauper in a naked disguise
A millionaire through a business man's eyes
Oh friend of mine
Don't be denied
