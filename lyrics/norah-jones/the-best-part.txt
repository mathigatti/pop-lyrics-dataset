I see the moon in the sky
I taste the soft in your eyes
I'll ignore all your lies
I'll chain as I go swing
Breaking off and away
In the scold of the cave
Don't forget me


I'll lay precious and mine
Love is reality line
Time always puts up a fight
Don't forget me

Lay your hand on my heart
Like it was at the start
That always was the best part
That was the best part
