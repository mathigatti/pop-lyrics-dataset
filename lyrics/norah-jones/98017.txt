This is the end of a beautiful friendship
It ended a moment ago
This is the end of a beautiful friendship
I know, 'cause your eyes told me so


We've always been
Like sister and brother
Until tonight
When we looked at each other

This was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of love
