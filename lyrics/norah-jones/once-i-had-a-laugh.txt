Once I had a laugh
And when I'm older
I will not forget
That once I had a laugh
And when I'm tired
I will not forget
That once I had a laugh
And when I'm fallin'
I will not forget
That once I had a laugh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh


Once I had a laugh
And now I'm older
But I will not forget
That once I had a laugh
And now I'm fallin'
But I will not forget
That once I had a laugh
I hear you callin'
But it's not over yet
Cause once I had a laugh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
I had a
Ooh
