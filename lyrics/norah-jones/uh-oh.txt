If I say it to your face, uh oh
Will you step out of the way (don't go)
What would happen if I look out the window
Is life slipping in and out of place, uh oh
Please just tell me what to say, uh oh
Do you still think I'm okay (oh no)
What's the point of only looking for problems
When solving them sends me into space
(Uh oh, uh oh)
I'll jump out the window
And float up to find myself disgraced


(Uh oh, uh oh)
Oh no
(Uh oh, uh oh)
Oh no, oh no
(Uh oh, uh oh)
Oh no, oh no
(Uh oh, uh oh)
Oh no, oh no
Uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh

If I breathe I will misplace my fear
I won't walk away in anger dear
Or in time I will forget
And I stumble toward you
With hands around your neck
You hear, you hear
I look out the window
And life, it has shifted out of place
Oh dear, oh dear
I'll just look out the window
My life's slipping in and out of place

Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no
(Uh oh, uh oh)
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no
(Uh oh, uh oh)
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no
(Uh oh, oh)
Oh no, oh no
