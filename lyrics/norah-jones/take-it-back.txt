Won't you take me away from here
So I'll never find my way home
Well there's one missing part of me
And I'm afraid it's fine on its own
And this time it's finally grown
For me to see
Now I see


Words spoken silently
I could never understand
How breath delivers such poison
To someone too weak to stand
And dust can turn into mud
Out on the sea
In the sea

Take it back, take it back
Take it back

Take it back, take it back
Take it back

Take it back, take it back
Take it back

Take it back, take it back
Take it back
