Heart of mine,
Be still
You can play with fire,
But you'll get the bill
Don't let him know
Don't let him know that you love him
Oh, don't be a fool, don't be blind
Heart of mine


Heart of mine, 
Go back home
You've got no reason to wander
No reason to roam
Don't let him see
Don't let him see that you need him
Oh, don't push yourself over the line
Heart of mine

Heart of mine,
Go back where you been
The only trouble with you
Is if you let him in
Don't let him hear
Don't let him hear where you're goin'
Oh, I'm tired of ties that bind
Heart of mine

Heart of mine,
So malicious and so full of guile
I give you an inch
And you take a mile
Don't let yourself fall
Don't let yourself stumble
Oh, do the time, don't do the crime
Heart of mine

Heart of mine…

Oh, oh, oh…

Heart of mine…
