This life as we know it
This life as we know it
This life as we know it is over
This life as we know it
This life as we know it
This life as we know it is over


Some may run, but I won't hide
I'll take my pride with you
If we find what we lost
God might see us through

Hearts frozen
Arms open
Hands shaking
Bonds breaking

This life as we know it
This life as we know it
This life as we know it is over
