Ooh
Ooh


Heartbroken, day after
My mind is spinning
Hopelessly out of control
Heartbroken, day after
Your side is winning
And I find myself in the cold

Hey, hey
It's gonna be okay
At least that's what I tell myself
Anyway
Hey, hey
Don't look so sad
It's not that bad, or is it?
It might be today

Heartbroken, day after
My heart is racing
To find a way out of this place
Heartbroken, day after
Our world is wasting away
And it's too much to face

Oh, hey, hey
It's gonna be okay
My little one, I promise
We'll find our way
Hey, hey
Don't look so worried
We'll have to hurry and climb out
Of this mess we've made

Find a way out
Find a way out
Find a way out
Find a way out
Find a way out
Find a way out
Find a way out
Find a way out
Find a way out
Find a way out

Heartbroken, day after
My mind is spinning
Hopelessly out of control
