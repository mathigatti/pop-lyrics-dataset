I'm not lonely
'Cause I'm looking at pictures of you
While I listen to snow
Being pushed off of the roof


I can't stand it
When I forget the things that I've got
And I'm wondering why
They were not in my life, no sign

I was mistaken
When I thought we could have it all
We can see what we wanna see
Before we have to fall

I'm just smiling
At the thought of a day long ago
When you asked me to stay and I left
At the fork in the road

We were dancing
In the place where your heart was in love
And the pieces were in the right place
Sent from Heaven above

Ooh
