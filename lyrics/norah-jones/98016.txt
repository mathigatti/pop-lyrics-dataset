If you wanted to stay
With me tonight
that's alright
But I ain't gonna ask you


It's late and you're tired
And it's so cold outside
So I don't mind
But I ain't gonna ask you

It could be nice
It could be wild
If we share a few hours together

And if you don't love me
But don't know if that's clear
Don't you feel
'Cause I ain't gonna ask you

Don't you feel
'Cause I ain't gonna ask you
