I won't cry for you
When the night grows long
And I won't die for you
Because you done me wrong
So tell your mama
I said hello
And that she raised you
Too damn slow
You're too damn slow
Too damn slow


Because I've been waiting
For your time
And I've been missing
Out on mine
So tell your father
That I said so long
And thanks for raising you
So damn wrong
You are so damn wrong
You're so damn wrong
So damn wrong
