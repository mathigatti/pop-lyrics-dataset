Bet you’re gonna cry when I’m gone
Bet you’re gonna cry when I’m gone
What a time to be wrong
What a time to be wrong


I know I’m gonna be missed
Yeah I know I’m gonna be missed
What a way to be tricked
What a waste of a trip
Never thought the day would’ve come
When I couldn’t get up and run
See you’ve given me gold and it weighed down my soul
But can I see if tomorrow will
Turn back to yesterday
Of have I gone too far to turn it back all the way?
How can it take so long?
I know that I’m killing time all alone but it’s dyin’ to slow
Why did it take so long?
I know that I’m just killing time all alone but it’s dyin’ to slow

Bet you’re gonna cry when I’m gone
Bet you’re gonna cry when I’m gone
What a time to be wrong
What a time to be wrong
