I want to find out where the moon goes
When it leaves the western sky
And night dissolves again 'til morning
Azure turns to gold
Azure turns to gold


I'm gonna sleep with one eye open
I'm gonna keep the shades half drawn
Nearly silent, dressed in shadows
Lines and colors fall

I'm gonna watch her through my window
Just as I watched you before
A smile knows, but just won't tell me
I just watch her go
I just watch her go

Now I learned just where the moon goes
When it leaves the western sky
And night dissolves again 'til morning
The moon is in your eyes
The moon is in your eyes
The moon is in your eyes
The moon is in your eyes
