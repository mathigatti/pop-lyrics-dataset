And all along, we were playing along
A game of mouse turned to playin' house
I sit back and watch this shit play out
One shirt turns into two
A toothbrush, a shoe or two
A courtesy, I'll fly with you
Runnin' from whatever
Running towards each other
I'll


Excuse me, beg my pardon, I know I don't say this often
But I find you to be awesome, awesome enough for stalkin'
If available for callin', we'll talk about summer and autumn
In between this lonely dream I give you a precaution

I'm known to be clingy, stingy, and needy with your love
We be eatin' and grab it, grabby, h-hoggin' all your love
So if your interest is my interest, intention my intention
If we color code this crazy mode, your Pinterest be my interest

Hey, I miss you
Don't know why I kiss you, baby
How do we find a
Place where we can be, baby?
Subways and streetcars
Taxis and Uber's
Taxis and Uber's

Don't be crazy
Though you can't save me, baby
Subways and streetcars
Taxis and Uber's
Driving to see you
Don't you go too
Help me from sinkin'
You know what I was thinkin', baby
Subways and streetcars
Taxis and Uber's
Driving to see you
Don't you go too far
