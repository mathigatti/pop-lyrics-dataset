Tonight you're mine completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow


Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sights
And will you love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that i'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to now if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
