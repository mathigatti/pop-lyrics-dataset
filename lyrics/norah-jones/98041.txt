Don't tell them, they'll only drink your tears 
Don't do it, not in a hundred years 
You know it 
You feel it, I do too 
Just listen 
Something is calling you 


What difference do you think that it makes 
If you give, or if it's you who takes? 
I know it 
I feel it, you do too 
Just listen 
You'll hear it calling you 

What difference do you think that it makes 
If you give, or if it's you who takes? 
I know it 
I feel it, you do too 
Just listen 
You'll hear it calling you
