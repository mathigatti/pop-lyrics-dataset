At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song


At last the skies above are blue
And my heart was wrapped in clover
Mmm The night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never never known

Ohh You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last
You are mine at last
You are mine...at last
