I turned your picture to the wall
I don't wanna see you anymore
You once were nice to me
Sugar and spice to me
Now you're as salty as you can be


Wehad some good times I recall
We don't ever have them anymore
Now you just lie to me
Then say goodbye to me
I can't believe this is happening to me

When I call you on the phone
You are never there
And I sit home all alone
You don't even care

So I'll just turn your picture to the wall
I ain't gonna see you anymore
It's all a memory
Now it can never be
I'll never see you at all
'Cause I will just turn your picture to the wall
