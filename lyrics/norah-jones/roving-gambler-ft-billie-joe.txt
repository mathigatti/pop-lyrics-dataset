I am a roving gambler, I've gambled down in town
Whenever I meet with a deck of cards, I lay my money down
Lay my money down, lay my money down


I had not been in washington, not many more weeks than three
When I fell in love with a pretty little gal, she fell in love with me
Fell in love with me, fell in love with me

She took me in her parlor, she cooled me with her fan
She whispered low in her mother's ear,
"I love that gambling man''
Love that gamblin' man, love that gamblin' man

"Daughter, oh, dear daughter
How can you treat me so?
To leave your dear old mother and with a gambler go?
With a gambler go, with a gambler go"

I've gambled down in washington, I've gambled over in spain
I'm goin' down to georgia to gamble my last game
Gamble my last game, gamble my last game

"Oh, mother, oh, dear mother
You know I love you well
But the love I have for this gambling man
No human tongue can tell
No human tongue can tell
No human tongue can tell"

"I hear that train a-coming
Coming 'round the curve
Whistling and blowing
Straining every nerve
Strainin' every nerve
Strainin' every nerve"

"Mother, oh, dear mother
I'll tell you if I can
If you ever see me comin' back
I'll be with the gambling man
Be with the gambling man
Be with the gambling man"

I am a roving gambler
I've gambled down in town
Whenever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
Lay my money down
Lay my money down
