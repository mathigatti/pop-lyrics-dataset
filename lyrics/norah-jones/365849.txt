I'm not here to forget you, I'm here to recall
The things we used to say and do
I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you


I haunted the same places where we used to go
Alone at a table for two
I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you

They ought to give me the Wurlitzer prize
For all the silver I led slide down the slot
Playing those songs sung blue
Help me remember you
I don't wanna get over you

A fresh roll of quarters, same old song
Missing you through and through
I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you

I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you
