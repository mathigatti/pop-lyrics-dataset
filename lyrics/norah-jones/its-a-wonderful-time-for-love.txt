It's a wonderful time for love
It's a wonderful time for love
Sun shines down from above


It's a wonderful time for love
And you think you have all you dreamed of
But all the great blue skies just ain't enough

When the sun goes down
We sleep safe and sound
A wonderful time for love
Time for dealing a different game
One where we don't have to place the blame

How much can we bear?
If pain is all we share
A wonderful time for love
Such a beautiful time to rise
And walk away from all the endless lies
And try to see the world through other eyes
