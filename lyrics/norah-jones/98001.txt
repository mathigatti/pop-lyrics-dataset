has got you under it's spell
moving so fast ... but
going nowhere


Up 'n' down
ferris wheel
tell me how does it feel
to be so high ... 
looking down here

Is it lonely ?
lonely
lonely

Did the clown
make you smile 
he was only your fool for a while
now he's gone back home
and left you wandering there

Is it lonely ?
lonely
lonely
