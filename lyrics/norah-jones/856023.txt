Yesterday I saw the sun shining
And the leaves were falling down softly
My cold hands needed a warm, warm touch
And I was thinking about you


But here I am looking for signs to lead me
You hold my hand, but do you really need me
I guess it's time for me to let you go
But I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you

So when you sail across the ocean waters
And you reach the other side safetly
Could you smile a little smile for me

'Cuz I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
