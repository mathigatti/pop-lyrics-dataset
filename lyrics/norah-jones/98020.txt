Coms a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snowstorm, you can get a little heat
Comes love, nothing can be done
Comes a fire, then you know just what to do 
Blow a tire, you can get another shoe
Comes love, nothing can be done


Don't try hiding, 'cause there isn't any use
You will start sliding, when your heart turns on the juice
Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away
Comes love, nothing can be done

That's all brother, if you ever been in love
That's all brother, you know just what I'm speaking of
Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake
Comes depression, you may get another break
Comes love, nothing can be done
