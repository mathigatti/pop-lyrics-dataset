It brings a tear
Into my eyes
When I begin
To realize
I've cried so much
Since you've been gone
I guess 
I'm drowning 
In my own tears


I sit and cry
Just like a child
My pouring tears
Are runnin' wild
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown 
In my own tears

I know it's true
Into each life
Some rain 
Rain must pour
I'm so blue
Here without you
It keeps raining
More and more

Why don't you
Come on home
Oh yes, so I won't
Be all alone
If you don't think
You'll be home soon

I guess I'll
(Drown in my own tears)
Ooh, don't let me
(Drown in my own tears)
When I'm in trouble, baby
(Drown in my own tears)
Oh, yeah 
Baby don't let me
(Drown in my own tears)
I guess I'll drown 
In my own tears
Oh, mmmmm
