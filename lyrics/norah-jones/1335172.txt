It starts off slow 
With a kiss of folly
And you don't see it 
As more
But after awhile 
When all the dogs 
See you
Sneaking 
In the back door
You don't believe 
When they tell you
You don't believe


Then 
A world of trouble 
Is all you see

Nights 
When the phone rings 
And it's so easy
To get up 
And go back again
You don't stop
You don't think 
To live without it
Knowing 
That you'll never win
You don't believe 
When they tell you
You don't believe

Then 
A world of trouble 
Is all you see

This is the last time 
Or the beginning
Whenever you say 
It's enough
While each day 
Each month 
Rolls out behind you
The lost time 
Is calling your bluff
You don't believe 
When they tell you
You don't believe

Then 
A world of trouble 
Is all you see
A world of trouble 
Is all you need
