Sweet dreams of you every night I go through
Why can´t I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you 
You don´t love me, it´s plain I should know


I´ll never wear your ring I should hate you
The whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you 

Sweet dreams of you things I know can´t come true
Why can´t I forget the past start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
