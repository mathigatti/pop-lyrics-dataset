Enter the nights all remains
Make me get up off my feet
Take the beat out of my heart
Now the people might believe


And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, and I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, and I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew

Moments fall like crimson nights
Some stick to my skin tonight
Take a breath and shake them off
Eyes ahead, don't you wait too long

And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, and I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, and I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew it was you

And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, and I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, and I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew
