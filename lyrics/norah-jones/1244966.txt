I don't know how to begin
Cause the story has been told before
I will sing along i suppose
I guess it's just how it goes


And now those sprangs in the air
I don't go down anywhere
I guess it's just how it goes
The stories have all been told before

But if you don't try
The light won't hit your eye
And the moon won't rise
Before it's time

But if you don't char
The light won't hit your eye
And the moon won't rise
Before it's time

But i don't know how it will end
With all those records playin'
I guess it's just how it goes
The stories have all been told before
I guess it's just how it goes
The stories have all been told before
I guess it's just how it goes
