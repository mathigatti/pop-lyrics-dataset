Take from me what you can hold
The things I need, already sold
I'll try to be somebody else
Or find new ways to be myself


Never hurts to be alone
Never hurts to be alone
Never hurts to be alone
Never hurts to be alone

Can you make me disappear
At least for once or twice a year?

It hurts to be alone
It hurts to be alone
It hurts to be alone
It hurts to be alone

Everybody is my friend
Until I run into my end

But it hurts to be alone
But it hurts to be alone
But it hurts to be alone
It hurts to be alone, ooh
It hurts to be alone
It hurts to be alone, ooh
It hurts to be alone
It hurts to be alone
