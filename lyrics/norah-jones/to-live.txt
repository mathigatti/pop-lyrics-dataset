Ooh
Ooh


To live in this moment
And finally be free
Is what I was after
No chains holding me
If love is the answer
In front of my face
Then I'll live in this moment
And find my true place

These cracks in my heart
Can't be filled with cement
Can't find or use up
All the time that I've spent
I want a life in color
To breathe outside the lines
To live in this moment
Find peace in my mind

Ooh
Ooh

Who said all those things
To make you go and hide?
So stuck in your head
That you can't come outside
Please, throw down the darkness
As best as you can
And live in this moment
I'll reach out my hand

To live in this moment
And finally be free
Is what I was after
No chains holding me
If love is the answer
In front of my face
I'll live in this moment
And find my true place
I'll live in this moment
And find my true place
I'll live in this moment
And find my true place

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
