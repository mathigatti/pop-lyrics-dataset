Little broken hearts of the night
Slowly picking up their knives
On the way to the fight
Tonight they want revenge


Beautiful soldiers in their beds
Making love inside their hands
With no chance to defend
Tonight could be their end

With the weapons in their hands
And their eyes closed as they stand
Can they end it all tonight so easily?

Did the darkness of their days
Make them let go of their light?
Will they want to find a way
To make it all right?

When the beautiful awake
See the sadness in their eyes
Will they want to find a way
To make it all right,
To make it all right?

Only the fallen need to rise
What if lightning strikes them twice?
Will they give up on their lives
And finally divide?

Did the darkness of their days
Make them let go of their light?
Can they ever find a way
To sleep side by side?

When the beautiful awake
See the sadness in their eyes
Will they ever find a way
To sleep side by side,
To sleep side by side,
To sleep side by side?
