Trying to pick up the pace,
Trying to make it so i never see your face again.
Time to throw this away want to make sure that you never waste my time
Again.


How does it feel?
Oh how does it feel to be you right now dear?
You brought this upon, so pick up your piece and go away from here.

Please just let me go now.
Please just let me go.
Would you please just let me go now?
Please just let me go.

I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you out of my head.
Get out.

I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you out of my head.
Get out.

Never said we'd be friends,
Trying to keep myself away from you,
'cause you're bad, bad news.

With you gone, i'm alive,
Makes me feel like i took happy pills,
And time stood still.

How does it feel?
Oh how does it feel to be the one shut out?
You broke all the rules.
I won't be a fool for you no more my dear.

Please just let me go now.
Please just let me go.
Would you please just let me go now?
Please just let me go.

I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you out of my head.
Get out.

I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you out of my head.
Get out.
