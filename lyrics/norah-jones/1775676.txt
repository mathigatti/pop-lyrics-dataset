Saving nickles saving dimes
Oh that boy of mine
Oh some sweet day
By my side
How happy I'd be
Where those fishing boats
Gonna see my baby again
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
The silver moon
Gonna take away
On Blue Bayou
And the evening tide
And the world is mine
To Blue Bayou
Come what may
Where the folks are fine
On Blue Bayou
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou
Come what may
If I could only see
Saving nickles saving dimes
I'm so lonesome all the time
To Blue Bayou
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou
If I could only see
Gonna be with some of my friends
I'm going back someday
My dreams come true
Where the folks are fine
Through sleepy eyes
This hurting inside
With their sails afloat
That familiar sunrise
How happy I'd be
On Blue Bayou
Working til the sun don't shine
Through sleepy eyes
That familiar sunrise
Well I'll never be blue
With their sails afloat
Looking forward to happier times
I'm going back someday
Looking forward to happier times
Working til the sun don't shine
