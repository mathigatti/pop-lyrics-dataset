I got a house full of walls
And utility bills, every Monday the company calls
I got a nice bed to sleep on
And a chest of drawers, where I keep those dreams of yours


Cause you're always mine to keep when you're gone
Two silvers rings, one's on my finger and the other one's gone
Went underground with you, oh John

Ten years pass
And I ended up with a house full of cats
But most of them went missing
Through that window you never fixed, the door you never latched

But you were on your way out the last time...

Cause you are always mine to keep when you're gone
Two silvers rings, one's on my finger and the other one's gone
Went underground with you, oh John

I knew what you were doing
That summer when Candie came around
But I had too much hurt to bother you
When we lost our first child I thought a little pain was overdue

And I wanted you so bad...

Cause you are always mine to keep when you're gone
Two silvers rings, one's on my finger and the other one's gone
Went underground with you, oh John

I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you...
