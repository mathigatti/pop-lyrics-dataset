My story is much 
To sad to be told
But practically everything 
Leaves me totally cold
The only exception 
I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree 
Fighting vainly the old ennui
Then I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face


Chorus:

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol 
Doesn't thrill me at all

So tell me why 
Should it be true?
That I get a
Kick out of you

(Some like the perfume from Spain)
(I'm sure 
that if I took even one sniff)
(It would bore me terrifically too)
(But I get a kick out of you)

(Some like the bop-type refrain)
(I'm sure that if 
I heard even one riff)
(It would bore me terrifically too)
(But I get a kick out of you)

(Some they may go for cocaine)
(I'm sure that if 
I took even one sniff)
(It would bore me 
terrifically too)
(But I get a kick out of you)

I get a kick every time 
I see you 
Standing there before me
I get a kick though 
It's clear to see 
You obviously do not adoreme

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high 
With some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you
