Good morning
My thoughts on leaving
Are back on the table
I thought you should know
And maybe powerful actions
Or powerful feelings
Will keep me from going


I’m folding my hand, hand
I’m folding my hand, hand

Good morning
Why did you do it?
I couldn’t sleep
I knew you were gone
Our loving is all I was after
But you couldn’t give it
So I’m moving on

I’m folding my hand, hand
I’m folding my hand, hand
