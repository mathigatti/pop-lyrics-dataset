There's a big ol' hole
That's gone right through the sole
Of this old shoe
And the water on the ground
Ain't got no place else it found
So it's only got one thing left to do


Creep on in
Creep on in
And once it has begun
Won't stop until it's done
Sneaking in

There's a silver moon
That came just a little soon
For me to bare
Shines brightly on my bed
And the shadows overhead
Won't let me sleep as long as they're there

Creep on in
Creep on in
And once it has begun
Won't stop until it's done
Sneaking in

There's a big ol' hole
That goes right through my sole
And that ain't nothin' new
So long as you're around
And got no place else you've found
There's only one thing left to do

Creep on in
Creep on in
And once you have begun
Don't stop until you're done
Sneaking in
