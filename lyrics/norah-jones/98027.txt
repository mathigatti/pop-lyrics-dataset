Close your eyes, close the door
You don't have to worry any more
Cause I'll be your baby tonight


Shut the light, shut the shade
You don't have to be afraid
'Cause I'll be your baby tonight

Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
That big fat moon
Is gonna shine like a spoon
But we're gonna let it
You won't regret it

Kick your shoes off
And don't you fear
Bring that bottle over here
Cause I'll be your baby tonight

Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
That big fat moon
Is gonna shine like a spoon
But we're gonna let it
You won't regret it

Kick your shoes off
And don't you fear
Bring that bottle over here
Cause I'll be your baby tonight
Cause I'll be your baby tonight
Cause I'll be your baby tonight, tonight
