You made a mess inside
You could not hide your pride
You never held my hand
And I'll never understand
Why I can't stop loving you
And I won't stop trying to


I go out every night
Can't seem to pick a fight
Never have found your eyes
Out in the crowded skies

And I can't stop fighting you
But I won't stop trying to
'Cause your voice keeps spinning 'round my head at night
Making me scream

And I can't stop loving you
But I won't stop trying not to
and I can't stop loving you away

You made a mess inside
You really hurt my pride
Why did you have to die?
Why did you have to die?
Why did you have to die?
