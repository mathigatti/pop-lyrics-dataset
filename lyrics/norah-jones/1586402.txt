If I touched myself
the way you touched me
If I could hold myself
the way you held me


Then I wouldn't need you
I wouldn't need you
No, I wouldn't need you
to love me

If I could replace
the things you gave me
If I could see my face
without the tragedy

Then I wouldn't need you
I wouldn't need you
No, I wouldn't need you
to love me

But I do
So come back
Come back

If you could see the way I act
When I'm alone
If you could hear my voice crack
over the phone

Then you'd know I need you
You'd know I need you
Oh, you'd know I need you
to love me
