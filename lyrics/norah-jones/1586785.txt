While the seasons will undo your soul
Time forgives us and it takes control
We separate our things to put us back together


We're light as a feather
Heavy as the weather
If it was raining stones

Put our hands together to applaud or pray
It's like the show was over,
but we're too scared to walk away

All for the better,
worse for the wear
We're light as a feather
GOD, you, and I together

Meanwhile inside me
It was raining stones
...ohmmmm...

And you didn't know
...ohmmmm...
GOD bless your soul

We're light as a feather
Heavy as the weather
We're light as a feather
GOD, you, and I together

...ohmmmm...
...ohmmmm...
...ohmmmm...
