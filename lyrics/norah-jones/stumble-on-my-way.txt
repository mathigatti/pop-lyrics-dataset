Above the clouds
I found a place
Where I can be
Without a trace


Wandering eyes
Can dance away
All of their blues
Out into space

You hold me up
I can't come down
Until I turn
Myself around

The Sun is fading
Into white
All of the beauty
And all of your light

Is almost gone
A passing dream
And I'll never know what
It all means

I'll sing a song
I'll have a time
And I'm holding on
To what is mine

But I'll kiss the dawn
Of a new day
And then I'll stumble on
My way

I'll sing a song
I'll have a time
And I'm holding on
To what is mine

I'll kiss the dawn
Of a new day
And then I'll stumble on
My way
And then I'll stumble on
My way

Ooh
Mmm
