Today is not like any other day
This one's gone and turned a darker shade of gray
What will I have learned
Tell me tell me somebody tell me now
When this hard rain's gone away


There is a safe place that I used to know
It's the only place that I wanna go
Where else could I turn 
Tell me tell me somebody tell me now
'Till this hard rain's gone away

Grandma, grandpa, mother, father, sister, brother,
Lord
Please help the child
I heard the preacher say "it's so sad"
I see the airplane
I hear the engine on the boat
But y'all can't see me waving the flag
Somebody please wave the flag

Grandma, grandpa, mother, father, sister, brother,
Lord
Please help the child
I heard the preacher say "it's ok"
I see the airplane
I hear the engine on the boat
But y'all can't see me waving the flag
Somebody please wave the flag

What will I have learned 
Tell me tell me somebody tell me now
When this hard rain's gone away

Today is not like any other day
So I'm gonna have to find another way
People we got to find another way
Can you tell me how
Tell me tell me somebody tell me now
When the hard rain's gone away

I've seen 'em waving the flag
Tell the chopper over here man we've waving the flag
I've seen 'em waving the flag
Tell the boat over here man we've waving the flag
Man, I'm waving the flag
Tell the chopper over here man we've waving the flag
Man, I'm waving the flag
Tell the boat over here man we've waving the flag
Waving the flag, waving the flag, waving the flag
