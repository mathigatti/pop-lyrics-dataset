I was dancing with my baby to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced her to my loved one
And while they were waltzing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me


Well I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
And I knew just how much I had lost
I have lost my little darlin'
The night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
And I knew just how much I had lost
I have lost my little darlin'
The night they were playing
The beautiful beautiful Tennessee Waltz
The Tennessee Waltz
