Just sit and wait, don't move
Just hesitate
You can hope and pray
You can moan
Maybe things will change


You feel your soul
Get hollowed out
While the world implodes
You just live without

She walks, she runs
She fights almost as one
And finds her voice
She’ll march
She has no choice

She's crushed by thoughts
At night of men
Who want her rights
And usually win

But she's alive
Oh, she’s alive
She's alive
Oh, she's alive

He screams, he shouts
The heads on the TV bow
They take the bait
They mirror waves of hate

They break down walls
To free their sins
And then their hearts
Come caving in

Oh, I watch, I think
I dance
And sometimes I drink
I sing my songs
I'll hope someone sings along

If I should break
My silent streak
Will knives come out
To cut my cheeks?

Oh, I'm alive
Yes, I'm alive
But I'm alive
Oh, I'm alive
I’m alive
Oh, I’m alive
Yes, I'm alive
Yes, I’m alive

I care a lot
I know the things I'm not
It's alright, it's okay
And it’s not, maybe things will change
