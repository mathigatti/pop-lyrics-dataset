Through these sleepless nights
I cry for you
And wonder who
Is kissing you
Oh, these sleepless nights
Will break my heart in two


Somehow through the days
I don't give in
I hide my tears
That wait within
Oh but then through sleepless nights
I cry again

Why did you go?
Why did you go?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
I need you

I keep hoping you'll come back to me
Oh, let it be
Please let it be
Oh, my love, please, end
These sleepless nights for me

Why did you go?
Why did you go?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
I need you

I keep hoping you'll come back to me
Oh, let it be
Please let it be
Oh, my love, please, end
These sleepless nights for me

My love, please, end these sleepless nights for me
