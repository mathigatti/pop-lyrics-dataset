Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high,
And the dreams that you've dreamed of
Once in a lullaby.


Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly,
And the dreams that you've dreamed of
Dreams really do come true.

Someday i'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me.
Where troubles melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly.
And the dreams that you dare to..
Oh why, oh why can't i?

Well, i see
Trees of green and red roses too,
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
And i think to myself,
What a wonderful world.

Well i see,
Skies of blues and, clouds of white,
And the brightness of day, i like the dark
And i think to myself,
What a wonderful world.

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They're really saying i... I love you.

I hear babies cry, i watch them grow
They'll learn much more than really know
And i think to myself
What a wonderful world.

Someday i'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high,
And the dreams that you dare to
Oh why, oh why can't i?
