My words are lazy
My thoughts are hazy
But this is one thing I'm sure of
Everybody needs a best friend
I'm happy I'm yours


You got a double
Who brings you trouble
And though you're better without me
Everybody needs a best friend
I'm happy I'm yours

A fool could see decidedly
That you're a ten and I'm a three
A royal brie is what you need
So how did you come to be stuck with a bummer like me

Oh you got a head full of someone dreadful
And yet lest that someone adores you
Everybody needs a best friend
I'm happy I'm yours

A fool could see decidedly
That you're a ten and I'm a three
A royal brie is what you need
So how did you come to be stuck with a bummer like me
