The sun doesn't like you, you always get burned,
Stay in the shade and watch the world turn.
Better find a new place to lay on the ground,
Can't stay where you are or you're gonna be found.


And time won't pass you by,
And I won't tell you lies.

So tonight...we can build a fire,
In the open field past the razor wire.
Sneak by the dogs when they go to sleep,
Bring part of yourself that you'll let me keep.

'cause time won't pass us by,
And I won't tell you lies,
Someday I will ask you why ...but not now.

And time won't pass us by,
And you won't tell me lies,
Someday we all have to die...but not now.
