I never told you about the summer
Everyday was changing
Only photographs
But life goes on
In my mind so warm


Out on my own now
And I like the way it feels
Didn't I come through
You were too far gone

After the fall
Do you still want it all?

You never told me about the winter
Everyday was changing
But I remember
But life went on
In my mind so cold

Out on your own now
Do you like the way it feels?
Didnâ€™t I come through?
You were too far gone

After the fall
I still want it all
