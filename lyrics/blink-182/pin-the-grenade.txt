Back down, I feel that you're leaving me
Right now, it feels like you're bleeding me dry
Slow down, you took away a piece of me
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go


Drove home, I'm running out of oxygen
Tight rope, tonight it's like I'm walking on air
Black smoke, coming from the undergroung
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go

Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Hey! Wait! Get out of my brain
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me baby please just do it slow
So hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face

My God, how could you talk to me like that?
Let's stop, you changed you're mind and called a ride home
You dropped a hint that I embarassed you
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go

Midnight, I'm underneath the landslide
Fast life, I leave you on the side of the road
You cried: this isn't what you promised me
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let

Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Hey! Wait! Get out of my brain
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me baby please just do it slow
So hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face

(Lie to my face)
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me baby please just do it slow
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me baby please just do it slow

Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Hey! Wait! Get out of my brain
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me baby please just do it slow
So hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
If you don't love me, lie to my face
If you don't love me, lie to my face

Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
