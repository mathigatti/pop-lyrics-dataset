13 miles down the road
Lives a young boy
He's got jet-black hair
And blue-green eyes
And he's mine


And every now and then
He and I will sit together on the porch
And I take off his pants
And I fuck him from behind

And I love him for his heart and soul
And I love his wrinkled scrotum too
So if you see us passing by
On some dreary rainy day
Take a look at the young boy
And his naked...
Asshole

Tom:"You guys like that song?"
