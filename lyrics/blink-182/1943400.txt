Take off the gloves
We fell in love by the side of the road
This desert will break you down
The veins you cut
Your smoking tongue is the end of us all
But you only care about
Fame and fortune
Watching others tortured
Casting your reflection
Grocery store perfection
This is the last time
Sent to the front line
With dirty boots on the ground
You said i'll make this all mine


You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone

Yeah your heart's all gone

Blackjack and architect
Let's drink ourselves to death
The crimes of everyone
Passed down from father to son
Hopeless and destitute
Destroyed my gratitude
Your strongest lines of defense
Are all just self-inflicted wounds

You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone

You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone

Yeah your heart's all gone

You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone

You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone

Yeah your heart's all gone
