Dragon Attack 

Take me to the room where the red's all red 
Take me out of my head-'s what I said, yeah 


Hey take me to the room where the 
green's all green 
And from what I've seen it's hot it's mean 

-Gonna use my stack 
-It's gotta be Mack 
-Gonna get me on the track 
-Got a dragon on my back 

Take me to the room where the beat's all round 
Gonna eat that sound - (yeah yeah yeah!) 

Take me to the room where the black's all white 
And the white's all black take me back to the shack 

-She don't take no prisoners 
-Gonna give me the business 
-Got a dragon on my back 
-It's a dragon attack 

Get down - I said so 
Hey hey - All right 
She's low down 
-She don't take no prisoners 
Go down 
-Gonna give me the business 
No time 
-Yeah chained to the rack! 
Show time 
-Got a dragon on my back 
Show down 
-Go find another customer 
Slow down 
-I gotta make my way
