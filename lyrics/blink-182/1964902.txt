I'm like a cat in a cage, locked up and battered and bruised
I am the prodigal son, a shameful prodigy too
I am the love of your life, battering ram and confused
I turn each day into night, I stand there waiting for you
There is desire to fight, but I have nothing to prove
With the crowd and some lights, I start to feel things move
Do you have something to hide? 'Cause I think that we all do
I am a child inside, back up and give me some room


I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
They turn us loose in the night, a fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home

Don't start to panic for me, 'cause I have nothing to lose
I am as bright as the sun, I burn up all that I choose
Up on the side of the field I see a city with lights
I touch her face when I kneel, she tells me she's not alive
I am too nervous to run, the kids who scatter and hide
Still reach and grab for someone, but end up buried alive
Her world is waiting for me, a world that I rarely used
I start to feel my feet, they kick down walls as they move

I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
They turn us loose in the night, a fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home

I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
They turn us loose in the night, a fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home
