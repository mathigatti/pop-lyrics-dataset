I'm a wreck, I'm out of time
I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken


I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Pulled me up underneath this heavy burden

There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

Torn apart like a broken hearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge
So I won't find my way home

Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent
When I'm cracked
When I'm broken

There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

Torn apart like a broken hearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone

Fifteen times a night
When the sun's gone down
In the dark awake
And you're not around
And the closest thought
Is the edge of oblivion

Fifteen times a day
When you check your phone
And I won't be there
And you're all alone
Because we always lived
On the edge of oblivion

Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
Because it's the only fun
On the edge of oblivion

Torn apart like a broken hearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
