Been gone a long time
I kinda lost my way, I can't find it
And I caught a short ride
To the grave and back this season
I can try to get by
But every time I start to panic
I'm a little bit shy
A bit strange and a little bit manic


La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da

I went to a wishing well
I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharper rocks
And washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star
It burned a hole through my hand
Made its way through my heart
Had fun in the promised land

On the narrowing line
What a way to sort my troubles
In a very short time,
Gonna pop, better duck and cover
Can you figure me out?
I got caught like a little kid stealing
Did I say it too loud?
A bit hard or a little misleading

La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da

I went to a wishing well
I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharper rocks
And washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star
It burned a hole through my hand
Made its way through my heart
Had fun in the promised land

La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da

I went to a wishing well
I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharper rocks
And washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star
It burned a hole through my hand
Made its way through my heart
Had fun in the promised land

I went to a wishing well
I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharper rocks
And washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star
It burned a hole through my hand
Made its way through my heart
Had fun in the promised land
