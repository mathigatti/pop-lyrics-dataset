She's a girl dressed in black from another world
Lives and breathes like a girl from another world
She don't know my name
She don't have the time of day
Celebrate‚ medicate 'til we numb the pain
In this storm it's still dark like it always rains
She don't feel the same
She don't have the time of day


And I wait, and I wait‚ and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her
And I wait‚ and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her

I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you

I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you

She's a girl I look back to what could have been
Her cloak and dagger, mouth tastes like medicine
She won't last the night
Spun out in the neon lights
You would leave, but you need me to numb the pain
You're possessed and you slept through another day
You don't feel the same
And I don't have the strength to stay

And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her

I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you

I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you

I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you

I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side

I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you

I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
