Push it out
Fake a smile
Avert disaster
Just in time


I need a drink
Cause in a while
Worthless answer
From friends of mine

It's dumb to ask
Cool to ignore
Girls possess me
But they're never mine

I made my entrance
Avoided hazards
Checked my engine
I fell behind

I fell behind

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone i'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this, like the prom
I get too scared to move, cause i'm a fuckin' boy

Remember when
I was in
The grocery store
Now's my time

Lost the words
Lost the nerve
Lost the girl
Left the line

I would wish
Upon a star
But that star
It doesn't shine

So read my book
With a boring ending
A short story
Of a lonely guy

I fell behind

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone i'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this, like the prom
I get too scared to move, cause i'm still just a stupid worthless boy
