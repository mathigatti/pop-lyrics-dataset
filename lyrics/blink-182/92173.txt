Every night in my dreams,
I see you I feel you.
That is how I know you,
Go on....


Far across the distance.
And spaces Between us.
You have come to show you,
Go on.....

Near... Far,
Wherever you are.
I believe that the heart does go on.
Once... more,
You open the door.
And you're here in my heart and
My heart will go on and on.

Love can touch us one time,
And last for a life time.
And never let go 'til,
You're gone.

Love was when I loved you,
One true time I
Hold to.
In this life we'll always,
Go on......

Near... Far.
Wherever you are.
I believe that the heart does.
Go on.......
Once... more.
You open the door.
And you're here in my heart and
My heart will
Go on and on.........

You're here,
There's nothing I fear.
And I know that my heart will,
Go on.....
We'll stay, forever this way.
You are safe in my heart,
And my heart will go on and on.....
