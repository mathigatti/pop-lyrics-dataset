It's all right to tell me
What you think about me
I won't try to argue you
Or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving
You must have your reasons
The season is calling
Your pictures are falling down


The steps that I retrace
The sad look on your face
The timing and structure
Did you hear he fucked her
A day late, a buck short
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing
When I move of flailing now

And it happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up

And maybe I'll see you
At a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by
On the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave
We'll pretend it's okay
The charade it won't last
When he's gone I won't come back

And it'll happen once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And you've been here for too long
To face this on your own
Well, I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
