I can almost see your house from here
But the signal seems to disappear
So whats the problem Houston's calling
The you hit me like a Friday night
Like a handgun in a firefight
Dive in slow motion towards the ocean


Let's run away
Let's go and waste another year
Lets spin apart while racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright
We're teenage satellites

I'm kind of nervous of the consequence
As we climb over the neighbor's fence
The longest summer's nights are numbered
Then you kissed me like a storm at sea
Like i'm the only one you'll ever need
We're left abandoned in the deep end

Let's run away
Let's go and waste another year
Lets spin apart while racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright
We're teenage satellites

We are a slow descent
Forgotten astronauts
We are an avalanche
We're just an afterthought

Let's run away
Let's go and waste another year
Lets spin apart while racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright
We're teenage satellites
Teenage satellites
