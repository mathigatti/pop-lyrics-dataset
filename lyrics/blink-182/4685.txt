Seen enough to eye you
But I've seen to much to try you
It's always weirdness while you
Dig you much too much to fry you
The wind just blows between us
Anyone could tell to see us
Freak scene just can't believe us
Can't it just be cool and leave us


Seen enough to eye you
But I've seen to much to try you
It's always weirdness while you
Dig you much too much to fry you
The wind just blows between us
Anyone could tell to see us
Freak scene just can't believe us
Can't it just be cool and leave us

Ahhhhhh!

So fucked, I can't believe it
If there's a way I wish we'd see it
How could it work, just can't conceive it
Oh what a mess, it's just to leave it

Sometimes I don't thrill you
Sometimes I think I'll kill you
Just don't let me fuck up will you
'Cause when I need a friend it's still you

(It's not gonna last)
