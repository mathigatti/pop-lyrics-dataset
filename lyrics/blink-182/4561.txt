On and on, reckless abandon
Somethings wrong,
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song, to lead you on


I learned a lot today
Not sure if I'll get laid and
Not sure if I'll fail or pass
Kissed every girl in class

Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up, when it's all done.

On and on, reckless abandon
Somethings wrong,
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song, to lead you on
Break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar, size: Extra large

Sip a drink of the alcohol
End up kneeling in bathroom stalls
Eyes are red and movements slow
Too high, got vertigo
He took a shit in the bathroom tub
And fed the dog the brownie drugs
Tried hard to not get caught
He fucked a chick in a parking lot.

On and on, reckless abandon
Somethings wrong,
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song, to lead you on
Break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar, size: Extra large

Break a window and bust a wall.
Making fun of your friends mom
Turn the music up way too loud.
Charge the pizza to the house.
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Somethings wrong,
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song, to lead you on
Break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar, size: Extra large
