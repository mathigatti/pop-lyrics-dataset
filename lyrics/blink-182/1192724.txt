I'm sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind
An oversensitive guy
That he's lost and alone
Yeah


I hate our favourite restaurant
Our favourite movie
Our favourite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in
What went wrong?
'Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place, it's fucking cursed
In it's plague
And I can never escape
When my heart, it explodes

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in
What went wrong?
'Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm kicking
Out fiercely at the world around me
What went wrong?
I'm kicking
Out fiercely at the world around me
What went wrong?
I'm kicking
Out fiercely at the world around me
What went wrong?
I'm kicking
Out fiercely at the world around me
What went wrong?
I'm kicking
