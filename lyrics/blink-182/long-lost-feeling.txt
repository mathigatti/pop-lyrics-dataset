Made a wish on a mountain top
But an avalanche came and washed away
Wrote a song on an old guitar
But the words were wrong, they made you walk away


Said I could have anything I wanted forevermore
Said I could be anyone I wanted when I was born

Every day turns into sleepless nights
My head is spinning with the sadness of a long lost feeling
Golden years where I would smash the mirrors
My head is spinning with the sadness of a long lost feeling

Found a wreck on the ocean floor
Like a tidal wave you washed it all away
Heard a song on the radio
All the words were right, it made me wanna stay

Said I could have anything I wanted forevermore
Said I could be anyone I wanted when I was born

Every day turns into sleepless nights
My head is spinning with the sadness of a long lost feeling
Golden years where I would smash the mirrors
My head is spinning with the sadness of a long lost feeling

Say goodbye until it hurts
Stormy skies and fireworks
Say goodbye until it hurts
Stormy skies and fireworks
Say goodbye until it hurts
Stormy skies and fireworks
