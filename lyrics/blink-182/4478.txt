Don't bide your time
'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
I'll see you around


And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again

Just yesterday
It always seemed like such a dream
We're unstoppable, indestructable
Nothing happens to our machine

And there's no harm
At least nothing we can see
As for you, not so true
You couldn't choose who's road he would lead

What a loss
You just lost all your sleep
And we've always thought
That this could never happen, you see

That it's so hard
You gotta get up on your feet
'Cause the only way, I gotta say
Is to move on through the week

Don't bite your time
'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
And I'll see you around

And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again

I'm sorry [x16]
(Sorry) it's happened to you

Don't bite your time
'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
And I'll see you around

And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again
