Good bye to you my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we've found help through the birds and bees
Learned to love and abc's
We skinned our hearts, we skinned our knees


Good bye my friend its hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere, look for me and I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time

Good bye my pop, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine, too much song don't know how i got along

Good bye, good bye it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that spring is in the air
Little children everywhere
When you see them I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song of all the seasons are now gone (x2)

Good bye Rochel my little one
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
And everytime that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground

Good bye Rachel it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that spring is in the air
There are flowers everywhere
I wish when you pick them I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the stars and their reason, and describes all their meaning(x2)

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song of all the seasons are now gone

Now all our lives we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climb were just seasons out of time
