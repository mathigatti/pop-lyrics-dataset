I can't get my feet up off the edge
I kinda like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy


Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help you suffer when you're hurt
For real 'cause you are driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
Do you grin inside, you're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know, I'm here to stay

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you've said
And it's driving me crazy

I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
'cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
Do you grin inside, you're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know, I'm here to stay

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on
