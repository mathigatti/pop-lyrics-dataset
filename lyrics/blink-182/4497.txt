It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, but I could never leave her
And if I did, you know I'd never cheat her


But this I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel if I should choose to go
Another guy, you think it'd be unlikely
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me

She's a dove, she's a fucking' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

I heard it once, I'm sure I heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say you got to turn your back and run now
Come on son, you haven't got a chance now

She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

I need a girl that I can train
I need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now

Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now
