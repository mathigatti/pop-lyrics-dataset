Home show, mom wont know
Run out the back door
He's passed out on the floor
Third time, been caught twice
Forgive our neighbor Bob
I think he humped the dog


But good things come to those who wait
Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21

White lies, bloodshot eyes
Breath of alcohol
Stole it from the mall
How's Chris marked with lipstick
Better call their fathers
Sleeping with your daughters
But good things come to those who wait
Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21

You dont belong, you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
Too bad youre wrong, dont need a mom dad slave drive song
I time bomb

Turn low the radio
I think I hear my dad
Yelling at the band

But good things come to those who wait
Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21

You dont belong, you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
Too bad you're wrong, dont need a mom dad slave drive song
I time bomb
