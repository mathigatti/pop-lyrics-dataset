Beige little boxes in a row
Neighbors and friends that you don’t know
Here’s a form go wait in line
Can’t you see I’m doing fine
It’s what I’ve always wanted


Two little kids out on the lawn
Once we had love, now it’s gone
Good things haven’t happened yet
I’m empty as a movie set
It’s what I’ve always wanted

Hey here’s to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey here’s to you California

Wearing all black out on the beach
Faces I’ve seen in magazines
Let’s take a walk out on the pier
Watch the shoreline disappear
It’s what I’ve always wanted

Hey here’s to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey here’s to you California

Na na na na na na na na na (oh oh oh)
Na na na na na na na na na (oh oh oh)
Na na na na na na na na na (oh oh oh)
Na na na na na na na na na (oh oh oh)

Hey here’s to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey here’s to you California
