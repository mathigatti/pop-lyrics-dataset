Last night it came as a picture
With a good reason, a warning sign
This place is void of all passion
If you can imagine, it's easy if you try
Believe me, I failed this effort
I wrote a reminder: this wasn't a vision
This time where are you, Houston?
Is somebody out there? Will somebody listen?


Should I go back? Should I go back? should I?
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back? Should I go back? should I?
I hope I won't forget you

My head is made up of memories
Most of them useless delusions
This room is bored of rehearsal
And sick of the boundaries
I miss you so much

Should I go back? Should I go back? should I?
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back? Should I go back? should I?
This time I don't want to
Should I go back? Should I go back? should I?
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back? Should I go back? should I?
I hope I won't forget you

Should I go back? Should I go back? should I?
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back? Should I go back? should I?
This time I don't want to
Should I go back? Should I go back? should I?
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back? Should I go back? should I?
I hope I won't forget you
