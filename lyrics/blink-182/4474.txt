Yeah my girlfriend
Takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous
When I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero's just because
Yeah just because


And my girlfriend
Likes UL and DHC
And she's so smart and independent
I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another
Guy that she'd prefer

And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down

I show up at 3 AM
She's still up watching vacation
And I see her pretty face
It takes me away to a better place and

I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine

And my girlfriend
Takes collect calls from the road
And it doesn't seem to matter
That I'm lacking in the bulge
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero's just because

And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down

I show up at 3a. M
She's still up watching vacation
And I see her pretty face
It takes me away to a better place and

I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine

I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine

I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine

I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine

I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine

I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine

I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine

I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine
