I was cruising in my stingray late one night,
When an xke pulled up on the right.
He pulled down the window of his shiny new jag,
And challenged me then and there to a drag.
I said "you're on buddy, my mills runnin fine, let's come off theline now at sunset and vine.
I'll go you one better if you've got the nerve, lets race all theway to 'dead man's curve.'"


Ooh ooh ooh deadman's curve
Ooh ooh ooh deadman's curve
Won't come back from deadman's curve

The street was desserted late friday night
We were buggin eachother while we sat at the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green-
You should've heard the whine from my screamin machine

I flew passed the labrea, schwabs, and crescent heights,
And all that jag could see were my 6 tail lights.
He passed me at doheny and i started to swerve.
I pulled her out and there we were at deadman's curve.

Ooh ooh ooh

"well the last thing i remember doc, i started to swerve"
"and then i saw the jag slide into the curve..i'll never forgetthat horrible sight."
"and this i found out for myelf: that everyone was right."

Won't come back from deadman's curve
Deadman's curve (ooh ooh ooh) to fade
