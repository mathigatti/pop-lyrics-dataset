She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me
But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving
The good intentions that you had
now only came to this
and although she saw the mark the arrow missed


It isn't exciting reciting the stories
Of kind words turned hurting
When routine gets boring
Both getting tired of punk rock clubs
And both playing in punk rock bands
The start was something good
But some good things must end

And she said it could never survive
With such differing lives
One home one out on tour again
We may never come back
The strike of the match
The candle burning at both ends

And now she knows too much and I'm too fucked up
It's awkward trying to make my move
I'll pretend that I'm fine
Show up right on time
But I know I'll never be that cool

I never wanted to hold you back
I just wanted to hold on
But my chance is gone
I know just where I stand
A boy trapped in the body of a man
And I'll take what you're willing to give
And I'll teach myself to live
With a walk-on part of a background shot
from a movie I'm not in

She's so important
and I'm so retarded
And now I realize
I should have kissed you in LA
but I drove home all alone
as if I had a choice anyway
Where are you coming from
What are you running from
is it so hard to see
And if you're feeling scared
remember the time we shared
You know it meant everything (everything)
You know that it meant everything to me
You know that it meant everything to me
