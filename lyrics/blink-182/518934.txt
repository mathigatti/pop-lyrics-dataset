She don't care about my car,
And she don't care about my money,
And thats real good cuz i don't got a lot to spend,
But if i did it would mean nothing.


She likes me for me,
Not because i look like tyson bedford,
With the charm of robert redford,
Unsing out my ears,
What she sees,
Are my most rending desisions,
My insecure conditions,
And the tears upon the pillow that i shed.

She don't care about my big screen,
Or my collection of dvds,
Things like that just never mattered much to her,
Plus she don't watch too much TV.

She don't care that i could fly her,
To places she ain't never been,
If she really wants to go,
|I think deep down she knows that,
All she has to say is when.

She likes me for me,
Not because i hang with leonardo,
Or that guy who played in fargo,
I think his name was steve.
Shes the one for me,
And i just cant live without her,
My arms belong around her,
And i'm so glad i found her once again,
And i'm so glad i found her once again,
Yeah i'm so glad i found her once again.

Gazing at the ceiling,
As we entertain our feelings in the dark,
Things that we're afraid of,
Are gonna show us what we're made of in the end.

She likes my for me,
Not because i sing like poppa raughty,
Or because i'm such a hottie.(sigh)

I like her for her,
Not because shes phat like cindy craford,
She has got so much to offer,
Why does she waist all her time with me?
There must be something there that i don't see,
I don't see.

She likes me for me,
Not because i'm tough like dirty harry,
Make her laugh just like jim carey,
I'm like the cable guy,
But what she sees,
Is that i cant live with out her,
My arms belong arround her,
And i'm so glad i found her once again,
I found her once again,
Once again,
