When the clock strikes two,
Theres just so much to do
And I cant explain what i need
Jobs and social groups
Hearing the latest news
Keeping our reputations clean


And i, dont wanna worry
About being on time
Ive seen the way you hurry
And time runs your life
Again

The difference between east and west
Money is so much less
And objects aren't so important to buy
I  wish that the clock would often just be stopped
And then we'd look
Into the time

And I, don't wanna worry
About being on time
Ive seen the way you hurry
And time runs your life
