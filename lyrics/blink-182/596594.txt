When I'm at work, ya, I always rush right home for lunch 
So I can check out what's up on the Brady Bunch 
And when I'm walking through the front door at night 
I gotta see who's winning on The Price is Right, oh 
[Chorus] 
I never dreamed that I'd spend my days 
Staring at some tube emitting cathode rays 
I need my TV 
[Verse2] 
What's happening in this world, I don't care at all 
But it better not pre-empt Monday Night Football 
I can't even come up with my own views 
I'm taught how to think from the evening news, oh 
[Chorus] 
I never dreamed that I'd spend my days 
Staring at some tube emitting cathode rays 
I need my TV 


La la la [x12]
