I'm gonna wanna see myself with someone too
Friends I don't pay are friends I never knew
So I took the chance and got some help from a few
And got a long and skinny friend to talk to


Cause I have the time and the liberty
To play with my pet sally
Please don't go away, sally please

No more lonely showers and uneaten foods
My salamander has hygiene too
And he thinks of me the way I think of you
The only next step is for him to say I do

Sally please don't go away
I won't be living in yesterday
The lonely nights
Getting beat up by gays in bar fights
