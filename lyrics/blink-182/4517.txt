Lets take the boat out on the bay
Forget your job for just one day
I wish it didnt have to be so bad
It might be innapropriate because
Either way our band get dropped
I wish it didnt have to be so bad


But Id play with fire to break the ice
And Id play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I cant get?
I wish it didnt have to be so bad

The three-date theory is getting old
Everyone is getting left out in the cold
I wish it didnt have to be so bad
So I'll see you with another guy
Who pretends not to hear you when you cry..oh yeah
I wish it didnt have to be so bad

But Id play with fire to break the ice
And Id play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I cant get?
I wish it didnt have to be so bad

I'll be moving on..movin on..movin on..movin on and on and on
I'll be moving on..movin on..movin on..movin on and on and on

But Id play with fire to break the ice
And Id play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I cant get?
I wish it didnt have to be so bad

I wish it didnt have to be so bad

I wish it didnt have to be so bad

I wish it didnt have to be so bad
