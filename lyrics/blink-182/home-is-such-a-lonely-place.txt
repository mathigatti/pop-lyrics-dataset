We're falling faster than we can fly
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive
And I hold on tight but not enough to hold you back


It feels like the moon is spinning off into outer space without you
This room is such a lonely place without you

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place

I love the lightning but hate the rain
Tomorrows frightening but not today
Wish I could slow down time but not enough to slow you down

It feels like the moon is spinning off into outer space without you
The universe an empty place without you

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place

We're falling faster than we can fly
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place
