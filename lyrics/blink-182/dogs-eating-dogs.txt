I've got a feeling, I've got a feeling
These broken nights and bitter ends
We would always starve and devour
Our closest friends my beautiful friends
Paranoia my paranoia
Can't let it go, it never lets me go
What am I feeling, why am I feeling
We are into the freezing cold


Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs

I'm the last and the first in a very sad set of eyes
To the bone, to the knees, to the factory line
I am numb to the shot, I have a crippling fear of heights
'Cause the fall sounds a lot like a symphony of cries

Your only hope is burning down the chapel
All getting washed out with the tide
We need to find some middle ground
It's always sex or suicide

Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs

I'm the last and the first in a very sad set of eyes
To the bone, to the knees, to the factory line
I am numb to the shot, I have a crippling fear of heights
'Cause the fall sounds a lot like a symphony of cries
