I would do anything and that's
What scares me so bad
Don't want to live my life alone
Don't want to go back to what I had


Don't want to spend my life without
All those special things
Don't want to walk around being tied to
Anyone else's

Strings, strings, strings, strings

I would do anything and that's
What scares me so bad
Don't want to live my life alone

Don't want to spend my life without
All those special things
Don't want to walk around being tied to
Anyone else's

Strings, strings, strings, strings
Strings, strings, strings, strings
