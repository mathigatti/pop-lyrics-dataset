Am I strung out, crazy, or not allowed
To be the one who gets stupid over you
Lazy (lazy), laid back (laid back),
Maybe you're just on crack
Why am I the one who gets fucked up and confused?

She doesn't care at all
She doesn't care at all
She doesn't care about those times
We never shared at all

Would you still be the same person that I knew
And if it's for me, another boring story
I swear I'll act enthused
