One more time you will laugh about it
and he'll never try to give you more
And I don't care he is such a dick
He treats you like you are a stupid whore


And it seems like things will never change
You go on every cloud is in you way
And I know you feel empty all the time
You'll never listen to anything that I say

She's better off sleeping on the floor
because she fell right off
when all is said
you know it's okay to just want more

Why leave when you claim it is love
But why stay when you're not the only one
She's proved she's strong
Be brave be strong

She's better off sleeping on the floor
because she fell right off
when all is said
you know it's okay to just want more

She's better off sleeping on the floor
Because she fell right off the bed
She's better off sleeping on the floor
Because she fell right off the bed
