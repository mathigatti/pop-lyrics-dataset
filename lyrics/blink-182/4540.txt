Two different people, two different places
Through a one way window with two different faces
Agreements are not reached, faces are forgotten
The other person's shoes, you've not got in


Stubborn minded enclosed to your own world
Wake up and see someone else's morals
What right to you
Might be true

It's a different point of view to you
You cannot see things that are different to me
And I can't understand why you cannot see
The things that I cannot see

I see what you don't see
I see what you don't see
Turn around and the shadows are all around me

Two different people, two different places
Through a one way window with two different faces
Agreements are not reached, faces are forgotten
The other person's shoes, you've not got in
