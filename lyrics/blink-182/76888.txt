I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me


So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am
Are you ready?

Come on, let me hold you
Touch you
Feel you
Always
Kiss you
Taste you
All night
Always

And I'll miss your laugh your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you'd tell me
I'm so sick of fights I hate them
Let's start this again for real

So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready

Come on, let me hold you
Touch you
Feel you
Always
Kiss you
Taste you
All night
Always

Come on, let me hold you
Touch you
Feel you
Always
Kiss you
Taste you
All night
Always

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying

Come on, let me hold you
Touch you
Feel you
Always
Kiss you
Taste you
All night
Always

Come on, let me hold you
Touch you
Feel you
Always
Kiss you
Taste you
All night
Always

Always
Always
