Hey mom, there's something in the backroom
Hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories
As if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb


What if people knew that these were real
(These were real)
Id leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say
What you hear is all hearsay
I wish someone would tell me what was right

Up all night long
And there`s something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

I am still the skeptic, yes you know me
(Yes you know me)
Been bestfriends and will be til we die
(Die)
I got an injection
Of fear from the abduction
My bestfriend thinks Im just telling lies
Alright

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

Dark and scary, ordinary, explanation, information
Nice to know ya, paranoia
Wheres my mother, bio-father

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
Twelve majestic lies
