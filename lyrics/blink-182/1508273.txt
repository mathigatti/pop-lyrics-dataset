Do you remember me from 20 minutes ago 
I fell in love with the look in your eyes


With the lick of your lips
And a shake in your hips
Your body framed in the sound of the light

I said hey
My arms are open glide
I've got so much inside it's making me high

I'll hold you all night honey
To the sound of the waves
Until the stars fall out of the sky

And then we all say
How could I ask for more

Where are we going now
It doesn't matter at all
A stolen kiss and the sound of your voice

We had to go, couldn't stay
Now we're so far away
The open road and the stereo noise

You said hey
I'm never coming back
I'm running down the track I've never been down

But if you love me honey
Everything is okay
The world is ours and we'll never be found

And then we all say
How could I ask for more

I've got nothing to hide
When it's dark outside
It will come to you

You've got nothing to fear my dear
When you're lost in the load
I will run to you
I will run to you

Do you remember me from 20 summers ago
I fell in love with the look in your eyes

With the lick of your lips and the shake in your hips
Your body framed in the sound of the light


And then we all sing
How could we ask for more
