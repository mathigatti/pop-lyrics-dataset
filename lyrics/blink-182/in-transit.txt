The world is filled with
The minds of people who try to discuss
A light will shine through
When no one can save you


And you feel
The eyes of people who try to decide
You'll find yourself lost
Inside of the chaos

(Chorus:)

The truth is never far away
You always give yourself a way
[I can't even smile]
Through open eye, a slide of him
Won't you reveal to me?
Reveal to me...

The world is filled with
The lives of people who try to define
The lines that find you
Can anyone save you?

Go down the hall
Drink from the bottle
And never go home
No one's to blame
We're always the same
[We're always the same]

The truth is never far away
You always give yourself a way
[I can't even smile]
Through open eyes, a slide of him
Won't you reveal to me?

The truth is never far away
You only have yourself to blame
[it's taking all your time]
Through open eyes, a slide of him
Won't you reveal to me?
Reveal to me

The truth is never far away
You always give yourself a way
[I can't even smile]
Through open eyes, a slide of him
Won't you reveal to me?
Reveal to me
Reveal to me...
