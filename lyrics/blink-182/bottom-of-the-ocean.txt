Here nights are foggy and weird
Everyone I trust just disappears
Breathing life into my deepest fears
Take, now there's nothing to take
Now you're haunted by your worst mistakes
Watch me sinking underneath the waves


I don't wanna drink about it (staring down)
Driving out at 3 am (no way out)
My head is full, my mind is cloudy
(And then I woke up broken)
Finally make it here again
(Too much, too much, too much)

Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note in red

If you need me
I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me
I'll be right here

Air, leave it up in the air
'Cause the people on the ground don't care
They don't notice but it's everywhere
Chase, now there's nothing to chase
Every day I feel so out of place
Let me wash away without a trace

I don't wanna drink about it (staring down)
Driving out at 3 am (no way out)
My head is full, my mind is cloudy
(And then I woke up broken)
Finally make it here again
(Too much, too much, too much)

Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note in red

If you need me
I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me
I'll be right here

I'm out here in the deep end
I'm lower than I've ever been
I burn it down, it turns to smoke
And when I see the morning
It's colder than it's ever been
My bloodshot eyes see through the smoke

Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note in red

If you need me
I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me
I'll be right here
