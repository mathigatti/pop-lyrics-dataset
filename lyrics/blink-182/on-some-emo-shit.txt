I suppose we got lost in Brooklyn
There's a poster on my wall
With a picture that says you're missing
My friends say I should rip it apart
Thought I saw you at the bodega
Thought I heard your voice at the bar
Time is slipping out through my fingers
I'm wishing on a burned-out star


They say forgive and forget
As long as I live, I'll let
These feelings pound in my chest
Maybe I am better off dead

The last time I saw her
She was standing on the edge
Of a good time, been a long time
Tell me how could I forget?
She had questions in her eyes
Oh, I should have realized that it was over
Yeah, it was over
The last time that I saw her

Thinking back to times in Manhattan
And that SoHo gallery
Saw the sights and your favorite paintings
You were as priceless as can be
Now I'm looking back at the city
The one that they say never sleeps
How'd things get so dark and shitty?
Sunrise always gives us the creeps

They say forgive and forget
As long as I live, I'll let
These feelings pound in my chest
Maybe I am better off dead

The last time I saw her
She was standing on the edge
Of a good time, been a long time
Tell me how could I forget?
She had questions in her eyes
Oh, I should have realized that it was over
Yeah, it was over
The last time that I saw her

Now you're just a stranger
And I feel like I let you down
Your friends say I'm a failure
And I could never prove them wrong
So call me when you're lonely
And maybe we can work it out
Fall back in our routines
Like nights I still dream about

The last time that I saw her
The last time that I saw her

The last time I saw her
She was standing on the edge
But it was over
Yeah, it was over
The last time I saw her
