I don't believe that we were ever meant to be
Left underneath the light of dying stars
Push me off of the edge of the world
Watch me as I slowly fall apart


Set fire to the roof of your house
And waited for the sirens to wail
Left your favorite rockets to melt
Listen as you damn me to hell

Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me now
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me

Well what did I think would happen
I wouldn't dream of asking you and it
Lived in me for so long
I lived in fear that you moved on

What have I done to us it seems?
I've broken trust and shattered dreams
I only wish I'd spoken up
Loneliness since we broke up

Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me now
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me

Say a prayer that you'll make it to the other side
It won't make no sense and you're losing mine
We're lost in our ways
Nothing left to say, no
Make a wish that you'll get a chance to say goodbye
Before the shots ring out in the dead of night
We're stuck in our ways
I've got so much to say, oh
Showed up like shadows in this crowd
Brought the fire blinding
Came here to quickly tear us down, down, down

Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me now
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me
