I had a feeling you were troubled
The night I pulled you from the rubble
When will we release this disaster piece?
From the ceiling or the gutter
Get my bleeding heart aflutter
And I can't erase the sad memories


Got time on my hands
I got time to slow you down, down, down, down
Got time on my hands
I got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down

Tonight, why are you so broken?
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
All about you
Tonight, why are we still holding on?

It's never enough for you
It's never enough for you

Heard a rumor you were leaving
The West Coast tomorrow evening
Wasting no time, saying your goodbyes
For the life of me, I can't find
Anyone to share or kill time
I want you back, my little heart attack

I got time on my hands
I got time to slow you down, down, down, down
I got time on my hands
I got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down

Tonight, why are you so broken?
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
All about you
Tonight, why are we still holding on?

When the world's fall down
And you run from the dust as it gathers your thoughts
It's never enough for you
When the storm is gone
Comes crashing down upon us, waste of a life
It's never enough for you
It's never enough for you
It's never enough for you

It's never enough for
It's never enough for you
It's never enough for
It's never enough for you

I got time on my hands
I got time to slow you down, down, down, down
I got time on my hands
I got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down

It's never enough for you

I got time on my hands (my hands)
I got time to slow you down, down, down, down
I got time on my hands (I got time on my hands)
I got time to slow you down, down, down, down, down
