I wasn’t born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
The flash flood, punk rock, and the alcohol
I was raised on a rerun
I was bored to death, so I started a band
Cut my teeth on a safety dance
My attention span never stood a chance


It’s too late
Can you forgive me now?

You can never kill my high
I’m the ink and you’re the headline (oh)
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (oh)
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!

I wasn’t made for the good life
I ended up getting stuck on the side of the road
I tripped and fell on hard times
The tough breaks are the only kind I know
I was left on a doorstep
I was scared to death with nowhere to go
Cut myself on the neighbor’s fence
That I hopped as the cops tried to take me in

It’s too late
Can you forgive me now?

You can never kill my high
I’m the ink and you’re the headline (oh)
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (oh)
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!

I was raised on the Ritalin
Ever since I was a little kid
No one ever seemed to give a shit
I don’t need an excuse
I don’t need an excuse

You can never kill my high
I’m the ink and you’re the headline
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (oh)
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!

You can never kill my high (endless summer)
I’m the ink and you’re the headline (stretching on and on)
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!
Blame it on, blame it on my youth!

(Endless summer stretching on and on)
