I could never own up
I need to speak up
I don't want to grow up
I don't want to end up caught in a landslide with the other side


Living for the paycheck
Dying for the weekend
Take another Xanax
Cheating on your girlfriend
Taking your last breath
Counting down the time

Don't tell me it's too late
I'm stuck at heaven's gate
Strike a match and start a wildfire

I'll own all my mistakes
Won't give you what you take
Watch you burning in the wildfire

They said I'd never make it
Watching me fall
All the time I wasted
Learning to crawl
From the ashes as this world comes crashing down

Don't tell me it's too late
I'm stuck at heaven's gate
Strike a match and start a wildfire

I'll own all my mistakes
Won't give you what you take
Watch you burning in the wildfire

We want this war
We cursed and swore
They stood no chance at all
The underdogs came home

We want this war
We cursed and swore
They stood no chance at all

I don't forget
I don't forgive
I'll never change the way I live
I always fought the urge to fall in line

I turned my back on all the rules
I'll never heed the king of fools
I'll never lead the perfect kind of life

I don't forget, I don't forgive (We want this war)
I'll never change the way I live (We cursed and swore)
I always fought the urge to fall in line
(They stood no chance at all)

I turned my back on all the rules (We want this war)
I'll never heed the king of fools (We cursed and swore)
I'll never lead the perfect kind of life
(They stood no chance at all)

The underdogs came home
