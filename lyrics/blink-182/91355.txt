The thoughts, the thing that's I don't know

it's all what keeps my mind clear
you laugh at ?
you can do what you want to
I need some time alone
between what answers
I need some time alone
don't talk to me
don't notice me
don't talk to me
don't notice me


It's all what keeps my mind clear
you laugh at ?
not in the mood, not just to justify
not to think of what a lie
you can do what you want to
I need some time alone
between what answers
I need some time alone
don't talk to me
don't notice me
don't talk to me
don't notice me
