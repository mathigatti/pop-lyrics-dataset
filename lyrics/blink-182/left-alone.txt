Eyes are open, words are spoken
Here's to the sunrise
Head is loaded, cards are folded
Under the moonlight


Can you remember, you remember the last time we woke up sober?
Can you remember, you remember the last night you ran me over?

Are we halfway gone or halfway there?

Left alone we're only halfway home
Sink like stones, fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under, slowly drown
I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

Mind is open, thoughts are woken
There goes the sunrise
Heart is broken, love unspoken
Here comes the moonlight

Can you remember, you remember the last time I left hungover?
Can you remember, you remember the last night that I stayed over?

Are we halfway gone or halfway there?

Left alone we're only halfway home
Sink like stones, fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under, slowly drown
I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

We're left alone, we're left alone
We're left alone, we're left alone

Left alone we're only halfway home
Sink like stones, fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under, slowly drown
I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

We're left alone, we're left alone
We're left alone, we're left alone
