You don't need nothing
and I know that you won't even try
Don't wait for me to help you
it's too late for any of my advice


No trust
All I got is lies
Boring
all right

Misplaced your values
Forgot the importance of being right
don't sit there and act humble
I've heard your story a thousand times

No trust
All I got is lies
Boring
all right
