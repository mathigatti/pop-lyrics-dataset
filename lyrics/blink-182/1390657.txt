I got a funny feeling
There's something wrong today
I got a funny feeling
And it won't go away


I got an itchy finger
And they'll be hell to play
I'm gonna pull the trigger
And blow them all away

Don't ever
Try to tell me
How much you care for me
Don't ever
Try to tell me
How you are there for me

I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it

I got a wicked demon
His hunger never fades
I got an empty feelin'
I won't be home today

Don't ever
Try to tell me
How much you care for me
Don't ever
Try to tell me
How you are there for me

I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it

No one is a stoppin' you
From a doin' what you want to do
no one is a stoppin' you now
Stoppin' you now

I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
