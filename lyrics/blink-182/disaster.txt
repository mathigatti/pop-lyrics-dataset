Disaster, disaster

Fall comes a loaded gun
Black ties for everyone
Can you read my mind
Fall in my arms again
Grey stones that break apart
French braids demonic art
The dead come alive
Fall in my arms again (again)


I'm scared of the dark, my friends
What do you fear, my love?
Hold on, you're breaking up

Disaster disaster
Disaster disaster

White stones of hollow eyes
Death comes you better hide
Never rest in town
Fall in my arms again
Full moon on a rotten night
Eighteen and a wind came by
Not a soul around
Fall in my arms again (again)

I'm scared of the dark, my friends
What do you fear, my love?
Your soul it will float like a dove
Your words they will scream out our love
Your lips they will stutter with flavor
You can't shake the taste of the blood
Hold on, you're breaking up
(Breaking up)
