And when the day ends I'm sure she feels sorrow
The lonely guy I am, I wait for her to change
I've been here two days, I'll sure be here tomorrow
I'd eat her out if she were on my dinner plate


(And I wish)
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home

I can't be too cool in a tree with my pants down
The air is cold and I've got splinters in my feet
She caught me once, but I don't think that she cares now
Unlike before, her view is now blocked by a leaf

(And I wish)
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home

I bet this last time's the one time too many
The rush of waiting is burning in my head
Right after supper her brother shower's twice a week
He kicks my ass so much, that fucking white inbred

I've made mistakes by looking in the wrong window
Her dad is big and I've never seen his face
I've been here two days, and I'll sure be here tomorrow
My lady's so sweet, she likes to entertain

(And I wish)
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home

I bet this last time's the one time too many
The rush of waiting is burning in my head
Right after supper her brother shower's twice a week
He kicks my ass so much, that filthy white inbred
