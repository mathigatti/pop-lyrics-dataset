Dearest mum
I'm always here no matter how far gone
I'm alright without you
I laid at night a million thoughts are caught up in my tree
Your alright without me


It don't mean
It don't mean
It don't mean anything all
It don't mean
It don't mean
It don't mean anything all

Its long way back to the middle of the road
Finding our way back home
It dont mean
It dont mean
It dont mean anything all

Dear old dad
I'm the one and only son you never had
I'll be fine without you
Late at night I hear you grab your coat and car keys
You'll be fine without me

It don't mean
It don't mean
It don't mean anything all
It don't mean
It don't mean
It don't mean anything all

Its long way back to the middle of the road
Finding our way back home
It don't mean
It don't mean
It don't mean anything all

And we all fall to the surface sometimes
And we all fall back where we belong
And we all fall to the surface sometimes
And we all fall back where we belong

It don't mean
It don't mean
It don't mean anything all
It don't mean
It don't mean
It don't mean anything all

Its long way back to the middle of the road
Finding our way back home
It don't mean
It don't mean
It don't mean anything all
