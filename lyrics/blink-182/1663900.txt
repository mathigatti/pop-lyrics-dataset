I'm sick of always hearing
All those sad songs on the radio
All day, it is there to remind, another sensitive guy
That is lost and alone yeah


I hate, a favorite restaurant, a favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone

I can't forgive, can't forget, can't give in
What went wrong cuz you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm sick, of always hearing, sappy love songs
On the radio, this place it's fucking cursed in it's plague
And I can never escape, with my heart it explodes

I can't forgive, can't forget, can't give in
What went wrong 'cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life.

I'm kicking out fiercly at the world around me
What went wrong
I'm kicking out fiercly at the world around me
What went wrong
I'm kicking out fiercly at the world around me
What went wrong
I'm kicking our fiercly at the world around me
What went wrong
I'm kicking
