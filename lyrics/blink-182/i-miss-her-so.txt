I guess it's only the men
Who get fucked now and again
We take our chicks to the mall
We wait at parking stalls
And when we come home too late
She's pissed that she had to wait
And my excuse not to call
It never worked at all


Time to wake up
Where's your daughter?
Hurts to break up
She was stronger
All my friends say
Please don't love her
What did I gain?
Now I miss her so

I used to hate the lipstick
It stained and tasted so sick
The panty hose and the bras
She threw on my guitars
Shit fuck I made a mistake
I thought I needed a break
The truth is I'm such a dick
It's broke and can't be fixed

Time to wake up
Where's your daughter?
Hurts to break up
She was stronger
All my friends say
Please don't love her
What did I gain?
Now I miss her so

If you want to call it a heartache (a hearthache)
Then I should regret those things
I miss her
If you want the pain to go away (to go away)
Better suck up your pride admit
You lost her let her go (let her go)
Move on (move on) let her go (let her go)
Move on (move on) let her go

Time to wake up
Where's your daughter?
Hurts to break up
She was stronger
All my friends say
Please don't love her
What did I gain?
Now i miss her so

Move on (move on) let her go (let her go)
Move on (move on) let her go (let her go)
Move on (move on) let her go (let her go)
Move on (move on) let her go (let her go)
