There was a time long ago
But it seemed like yesterday
When all I wanted was you
And now you make a segway
As you turn your face away
And I know your words aren't true
And I don't want your lies
And I don't think that I'm better than you inside
And you can take off your disguise
Cause I can see the truth that's hidden
Behind your eyes


And all those words that you don't say just mean less and lesseach day
You can't make me shed a tear
I think about tomorrow
Another day of sorrow
But I don't think that I'll be here
And I don't want your lies
And I don't think that I'm better than you inside
And you can take off your disguise
Cause I can see the truth that's hidden
Behind your eyes
