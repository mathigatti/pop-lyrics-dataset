I guess it's only the men
Who get fucked now and again
We take our chicks to the mall
We wait in parking stalls


And when we come home too late
Shes pissed that she had to wait
And my excuse not to call
It never worked at all

Time to wake up
Where's your daughter?
Hurt's to break up
She was stronger
All my friends say
Please don't love her
What did I gain? Now
I miss her so

I used to hate the lipstick
It stained and tasted so sick
The pantyhose and the bras
She threw on my guitars

Shit fuck I made a mistake
I thought I needed a break
The truth is I'm such a dick
It's broke and can't be fixed.

Time to wake up
Where's your daughter?
Hurt's to break up
She was stronger
All my friends say
Please don't love her
What did I gain? Now,
I miss her so

If you wanna call it a heartache
Then I shouldn't regret those things
I miss her
If you want the pain to go away
Better suck up your pride and admit
You lost her
Let her go
Move on
Let her go
Move on
Let her go
