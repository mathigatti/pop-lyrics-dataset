Sometimes I wonder where our lives go
They question who we used to be
Sometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between
The cigarette and gasoline


I can't sleep cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost to San Diego
(To San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego
(Can't go back to San Diego)

Abandoned houses with the lights on
Late at night I call your name
Abandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors
I read the sadness on your face

I can't sleep cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost to San Diego
(To San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego
(Can't go back to San Diego)

I never needed to hear
All of the pain and the fear
Your secrets filled up my ears
Like the ocean blue
I never wanted to know
How deep these cuts on you go
And like a river they flow
To the ocean blue

Going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost to San Diego
(To San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego
(Can't go back to San Diego)
