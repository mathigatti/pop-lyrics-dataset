Breathing deeply
Walking backwards
Finding strength
To call and ask her
Roller coaster
Favorite ride
Let me kiss you
One last time


Leave me standing here
Act like i'm not around
The coast will probably never clear
Can i please go home now?
I had that dream
About you again
Where i wait outside
Until you let me in.
And there i stay.

Lay beside me
And listen at the wall.
We'll keep on lying
Until the summer comes
I had that dream
About you again
Where you drive my car
Right off a fucking cliff

And now i'm breathing deeply
Walking backwards
Finding strength
To call and ask her
Roller coaster
Favorite ride
Let me kiss you
One last time

Make me promise
That i will never tell
All i remember's
The way your bedroom smells
I had that dream
About you again
Where i wait outside
Until you let me in.
And now i'm breathing deeply
Walking backwards
Finding strength
To call and ask her
Roller coaster
Favorite ride
Let me kiss you
One last time

Goodnight
