Late at night on mercy street
The summer air is way too sweet
The way I feel inside is worse than poison


Washed up standing on a beach
Something inside is incomplete
I'm on the bay for one more night of mourning

This is the one last time
I promise one last time

(I'll take the last train home) (the last train home)
(I'll take the last train home) (the last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)

The tidal wave and aftermath
I'm seasick from the years we've passed
Adrift at sea with no one left to rescue

Tonic and a fifth of gin
She said goodbye and left again
These empty rooms are deafening without you

This is one last time
I promise one last time

(I'll take the last train home) (the last train home)
(I'll take the last train home) (the last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)

Life's so strange
Time won't change
The world slips by, I'm afraid that she never cared much anyway
Life's so strange
