My mind wonders as I'm trying not to fall in love with you
Cause everytime I awake I ponder on my mistakes of
What I said, it is always my esteem that I sure lose
Playing those stupid games as I always end up chasing you


I can't help myself anymore
Rehearsing my thoughts as I'm too scared to come to your door
I pushed it all a side just to stand next to you
But now you won't talk to me for something that i didn't do

It's not gonna work

And i'm trying not to think of you
I'm all confused as I think of the things that I would do
I'm all shook up as I get all nervous inside
My emotions are something that I will always hide my ways
