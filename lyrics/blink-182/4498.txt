Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
I'll be fine, it's not the first
Just like last time, but a little worse


She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past"
She said "Don't let my door hit your ass"

One more chance, I'll try this time
I'll give you yours, I won't take mine
I'll listen up, pretend to care
Go on ahead, I'll meet you there

She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past"
She said "Don't let my door hit your ass"

Let's try this one more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling

She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past"
She said "Don't let my door hit your ass"

Dont leve me all alone
Just drop me off at home
And I'll be fine
