(This makes no sense...)

This air is too thick to breathe so just drive
These eyes are too sick to see, don't leave me behind
Something's swimming in my blood, something's rotting in my brain
When I'm smothered from the blood I can't recognize your face
I need to leave so just drive


Burning lights on the street I'm fight-fighting the gravity
When I'm beaten, defeated they'll take you away from me
They'll take-take you away from me

Dead and lost in a dream, as this is the last of me
This-this is the last of me
I'm always fighting the gravity

Tonight is too much for me to get through
Tomorrow's just a darkened hall to an empty room
When I'm far away from you

Burning lights on the street I'm fight-fighting the gravity
When I'm beaten, defeated they'll take you away from me
They'll take-take you away from me
Dead and lost in a dream, as this is the last of me
This-this is the last of me
I'm always fighting the gravity

(This makes no sense...)
