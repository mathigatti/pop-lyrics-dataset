Walking through the grass
Another blade next to you from the ground
As the wind does pass
I notice as you feel the breath of my shout


Your words are kind
The kind that repeatedly say no
But that's alright
I'm older than you so I've got time

What have you said, reach out your hand
There's a black shadow on my wall
But as I look into my mind
I can see that girls are a waste of time

We've all seen the bridge
A broken seam and a girl on one side
You think your words will work
They only work when you lay down and close your eyes

I thought of all the lines
All the right ones used at all the wrong times
But that's alright
Depression's just a sarcastic state of mind

What have you said, reach out your hand
There's a black shadow on my wall
But as I look into my mind
I can see that girls are a waste of time

I don't want to live alone
I don't want to live in
My broken dreams of you

I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you
I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you
