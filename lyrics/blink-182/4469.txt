Watching your house shrink away in my rear view mirror
as I drive away
wishing that I could take back all those words that meantnothing
that I didn't say
I'm trying to be what you want me to be
But it's so damn hard to keep playing the part of the fool
week after week


I think you need some time alone
You say you want someone to callyour own
Open you eyes
you can suck in your pride
you can live your life all on your own

I this all going to be just another time
that we play this game
I've tried to convice you that things could be different
but somehow they end up the same
But what did you expect from me
What am I supposed to do
you say that you're starting to fell like you're getting lost
Well I do too

I'm not gonna live this lie again
I know I'll get it right but I don't know when
I'll open my eyes
Iv'e got somethin inside
I'll just jack off in my room until then

It's never over till its done
and I don't think that you're the one (4x)
