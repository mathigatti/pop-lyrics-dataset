Tragedy (tragedy)
Erase my memory (erase my memory)
And now all I see
Is this black rain


Oh tragedy
You took my everything (you took my everything)
Oh now all I feel
All I feel is pain

Oh, how can I go on?
Knowing that I lost you
Where did I go wrong?
Where do I run off to?
Lost down here, broken and alone

I went and searched for some answers
But all I found were monsters
They're under my bed
They're hunting us down
That's been said
But this time it's been severed
Now I follow your footsteps
Through the oceans you once crept
I feel so hollow now
I'm dropped on this island
This island of regret

Tragedy (tragedy)
Erase my memory (erase my memory)
And now all I see
Is this black rain

Oh tragedy
You took my everything (you took my everything)
Oh now all I feel
All I feel is pain

Oh, how can I go on?
Knowing that I lost you
Where did I go wrong?
Where do I run off to?
Lost down here, broken and alone

They left a note on the front door
We determine the places the tears broke from my eyes
Straight to the floor there was no going back once we knew what they came for

And all I have here is heartache
And faults, and mirrors for me to break
Only so much bad luck a person can take
We quiver and quake, we shiver and change

Tragedy (tragedy)
Erase my memories (erase my memories)
And now all I see
Is this black rain
Oh tragedy
