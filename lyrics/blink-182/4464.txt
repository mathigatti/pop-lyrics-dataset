I know I'm pathetic I knew when she said it
A loser a bum's what she called me when I drove her home
There's no more waiting and sure no more wasting
I've done all I can but she still wants to be left alone
You got you got you got to help me out
And I'll try not to argue
No one no one no one likes a drop-out
Mistakes are hard to undo


Don't pull me down this is where i belong
I think I'm different but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down this is where i belong
I think I'm different, this is where i belong

I think it's disgusting believing and trusting
If I gave a fuck there would be nothing for me to prove
Although it's amusing it's slightly confusing
I've done all I can but her ego is still hard to move
You got you got you got to help me out
And I'll try not to argue
No one no one no one likes a drop out
Mistakes are hard to undo

(Chorus 3X)
