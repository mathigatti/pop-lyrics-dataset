I've had it with this damn double vision
My hands swollen, I can't keep holding on
My heart's sinking and stuck in deadly rhythm
I can't fake it. I can't, can't brush it off


Love, love is dangerous
Love, love is so dangerous

I'm back at it, I just don't seem to listen
I see your lips, I just can't hear the sound
It's all static, just like my television
Her skills sharpen, her eyes cut through the clouds

(I Need) Love, love is dangerous
(Hard times, don't be fooled when she says it's)
Love, love is so dangerous
(We'll betray the ones we care about)
Love, love is so dangerous
(Life's cruel, so we all pretend to fuck)
Love, love is dangerous

(I Need) Love, love is dangerous
(Hard times, don't be fooled when she says it's)
Love, love is so dangerous
(We'll betray the ones we care about)
Love, love is so dangerous
(Lifes cruel, so we all pretend to fuck)
Love, love is dangerous
