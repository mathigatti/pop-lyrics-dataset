I never found out why you left him
But this answer begs that question.
Too blind to see tomorrow
Too broke, to beg or borrow.
Young and stupid
Left wide open
Hearts are wasted
Lives are broken.


One more point of contention,
I need some intervention
Approaching failing tensions
Betray my short attention
Span the distance
Bridge the border
Beg forgiveness
Round the corner.

Everytime I look for you the sun goes down.
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground.
I left another message you are never around.
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more.
Will the last one out, please shut the door.

More time apart will give you
A few more months to argue.
Is this too much to live through
It always seems too far to
Drive the point home
Send more letters
Pray tomorrow
Ends up better

Everytime I look for you the sun goes down.
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground.
I left another message you are never around.
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more.
Will the last one out, please shut the door.

I never did do anything that she asked,
I never let what happend stay in the past
I never did quite understand what she meant.
In spite of everything, in spite of everything

Everytime I look for you the sun goes down.
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground.
I left another message you are never around.
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground.
I left another message you are never around.
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down
