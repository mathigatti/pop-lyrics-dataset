There's this one guy
There's no one like him in all the world
'Cause you can always see
Those girls down on there knees


In those dark sweaty rooms
Planning out his thoughts
He's waiting for just the right

One by one as they
Walk right through the door, they
Keep on coming back I
Guess they just want more

He has fun fun fun and you
Might call him a whore, but
Just look where he's at 'cause
He is the one that scores

I saw my friend there
Out on the field today
I asked him where he's going, he said
"All the way," now

One by one as they
Walk right through the door, they
Keep on coming back I
Guess they just want more

He has fun fun fun and you
Might call him a whore, but
Just look where he's at 'cause
He is the one that scores
Go!
