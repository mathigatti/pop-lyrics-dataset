Better stand back
Get out of my way
I'm coming on strong
Like a burning flame!
HEY! HEY!
I'm Hot Tonight!



Better take it easy
Don't you get me uptight
I'm wound up like a spring
And I'm ready to fight!
HEY! HEY!
I'm Hot Tonight!


I was flying high
Till you shut me down
Were you coming with me,
When I hit the ground?
HEY! HEY!


Better look out 
When we ring the bell
Cause I'm coming up fast
Like a bat out of hell!
HEY! HEY!
I'm Hot Tonight!


When I get hot
You know what I'm like
I'm caught up like a snake
And I'm ready to strike
HEY! HEY!


I'm Hot Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)


I'm Hot Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)


I'm Hot  Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)


I'm Hot Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)


I'm Hot Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)


I'm Hot Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)


I was flying high
Till you shut me down
Were you coming with me
When I hit the ground?
HEY! HEY!


I'm Hot Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)


I'm Hot Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)


I'm Hot  Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)


I'm Hot Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)


I'm Hot Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)


I'm Hot Tonight!
(I'm hot tonight)
