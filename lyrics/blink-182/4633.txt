Now it's time to say good bye,
didn't mean to make you cry out.
Now it's time to say hello,
to the hopes and dreams u don't know.


chorus:
don't take the high road,
just say your lies good bye then
get in that car and drive away.

Now u're giving up the fight,
cause ur love is already destroyed,
and I tell u now it's something
that u probably never tried.
and u look behind the mirror,
and u try so hard,
to make up our desires,
and u're taking it too far.

chorus:
don't take the high road,
just say your lies good bye then
get in that car and drive away.
don't take the high road,
just say your lies good bye then
get in that car and drive away.
don't take the high road,
just say your lies good bye then
get in that car and drive away.
