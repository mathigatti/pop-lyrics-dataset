Dear head, shut up
I can't listen no more
It's late, so shut up
Is one night too much to ask for?


You are a haunted house
You're superstitious
You are the coldest stone carved marble faces

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole

With you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you again

This bed, on fire
I can't sleep here no more
Too late and tired
Dreaming down on the floor

I am a haunted house
I'm superstitious
I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole

With you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you again

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
(I won't fall down, I won't fall down)
I'm barely standing on the ground
(Barely standing on the ground)
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
(I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole)
