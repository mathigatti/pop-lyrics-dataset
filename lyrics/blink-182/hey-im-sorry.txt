Hold me down deep under water
Wave goodbye to all your daughters
Break yourself but why even bother?
Fathers pray for princes instead


Have your fill of disappointment
Two more years of unemployment
All your fears come to life
And leave you boarded up abandoned and spent

Everything you've ever hoped for
Waiting there outside your front door
Bleeding to death
Everything you've never wanted
Here to seem just like that haunted place
They say for everyones dying breath

Hey I'm sorry, I lost the melody
(Whoa-ah-oh)
Hey I'm sorry, I lost your memory
(Whoa-ah-oh)
When we fall asleep, I sleep all by myself
At the end of the day

Are you alone with all your thoughts
Your suitcase full of books you bought
The war we fought and all the battles lost
In spite of search exceeding expense

Everything you've ever hoped for
Waiting there outside your front door
Bleeding to death
Everything you've never wanted
Here to seem just like that haunted place
They say for everyones dying breath

Hey I'm sorry, I lost the melody
(Whoa-ah-oh)
Hey I'm sorry, I lost your memory
(Whoa-ah-oh)
When we fall asleep, I sleep all by myself
At the end of the day

(Whoa-ah-oh)

Hey I'm sorry I lost the melody
(Whoa-ah-oh)
Hey I'm sorry I lost your memory
(Whoa-ah-oh)

Hey I'm sorry, I lost the melody
Hey I'm sorry, I lost your memory
Hey I'm sorry, mistakes and tragedy
Hey I'm sorry, give back what's left of us
When I fall asleep, I sleep all by myself
At the end of the day

(Whoa-ah-oh)
At the end of the day
(Whoa-ah-oh)
