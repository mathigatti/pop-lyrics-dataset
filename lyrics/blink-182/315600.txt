I always flirt with death
I could kill, but I don't care about it
I can face your threats
Stand up tall and scream and shout about it


I think I'm on another world with you, with you
I'm on another planet with you, with you

You always get under my skin
I don't find it irritating
You always play to win
I don't need rehabilitating

I think I'm on another world with you, with you
I'm on another planet with you, with you

Another girl, another planet
Another girl, another planet

Space travels in my blood
And there ain't nothing I can do about it
Long journeys wear me out
Oh God you know we won't live without it

I think I'm on another world with you, with you
I'm on another planet with you, with you

I think I'm on another world with you, with you
I'm on another planet with you, with you

Another girl is loving you now
Another planet, forever holding you down
Another planet
