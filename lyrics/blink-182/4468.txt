Please mom
you ground me all the time
I know that I was right all along
And I'm hoping
Remember I'm a kid
I know not what I did just havin' fun
couldn't wait
for something new
and yesterday
I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
it's too late
I fell through
Nothing to lose
a boy who went out when he finished all his chores
nothing to do
They can't trust me
because i blew it once before


Shit dad
Please don't kick my ass
I now I've seen you trashed at least one time
Can i blame it
on one of my dumb friends
it's been awhile since I've used that line
