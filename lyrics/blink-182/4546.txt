My mom she`s not a woman anymore
She dresses like
dresses like a man
shes not as feminine as she used to be before
now she is so damned masculine
I close my eyes my moms not a woman anymore
shes wearing a disguise
everytime she leaves through that door
my moms not the same
as she was in the past
if I misbehave she kicks my ass
my moms not quite the woman that she was before
when my friends come over
she likes to wrestle them down to the floor
I close my eyes. my mom not woman anymore
She`s wearing a disguise
Everytime she leave`s to that door
My Mom told , my mom told, my mom told transvestite
My mom told transvestite, AIAIAIAI
UHUHUHUUUHUHUH
