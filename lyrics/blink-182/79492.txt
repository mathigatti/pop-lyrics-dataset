I love every minute we spend together
I think we wil last forever
Your the one that keeps me alive
Your the one that makes me thrive


I come over every friday night
All these months we haven't had a fight
Every day and night
Your the best thing in my life

I couldnt stand being apart from you
The day I die is the day were through
Your always gonna make me smile
Whenever im depressed or in denial

Your the one I've been searching for
Having sex on your front room floor
Those weeks you went away and played
I so much missed being layed

When you said yes that morning
The happiest day I was soaring
This magic is going to last
These days have flown by so fast

I couldnt stand being apart from you
The day I die is the day were through
Your always gonna make me smile
Whenever I'm depressed or in denial
