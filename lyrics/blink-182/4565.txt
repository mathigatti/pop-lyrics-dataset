Mom and dad they quite don't understand it
All the kids they laugh as if they planned it
Why do girls wanna pierce their nose
And walk around in torn pantyhose, oh, yeah!


I like the ones who say they listen to that punk rock
I like the kids who fight against how they were brought up
They hate the trends and think it's fucked to care
It's cool when they piss people off with what they wear, oh, yeah!

So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in

Hate the jocks, the preps
The hippie fuckin' scumbags
Heavy metalers with their awful pussy hair bands
Counting seconds until we can get away
Ditching school almost every single day, oh, yeah

So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in
