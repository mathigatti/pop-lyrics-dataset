Can you read my thoughts
I'm not sure what I said
I feel dumb and long night coming


Did you steal my prayers
I don't know where I was
I feel numb and all or nothing (all or nothing)

It's Friday night let's lose our minds
In a downward spiral
Here we go
Because we got no control (no control)

Friday nights always save my life
From the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

Until Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend

I can feel my head falling off my neck
I need something to keep going
So just take my hand only second's left
The clock's running 
Our time's coming

It's Friday night 
Let's lose our minds
In a downward spiral
Here we go
Because we got no control (no control)

Friday nights always save my life
From the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

Until Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend

It's Friday night 
Let's lose our minds
In a downward spiral
Here we go
Because we got no control (no control)

Friday nights always save my life
From the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

Until Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend
