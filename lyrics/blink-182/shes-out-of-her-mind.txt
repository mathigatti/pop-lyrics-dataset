I said: Settle down, settle down, everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor
She said: No I'm not, no I'm not, no I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door


She's an-an-an-antisocial, an-an-an-antisocial
An-an-an, she's an angel, yeah

I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
She said: Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt
And Bauhaus stuck in her head

I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
(Oh oh oh oh oh) oh yeah
We all need something to live for, oh yeah
We all need something to live for

She said I let her down, let her down
I no longer dream of anything anymore
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all
You make me wanna scream
And threw herself on the floor

She's an-an-an-antisocial, an-an-an-antisocial
An-an-an, she's an angel, yeah

I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
She said: Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt
And Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind
(Oh oh oh oh oh)

She's not complicated
Can't be overstated at all
She's not complicated-ated-ated at all

I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
(Oh oh oh oh oh) (she's out of her mind)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
She said: Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight
She got a black shirt, black skirt
And Bauhaus stuck in her head

I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind, oh yeah
(Oh oh oh oh oh) oh yeah
We all need something to live for, oh yeah
We all need something to live for
