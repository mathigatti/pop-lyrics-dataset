Day in day out
Up at 3AM
With the searchlights shining down
Day in day out
It's the blinding light
Underneath the dirt downtown


Listen to the sound as they bomb the sixth street bridge
Listen to the sound of the voices south of fifth

Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles I'm never coming home

Come down
I've been awake for days
Knocked out
By the sound of the falling rain
Come down yeah we'll watch the sun just burn away the sky
Watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive

Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
