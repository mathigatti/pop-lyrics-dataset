Threw my wishes in a fountain
Deep down under where I found them
Don't let go I'll probably drown in them
Three, two, one, but who's counting 'em?


Hey, mom, I'm on my own
Scared to death and far from home
Can you imagine that, imagine that, imagine that
You know I'm bad at that, bad at that, bad at that

You left pieces of me along the side of the road
Right after you said, you'd never leave me alone
Found myself on the wrong side of the door
I'll come in if you let me
I got a song in my head
You played me over the phone
Left the light on upstairs but there ain't nobody home
All the nights that you'd end up all alone
Remember to forget me

This is hard, I'm one step off
I called but you're gone, I'm here but you're not
We both made a left, it don't make a right
We try to forget but remember the times

Hey, mom, I'm on my own
Scared to death and far from home
Can you imagine that, imagine that, imagine that
You know I'm bad at that, bad at that, bad at that

You left pieces of me along the side of the road
Right after you said, you'd never leave me alone
Found myself on the wrong side of the door
I'll come in if you let me
I got a song in my head
You played me over the phone
Left the light on upstairs but there ain't nobody home
All the nights that you'd end up all alone
Remember to forget me

I got a song in my head
You played me over the phone
Left the light on upstairs but there ain't nobody home
All the nights that you'd end up all alone
Remember to forget me
