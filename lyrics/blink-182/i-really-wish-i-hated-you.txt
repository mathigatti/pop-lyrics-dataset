I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
’Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you


A little drunk, waiting on your phone call
A little numb, maybe I can't feel at all
You stitch me up but you can’t stop me bleeding out
I'm better when I'm broken

I love you but I hate you when you're with someone else
I don't want you wrapped around me but I don't trust myself
I drove by your house but you don't live there anymore

'Cause I don’t really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
’Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you right now

Won’t you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you

The Sun is out, I’m dying in the daytime
I think about the future that we left behind
I drank it all but I can't shake you from my mind
Now every window's broken

I love you but I hate you when you're with someone else
I don't want you wrapped around me but I don't trust myself
I drove by your house but you don't live there anymore

'Cause I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you right now

Won’t you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you

I can see that you've had enough
I can see that you're giving up on me
I can see that your hands are up
I can see that you're giving up on me
I hate the way that you're better off, better off
I numb the pain but it's never stops, never stops
Wish I could say that I'm better off, better off now

But I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you right now

Won’t you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you

Won’t you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you
