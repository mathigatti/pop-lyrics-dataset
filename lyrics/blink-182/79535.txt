You gotta be careful
You never know who's around
Look over your shoulder
I'm right behind youI see you watchin
Two steps behind me, stalkin
Knock me, tryin to stop me from my monopoly
Wait, stop and see what I do next
If you win then ... you be scared and stressed
I've seen your type, all hype
and no substance
We bang hard like snares in percussion
You can't intimidate men like me
You bring a knife to a gunfight
Winning's unlikely
Follow me, go ahead, I'm watching your shadow
The snakes in the grass get caught by the rattles
Skadattle, slam, you been defeated
You're messing with a guerilla
Who told you to beat it
Bleed it, Beep it, whatever you want
Make a million dollars
Go ahead and punt
You still get no respect
It just don't matter
Rat-ta-tat-tat and all the punks scatterI'm 
right
behind you
So you better (uh)
Watch your back 
(watch your watch your watch your back
(watch your watch your watch your back)
(watch your watch your watch your back)
(watch your back watch your back)
(watch your watch your watch your back)
(watch your watch your watch your back)
(watch your watch your watch your back)
(watch your back watch your back)Once in a while
Things can get drastic
Classic, cases of fools made from plastic
Livin in the city
Oppression is king
Survival of the fittest
Is a real thing
One second you're breathing
The next second you're not
One minute you're standing
The next minute you're dropped
357's or AK-47's
All tools that create 187's
A learning departure
To hell in a heaven
No matter if you're rich
Or live like a peasant
The nicest guy
Or The finest girl
Or the toughest gangster
With an O.G. curl
I live in peace
But folks still be testing me
Your best friend today
Tomorrow, your worst enemy
You never know who's planning to jack
That's why I'm trying to warn you people
Watch your backI'm 
right
behind you
So you better (uh)
Watch your back 
(watch your watch your watch your back
(watch your watch your watch your back)
(watch your watch your watch your back)
(watch your back watch your back)
(watch your watch your watch your back)
(watch your watch your watch your back)
(watch your watch your watch your back)
(watch your back watch your back)Can you hear me?
Can you feel me?
Can you see me?
I'm right here .. hahaWATCH YOUR BACK!
(watch your back)
(watch your watch your watch your back
(watch your watch your watch your back)
