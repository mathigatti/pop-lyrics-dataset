I woke up today surrounded by blackness
The small morning sun devoured the process
It's always been fun when I get a bit nervous
And it's hard to say but I feel a bit weightless
The more I admit I feel a bit anxious
The more I go on the less I can face this
And those rotten things that live in our shadow
We walked on the line of death and the gallows
And hope that we clear a path we can follow


It's the worst damn day
(It doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today
(It doesn't hurt that much)
I'm alright
(It doesn't hurt that much)

When I was young the world it was smaller
The cities were vast the buildings were taller
I felt really strong my parents seemed stronger
But life has a way it showers with greatness
Then takes it away those pieces that made us
Then teaches you things you'd never imagine
We all get the same the memories the burdens
The pictures we made they still form a pattern
They cautiously say: Does it all matter?

It was the worst damn day
(It doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today
(It doesn't hurt that much)
I'm alright
(It doesn't hurt that much)
