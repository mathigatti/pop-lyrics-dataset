And she was, like a starry night
Like a ferris wheel, full of blue-green eyes
And a heart of steel, always on her own
Almost never real


When the night will begin
The pain will not end, even if she falls in love
Back, you wanna turn back
Your heart will attack, even if she falls in love

And she was, like a blade of ice
Like a lonely road, clear as day, alive
Always sharp and cold, always beautiful
I'm such a fool

When the night will begin
The pain will not end, even if she falls in love
Back, you wanna turn back
Your heart will attack, even if she falls in love
Try to look in her eyes
The light is just right, even if she falls in love
And it isn't so bad
It's driving you mad, even if she falls in love

When the night will begin
The pain will not end, even if she falls in love
Back, you wanna turn back
Your heart will attack, even if she falls in love
Try to look in her eyes
The light is just right, even if she falls in love
And it isn't so bad
It's driving you mad, even if she falls in love
