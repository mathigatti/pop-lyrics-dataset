Am I strungout crazy or not allowed
to be the one who gets stupid over you
Lazy laidback maybe you're just on crack
Why am I the one who gets fucked up and confused
GO!


She doesn't care at all
She doesn't care at all
She doesn't care about those times we never shared at all

If I were the last
of the few who always ask
would you still be the same person that I knew
And if it's for me
Another boring story
I swear I'll act enthused
