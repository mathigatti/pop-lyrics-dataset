Been gone a long time,
I kinda lost my way,
Can't fight it.
And I caught a short ride,
To the grave and back this season.
I can try to get by,
But everytime I start to panic.
I'm a little bit shy.
A bit strange, and a little bit maniac


La da da da da da da da

I went to a wishing well,
But sank to the ocean floor.
Cut on the sharp blue rocks,
And washed up along the shore.

I reached for a shooting star,
It burnt a hole through my hand.
Made it's way through my heart,
A funny and a promised land.

On the narrowing line,
What a way to sort my troubles.
In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover.
Can you figure me out?
I got caught like a little kid stealing.
Did I say it too loud?
Bit hard or a little misleading.
