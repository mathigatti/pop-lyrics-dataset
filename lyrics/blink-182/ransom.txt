Say the word and I'll be there
Say the word and I'll be there


She was just a babe in the woods
He was always up to no good
Of course, they'd end up as one
(Say the word and I'll be there)

She took a late-night bus to L.A
He left home with nowhere to stay
Moving to the land of the Sun
(Say the word and I'll be there)

They found a spot on broker hill
The getting part was hard
The phoenix slowly turned to ashes
Hope to broken hearts

Now she's holding him for ransom
Now she's holding him for ransom
Say the word and I'll be there
Say the word and I'll be there

Now she's holding him for ransom
Now she's holding him for ransom
Now she's holding him for ransom
