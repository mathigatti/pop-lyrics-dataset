I took her out, it was a friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the tv


And thats about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by tv shows
What the hell is add?
My friends say I should act my age
Whats my age again?
Whats my age again?

And later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops
And your husbands in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And thats about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call id?
My friends say I should act my age
Whats my age again?
Whats my age again?

And thats about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
Whats my age again?
(Whats my age again?)

And thats about the time that she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never want to act my age
Whats my age again?
Whats my age again?

Whats my age again?
