Now i`m trying to say good bye, they meant to might be dry out,
now i`m trying to say hello, took u whore and drink u dont know,
chorus: dont take the high road, they said you`re laugh about it,
get in the car and drive away.Now u did it just for fight, cause u love it when is dry,
and I tell u now is something that u probbly never tried,
when u look behind the mirror, reach I tried is so wide,
to make up the side that u taking easy far.
chorus:
Dont take the high road, that said u laugh about it, get in the car and drive away.
