A bottle for breakfast trying to let go
Remember a voice but it's only an echo
I still got your make-up here on my pillow
And I'm seeing ghosts here outside of my window


It was just one time
One time
Started turning into two times
A few times
Haven't been sober in a long time
A long time
Yeah you used to be all mine
All mine

It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I've got my head hungover you
I guess I'm still hungover you

I was so wasted I couldn't see you
Didn't seem like a choice, no I would never leave you
Nights that we stayed up, days that we'd sleep through
I can still see your face right outside of my window

It was just one time
One time
Started turning into two times
A few times
Haven't been sober in a long time
A long time
Yeah you used to be all mine
All mine

It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I've got my head hungover you
I guess I'm still hungover you
(I've got my head hungover you
I guess I'm still hungover you)

A bottle for breakfast trying to let go
Remember a voice but it's only an echo

It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I've got my head hungover you
I guess I'm still hungover you
It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I've got my head hungover you
I guess I'm still hungover you
(I've got my head hungover you
I guess I'm still hungover you)
