Don't wanna hear the static on the TV screen
Don't wanna live a life of cellphone memories


When did you go missing?
Where did I go wrong?
Sometimes I just don't know where I belong

Save yourself, we're always saying
We're not the same we're two in a million, ahh
We've got the good old days
These are the good old days
We've gone through hell the battles, we fought
And we stood as one we're young and forgotten
We've got the good old days
These are the good old days

You're not the only one who grew up feeling scared
You're not the only broken heart gone on repair

Everyone's gone missing
Everyone's done wrong
Sometimes we both fly too close to the sun

You're giving up
We're getting out
We were young and we're not growing up
We're not growing up

You're giving up
We're getting out
We were young and we're not growing up
We're not growing up

These are the good old days
These are the good old days

These are the good old days
These are the good old days
