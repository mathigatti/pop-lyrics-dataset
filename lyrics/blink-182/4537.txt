You are better than me
Girls money and everything I
Try to compete with you
But you beat me at everything I do


I see in you
The things that I would like to be
But I'm different from you
So you will have to be like me

I cannot be bought my
Personality is what I choose
I was brought up without a silver cup!
I won't covet the things owned by you

For all the world
Material things are now more and more
Jealousy for you and me

I won't covet the things owned by your store
