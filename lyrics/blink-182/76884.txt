Come here, please hold my hand, lord, now
Help me, I'm scared please show me how
To fight this, God has a master plan
And I guess, I am in his demand


Please save me, this time I cannot run
And I'll see, you when this is done
And now I, have come to realize
That you are, the one who's left behind

Please stay, until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on, to me
I'm right here, waiting

I see, the light it feels good
And I'll come, back soon just like you would
It's useless, my name has made the list
And I wish, I gave you one last kiss

Please stay, until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on, to me
I'm right here, waiting
And take, my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here, waiting

Please stay, until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on, to me
I'm right here, waiting
And take, my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here, waiting

Please stay, until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on, to me
I'm right here, waiting
And take, my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here, waiting
