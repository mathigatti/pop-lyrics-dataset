All her signals are getting lost in the ether
(That's what she wanted)
She's a landslide with a city beneath her
(That's what she wanted)
So take a good look, so you'll never forget it
(That's what she wanted)
Take a deep breath, I know I'm gonna regret it
(That's what she wanted)


Holly's looking dry, looking for an easy target
Let her slit my throat; give her ammo if she'll use it
Caution on the road: Lies lies and hidden danger.
Southern california's breeding mommy's little monster

She's got a mission, and I'm collateral damage
(That's what she wanted)
She's the flower that you place on my casket
(That's what she wanted)
Savor the moment 'cause the memory's fleeting.
Take a photograph, as the last train is leaving.

Holly's looking dry, looking for an easy target
Let her slit my throat; give her ammo if she'll use it
Caution on the road: Lies lies and hidden danger.
Southern california's breeding mommy's little monster

Better run run run run run (holly let me out)
Better run run run run run (holly let me out)
Better run run run run run (holly let me out)
Better run run run run run run run (holly let me out)
