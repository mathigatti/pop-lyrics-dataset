I've got her in my head
At night when i go to bed
and I know it sounds lame
but she's the girl of my dreams
And of course I'd do anything for her
I'd search the moons of Endor
I'd even walk naked through the deserts of Tatooine


Princess Leia where are you tonight
and who's laying there by your side
Every night i fall asleep with you
and I wake up alone

And even though I'm not as cool as Han
i still want to be your man
You're exactly the kind of Alderranian that I need
But when you when you were available
I was drinking colt 45's with Lando
I was hanging out in the cantina on Mos Eisley

Princess Leia where are you tonight
and who's laying there by your side
Every night i fall asleep with you
and I wake up alone

Princess Leia Princess Leia
Princess Leia where are you tonight
and who's laying there by your side
Every night i fall asleep with you
and I wake up alone
