Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

First drink of the night just to get me right
The first light of the day I know I've got it all wrong
First pill that you drop only sets it off
The next morning you wake up all blurry and numb


Before all the damage securities
Before all your innocence is all lost
Think back to the time you were all alone
One day you'll look back and say where's it all gone?

Sometimes we get lost inside our little heads
Don't sleep, just yet, we all know that there's nothing like the
First love, first time, there ain't nothing like the first time
Passed out, last night, there ain't nothing like the first time

Taking all the meds (first love)
Sleeping with your friends (first time)
Fighting, in the end ain't (there ain't)
Nothing like the first time (nothing like the first time)
Stuck inside her head (passed out)
Jumping in her bed (last night)
Fighting, in the end ain't (there ain't)
Nothing like the first time (nothing like the first time)

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(Nothing like the first time)

First time on a plane, said she's paranoid
Tried to make her feel safe and said it all wrong
First time in la so she can't avoid
Leaving life she's failing all along

Sometimes we get lost inside our little heads
Don't sleep, just yet, we all know that there's nothing like the
First love, first time, there ain't nothing like the first time
Passed out, last night, there ain't nothing like the first time

Taking all the meds (first love)
Sleeping with your friends (first time)
Fighting, in the end ain't (there ain't)
Nothing like the first time (nothing like the first time)
Stuck inside her head (passed out)
Jumping in her bed (last night)
Fighting, in the end ain't (there ain't)
Nothing like the first time (nothing like the first time)

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(Nothing like the first time)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(Nothing like the first time)
