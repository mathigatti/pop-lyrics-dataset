Hangin out behind the club on the weekend
Actin stupid gettin drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there


She's gettin kicked outta school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one she'll aways be there
She took my hand and that made it I swear

'cause I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said what? and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool,  gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of  town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin explanation

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said what? and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call
She always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance
I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said what and I told her that  I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parent go out of  town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

With the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show
( I'll never.. forget tonight)
With the girl at the rock show
(I'll never.. forget tonight)
With the girl at the rock show
( I'll never.. forget tonight)
With the girl at the rock show
( I'll never.. forget tonight)
With the girl at the rock show
( I'll never.. forget tonight)
With the girl at the rock show
( I'll never.. forget tonight)
With the girl at the rock show
( I'll never.. forget tonight)
