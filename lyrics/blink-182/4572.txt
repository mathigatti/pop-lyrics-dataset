Everything has fallen to pieces,
Earth is dying, help me Jesus
We need guidance, we've been misled
Young and hostile, but not stupid.


Corporate leaders, politicians
kids can't vote, adults elect them
laws that rule the school and workplace,
signs that caution, sixteen's unsafe.

We really need to see this through,
we never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
if we're fucked up you're to blame

Let this train wreck burn more slowly,
kids are victims in this story
Drown the youth with usless warnings
teenage rules, they're fucked and boring

We really need to see this through,
we never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
if we're fucked up you're to blame

Everything has fallen to pieces,
Everything has fallen to pieces,
Everything has fallen to pieces,
Everything has fallen to...

We really need to see this through,
we never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
if we're fucked up you're to blame!
FUCK YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!
