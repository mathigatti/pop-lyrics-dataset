Do you wanna know what I think of you?
'Cause you're not the way I thought you should be
Do take back what you said
It's time to fix, it's time to fix your head


And now all alone, one's less than two
I've never been better off living lonely
To listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

What did you think of me acting this way
I guess you never really thought at all
Is that what you call your brain?
Is that why I call you hang up on me?

I wanted to know, I don't want to lose
And now I'm a man who's just living small
Listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

To me as I walk alone I'd
Much rather be riding prone, then
To be just another one you are lame to

I wanted to know, I don't want to lose
But now I'm a man who's just living small
Listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

To me as I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step ahead to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me as I walk alone, I'd
Much rather be riding prone, than
Be just another one you are lame to

Don't talk to me as I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step ahead to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me as I walk alone, I'd
Much rather be riding prone, than
To be just another one you are lame to
