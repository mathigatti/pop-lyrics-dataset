I got to regret right now (I'm feeling this)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feeling this)
let me go in her room (I'm feeling this)
I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this)
Oh it is such a blur (I'm feeling this)
I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this)


[Chorus]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Where do we go from here
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)
Our breathing has got to loud (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)
We're taking this way to slow (I'm feeling this)
Take me away from here (I'm feeling this)

[Chorus x2]

This place was never the same again
After you came and went
How can you say you meant anything different
To anyone standing alone
On the street with a cigarette
On the first night we met

Look to the past
Remember a smile
And maybe tonight
I can breath for awhile
I'm not in the seat
I think I'd fallen asleep
But then all that I need
I'd always be dreaming of you

[Chorus x5]
[During Last Choruses In The Background:]
(I'll be alone if you're feeling
So lost and disillusioned)
