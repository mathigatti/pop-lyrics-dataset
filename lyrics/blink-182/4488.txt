When you talk about tomorrow
I'm not sure about today
When you tell me that you love me
What am I supposed to say?


Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel

Words like forever
They scare the shit out of me
Maybe I'm afraid of commitment
Maybe you're too distracted to see that

Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel

I think of all the things I'd say to you if I had the chanceagain
I think of all the things I'd scream
But I think it's for the best
That you and I just don't connect and
Things are never quite what they seem

Will there ever be
Someone to give her heart to me
Or would I be to blind to see it

I wouldn't make a sound
I'd keep it underground

It always seems like I'm running around around
Running around around
Round
Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel
