I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a Carousel


Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die

Just you wait and see
A school life is a
It is a woken dream

Aren't you feeling alo-o-o-o-one?
I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone

Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile

A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again

Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream

Aren't you feeling alo-o-o-o-one?
I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone
