I'm Sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind
An oversensitive guy
That he's lost and alone (Yeah)


I hate our favorite restaurant
Our favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone

I can't forgive, can't forget
Can't give in, what went wrong?
'Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place, it's fucking cursed and it's plagued
and I can never escape
When my heart, it explodes

I can't forgive, can't forget
Can't give in, what went wrong?
'Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm kicking out fiercely
At the world around me
What went wrong?

I'm kicking
