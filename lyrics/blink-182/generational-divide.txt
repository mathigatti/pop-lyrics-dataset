Is it better, is it better now?
Are we better, are we better now?
Is it better, is it better now?
Are we better, are we better now?


All we needed was a lifeline
(Is it better, is it better now?)
We swore we'd be better than the last time
(Are we better, are we better now?)

Donate, tell me that you're all right
(Is it better, is it better now?)
I'm not the generational divide
(Are we better, are we better now?)
