Oh no it happens again
She's cool she's hot she's my friend
I tried for hours if so
you leave me no where to go


She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated wrong

Please take, me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet, you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

I hope, hope that it last
Give in forget the past
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest, this breaks my heart

She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated, wrong

Please take, me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet, you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Please take, me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet, you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Why did we have to go date?
Its too easy to complicate
Be strong when things fall apart (Be strong when things fall apart)
Honest,this breaks my heart (It's so hard)
Let's Go!

Please take, me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet, you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Please take, me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet, you're sad
This is the best time we ever had
