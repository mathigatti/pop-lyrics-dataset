From the walls of Tokyo
Down in London town's a go-go
With the record selection
And the mirror's reflection
I'll be dancing with myself
When there's no one else in sight
In the crowded, lonely night
I wait so long for my love vibration
And I'm dancing with myself


Oh, oh dancing with myself
Oh, oh dancing with myself

Well there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, oh

If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But their empty eyes seem to pass me by
I'll be dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think

If I had the chance, I'd ask the world to dance
I'd be dancing with myself

Oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself

If I had the chance, I'd ask the world to dance
I'll be dancing with myself

Oh, oh, oh, oh (3x)
Mark! oh oh oh oh

If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But their empty eyes seem to pass me by
I'll be dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think

If I had a chance, I'd ask the world to dance
I'll be dancing with myself

Oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself

If I had a chance, I'd ask the worldto dance
If I had a chance, I'd ask the world to dance
If I had a chance, I'd ask the world to dance

Oh, oh, oh, oh (9x)
yeah, in a sweat (5x)
sweat! (10x)
