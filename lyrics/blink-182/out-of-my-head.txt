Leave a light in your bedroom
For when I stumble down the hall
Got nowhere left to go to
Guess I shouldn't go anywhere at all


And I hear what you're saying
But I still keep banging away
Left a note on my windshield
Saying that you shouldn't have to

Waste another
Day of my life

Get me out of my head
Empty, left for dead
Don't make this so complicated
There's no point in a conversation

Get you out of my head
Let's both just forget
How this got so complicated
There's no point in a conversation

I can tell this time that you're leaving
Free yourself of me and my demons
Caught ever hurting your feelings
Said I can't take this no more

Ran away on a bike that I gave you
Sold it off the next day you came to
Can't stand me, can't say I blame you
I can't take this anymore
I can't stand me anymore

Get me out of my head
Empty, left for dead
Don't make this so complicated
There's no point in a conversation

Get you out of my head
Let's both just forget
How this got so complicated
There's no point in a conversation

There's no point in a conversation
There's no point in a conversation

Get me out of my head
Empty, left for dead
Don't make this so complicated
There's no point in a conversation

Get you out of my head
Let's both just forget
How this got so complicated
There's no point in a conversation
