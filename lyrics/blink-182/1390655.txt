Broken glass and cigarettes
Writin' on the wall
It was a bargain for the summer
And I thought I had it all
I was the one who gave you everything
The one who took the fall
You were the one who would do anything
The one who can't recall
Where she was while she was sleepin'
In another women's bed
Or the doctor's or the lawyer's
Or the stranger that she met
If there's nothin' I can gain from this
Or anything at all
It'd be the knowledge that you gave me
When I thought I'd heard it all


It was a long time for you
(It was a long time)
It was a long time for me
(It was a long time)
It'd be a long time for anyone but
(It was a long time)
Looks like it's meant to be

Social class and registers
Cocaine in the hall
All the way from California
On the way to your next call
To those non-negotiations
To stimulate a cause
For the betterment of evils
And your ways around the laws
That keep you up and sitting pretty
On a pedestal or bed
And now you're sleeping like an angel
Never mind who gave you head
If there's somethin' I can make of this
Or anything at all
It'd be the devil hates a loser
And you thought you had it all

It was the wrong time for you
(It was a wrong time)
It was the wrong time for me
(It was a wrong time)
It was the wrong time for anyone but
(It was a wrong time)
Looks like I got to see for myself

If I could go back in time
To the place in my soul
There all alone
Lonely teardrops ooh
Are callin' you
But I don't want to know it now
Cause knowin' you
It won't change a damn thing
But there was a time

Yeah there was a time
Didn't want ta know it all...
Didn't wanna know it all...
N' I don't wanna know it now
Yeah there was a time
Didn't want ta know it all...
Didn't wanna know it all...
N' I don't wanna know it now
Oh

Oh I would do anything for you
There was a time
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
There was a time

There was a time
I would do anything for you
Ooh...
Yeah, there was a time
Didn't want ta know it all...
Didn't wanna know it all...
Ooh...
N' I don't wanna know it now
I would do...
Didn't want to know at all...
Anything for you
Didn't wanna know at all...
N' I don't wanna know it now

There was a time...
There was a time
