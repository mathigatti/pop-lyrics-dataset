Let's get started
The faint and broken-hearted
Hold it up, I've got something I cannot hide
Worst painkiller, that all-in filler
The apart and departed look in my eyes


Sad, how far you ran
I'll search this land
Up through the clouds
Then back here
We could reignite
Like fireflies
Like an atom bomb
At all hours

I'm empty like the day after christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after christmas
There's nothing left to say and so goodnight

I will follow the trail to tomorrow
With my loneliness with sorrow all through the night
Sons and daughters, mothers and their fathers
Just the bridges and the waters
Their clues left behind

Sad, how far you ran
I'll search this land
Up through the clouds
Then back here
We could reignite
Like fireflies
Like an atom bomb
At all hours

I'm empty like the day after christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after christmas
There's nothing left to say and so goodnight

I'm empty like the day after christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after christmas
There's nothing left to say and so goodnight

There's nothing left to say and so goodnight
Goodnight
