There's an echo
Pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream


The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I
I'm not coming home

Save your breath
I'm nearly
Bored to death
And fading fast
Life is too short to last long

Back on earth
I'm broken
Lost and cold
And fading fast
Life is too short to last long

There's a stranger
Staring a the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree

The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I
I'm not coming home

Save your breath
I'm nearly
Bored to death
And fading fast
Life is too short to last long

Back on earth
I'm broken
Lost and cold
And fading fast
Life is too short to last long

I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
I said I'm sorry
I'm bit of a letdown

But all my friends daring me to come over
So I come over
And over
And over

So let me buy you a drink
And we'll pretend that you think
That I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
And we'll go over
And over
And over

Save your breath
I'm nearly
Bored to death
And fading fast
Life is too short to last long

Back on earth
I'm broken
Lost and cold
And fading fast
Life is too short to last long
