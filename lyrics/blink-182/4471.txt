I think of a while ago
We might of had it all
I was so stupid then
You needed time to grow
But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you


But what do I get cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
Now I give up so good bye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
it's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night
you have your other friends
They were there when you cried
Didn't mean to hurt you then
Best friends just won't leave your side

But what do I get cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
Now I give up so good bye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
it's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night
When I needed you most when I needed a friend
you let me down now like I let you down then
So sorry
It's over
