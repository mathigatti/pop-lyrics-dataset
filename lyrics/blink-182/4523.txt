With all those words you bring
Why do you say what you don't mean?
To those people who don't care about one thing that you mightneed


And you just don't know
Your actions always shine the most
To those people who don't care if you end up alone

You need some time to sew
All those bridges that you burned
'Cause there's nothing left to bring
To someone who just won't learn

Have you made up your mind?
How have you known what you decide
To those people who just think that you are telling lies

So I give up
I made it clear as it can be
To those people who don't care about one thing that you mightneed

You need some time to sew
All those bridges that you burned
'Cause there's nothing left to bring
To someone who just won't learn

Oh, you need some time to sew
All those bridges that you burned
'Cause there's nothing left to bring
To someone who just won't learn
