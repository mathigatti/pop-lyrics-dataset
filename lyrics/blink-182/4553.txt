It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted
It's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all


I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it everyday

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So, when you're dead and gone, will you
Remember this night
Twenty years now lost?
It's not right

Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather then fix the problem
They never solve them
It makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants
And it's what she wants
Then why there's so much pain?

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So, when you're dead and gone, will you
Remember this night
Twenty years now lost?
It's not right

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So, when you're dead and gone, will you
Remember this night
Twenty years now lost?
It's not right

It's not right!
It's not right!
It's not right!
