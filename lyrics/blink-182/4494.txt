Ladies and gentlemen, for your listening pleasure, Blink)


Passively one day as the sun rose out of it's house
So did this little old guy as he whistled out of his mouth
And happily and gay
Well I guessed exactly that
Because he found a special girl
That put him in a special trance

He fell in love so quickly
What the hell was he do to expect
That the girl under his arm wasn't the same
As any other girl
That he had thought that he once met
I guess you could only blame fate

Things started getting weird as they started to kiss
She often felt his beard and remembered how her father shemissed
And then quietly one day
He sang a song from deep within his heart
Causing some ingestion
He finished with a great big fart and

She knew at that one moment
That song was something she heard before
So she asked him to do that again

Then out the door they hurried
She was gonna find out for sure
So she analyzed his rear end

She said, "When I was a little girl my dad left my mom.
He used to always fart and sing this special song.
Now I wasn't quite so sure until your pants did fall.
'Cause now I know that your my dad because you use ben wahballs."

I said a wah, wah, wah-wah-wah,
Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah...
Ben wah balls, wah, wah, wah-wah-wah,
Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah... Balls.
