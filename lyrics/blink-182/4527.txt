So sorry, it's over, so sorry, it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry, it's over)
There's so much more that I needed and
(So sorry, it's over)
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone


Let's take some time to talk this over
You're out of line and rarely sober
We can't depend on your excuses
Cause in the end it's fucking useless
You can only lean on me for so long
Bring your ship about to watch a friend drown
Stood over the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long

I remember shots without a chaser
Absent minded thoughts, now you're a stranger
Cover up the scars put on your gameface
Left you in the bar to try and save face

You can only lean on me for so long
Bring your ship about to watch a friend drown
Stood over the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long
So sorry, it's over, so sorry, it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry, it's over)
There's so much more that I needed and
(So sorry, it's over)
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone

Man on a mission can't say I miss him around
Insider information, hand in your resignation
Loss of a good friend best of intentions I found
Tight lipped procrastination
Yeah, later, see you around
