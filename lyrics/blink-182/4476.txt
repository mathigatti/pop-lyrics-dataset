Crossed the street
Naked at night
Bent over to show some moonlight
Pulled out some beer and gulped it down
Nude in a gutter is how I was found
Thrown in a police car and the door slammed
No noise just silence as I screamed my dick was jammed
Now in prison for one month no one to see
All I got is this guy Ben Dover


Don't like Hesh, don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally, 'cause she's fat
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
Took a shower cause I stunk
Smoked a bong killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs

Went to a farm to tip some cows
Forgot that I left my pants down
Bent over to pick them up
Felt a twelve gauge next to my humdididum
The famer took me to his house
Showed me the closet from the inside out
The police came and took me away
Saw Ben Dover again and he's still gay

Don't like Hesh, don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally, 'cause she's fat
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
Took a shower, 'cause I stunk
Smoked a bong killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs

Don't like Hesh, don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally, 'cause she's fat
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
Took a shower 'cause I stunk
Smoked a bong killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs
