I've been watching you from a distance
But distance sees through your disguise
All I want from you is your hurting
I want to heal you
I want to save you from the dark


Give unto me your troubles
I'll endure your suffering
Place onto me your burden
I'll drink your deadly poison

Why should I care if they hurt you?
Somehow it matters more to me
Than if I were hurting myself
Save you, save you
I'll save you

Give unto me your troubles
I'll endure your suffering
Place onto me your burden
I'll drink your deadly poison

Fear not the flame of my love's candle
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness
