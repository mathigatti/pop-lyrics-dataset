Embrace the silence
'Cause there's nothing that can change the way I feel
Taken all that you wanted
Now there's nothing that can change the way I feel


Hold on, little girl
The end is soon to come

Sick of it all, sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all, sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are, sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies
Behind closed eyes

Oceans between us
And there's nothing that can change the way I feel
I can still taste the poison
Of every thought, every breath I wasted here

Hold on, little girl
The end is soon to come

Sick of it all, sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all, sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are, sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies
Behind closed eyes

Someday you'll know the pain
Someday the light will break through
And nothing you tell yourself will save us from the truth
Screaming out

Sick of it all, sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all, sick of it all
They don't understand how
Sick we are, sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies
Behind closed eyes
