Playground school bell rings again
Rain clouds come to play again
Has no one told you she's not breathing?


Hello, I am your mind
Giving you someone to talk to, hello

If I smile and don't believe
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream
Don't try to fix me
I'm not broken

Hello, I am the lie living for you
So you can hide, don't cry

Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping
Hello, I'm still here
All that's left of yesterday
