All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned
By your thoughtless scheming
Now, you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming


Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
Pushing all the mercy down, down, down
I wanna see you try to take a swing at me
Come on, I'm gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground

Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it's funny? What the fuck you think it's doing to me?
You take your turn lashing at me
I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me

All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned
By your thoughtless scheming
Now you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming

Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown
I wanna kill and rape you the way you raped me
And I'll pull the trigger and you're down, down, down

Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it's funny? What the fuck you think it's doing to me?
You take your turn lashing out at me
I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me

All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned
By your thoughtless scheming
Now you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming

All my friends are gone, they died
They all screamed, and cried

I'm gonna take you down
I'm gonna take you down
I'm gonna take you down
I'm gonna take you down

All of my hate cannot be found
I will not be drowned
By your thoughtless scheming
Now you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming

Yeah All of my hate cannot be found
I will not be drowned
By your thoughtless scheming
Now you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming
