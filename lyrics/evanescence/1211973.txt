All our times have come. Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
And we can be like they are
(Come on baby) don't fear the reaper
(Baby take my hand) don't fear the reaper
(We'll be able to fly) don't fear the reaper
(Baby I'm your man)


La la la la la la
Valentine is done. Here but now they're gone.

Romeo and juliet
Are together in eternity
Romeo and juliet
(40,000 Men and women everyday) like romeo and juliet
(40,000 Men and women everyday) redefine happiness
(Another 40,000 comin' everyday) and we can be like they are
(Come on baby) don't fear the reaper
(Baby take my hand) don't fear the reaper
(We'll be able to fly) don't fear the reaper
(Baby I'm your man)

La la la la la la
Love of two is one. Here but now they're gone.

Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared
(Saying don't be afraid) come on baby
(And she had no fear) and she ran to him
(Then they started to fly) they looked backward and saidgoodbye
She had become like they are (she had taken his hand)
She had become like they are (come on baby)
Don't fear the reaper
