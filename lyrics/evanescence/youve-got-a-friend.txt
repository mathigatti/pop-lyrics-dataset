When you're down and troubled
And you need some loving care
And nothing, ooh, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest nights


You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, oh yeah baby
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Should grow dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow
Keep your head together and call my name out loud
And soon I will be knocking upon your door
You just call out my name
And you know where ever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you go to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend?
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
Well they'll take your soul if you let them
Oh yeah, but don't you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Oh babe, don't you know that
Winter, spring, summer or fall
Hey now, all you've go to do is call
Lord, I'll be there, yes Iwill
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
You've got a friend
