I will wander till the end of time
Torn away from you


I pulled away to face the pain
I close my eyes and drift away
Over the fear that I will never find a way to heal my soul
And I will wander till the end of time
Torn away from you

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrow’s hold (over my heart)

I can’t go on living this way
But I can’t go back the way I came
Chained to this fear that I will never find a way to heal my soul
And I will wander till the end of time
Half alive without you

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us

Change
Open your eyes to the light
I denied it all so long, oh, so long
Say goodbye
Goodbye

My heart is broken
Release me, I can’t hold on
Deliver us
My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us
My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrow’s hold!
