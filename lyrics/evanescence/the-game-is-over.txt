Had enough, I've really had enough
Had enough of denial
I'm not alright, but I'm not gonna lie
I don’t know that I ever was


All alone I’ve waited, all alone
Held it in as I played by your rules
I've been biting my lip, but I’m losing my grip
I'm coming down, down, down

When all the hate burns off
I'm left here with the pain
Behind our vain devices
Aren't we all the same?

Change me into something I believe in
Change me so I don't have to pretend

Take a breath and try to play along
But I'm a terrible liar
I feel the world like a brick on my chest
And the party's just begun

Throw the rope, I'm wading
Through the mud
From your mouth flow a thousand truths
But you know there's only one

When all the hate burns off
I'm left here with the pain

Change me into something I believe in
Change me so I don't have to pretend
Sweet words, they mean nothing, they're not true
'Cause the game is over

I want it all or I want nothing at all
Maybe I can change me into something I believe in
Change me so I don't have to pretend
Your sweet words, they mean nothing, save your breath
The game is over
