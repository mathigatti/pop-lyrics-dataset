I don't know your heart
I don't know where to begin
But I could feel you erasing
The rivers I'd drawn in
The more I stood still
The faster you were running
You don't know how it feels
Crawling under your skin
So far, so far away
Don't you know we could be


High or low
You never fell beneath me
And I gave up on you
But I never forgot you

I can't be your friend
Hold your hand while you bleed
There's nothing left to give you
Nothing more I need
Time to let it sleep
Oh, the damage was real
But nothing cut me so deep I could not heal

Don't you know we could be
High or low
You never fell beneath me
And I gave up on you
But I never forgot you

High or low
You never fell beneath me
And I gave up on you
But I never forgot
