Meet me after dark again and I'll hold you
I want nothing more than to see you there


And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

If only night can hold you
Where I can see you, my love
Then let me never ever wake again

And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

Somehow I know
That we can't wake again from this dream
It's not real, but it's ours

Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn
