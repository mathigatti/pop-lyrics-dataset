I know a secret something still belongs to me
I'm not afraid of those who killed their body
For still they cannotï»¿ kill kill their soul
You may beat me down
Just denying the truth
But you can't kill the me in you
Dreams are illusions
They fade away before we can catch them
Promises that may be broken, dreams we'll forget
But what birthed in you cannot die
You may beat me down
Just denying the truth
But you can't kill the me in you.
