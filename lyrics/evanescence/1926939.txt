Make me whole again
Open your eyes
Taunted by the shadows of your light
Cold and far away
Like you're not even mine
Undo everything and take me higher
Never believing what they say cause I'm


Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home

I'm not giving in
I want you back
Holding together by the shards of our past
Stole my heart away
I can't let you go
Break these chains and let me fly to you
High above the world below
Over and over in my mind

Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home

I am so lost without my place inside your heart
I won't survive, I need to know you hear me
Awaken and release my love

Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me...
Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home
