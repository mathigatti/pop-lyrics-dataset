How many times have you told me you love her?
As many times as I've wanted to tell you the truth
How long have I stood here beside you?
I live through you, you look through me


Ooh, solitude
Still with me is only you
Ooh, solitude
I can't stay away from you

How many times have I done this to myself?
How long will it take before I see?
When will this hole in my heart be mended?
Who now is left alone but me?

Ooh, solitude
Forever me and forever you
Ooh, solitude
Only you, only true

Everyone leave me stranded
Forgotten, abandoned, left behind
I can't stay here another night
Your secret admirer, who could it be?

Ooh, can't you see?
All along it was me
How can you be so blind
As to see right through me?

Ooh, solitude
Still with me is only you
Ooh, solitude
I can't stay away from you

Ooh, solitude
Forever me and forever you
Ooh, solitude
Only you, only true
