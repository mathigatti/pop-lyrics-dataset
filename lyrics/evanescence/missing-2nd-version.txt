Please, please forgive me
But I won't be home again
Maybe someday you'll look up
And barely concious you'll say to no one
Isn't something missing


You won't cry for my absence, I know
You forgot me long ago
Am I that unimportant?
Am I so insignificant?
Isn't something missing
Isn't someone missing me?

Even though I'm the sacrifice
You won't try for me, not now
Though I'd die to know you loved me
I'm all alone
Isn't someone missing me?

Please, please forgive me
But I won't be home again
I know what you do to yourself
I breathe deep and cry out
Isn't something missing
Isn't someone missing me?

Even though I'm the sacrifice
You won't try for me, not now
Though I'd die to know you loved me
I'm all alone
Isn't someone missing me?

And if I bleed I'll bleed
Knowing you dont't care
And if I sleep just to dream of you
And wake without you there
Isn' t something missing?
Isn' t something

Even though I'm the sacrifice
You won't try for me, not now
Though I'd die to know you loved me
I'm all alone
Isn't something missing
Isn't someone missing me?
