Bind my limbs with fear
Choke me with tears
I won't die for you
You've been here before
And came back for more
But no this time


You will never be strong enough
You will never be good enough
You were never conceived in love
You will not rise above

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you
I should have known all along it was all a lie
(Should have known it was all a lie)

Now I know the true
I'm through fearing you
And I am free

You will never be strong enough
You will never be good enough
You were never conceived in love
You will not rise above

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you
I should have known all along it was all a lie
(Should have known it was all a lie)

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you
I should have known all along it was all a lie

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you
I should have known all along it was all a lie

Should have known it was all a lie
