I wanted you to know
That I love the way you laugh
I wanna hold you high
And steal your pain away


I keep your photograph
And I know it serves me well
I wanna hold you high
And steal your pain

'Cause I'm broken
When I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right
When you're gone away

You've gone away
You don't feel me here, anymore

The worst is over now
And we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high
And steal my pain away

There's so much left to learn
And no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high
And steal your pain

'Cause I'm broken
When I'm open
And I don't feel like
I'm strong enough

'Cause I'm broken
When I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right
When you're gone away

'Cause I'm broken
When I'm open
And I don't feel like
I'm strong enough

'Cause I'm broken
When I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right
When you're gone away

'Cause I'm broken
When I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right
When you're gone

You've gone away
You don't feel me here, anymore
