I know a secret
Something still belongs to me
I'm not afraid of those who kill their body
For still they cannot kill their soul


You may beat me down
Just denying the truth
But you can't kill the me in you

Dreams are illusions
They fade away before we can catch them
Promises that may be broken
Dreams we'll forget
But what's birthed in you cannot die

You may beat me down
Just denying the truth
But you can't kill the me in you
