I took their smiles and I made their mine
I sold my soul just to hide the light
And now I see what I really am
A thief, a whore and a liar


I run to you
(Run away from this hell)
Call out your name
(Giving up, giving in)
I see you there
(Still you are)
Farther away

I numb to you
Numb, deaf and blind
You give me all but the reason why
I reach, but I feel only air at night
Not you, not love, just nothing

I run to you
(Run away from this hell)
Call out your name
(Giving up, giving in)
I see you there
(Still you are)
Farther away

Try to forget you
But without you I feel nothing
Don't leave me here, by myself
I can't breathe

I run to you
(Run away from this hell)
Call out your name
(Giving up, giving in)
I see you there
(Still you are)
Farther away

Farther away, farther away
Farther away, farther away
