I'm Robbie's sister...
I guess that's plain to see.
When we watch cartoon's cartoon's...
I'm happy as can be
I think samurai Jack's cool
And Dexter's laboratory
I miss watching powerpuff
I miss watching TV
Well, living on the tourbus ain't that bad.
But I've feel like I've lost all that I had


On Cartoon network
I miss you so
Oh Cartoon Network
Where did you go?

Grim &amp; Evil, how I love that little brain.
Johnny Bravo, can I smack you once again?
I hope you learned a lesson here
Treasure what you have
Don't make the mistake I made
The rockstar life is sad
Well living on a tour bus is... pretty bad
And now I'm sure I know
The meaning of my life
The love within my soul
The reason I wake up each day and its cartoon network
I miss you so

My Cartoon Network

Where did you go?

My cartoon....network...
