Can you stop the fire?
Can you stand to fight her?
You can't stop the fire
You won't say the words
Can you stop the fire?


Please, please forgive me
But I won't be home again
Maybe someday you'll look up
And barely conscious you'll say to no one
Isn't something missing

You won't cry for my absence, I know
You forgot me long ago
Am I that unimportant?
Am I so insignificant?
Isn't someone missing me?

Even though I'm the sacrifice
You won't try for me, not now
Though I'd die to know you love me
I'm all alone
Isn't someone missing me?

Can you stop the fire?
Can you stand to fight her?
You can't stop the fire
You won't say the words
Can you stop the fire?

Please, please forgive me
But I won't be home again
I know what you do to yourself
I breathe deep and cry out
Isn't something missing?

Even though I'm the sacrifice
You won't try for me, not now
Though I'd die to know you love me
I'm all alone
Isn't someone missing me?

Can you stop the fire?
Can you stand to fight her?
You can't stop the fire
You won't say the words
Can you stop the fire?
