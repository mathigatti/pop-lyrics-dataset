Hot summer streets
And the pavements are burning
I sit around
Trying to smile but
The air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying
Oh, what do they say
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got
Right out of hand


It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone
And you're not the only one

The city is crowded
My friends are away
And I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go

Oh, it's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone
And you're not the only one

It's a cruel, cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone
And you're not the only one

You're not the only one
Oh

It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone
And you're not the only one

It's a cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone
And you're not the only one
No you're not the only one
You're not the only one
