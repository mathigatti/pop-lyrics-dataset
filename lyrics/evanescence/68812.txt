I hold my breath
As this life starts to take its toll
I hide behind a smile
As this perfect plan unfolds
But, oh God, I feel
I've been lied to lost all faith
In the things I have achieved


And I

I've woken now to find myself
In the shadows of all I have created
I'm longing to be lost in you
(Away from this place I've made)
Won't you take me away from me?

Crawling through this world
As disease flows through my veins
I look into myself
But my own heart has been changed
I can't go on like this
I loathe all I've become

(I've woken now)
I've woken now to find myself
In the shadows of all I have created
(I'm lost in you)
I'm longing to be lost in you
(Away from this place I've made)
Won't you take me away from me?

Lost in a dying world
I reach for something more
I have grown so weary of this
The lie I live

(I've woken now)
I've woken now to find myself
In the shadows of all I have created
(I'm lost in you)
I'm longing to be lost in you

I (I've woken now)
I've woken now to find myself
I'm lost in the shadows of all own
(I'm lost in you)
I'm longing to be lost in you
Amay from me
