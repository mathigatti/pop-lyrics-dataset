You don't remember my name
I don't really care
Can we play the game your way?
Can I really lose control?


Just once in my life
I think it'd be nice
Just to lose control, just once
(With all pretty flowers in the dust)

Mary had a lamb
His eyes black as coals
If we a play very quiet, my lamb
Mary never has to know

Just once in my life
I think it'd be nice
Just to lose control, just once

If I cut you down to a thing I can use
I fear there will be nothing good left of you

(Lose control, just once)
