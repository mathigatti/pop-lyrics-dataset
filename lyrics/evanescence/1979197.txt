In my own veins
Hearing more than a whisper
Having sudden movement under my heart
And I know
I know I have to watch them pass away
Just get through this day


Give up your way, you could be anything
Give up my way and loose myself
Not today
It's too much gived away

Sickened in the Sun
You dare tell me you love me
But you hurt and doubt what's the reason
I wanted me to die
Honey, you know
You know I've never hurt you that way
You're just pretty in your pain

Give up my way
I could be anything
I'll live my own way
Without your senseless
Hate! Hate! Hate

So run! Run! Run!
And hate me, if it feels good
I can't hear your screams anymore
You lied to me, but I'm older now
And I'm not buying, baby
To mending my response
To rather braking the door down
I found my way out

And you're not hurting me again
