Metaphor for a missing moment
Pull me in to your perfect circle
One womb, One shame, One resolve
Liberate this will
To release us all


Gotta cut away, clear away,
Snip away and severe this
Umbilical residue
Keeping me from killing you

And from pulling you down with me here
I can almost hear you scream

One more medicated peaceful moment (give me)
One more medicated peaceful moment

And I don't wanna feel this overwhelming hostility
No, I don't wanna feel this overwhelming hostility

Gotta cut away clear away
Snip away and sever this umbilical residue
Gotta cut away clear away
Snip away and sever this umbilical residue
Keeping me from killing you
Keeping me from killing you
