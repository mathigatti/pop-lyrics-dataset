Walk away slowly
You don't have to take this
In the spaces in between
Sadness on the faces


I could see the chains of love
The chains
Talking 'bout the chains of love
Can't take us away

Storms are brewing in your heart
I don't want to waste it
Better to have tried it all
Least we got to taste it

Locked up in the chains of love
We change
Caught up in the chains of love
Can't take us away

Clouds moving over the house
I think about those days
Wish i had something to relax my mind
Send me off to heaven i've got nothing but time

Lightning in the sky above
Blink and see the traces
Everything you are to me
Is bigger than the spaces

Between us and the chains of love
The chains
Locked up in the chains of love
They can't take us away
Can't take us away
Can't take us away
Can't take us away
