Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light


And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
You would never break the chain

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the Sun rise
Running in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
You would never break the chain

Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together

Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
You would never break the chain
