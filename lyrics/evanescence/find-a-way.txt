Take my hand
Hold me close
Every breath's a gift
We don't know what tomorrow holds


But I know I need you,
You show me the truth
And I will reach you somehow

I will find a way
Build another world beyond the pain
I will find a way
To keep you safe
Until the end of time

I can't hide
Tears I've cried
Nothing in this world will move me
I'm never gonna leave your side

I want to see your face
And hide in your wake
As long as you are with me

I will find a way
Build another world beyond the pain
I will find a way
To keep you safe
Until the end of

Break the chains within your mind
Fighting blindly throught the dark
I know you hear me
I would give my life
If it would save you from this

I will find a way
Build another world beyond the pain
I will find a way
To keep you safe
Until the end of time
