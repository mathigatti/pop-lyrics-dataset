Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind


Should I let you fall, lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself
Can't keep believing, we're only deceiving
Ourselves and I'm sick of the lie
And you're too late

Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

Couldn't take the blame, sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game
Selfishly hated, no wonder you're jaded
You can't play the victim this time
And you're too late

So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

You never call me when you're sober
You only want it 'cause it's over, it's over
How could I have burned paradise?
How could I? You were never mine

So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
Don't lie to me
Just get your things
I've made up your mind
