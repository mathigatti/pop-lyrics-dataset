Listen, listen, listen, listen

Listen to each drop of rain
Whispering secrets in vain
Frantically searching for someone to hear
Their story before they hit ground


Please, don't let go
Can't we stay for a while?
It's just too hard to say goodbye
Listen to the rain

Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen to the rain weeping

Ooh ooh oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh oh oh oooh
Listen, listen, listen, listen

I stand alone in the storm
Suddenly, sweet words take hold
"Hurry", they say
"For you haven't much time
Open your eyes to the love around you
You may feel you're alone
But I'm here still with you
You can do what you dream
Just remember to listen to the rain"

Ooh ooh oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh oh oh oooh
Listen
