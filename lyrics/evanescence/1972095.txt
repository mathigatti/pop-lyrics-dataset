Turn out the lights
Feed the fire till my soul breaks free
My heart is high as the waves above me


Don't need to understand
Too lost to lose
Don't fight my tears, cause they feel so good

And I, I'll remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door

Look past the end
It's a dream, as it's always been
All life lives on if we've ever loved it

And I, I'll remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door

And I, I'll remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door
