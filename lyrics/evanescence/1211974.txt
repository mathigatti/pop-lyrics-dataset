It seems so far, that I have gone down this road
Only to find that it ends
Looking back there is one thing that I know
I can't make it all alone again
Cause I'm too weak to stand on my own
When all I need is you


So lead me, guide me
Hold me, hide me in love
With all that you are, and all that you do
Hear me, take me
Mold me, break me oh god
Just fill all of me as I fall into you

Just catch me as I fall
All this time, I have felt so alone
Losing myself in my despair
Loving arms, you were waiting for me to let go
Of every step you were there
'Cause I'm too weak, to stand on my own
When all I need is you

So lead me, guide me
Hold me, hide me in love
With all that you are, and all that you do
Hear me, take me
Mold me, break me oh god
Just fill all of me

Oh my child
How I have longed
For you to come home
To where you belong
All of your life
If you could just see all of my joy
When you are here with me

Oh my child
(Lead me)
How I have longed
(Guide me)
For you to come home
(Hold me)
To where you belong
(Hide me in love)
And all of your life
If you could just see all of my joy
(With all that you are)
When you are here with me
(All that you do)

Hear me, take me
Mold me, break me oh god
Just fill all of me as I fall into you
