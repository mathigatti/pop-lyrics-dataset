Now I will tell you what I've done for you
Fifty thousand tears I've cried
Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me
(Going under)


Don't want your hand
This time, I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once
Not tormented daily
Defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom

I'm dying again
I'm going under
Drowning in you
I'm falling forever
I've got to break through
I'm going under

Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
So I don't know what's real and what's not
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I can't trust myself anymore

I'm dying again
I'm going under
Drowning in you
I'm falling forever
I've got to break through

So go on and scream
Scream at me, I'm so far away
I won't be broken again
I've got to breathe
I can't keep going under

I'm dying again
I'm going under
Drowning in you
I'm falling forever
I've got to break through

I'm going under
I'm going under
I'm going under
