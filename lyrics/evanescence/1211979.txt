I am, I am, I am
I said I'm gonna get close to you
I said I wanna get next to you
You wouldn't want me have to hurt you too, hurt you too?


I ain't, I ain't, I ain't
A buyin' into your apathy
I'm gonna learn ya my philosophy
You wanna know about atrocity, atrocity?

I know you want what's on my mind
I know you like what's on my mind
I know it eats you up inside
I know, you know, you know, you know

I am, I am, I am
I said I wanna get next to you
I said I'm gonna get close to you
You wouldn't want me have to hurt you too, hurt you too?

I know you want what's on my mind
I know you like what's on my mind
I know it eats you up inside
I know, you know, you know, you know

Here I come, I come, I come, I come
I am, I am, I am
I said I'm gonna get close to you
I said I wanna get next to you
You wouldn't want me have to hurt you too, hurt you too?

I know you want what's on my mind
I know you like what's on my mind
I know it eats you up inside
I know, you know, you know, you know

I know you want what's on my mind
I know you like what's on my mind
I know it eats you up inside
I know, you know, you know, you know

Here I come, I come, I come, I come
Here I come, I come, I come, I come
Here I come, I come, I come, I come
Here I come, I come, I come, I come
Here I come, I come, I come, I come, I come, I come, I come, I come, I come
