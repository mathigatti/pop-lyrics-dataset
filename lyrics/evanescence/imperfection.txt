The more you try to fight it
The more you try to hide it
The more infected, rejected, you feel alone inside it
You know you can't deny it
The world's a little more fucked up everyday


I'm gonna save you from it
Together we'll outrun it
Just don't give into the fear
So many things I would've told you if I knew
That I was never gonna see you again

I wanna lift you up into the light that you deserve
I wanna take your pain into myself so you won't hurt

Don't you dare surrender
Don't leave me here without you
'Cause I could never
Replace your perfect imperfection

The way you look us over
Your counterfeit composure
Pushing again and again and sinking lower and lower
The world is on your shoulders
Do you really know the weight of the words you say?

You want a little of it
You just can't let go of it
You've got an ego to feed
Too late to rise above it
Don't look now but the little girl's got a grenade

I'm gonna lift you up into the light that you deserve
Gonna take you down to the real world so you can watch it burn

Don't you dare surrender
Don't leave me here without you
'Cause I could never
Replace your perfect imperfection

We stand undefined
Can't be drawn with a straight line
This will not be our ending
We are alive, we are alive

Don't you dare surrender
Don't leave me here without you
'Cause I could never
Replace your perfect imperfection

Don't you dare surrender
I'm still right beside you
And I could never
Replace your perfect imperfection
