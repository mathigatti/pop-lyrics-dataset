Way down
I've been way down
Underneath this skin
Waiting to hear my name again


I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me
I adore you still
But I hear them calling
And nothing can hold me

Way down
All the way down
I will hear your voice
But I'll no longer understand

I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me
I adore you still
But I hear them calling

I was looking to the sky
When I knew I'd be swimming home
I cannot betray my kind
They are here
It's my time

I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me
I adore you still
But I hear them calling
And nothing can hold me
