I can feel you calling me
I can see the cracks between these walls
But this pain
I choke on the words
As they rise in me
To survive, I lock down


I can feel you calling me
I can taste the poison in your heart
But these dreams
Blurring the line between war and peace
To survive, I lock down

Say the words
I can't face the world
If I could say the words
Everything would be broken still
We are broken

I can feel you calling me
I can see the cracks between these walls
But this pain
I choke on the words
As they rise in me
To survive, I lock down

Say the words
I can't face the world
If I could say the words
Everything would be broken still
And I know why
Lock down, lock down, lock down
