I still remember the world
From the eyes of a child
Slowly those feelings
Were clouded by what I know now


Where has my heart gone?
An uneven trade for the real world
Oh I, I want to go back
To believing in everything
And knowing nothing at all

I still remember the sun
Always warm on my back
Somehow it seems colder now

Where has my heart gone?
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger
Oh I, I want to go back
To believing in everything

Iesu, Rex admirabilis
Et triumphator nobilis
Dulcedo ineffabilis
Totus desiderabilis

"As the days pass by, before my face, as wars rage before me, finding myself, in these last days of existence, of this poor country, this parasite inside me, I forced it out. In the darkness of the storm lies an evil, but it's me"

Where has my heart gone?
An uneven trade for the real world
Oh I, I want to go back
To believing in everything

Oh, where
Where has my heart gone?
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger
Oh I, I want to go back
To believing in everything

I still remember
