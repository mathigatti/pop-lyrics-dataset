She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box
For weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black


Hey, wait, I got a new complaint,
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint,
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

Meat eating orchids forgive no- one just yet,
Cut myself on angel hair and babies breath,
Broken hymen of your highness I'm left black,
Throw down your umbilical noose so i can climb right
Back

Hey, wait, I got a new complaint,
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint,
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice
Your advice
Your advice.
