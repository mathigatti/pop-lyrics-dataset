Speak your mind
Like I care
I can see your lips moving
I've just learned not to hear
Don't waste your time


It's never enough for you, baby
Don't wanna play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain until I'm made of stone

Take your time
I'm not scared
Make me everything you need me to be
So the judgement seems fair
Don't waste your time

It's never enough for you, baby
Don't wanna play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain until I'm made

To tear out my heart
For the way that it feels
I will still remember
When you've long forgotten me

It's never enough for you, baby
Don't wanna play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain until I'm made of stone

It's never enough (I'm not gonna play)
It's never enough (your game)
It's never enough
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone
Numb the pain till I am made of stone
