Don't want to be the one to walk away
But I can't bear the thought of one more day
I think I finally understand what it means to be lost


Can't find the road to lead us out of this
A million miles from where we burned the bridge
Can't keep pretending everything's gonna be alright

With the whole world falling around me

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
In the end
You never can wash the blood from your hands

Fallen so far from where we were before
You'll never find what you've been searching for
Something to fill the void and make up for all
Of those missing pieces of you

Like I could only dream to do

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie

Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

And we never learn
So we fall down again
Heaven help me find a way to dream within this nightmare

Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie

Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands
