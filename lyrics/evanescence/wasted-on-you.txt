I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet below
I'm wasted on you
Waitin' for a miracle
I can't move on
Feels like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth


Love
Don't you remember?
We were the ones
Nothing could ever change us
Now, it's easier not to believe
We've broken everything
But here we are

Numb my head
'Til I can't think anymore
But I still feel the pain

I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet low
I'm wasted on you
Waitin' for a miracle
I can't move on
Feels like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth

Once, this was a garden
This was a world
All of the nightmares stayed in the dark
A little too much time by yourself
And you become the enemy
Just look at us now

Drownin' slowly, just to stay true

I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet below
I'm wasted on you
Waitin' for a miracle
And I can't move on
Feels like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you
Just pass me bitter truth

Will I ever be the same?
Am I strong enough to change?
Is it in my blood?
Shield my eyes to face the day
Come too far to slip away
But it's killing me to go on without you

I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet below
I'm wasted on you (I'm wasted on)
Waitin' for a miracle
I can't move on
Like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you (I'm wasted on you)
Just pass me the bitter truth
