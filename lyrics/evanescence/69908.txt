I've been looking in a mirror for so long
That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side
All the little pieces falling, shattered
Shards of me, too sharp to put back together
Too small to matter
But big enough to cut me into
So many little pieces
If I try to touch her


And I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no more

Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child
Lie to me, convince me that I've been sick forever
And all of this will make sense when I get better
But I know the difference
Between myself and my reflection
And I just can't help but to wonder
Which of us do you love

So I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no
Bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe
I breathe
I breathe no more
