Can you forgive me again?
I don't know what I said
But I didn't mean to hurt you


I heard the words come out
I felt that I would die
It hurts so much to hurt you

Then you look at me
You're not shouting anymore
You're silently broken

I'd give anything now
To kill those words for you
Each time I say something I regret
I cry, I don't wanna lose you
But somehow I know
That you will never leave me, yeah

'Cause you were made for me
Somehow I'll make you see
How happy you make me

I can't live this life
Without you by my side
I need you to survive

So stay with me
You look in my eyes
And I'm screaming inside
That I'm sorry

And you forgive me again
You're my one true friend
And I never meant to hurt you
