It's taking you too long to decide
And I don't want to be the one, the one
Crying over wasted time
If you think you're strong enough to let me in
Then come on, stand up and be honest, be honest


I'm tired of feeling so alone
Cause you won't let me understand (let me understand)
I don't wanna pretend
I wanna feel
I want to live

Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real? Is this real?

Whenever you're around I can't fight it
You get under my skin in a way that I like it
And I can't take anymore
Tell me what you want from me
Or leave me alone
Cause I'm all caught up
And I'm losing control

I'm tired of holding on so tight
And you won't let me understand (let me understand)
Now I'm falling apart
I never meant to lose myself

Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real? Is this real?

Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real? Is this real?

Like drops of rain against my heart
Cut through like silver
And I want to make you feel that way
And I want to make you feel the way that I do

Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real? Is this real?
