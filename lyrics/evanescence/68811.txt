Give me a reason
To believe that you're gone
I see your shadow
So I know they're all wrong


Moonlight on the soft brown earth
It leads me to where you lay
They took you away from me
But now I'm taking you home

I will stay forever here with you, my love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on

Some say I'm crazy for my love, my love
But no bonds can hold me from your side, my love
They don't know you can't leave me
They don't hear you singing to me

I will stay forever here with you, my love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on
And I can't love you, anymore than I do love

I will stay forever here with you, my love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on
And I can't love you anymore than I do

People die, but real love is forever
