I'd give anything to give me to you
Can you forget the world
That you thought you knew?
If you want me
Come and find me (I'm here for you)
Nothing's stopping you
So please, release me


I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe
Close your eyes
I'll be anything for you

Nothing left to make me feel anymore
There's only you and everyday I need more
If you want me
Come and find me
I'll do anything you say
Just tell me

I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe
Close your eyes
I'll be anything for you

Anything for you

I'll become your earth and sky
Forever, never die
I'll be everything you need

I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe
Close your eyes
I'll be anything for you

I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe
Close your eyes
I'll be anything for you
