Thought that I was strong
I know the words I need to say
Frozen in my place
I let the moment slip away


I've been screaming
On the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you heal me?
(Ah, ah, ah)

Say it's over
Yes, it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough

Never meant to lie
But I'm not the girl you think you know
The more that I am with you
The more that I am all alone

I've been screaming
On the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you heal me?
(Ah, ah, ah)

Say it's over
Yes, it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough

Not that I'm so different
Not that I don't see
The dying light of what we used to be
But how can I forgive you?
You changed!
And I'm lying by your side
I'm about to lose my mind

'Cause I've been screaming
On the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you heal me?
(Ah, ah, ah)

You've been dreaming
If you're thinking
That I still belong to you
And I've been dying
'Cause I'm lying to myself!
(Ah, ah, ah)

Say it's over
Yes, it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough
