How can I pretend that I don't see
What you hide so carelessly?
I saw her bleed
You heard me breathe
And I froze inside myself
And turned away


I must be dreaming

We all live
And we all die
But that does not begin to justify you

It's not what it seems
Not what you think
No, I must be dreaming
It's only in my mind
Not real life
No, I must be dreaming

Help
You know I've got to tell someone
Tell them what I know you've done
I fear you
But spoken fears can come true

We all live
And we all die
But that does not begin to justify you

It's not what it seems
Not what you think
No, I must be dreaming
It's only in my mind
Not real life
No, I must be dreaming

We all live
And we all die
But that does not begin to justify you

It's not what it seems
Not what you think
No, I must be dreaming
It's only in my mind
Not real life
No, I must be dreaming

Not what it seems
Not what you think
I must be dreaming
Just in my mind
Not in real life
I must be dreaming
