I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted one time to see you laughing
I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you bathing in the purple rain


I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
Baby I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you underneath the purple rain

Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out for something new, that means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you into the purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you, only want to see you
In the purple rain
