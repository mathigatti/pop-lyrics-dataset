I found a grave
Brushed off the face
Felt your light
And I remember why I know this place
I found a bird
Closing her eyes one last time
And I wonder if she dreamed like me


As much as it hurts, ain't it wonderful to feel?
So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

I'm not afraid
I push through the pain
And I'm on fire
I remember how to breathe again

As much as it hurts, ain't it wonderful to feel?
So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

Why must we fall apart
To understand how to fly
I will find a way
Even without wings

Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream
Follow your heart till it bleeds
And we've gone to the end of the dream
