My black backpack's stuffed with broken dreams
Twenty bucks should get me through the week
Never said a word of discontentment
I thought it a thousand times but now
I'm leaving home


Here in the shadows, I'm safe, I'm free
I've nowhere else to go but
I cannot stay where I don't belong

Two months pass by and it's getting cold
I know I'm not lost, I am just alone
But I won't cry, I won't give up
I can't go back now
Waking up is knowing who you really are

Here in the shadows, I'm safe, I'm free
I've nowhere else to go but
I cannot stay where I don't belong

In the shadows, I'm safe, I'm free
I've nowhere else to go but
I cannot stay here

Show me the shadow
Where true meaning lies
So much more is made in empty eyes
