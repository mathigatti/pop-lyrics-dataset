Never thought that I'd be leaving you today
So alone and wondering
Why I feel this way


So wide the world
Can love remember how
To get me home to you someday?

We'll be together again
All just a dream in the end
We'll be together again

So many fears were swimming
Around and around in my mind
Who would have dreamed
The secrets we would find?

I've found a world
Where love and dreams
And darkness all collide
Maybe this time
We can leave our broken world behind

We'll be together again
All just a dream in the end
