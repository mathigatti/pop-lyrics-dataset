Hallelujah to Jesus who died on the tree
To raise up his ladder of mercy for me
Press onward climb upward, the top is in view
There's a crown of bright glory awaitin' for you


As Jacob was travelin' was weary one day
One night on a stone for a pillow did lay
A vision appeared of a ladder so high
It stood on the earth while the top reached the sky

Hallelujah to Jesus who died on the tree
To raise up his ladder of mercy for me
Press onward climb upward, the top is in view
There's a crown of bright glory awaitin' for you

This ladder was tall and yet so well made
Stood thousands of years and never decayed
High winds from the heavens they reel and they rock
But the angels they guard it from bottom to top
