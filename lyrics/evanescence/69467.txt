You hold the answers deep within your own mind
Consciously, you've forgotten them
That's the way the human mind works
Whenever something is too unpleasant
Or too shameful for us to entertain
We reject it
We erease it from our memory
But the imprint is aways there


The pain that grips you
The fear that blinds you
Releases life in me

In our mutual shame
We hide our eyes
To blind them from the truth
That finds a way from who we are

Please, don't be afraid
When the darkness fades away
The dawn will break the silence
Screaming in our hearts

My love for you still grows
This I do for you
For I've tried to fight the truth
My final time

We're supposed to try to be real
And when you feel alone
You're not together
And that is real

Can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away
Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away

Lying beside you
Listening to you breathe
The life that flows inside of you
Burns inside of me

Hold and speak to me
Of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this
And I will die for you

Cast me not away
Say you'll be with me
For I know I cannot
Bear it all alone

You're not alone, honey, never, never

Can't fight it all away
Can't hope it all away
Can't scream it all away
It just won't fade away

Oh, can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away, yeah

Can't cry it all away
Can't hope it all away
Can't scream it all away
Oh, it all away
Oh, it all away, yeah, yeah

But the imprint is always there
Nothing is ever really forgotten

God, just don't hate me
Because I'll die if you do

Because I'll die if you do
Because I'll die if you do
Because I'll die if you do
Because I'll die if you do
