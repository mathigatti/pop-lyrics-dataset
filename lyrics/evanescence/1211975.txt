Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Everytime I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me... From me
Life's gotta always be messing with me. (you wanna see
The light?)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (so do I)
Can't I take away all this pain. (you wanna see the
Light?)
I try to every night
All in vain... In vain.


Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me.
You and I were meant to be.
A cheap fuck for me to lay.
Something takes a part of me.
Feeling like a freak on a leash. (you wanna see the
Light?)
Feeling like I have no release. (so do I...)
How many times have I felt diseased? (you wanna see
The light?)
Nothing in my life is free... Is free.

Sometimes I cannot take this place.
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste.
Sometimes I cannot feel my face.
You'll never see me fall from grace.
Something takes a part of me.
You and I were meant to be.
A cheap fuck for me to lay.
Something takes a part of me.

Go!
Something takes a part of me.
You and I were meant to be.
A cheap fuck for me to lay.
Something takes a part of me.
