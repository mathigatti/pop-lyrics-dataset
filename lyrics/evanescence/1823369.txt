Bind my limbs with fear (with fear)
choke me with tears (tears)
wont die for you
You've (you've) been here before (before)
and come back for more (more)
not this time


You will never be strong enough
you will never be good enough
you were never concieved in love
you will not rise above

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you
I should have known all along it was all a lie
(should have known it was all a lie)

Now, (now) I know the truth (truth)
I'm through fearing you (you)
I am free

You will never be strong enough
you will never be good enough
you were never concieved in love
you will not rise above

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you
I should have known all along it was all a lie
(I should have known it was all a lie)

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you
I should have known all along it was all a lie

Somebody tell me what made us all believe you (I should have known it was all a lie)
should have known it was all a lie

I should have known it was all a lie.
