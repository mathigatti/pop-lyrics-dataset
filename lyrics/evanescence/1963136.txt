It’s too late to change your mind
Even though this fragile world
Is tearing apart at the seams


I can’t wash these sins away
This sinking feeling everyday
I’m waking up in someone else’s life

Is it so hard for you?
‘Cause it’s so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
‘Cause I cannot erase this lie

Not gonna let this day go by
I’m gonna save this wasted life
And nothing can stand in my way
Not enough to say goodbye
Burn it till there’s nothing left
I'm drowning in the mess that I have made

Is it so hard for you?
‘Cause it’s so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
‘Cause I cannot erase this dark in me

The water’s rising around us
There is no other way down
I only have myself to blame for it all

Is it so hard for you?
‘Cause it’s so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
If I could just erase my mind
But I cannot erase this lie
