I tried to kill the pain
But only brought more
(So much more)
I lay dying and I'm pouring
Crimson regret and betrayal


I'm dying, praying, bleeding and screaming
Am I too lost to be saved?
Am I too lost?

My God, my tourniquet
Return to me, salvation
My god, my tourniquet
Return to me, salvation

Do you remember me?
Lost for so long
Will you be on the other side
Or will you forget me?

I'm dying, praying, bleeding and screaming
Am I too lost to be saved?
Am I too lost?

My god, my tourniquet
Return to me, salvation
My God, my tourniquet
Return to me, salvation

(I want to die)

My god, my tourniquet
Return to me, salvation
My God, my tourniquet
Return to me, salvation

My wounds cry for the grave
My soul cries for deliverance
Will I be denied?
Christ, tourniquet
My suicide
