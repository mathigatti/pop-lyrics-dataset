I've spent so much time
Throwing rocks at your window
That I never even knocked on the front door


I walk by statues never even made one chip
But if I could leave a mark
On the monument of the heart
I just might lay myself down
For a little more than I had

The last day
The last day
The last day

Wait a time to spare these lies
We tell ourselves
These days have come and gone
But this time is sweeter than honey
