Oh, for where had been my dreams?
Prisoners in the gates of a cold place
For where it was my smile?
Prisoner in tomb concrete
Everything what I have now is solitude,
Seated in I sing it darker of the room
Bleeding and screamig out on the inside
My broken pieces spread of the soil
And nobody to join, oh
Never I thought that would feel as much pain
Bleeding and screaming out on the inside
And why nobody hears?
I go close the eyes now
And when to open I want everything as was before
I want seated you in my bed
Saying good night it sleeps well
And when I to bleeding you will hug me
And it will place me in its cool?
Oh, it is so safe here
And when I to feel cold you will cover me
With the more aconchegante blanket,
And if I to bleed you say me
That always will be here to my side
Please, I need this for to live, for to breathe
And when I to beg for to be free
Does not leave
Forces me with here with you
And after yor good night
When I to close the eyes
Please, does not disappear of new
Please...
