Out on your own
Cold and alone again
Can this be what you really wanted, baby?


(Lacrymosa)
Blame it on me
(Dies illa)
And set your guilt free
(Lacrymosa)
Nothing can hold you back now

Now that you're gone
Feel like myself again
Grieving the things I can't repair
And willing

(Lacrymosa)
To let you blame it on me
(Dies illa)
And set your guilt free
(Lacrymosa)
I don't wanna hold you back now, love

I can't change who I am

Not this time, I won't lie
To keep you near me
And in this short life, there's no time
To waste on giving up
My love wasn't enough

(Lacrymosa)
And you can blame it on me
(Dies illa)
Just set your guilt free
(Lacrymosa)
I don't wanna hold you back now, love
