Perfect by nature
Icons of self indulgence
Just what we all need
More lies about a world that


Never was and never will be
Have you no shame?
Don't you see me?
You know you've got everybody fool

Look, here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder
Oh, how we love you
No flaws when you're pretending
But now I know she

Never was and never will be
You don't know how you've betrayed me
And somehow, you've got everybody fool

Without the mask
Where will you hide?
Can't find yourself, lost in your lie

I know the truth now
I know who you are
And I don't love you anymore

Never was and never will be
You don't know how you've betrayed me
And somehow, you've got everybody fool

It never was and never will be
You're not real then you can't save me
Somehow, now you're everybody's fool
