Where's the light?
Killed my day
Lost in the dark of your ways
Wasting my energy, endlessly
On your sweet lie


And if you don't mind
I would like to live the lie that I will survive
And if you don't mind
I would love to slip away and leave your world behind

Insecure, I'm not so sure
That you're not just faking something
Wasting our last day
I can't take the pain

And if you don't mind
I would like to live the lie that I will survive
And if you don't mind
I would love to slip away and leave it all behind

And if you don't mind
I would like to live the lie that I will survive
And if you don't mind
If you don't mind
