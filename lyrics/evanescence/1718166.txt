Never been a fan of the light
Embracing darkness helped me feel alive
Drawing constellations in the sky
Worlds of perfect love within your eyes


I'll wait forever for your love
Make believe that we're the only ones
Holding on to whispers of your love
All we are is a dream beyond the dawn

Open my eyes, teach me to cry
Open up my heart, and I'll learn to fly
I won't regret what love gives me now
I know someday that I will learn how to

Wait forever for your love
Make believe that we're the only ones
I'm holding on to whispers of your love
All we are is a dream beyond the dawn

Steal my heart and throw away the key
Deep inside your love is where I'll be

I'll wait forever for your love
Make believe that we're the only ones
I'm holding on to whispers of your love
All we are is a dream beyond the dawn
So I'll wait forever for your love
Make believe that we're the only ones
I'm holding on to whispers of your love
All we are is a dream beyond the dawn
All we are is a dream beyond the dawn
All we are is a dream
Beyond the dawn
