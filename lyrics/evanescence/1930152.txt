I've been believing
In something so distant
As if I was human
And I've been denying
This feeling of hopelessness
In me, in me


All the promises I made just to let you down
You believed in me but I'm broken

I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

As much as I'd like
The past not to exist
It still does
And as much as I'd like
To feel like I belong here
I'm just as scared as you

I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

Run away, run away
One day we won't feel this pain anymore
Take it all away shadows of you
'Cause they won't let me go

Till I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise
Alone and lost in paradise
