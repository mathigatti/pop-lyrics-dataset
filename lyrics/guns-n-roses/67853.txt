I know you've been dreaming 'bout the times in our live
But I've been screaming in my bed late at night
A space a little, little and your stack of pain
Makes it grip that skull, to me child that you'll stay
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay


Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday
Oh yaaa, Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday, Oh yaaa

There's too many games in a day for a simple man to face
That desperate moment in your life where you can't be afraid
Don't thing your second change will break around the bend
'Con hearts don't always share love, or the person on the otherend

You're been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay ya

Just another sunday
Just another sunda,oh baby
It's only one more sunday
Just another sunday



Those are tickets for the same plane, bring it back to me
'Cos felling the same pain makes half the luxury
Take a walk away won't end the carousel
But if walking away can bring you back, then I wish you well
You're been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I?m begging you to stay.
