What can I say
Free will is blind today
The choice that you made
Is not a road that I would take
To use and betray
Simple as the power play
Not far away
With tears that go unexplained now


Oh, my love, can it be?
I’m falling from your grace with me now
Oh, more than ever
I still remember

They’re saying
It’s just a passing phase
No more like a game
Problems of the human race
Goes right to your brain
Caught down in a hidden place
With no sense of shame
The secrets are there and you can’t

Oh, my love, can it be?
I’m falling from your grace with me
Now more than ever
I still remember your name
When do you think you can tell me?
How long do you think I can wait? Oh no I said
I thought I never said I was sorry
Now dont you fall on your face now with livin with it
The storm is comin ‘again
I sense the shiverin’ down

You thought you had it, ah
But thought you had it figured it out
But you do not even care
How could it be?
You’re fallingin ‘from your grace with me

And now, my love
I ask
I ask myself what I believe in
‘Cause now
More than ever
I still remember
Your name
