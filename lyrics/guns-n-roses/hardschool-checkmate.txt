All cautions made
Every chance was given
No effort spared
To save what we had
All in good faith
I would not hesitate
To extend myself
And lend you a hand


But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school
And you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway

As tempers fade
And lies forgiven
No God's embrace
Could break what we had
And in it's place
A storm had lifted
I would've thought you could've been more of a man

But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school
And you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway

Too hard school
And you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
