Only Woman Bleed
Man's got his woman to take his seed
He's got the power-oh
She's got the need
She spends ger life through
pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can
She cries alone at night too aften
he smokes and drinks and don't come home at all


Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed

Man makes your hair gray
He's your life's mistake
All you're really lookin' for is an even break
He lies right at you
You know you hate this game
He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain
She cries alone at night too aften
he smokes and drinks and don't come at all

Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed

Black eyes all of the time
Don't spend a dime
Clean up this grime
And you there down on your knees begging me please come
Watch me bleed.

Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed
Only woman bleed
