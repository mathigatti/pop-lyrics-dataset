I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her


I had to put her
Six feet under
And I can still hear her complain

I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her

I knew I'd miss her
So I had to keep her
She's buried right in my backyard

I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her

She bitched so much
She drove me nuts
And now we're happier this way

Oh, oh yeah
Take it for what it is

I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her

I had to put her
Six feet under
And I can still hear her complain
