It's a critical solution
And the east coast got the blues
It's a mass of confusion
Like the lies they sell to you


You got a glass jawed toothache of a mental disease
An they be runnin' round back see 'em line up on their knees
'Cause the kiss ass sycophants throwin' penance at your feet
When they got nowhere to go, watch 'em come in off the streets

While they're bangin' out front inside their slammin' to the cruch
Go on an throw me to the lions and the whole damn screamin' bunch
'Cause the pissed-off rip-offs r everywhere you turn
Tell me how a generation's ever s'posed to learn

This fire is burnin' and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop it's rock n' roll

I read it on a wall it went straight to my head
It said: Dance to the tension of a world on edge
We got racial violence
And who'll cast the first stone
And sex is used anyway it can be

Sometimes when I look out
It's hard to see the day
It's a feelin' you can have it
It's not mine to take away

Lost in the garden of Eden
Yeah we're lost in the garden of Eden
And there's no one's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the garden of Eden

This fire is burnin' and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop it's rock n' roll

Suck on that

Looking through this point of view
There's no way I'm gonna fit in
Don't ya tell me what my eyes see
Don't ya tell me who to believe in

I ain't superstitious
But I know when somethin's wrong
I've been draggin' my heels with a bitch called hope
Let the undercurrent drag me along

Lost in the garden of Eden
Yeah we're lost in the garden of Eden
And there's no one's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the garden of Eden

Most organized religions make a mockery of humanity
Our governments are dangerous and out of control
The garden of Eden is just another graveyard
Said if they had someone to buy it said I'm sure they'd sell my soul

This fire is burnin' and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop it's rock n' roll

Lost in the garden of Eden
(An we ain't talkin' about no poison apple or some missin' rib ya hear)
Yeah we're lost in the garden of Eden
Said there's no one's gonna believe this
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden

This fire is burnin' and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop it's rock n' roll
