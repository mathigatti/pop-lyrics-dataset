You like to hurt me
You know that you do
You like to think
In some way
That it's me
And not you
(But we know that ins't true)


You like to have me
Jump an be good
But I
Don't want to do it

You don't know why
I won't act the way
You think I should

You thought they'd make me
Behave an submit (submit)

What were you thinking
Cause I don't forget

You don't know why
I won't give in
To hell with the pressure
I'm not cavin' in

You know that I
Got under your skin
You sold your soul
But I won't let you win

You talk too much
You say I do

Difference is nobody cares about you

You've got all the answers
You know everything
Why nobody asked you
'S a mystery to me

I'm sorry for you
Not sorry for me
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe

I'm sorry for you
Not sorry for me
You don't know who you can trust now
Or you should believe
You should believe
You don't know who you can trust now
Or you should believe

You close your eyes
All well an good
I'll kick your ass
Like I said that I would

You tell them stories they'd rather believe
Use an confuse them
They're numb and na√Øve

Truth is the truth hurts
Don't you agree

It's harder to live
With the truth about you
Than to live with
The lies about me

Nobody owes you
Not one goddamn thing
You know where to put your
Just shut up and sing

I'm sorry for you
Not sorry for me
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe
I'm sorry for you
Not sorry for me
You chose to hurt those that love you
An won't set them free
Won't set them free
You chose to hurt those that love you
An won't set them free

You don't need
Anyone else to be
Sorry for you
You've got no heart
You can't see
All that you've done for me
I know the reasons
You tear me apart
