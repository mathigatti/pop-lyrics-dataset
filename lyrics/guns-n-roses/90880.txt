I met a gin-soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind


It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorc√©e in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me with roses
But I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
Mr. Ronnie Wood!

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues oh
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

It's the honky tonk women yeah
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

?????????????????????????
?????????????????????????

Yeah!
Whoo hoo!
