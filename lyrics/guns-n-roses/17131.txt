I get up around seven
Get outta bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothin' no
Because worryin' is a waste of my time


Show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine

We've been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
No, no, no
He won't leave me alone

I used to do a little, but a little wouldn't do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before

I used to do a little, but a little wouldn't do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before

We've been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
No, no, no...
He won't leave me alone

Now I get up around whenever
I used to get up on time
But that old man, he's a real motherfucker
I Gonna kick him on down the line

I used to do a little, but a little wouldn't do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before

I used to do a little, but a little wouldn't do
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before

We've been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
No, no, no
He won't leave me alone

(Won't leave me alone)

Shoved it in the bindle and I shot it in the middle and it
It drove outta my mind
I should've known better, said I wish I never met her said I
I leave it all behind

Yowsa!
