It's been a year, most of the day
Got a picture, a postcard from you far away
There's something I could do
Something I could say


Like a good battle
You cherish the final drop
Everything we had
Everything for now

And I want a cigarette
How long till I forget
How long till I forget
I haven't forgotten you yet?
Still feel the regret
How long till I forget

All the which meet smashed to the ground
All the lost wich meet the dimension of the sound

I'm feeling like I'm lost, never to be found
And I want a cigarette
How long till I forget
How long till I forget
I haven't forgotten you yet
Still feel the regret.
How long till I forget?

Does it have to have someone to name
Does it have to let you forget?
Does it happen,when you try to sleep in that
Does it happen,when you try to forget
And I want one last cigarette
I haven't forgotten you yet?
I still feel the regret.
