Time has passed.
We're getting older.
You know that it's true.
Lose the pain.
I know you got to.
I know you do.
Go a phone call.
It went like this,,,
"You wanna be in the band?"
"I want to."
"You wanna star in the show?"
"You know that I want to."
I gotta let you know. Oh no.
Come on steve, dust of those drums.
I got shot with you velvet revolver.
It broke me in two.
I'm not dead.
I've got some life left.
Don't bury me too soon.
"Remember getting to high?"
"I want to."
Remember getting to low?"
"Don't you know that I want to."
I couldn't let you go. Oh no.
Izzy.
"I'm real sorry that I ruined, ruined the show" yeowza
