Ohhhhh
Why should I try and judge the things they say
They just won't budge I'm letting go
Ohhhhhhh
And, shelter from the blind, storm
You managed to be kind
But still enough to show me how to keep it together


When I'm crying out in vain
No matter who's to blame
There's still a ways to go
Ooohhh
So if you ask me to believe your heart will follow you
It's got a mind of its own

When it sits wrong and the road gets rough
And you're the one
Whose shoulders just ain't wide enough
Whose shoulders shrug when they've had enough

I'll be the last to say, don't follow your heart
There's more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you know
What you've shown
And that we know you understand

Ohhhh
Another thing, if I were you
I would say all that I do to be half as strong
Or still belong
Ohhhhh
You should take the time to look back at all your misadventures

When it sits wrong and the road gets rough
And you're the one
Whose shoulders just ain't wide enough
Whose shoulders shrug when they've had enough

I'd be the last to say, don't follow your heart
But there's more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you've known
What you've shown
That's what I hope you understand

I never said, don't follow your heart
That's what it takes to be a man
From what you know
All that you've been shown
Even now I hope you understand

I'd be the last to say, don't follow your heart
But there's more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you know
What you've shown
And what we know you understand

I never said, don't follow your heart
That's what it takes to be a man
More than you know
All that you've been shown
Even now I hope you understand
