The music's too loud,
it just beats, beats, beats,
on my head.


You've got to turn it down,
it just beats, beats, beats.
It's going up and you're going out

Bitch you'd better shut your mouth
or we're gonna burn down your home
You can't stop the music we're lovin',
we'll kick your ass and put your dog in the oven

¨Wesley Gunner¨
