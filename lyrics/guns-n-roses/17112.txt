It's not as you're thinking
Or as you've imagined
To live in the shade of
Beliefs that were fashioned,
To leave you in slavery and
Drain out your soul,
But what can I do when there's so many liars,
That crawl through your veins
Like millions of spiders,
That seek out their victims,
And ruins the wiser,
Watch out!
Gotcha!


Oh my god
I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
Like nobody wanted to know

So give it away
Like they're not gonna fuck you
How long can you bend
To come back and haunt you
To burn past your feelings
That cause you to suffer
You're starting to bleed
They don't discover
Before its too late
What will you offer
In way of healing
I'm so confused, abused, misused

Oh my god
I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
Cause nobody wanted to know

Ooh, if it opens your eyes
This is better than a strong compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
This is better than the last compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shadows
If only you had let me know

And they wont give in
Cause they know what they're after
A kick in the face
Like its all that would matter

Oh my god
I can't deny this
I've been taught just to murder and fight this
To bury it deeper where no one can find it
Cuz nobody wanted know

Ooh, if it opens your eyes
This is better than a good compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know

Ooh, well it's on with the show
Like the tides out on the ocean
The waves already set in motion
The only one in the game whose lost is you
