I tried so hard
Just to get through to you
But your head's so far
From the realness of truth


Was it just a come on in the dark
Wasn't meant to last long
I think you've worn your welcome honey
I'll just see you along
As I sing you this song

Time can pass slowly
Things always change
Your day's been numbered
And I've read your last page

You was just a temporary lover
Honey you ain't the first
Lots of others came before you woman
Said but you been the worst
Sa' you been the worst

So goodbye to you girl
So long, farewell
I can't hear you cryin'
Your jivin's been hell
So look for me walkin'
Down your street at night
I'll be in with another
Deep down inside

(Deep down inside)
