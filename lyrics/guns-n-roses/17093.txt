Talk to me softly
There's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow
And, please, don't cry


I know how you feel inside
I've been there before
Something is changing inside you
And don't you know

Don't you cry tonight
I still love you, baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

Give me a whisper
And give me a sign
Give me a kiss before
You tell me goodbye

Don't you take it so hard now
And, please, don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you
And the times we had, baby

Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

And, please, remember
That I never lied
And, please, remember
How I felt inside now, honey

You gotta make it your own way
But you'll be alright now, sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow
Come the morning light now, baby

Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby

Don't you cry, don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
Baby, maybe someday
Don't you cry, don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
