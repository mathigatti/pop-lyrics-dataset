You better change your attitude
Cause you know you want it to
You bring me all your food
But I know you want it too
I can feed your body, yeah
If you feed my head as well
And I won't give you empty promises
Or quarters in the wishing well


But this ain't no sentimental movie
Where dreams collect like dust
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes
So now, who can you trust?

You think you look so cool
Yes, you do
To take me for your fool, yeah, yeah
It's a folly of the mind (heart)
But I want you inside, but don't should be too (true), yeah
I can see through ya, yeah
You put my head into a wal, yeah
You take my heart to the dockside, yeah
You put me in the car
And take me for another ride

But this ain't no sentimental movie
Where dreams collect like dust
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes
So now, who can you trust?
Trust
Trust

But I grab onto your reins
And I kick on the (a) horse a new pain, yeah
The tears you cried
All the tears you cried tonight
Yeah
You put me down
But you can't get it out of sight

This ain't no sentimental movie
You push it on
You grab it on
But it don't seems too late
This ain't no sentimental movie
Yeah, see the screen
You start to scream
Abusin' confusin'
Your blood runs over

This ain't no sentimental movie
Yeah, you look so cool
Don't take me for another one of yours
This ain't no sentimental movie
This ain't no sentimental movie
The tears you cried
All the tears you cried tonight
Yeah
This ain't no sentimental movie
This ain't no sentimental movie
This ain't no sentimental movie
Yeah
