Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
That love happens as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
So sail away sweet sister
'cause I'll always be in love with you


But if you love somebody else, sweetheart
I do not want know about of you
'cause you see many others, you know what I mean
That's why I gotta live without you

I'm in love with a girl, I'm talking about
I'm in love with a girl that I cant live without
I'm in love, but it seems that
I'm livin' without
I'm in love, but the worst season to be
Is that one to be in love
