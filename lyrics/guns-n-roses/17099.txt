When you were young and your heart was an open book
You used to say: Live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry


Say: Live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya?
When ya got a job to do
Ya got to do it well
You got to give the other fella a hell

You used to say: Live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry

Say: Live and let die
Live and let die
