Bought me a box of french cigars
Bought me a black beret
Get my french from a girl next door
Teaching me night and day
Got me thinking 'bout the south of France
Vis-a-vis vous
Pack my suitcase, take a chance
Got nothing to lose


Gimme the sound of the rolling dice
Gimme a whiskey, don't think twice
Deal me the card that takes my blues away
Take me away to Marseilles

Fast train, jet plane, money to burn
Don't ask no reasons why
Drinkin' champagne, playin' cool
Don't even have to try

Gimme the sound of the rolling dice
Gimme a whiskey, don't think twice
Deal me the card that takes my blues away
Take me away to Marseilles
