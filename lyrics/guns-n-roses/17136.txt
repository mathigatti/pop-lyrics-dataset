I've been looking for a trace
Looking for a heart
Looking for a lover
In a world that's much too dark


You don't want my love
You want satisfaction, oh yeah
You don't need my love
You gotta find yourself another piece of the action, yeah

Say where you going?
What you gonna do?
I been looking everywhere
I been looking for you

You don't want my love
You want satisfaction, I got you satisfaction
You don't need my love
You gotta find yourself another piece of the action

'Cause you're crazy, crazy
You're fucking crazy, oh my
You know you're crazy, oh child
I said, you're crazy

Say, boy, where you coming from?
Where'd ya get that point of view?
When I was younger
Said, I knew someone like you

And they said, you don't want my love
You want satisfaction
You don't need my love
You gotta find yourself another piece of the action

'Cause you're crazy, crazy
You're fucking crazy, oh my
You know you're crazy, oh child
I said, you're crazy

Oh, you're crazy, you know you're crazy
Well, you're crazy, you know you're crazy
You know you are bring it down
You're fucking crazy
