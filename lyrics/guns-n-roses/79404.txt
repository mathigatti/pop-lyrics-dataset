It doesn't pay to try,
All the smart boys know why,
It doesn't mean, I didn't try,
I just never know, why.
It's isn't 'cause I'm all alone
Oh, baby, you're not home.
And when I'm home
Big deal, I'm still alone.
It's so restless, I am,
Beat my head against a pole
Try to knock some sense, down 'side my bones.
And even though it don't show,
Those guys are so old.
Can't put your arms around a memory,
Can't put your arms around a memory,
Can't put your arms around a memory.
Don't try
Don't try
You're just a basket case.
And you got no name.
Could you live with me ?
Go on and say.
And even though it don't show
Those guys are so old.
Can't put your arms around a memory,
Can't put your arms around a memory.
Can't put your arms around a memory.
Don't try
Don't try
"Johnny you're me
Yeah, you're memory
I wanna put my arms around your memory
I can't try.. I can't try, don't try."
