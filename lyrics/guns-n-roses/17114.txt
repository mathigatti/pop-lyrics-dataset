I try and feel the sunshine
You bring the rain
You try and hold me down
With your complaints
You cry and moan and complain
You wine an tear
Up to my neck in sorrow
The touch you bring


You just don't step inside to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say
You know, I've been the beggar
I've played the thief
I was the dog, they all tried to beat

But it's been
14 years of silence
It's been
14 years of pain
It's been
14 years that are gone forever
And I'll never have again, well

Your stupid girlfriends tell you
That I'm to blame
Well they're all used-up has-beens
Out of the game
This time I'll have the last word
Hear what I say
I tried to see it your way
It won't work today

You just don't step inside to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say
You know, I've been the dealer
Hangin' on your street
I was the dog, they all tried to beat

But it's been
14 years of silence
It's been
14 years of pain
It's been
14 years that are gone forever
And I'll never have again, well

Let's get naughtier!

Bullshit and contemplation
Gossip's their trade
If they knew half the real truth
What would they say
Well I'm past the point of concern
It's time to play
These last 4 years of madness
Sure put me straight

Don't get back 14 years
In just one day
So hard to keep my own head
Just go away
You know, just like a hooker, she said
Nothing's for free
Oh I tried to see it your way
I tried to see it your way
