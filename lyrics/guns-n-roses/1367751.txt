Don't you try to stop us now
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now
Cause I just won't let you


Sometimes I feel like
The world is on top of me
Breakin' me down with
An endless monotony

Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing that's stopping me
All things are possible
I am unstoppable

Some may convince you
No one can break through
I'm here to tell you
You're worth
More than they tell you

Don't you try to stop us now
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now
Cause I just won't let you

Sometimes I feel like
My life's a catastrophe
Can't understand why
It seem's like it has to be

Sometimes I feel like
It's all opened up for me
Nothing's impossible
I am inconquerable

No one can make you
Do what they want to
You know you're stronger
Than the lies
That they tell you

Don't you try to stop us now
(I'd give anything to know)
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now
(I would have never made it so far)
Cause I just won't let you

Believe in yourself

Some may convince you
No one can break through
You know you're stronger
Than the lies
That they tell you

Don't you try to stop us now
(I'd give anything to know)
I just refuse
(How you live with yourself)
Don't you try to stop us now
(I would have never made it so far)
Cause I just won't let you
(All by myself)

Believe in yourself
