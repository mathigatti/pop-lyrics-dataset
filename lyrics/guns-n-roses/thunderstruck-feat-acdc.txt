I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (thunder)
I looked round
And I knew there was no turning back (thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought what could I do (thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (thunder)

Sound of the drums
Beatin' in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart
You've been thunderstruck

Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, yeah, Texas
And we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again, please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck

Yeah
Oh, thunderstruck, yeah

Now we're shaking at the knees
Could I come again, please?

Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah

Said: Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
(So fine)

Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa, baby, baby, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck
