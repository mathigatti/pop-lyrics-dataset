I'm a cold heartbreaker, fit ta burn
And I'll rip your heart in two
And I'll leave you lying on the bed
I'll be out the door before ya wake
It's nothing new to you
'Cause I think we've seen that movie too


'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rapping
And your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said you could be mine

Now holidays come and then they go
It's nothing new today
Collect another memory
When I come home late at night
Don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars I'm home again

'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rapping
And your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said you could be mine

You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine

You've gone sketching too many times
Why don't ya give it a rest
Why must you find
Another reason to cry

While you're breaking down my back
I been rackin' out my brain
It don't matter how we make it
'Cause it always ends the same

You can push it for more mileage
But your flaps are wearing thin
And I could sleep on it 'til morning
But this nightmare never ends

Don't forget to call my lawyers
With ridiculous demands
An you can take the pity so far
But it's more than I can stand

'Cause this couchtrip's getting older
Tell me how long has it been
'Cause five years is forever
And you haven't grown up yet

You could be mine, but you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rapping
And your cocaine tongue you get nothing done
I said you could be, you should be

You could be mine
You could be mine (you could be mine)
You could be mine (you could be mine)
You could be mine (you could be mine)
You could be mine (you could be mine)
Yeah!
