Gentlemen, it's time to rock the rock

Turn it up
Make it loud
Get your guitar ready to scream
Heavy drums; Amplifiers
We're a sonic demolition team


You gotta rock the rock
Pound it all around
Rock the rock
With a stone crunching sound
Ooh, rock the rock
Hammer and grind
Rock the rock
It's gravel makin' time

Get in the ring, we'll give you a brawl

We're employed to destroy
We're a rock 'n' roll wrecking ball

You gotta rock the rock
Smash it to bits
Rock the rock
With a heavy metal fist
Rock the rock
Grind it to the bone
Rock the rock
It's a destruction zone

Supersized, pulverized
We're telling no lies
Rock the rock
Annihilate you
Devastate you
Eviscerate you
Rock the rock

Rock the rock
Rock the rock
Rock the rock
Rock the rock, yeah
(Rock the rock) rock the rock
(Rock the rock) rock the rock
Yeah
