Told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find
That it's alright, yes it's alright


Where to go, where to see
It's always been that way and we'll can never be
But it's alright, yes it's alright

Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn
That it's alright, yes it's alright

Don't you know that it's so good for you
You can be making love and i see it all go through
But it's alright, yes it's alright

Told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find
That it's alright, yes it's alright
