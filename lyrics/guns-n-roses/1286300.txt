Seems like forever an a day
If my intentions are misunderstood
Please be kind
I've done all I should
I won't ask of you what I would not do
Oh, I saw the damage in you
My fortunate one
The envy of youth


Why would they tell me to please those that laugh
In my face
When all of the reasons
They've taught us
Fall over themselves to give way

It's not a question whether my heart is true
Streamlined
I had to pull thought
Look for a new beginning on you
Oh I got a message for you
Up and away it's what I gotta do
Forgive what you have
For what you might lose

What would you say if I told you that I'm to blame
And what would you do if I had to deny your name
Where would you go if I told you I love you and then walked away
N' who should I turn to if not for the ones that you could not save

I told you when I found you
If there were doubts you should be careful and unafraid
Now they surround you
And all that amounts to is love that you fed by perversion and pain

So if my affections are misunderstood
And you decide I'm up to no good
Don't ask me to enjoy them just for you

Ask yourself why I would choose to prostitute myself
To live with fortune and shame, oh yeah
When you should have turned to the hearts of the ones that you would not save

I told you when I found you
All that amounts to is love that you fed by perversion and pain
