Have ya seen her so
Movin with a style and ease
And i feel her from across the room
Yes its love in the third degree.


Ooh baby, baby
Won't you turn your head my way.

Ooh baby, baby cmon
Take a chance,
Your old enough to dance

Dance the night away

Like wine barely a beginner,
But just watch that lady go.
She's so fine
Cause dancin gets her higher than
Anything else she knows.

Ooh baby, baby
Won't you turn your head my way,
Ohh baby, baby
Well don't skip romance now
That ya old enough to dance

Dance the night away

Ooh yeah

Dance the night away
Dance, dance, dance
The night away
