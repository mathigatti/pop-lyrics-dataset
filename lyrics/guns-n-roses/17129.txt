I see your sister in her Sunday dress
She's out to please, she puts her best
She's out to take, no needs to try
She's ready to make


It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me, baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me

Cars are crashing every night
I drink n' drive, everything's in sight
I make the fire but I miss the firefight
I hit the bull's eye every night

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me, baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me

So easy
But nothing seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night

See me hit you, you fall down

I see you standing there
You think you're so cool
Why don't you just
Fuck off?

Ya get nothing for nothing, if that's what you do
Turn around bitch I got a use for you
Besides you ain't got nothing better to do
And I'm bored

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me, baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me

So easy
But nothing seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night

So come with me
Don't ask me where cause I don't know
I'll try to please you
I ain't got no money but it goes to show

It's so easy, so fucking easy
It's so easy, oh damn easy
It's so easy, so fucking easy
It's so easy, oh it's so easy
It's so easy, so fucking easy
It's so easy, yeah
