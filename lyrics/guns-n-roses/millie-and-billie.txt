Billie, I wonder why are we insane
Will we ever get better
Will we stay the same
Billie, I'm worried


Millie, don't worry, no one knows our pain
Being in love is crazy not alone that way
I know you're worried today

God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel alone
He was thinking of us he was thinking of us
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel so alone

Billie, my mind seems to wander
To events of a night long ago
Driving alone with our guilt well concealed
In the trunk of your '68 Olds

Millie, our world's an asylum
And our minds like you say ain't that straight
But you know and I know our passion's
Not deformed it's true to say
We'll love our lifetime

God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel alone
He was thinking of us he was thinking of us
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel so alone

Billie, I dream of our children
They're frightening and gruesome and sad
And I don't want them growing inside me
They're no price for the love that we have

Oh, Millie, oh, Billie, criminally insane
Oh, Millie, oh, Billie

Oh, Billie, it's fresh in my memory
The night that it had to be done
You with your pick axe and scissors
And you with your shovel and gun

And I liked your late husband, Donald
But such torture his memory brings
All sliced up and sealed tight in baggies
Guess love makes you do funny things
Oh, Millie, oh, Billie, criminally insane
Oh, Millie, oh, Billie
