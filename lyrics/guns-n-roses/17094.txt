She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky


Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Oh, oh! Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Oh, oh! Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh, yeah, eh
Ooh! Sweet love of mine

Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?

Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?

Where do we go? (sweet child o' mine)
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?

Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now?
Sweet child
Sweet child o' mine
