I'm livin' every moment
Like its my last
You could say I push too hard
But I like it fast


There ain't nothing
On what you can depend
What you call your highway
Could be your dead-end

Luck ain't got the time
To be your friend or mine
I'm doin' nothing
I'm killing time

Don't get me wrong
Don't wanna bring you down
Take or give it as it comes
Don't waste your life now hangin' around

Sometimes when you're on your own
You look around and find yourself all alone

Luck ain't got the time
To be your friend or mine
I make my living
Killing time

Running late killing time
We're doing over, overtime
Spend your life on borrowed dime
I make my living killing time

Say you're depressed
You've been resist
Shake it, now don't you fake it
You're the one who wants to make it

Don't fake on anything
Cuz it's in your hands
Stand up every time you fall
You gotta show the world you're feelin' down

Luck ain't got the time
To be your friend or mine
I make my living
Killing time

Running late killing time
We're doing over, overtime
Spend your life on borrowed dime
I make my living killing time

I'm killing time
