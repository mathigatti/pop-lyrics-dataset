Sail away, sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
That love happens
As much as me


My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
So sail away, sweet sister cause
I always will be in love with you

But if you love somebody else
Sweetheart
I don't wanna know about you
Sweetheart
Sweetheart

Cause you see so many others
You know what I mean and
That is why I got to live without you

I'm in love with the girl
I'm talking about you
I'm in love with the girl
That I can not live without

I'm in love but I feel
Like I'm living without
I'm love but it's the worst
time to be in love

Sweetheart
Sweetheart
