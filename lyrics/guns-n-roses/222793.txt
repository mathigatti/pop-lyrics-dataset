1, 2, 1, 2, 3

Ooh, I'll be laughing when you're crying
Push me and you lose
Ooh, I'll be dancing when you're dying
Your paid dues


You got me out of indecision
You can slash me out of fear
Good intentions get me nowhere
It's always nothing, all your love
Tell me about your overview
And I'll, try to show you how it looks from here

I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
No, no, no
No!

I can see your true colors
I see red
When you hide all of your lovers under the bed

Instigate a simple life
And who's to say what's black or white?
Just because, you're curious, I've earned another brought me near
Through all the dreams that I could use
Now I know there's nothing I could do
For you!

Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
No, no, no
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
No, no, no

(That'll change, don't worry about it)

I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ooh, ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
No, no, no

I think, you should, keep your mouth shut...???

I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
I ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down
Ain't goin' down no more
Ain't goin' down
