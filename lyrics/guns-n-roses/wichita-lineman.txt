I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire


I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line

Ooohhh yeeeaaahh!

Ooohhhh!

Ooohhh yeeeaaahh!

Still on the line, still on the line!
