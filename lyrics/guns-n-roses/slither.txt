Hey, hey, hey!

When you look you see right through me
Cut the rope, fell to my knees
Fallen, broken every single time
Always keep me under finger
That's the spot where you would (sue) me
But I see sometime pleasure in my mind
Yeah, here comes the water
It's come to wash away the sins of you and I
This time, you see!


Hey, hey, hey!

When you seek me you destroy me
Rip my mind and smell the poppy's
Fallen blood in every single time
Always keep me under finger
That's the spot where you might linger
But I see sometime the pleasure in my mind
Yeah, here comes the water
It's come to wash away the sins of you and I
This time, you see
Like holy water
It only burns you faster than you'll ever dry
This time, with me!
