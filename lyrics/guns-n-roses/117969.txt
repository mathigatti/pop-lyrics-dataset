Tell everybody that I am sorry, truly sorry   
For all the wrong I've done   
I never meant to hurt nobody, no no  
Lord I never want to do no wrong   
 
And I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated   
And I know my ship, it won't be coming in   
And as I lay me down to take my rest   
I can see that it's just dust in the wind   
 
Take hold my hand, and hold it tighter, ever tighter   
You must believe that I love you still   
But my strength, it grows weaker, and weaker   
And my body has lost its will   
 
'Cause I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated   
And I know my ship, it won't be coming in   
And as I lay me down to take my rest   
I can see that it's just dust in the wind   
 
Oh Lord, I have lost once again   
And there's no one to help me find my way home   
Lord and I, Lord I never want to hurt nobody  
And I, Lord I never want to do no wrong  
 
'Cause I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated   
And I know my ship, it won't be coming in   
And as I lay me down to take my rest   
I can see that it's just dust in the wind
