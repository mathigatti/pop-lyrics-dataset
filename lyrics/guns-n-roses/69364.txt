I said: Baby, you been lookin' real good
You know that I remember when we met
It's funny how I never felt so good
It's a feelin' that I know, I know I'll never forget


Oooh, it was the best time I can remember
Oooh, and the love we shared, is lovin' that'll last forever

There wasn't much in this heart of mine
But there was a little left and babe, you found it
It's funny how I never felt so high
It's a feelin' that I know, I know I'll never forget

Oooh, it was the best time I can remember
Oooh, and the love we shared, is lovin' that'll last forever

I think about you
Honey, all the time my heart says yes
I think about you
Deep inside I love you best
I think about you
You know you're the one I want
I think about you
Darling, you're the only one
I think about you

I think about you
You know that I do
I think about you
All alone, only you
I think about you
Oooh, it's true
I think about you
Oooh, yes, I do

Somethin' changed in this heart of mine
You know that I'm so glad that ya showed me
Honey, now you're my best friend
I wanna stay together 'till the very end

Oooh, it was the best time I can remember
Oooh, and the love we shared, is lovin' that'll last forever

I think about you
Honey, all the time my heart says yes
I think about you
Deep inside I love you best
I think about you
You know you're the one I want
I think about you
