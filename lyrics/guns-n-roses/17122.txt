I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you


And I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you

Happiness and I guess
I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And tears been here since then

Yeah, we're fucked!

I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you
Oh, yeah!
