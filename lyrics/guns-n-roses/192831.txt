Hey, girl, stop what you're doin'! 
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin. 
I don't know what it is that I like about you, but I like it alot. 
Won't let me hold you, Let me feel your lovin' charms. 


Communication Breakdown, It's always the same, 
I'm having a nervous breakdown, Drive me insane! 

Hey, girl, I got something I think you ought to know. 
Hey, babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so. 
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah! 
I'm never gonna let you go,'Cause I like your charms. 

Communication Breakdown, It's always the same, 
I'm having a nervous breakdown, Drive me insane!

Communication Breakdown, It's always the same, 
I'm having a nervous breakdown, Drive me insane!
