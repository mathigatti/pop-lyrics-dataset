I'm like a little bitty kid with a real big mouth
And you're gonna have to catch me if you wanna wash it out
'Cuz I'll be standin'on the corner, callin' you names
with my juvenile skills and delinquent games


'Cuz I'm a fast motherfucker
let me tell you 'bout it sucker
If you fuck with me, I'll fuck your mother
Your sister too, and your best girlfriend
I'll line 'em up, and put 'em end to end
And then I'll put out, stick it in, I'll pull it out
I'll grab your face and cum in your mouth

It tastes good, don't it?
It tastes good, and you know it
It tastes good, don't it?
It tastes good, and you know it
If you're looking for trouble, I'm the one
If you're looking for a fight go have some fun
Ya like to dance, ya like to sing
I'm the one and we'll get it on
Ya wanna dance?
