I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I said I don't know what I did but I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I can't wait here forever, I got too much here to lose


And now you're blowin' smoke
I think you're one big joke
Me, I gotta lot ta learn
An I'm still waiting for the heads to turn
You say I walk a line
Fuck they move it every time
You walk a mile in my shoes
And then you tell me about singing the blues

You get what you pay for
And freedom's real high priced
And while you're ripping off children
Somebody is fucking your wife
It's never made a difference
It's only how you survive

I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I said I don't know what I did but I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I can't wait here forever, I got too much here to lose

And now you ask me why
I said it's do or die
I'll stick it right in your face
And then I'll put you in your motherfucking place
An you, you can suck my ass
An I think it's so low class
Me, I'm just so concerned
I'm still waiting for your ass to burn

Oh! You want a confrontation
I'll give you every fucking chance
With your verbal masturbation
Me, I just like to dance
How's that for provocation
I'm just making a stance
And I'm tired of the frustration
Of living inside of your lies
And I'm wired on indignation
I said somebody's got to die

I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I said I don't know what I did but I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I can't wait here forever, I got too much here to lose

I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
Listen motherfucker, you're about to pay your dues
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
If you're going up against me then you know you're gonna lose

I know
I know
I know
I know
(You think anyone with an I.Q. over fifteen
Would believe your shit, fuckhead!)

Nothing but a fucking pussy!
