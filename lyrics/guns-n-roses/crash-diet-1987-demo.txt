Crash diet of reds'n'ludes
A shot of vitamin C and a bottle of booze
Too stupid to live with nothin' to lose
In your one track mind now
Where's that leave you?


Drink'n'drive white lightning faster baby
Takin' your last ride
Now better be so careful or you'll be dead before you time
Sorry you took mother's car now

Tears in my eyes, baby please don't go
You bet one in too many, Havin' one for the road
fresh from detox, fresh from jail
Took your rehabilitation and you drove me to hell

Drink'n'drive white lightning faster hmm
Takin' your last ride
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Sorry you took mother's car now

Too soon, for those who didn't mean it
Too late for the pressure and blame
Too bad for those who don't believe it
Ruby street still calls your name

Itchy trigger finger and the race to be alive
Smokin' a cig while you drink'n'drive
With no control in your life ahead
You're never gonna see if you wind up dead

Drink'n'drive white lightning faster
Takin' your last ride
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Drink'n'drive white lightning baby
It's always on your mind
when you Put your a limit baby, do it one more time
Take it down
Break it down
Somethin's changin', somethin's breakin'
You gotta be abroad outta your family
baby one more time to make it
Sweet history, Ooohhhh
If you don't care about yourself
Would you please take me alive
Oooohhhh...
You gonna
You gonna drink'n'drive
