One, two, three four
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Well if you don't like it, go ahead,
Find yourself a saint, go ahead now
Try to find a boy who's gonna be what I ain't
And what you need is a plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint
Who's gonna sit through all the madness always, act so quaint,
I said - a. Oh yeah, well - a.
It's your new friend, you're really
Making a scene, and I've seen you
Bouncing around, from machine to machine
But you know that
They're never really
Never really what they seem, and you can count on
Generate some warmth, then you'll
See just what I mean, oh baby, baby, baby yeah.
Then if I'm acting like a king, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being, and if I
Want too many things, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being, and well if
It's a bit obscene, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being
I don't gotta walk around with my head on down
Just like a human, oh no a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, a real proud human being.
Won't you give me a little sip why won't you give me a
Drag of that cigarette, why don't you
Try to give me something, that I'll
Never ever forget, but now
Could you blow it all, on a
Million dollar bet, because you're
Liable to lose it on a
Best lovin' you've had yet, oh baby baby, oh yeah.
Then if I'm acting like a king, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being, and if I
Want too many things, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being, and well if
It's a bit obscene, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being
I don't gotta walk around with my head on down
Just like a human, oh no a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, a real proud human being.
It's like I'm talkin' 'bout the human race
You're tryin' to cover up a big disgrace
Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on
Well I may think that this whole scene is just a
Too appalling for me
Well, I may be the type who's just mad about
Funny little thing that I see, but I can
Colour that with history, and make it
Just what I want it to be, well I'm
Blowin' my change on the fan magazines, with all the
Hollywood refugees, oh baby baby oh yeah.
Then if I'm acting like a king, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being, and if I
Want too many things, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being, and well if
It's a bit obscene, don't you know it's 'cause
I'm a human being

Just like a human, oh no a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, a real proud human being.
