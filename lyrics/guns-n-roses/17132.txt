I'm reckless and feelin' no pain
You know I've got no need to control
Livin' with the danger
I'm always on the edge now
With million dollar visions that I hold
Livin' like this never ever
Tore my life apart
I know how to maintain
And you know I know my part
On a holiday, a permanent vacation
I'm living on a cigarette with wine
I'm never alone 'cause I've got myself
Yes, I imitate myself all of the time
Livin' like this never ever
Tore my life apart
I know how to maintain
'Cause it's comin' from my heart
I lead a reckless life
And I don't need your advice
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only vice
Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only
Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only
Hey, hey,  yeah!
