She hit town like a rose in bloom
Smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried
In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big
You know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home


I said nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy!

Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price layin' flat on her back
Wanted so bad just to please the boys
They ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made

You know nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy and I never was!

Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get around
But now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with
A flick and a spoon
And in the streets the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
You know the roaches so big
You know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home

Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll

No,no,no,no,no,no,no,no baby

Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll

I bet you mama said
'Nice boys don't play rock and roll'
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys!
