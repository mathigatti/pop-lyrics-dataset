If you´ve never had no one
Look around for a fallen angel
If you feel you´re the last one
Look around for a fallen angel


Don´t you think it´s time to know
Don´t you think it´s time to show
What´s in your heart

Don´t you think it´s time to know
Don´t you think it´s time to show
What´s in your heart
