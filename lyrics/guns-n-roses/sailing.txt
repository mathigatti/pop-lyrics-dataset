I am sailing, I am sailing
Home again across the sea.
I am sailing, stormy waters
To be near you, to be free.


I am flying, I am flying,
Like a bird across the sky
I am flying, passing high clouds
To be with you, to be free.

Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Through the dark night, far away
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say?

Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Through the dark night, far away.
I am dying, forever dying,
To be with you, who can say?

We are sailing, we are sailing,
Home again across the sea.
We are sailing stormy waters,
To be near you, to be free.

Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free.
Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free.
