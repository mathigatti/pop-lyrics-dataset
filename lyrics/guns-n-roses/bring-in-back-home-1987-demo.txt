Sweet little lady, don't you get crazy
Bring it back home to me
Woman little standing, dreaming to forget him
Bring it back home to me?
Brown-eyed stunner, come on,
Bring it home to me
Kiss a little, fishing for your lover,
Won't you bring it down home to me


See a sky lit on fire, seen the dog it here
She lit her lips, with a passion, in the third degree
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her things

You can see the love, like check an ounce of pain,
Darling won't you wanna;
Sorry to resent, you said; Gimme back
Keep your teeth
Never wanna hold you,
Never wanna kiss you,
I bet she's taking away from me
Never will repeat it, on never reprimand it,
Will you bring it back home to me

Take care before my baby,
When your baby gives it up for free
She just puts around, being lazy,
But since she brings her love to me
Don't need nothing to save me, say for a piece of your luxury
Like the doorfoot, you'll never gage it
I'll tell you just how it's gonna be

I call your lover in the morning,
When you have your cup of tea
You never give me your warning,
So you better give her right up for me
Guess who's coming over, on your thinks;
That's such a surprise
If you're saying you never know her,

Honey, you better open your eyes
Look out

See a real long fire, she's the dog in here
She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her things

Can't take care before my baby,
When your baby gives it up for free
She just gets around being lazy
Until she brings me her loving to me
I don't need nothing to save me,
Say for a piece of your luxury
Lock the door, but you'll never gage me
I tell you just how it's gonna be

I call your lover in the morning,
When you have your cup of tea
You never give me your warning,
So get yourself a letter from me
Ohhhh, where're you going, tell me;
Who're you to see?
I've been sleeping on your doorstep,
Baby, won't you bring it back ho to me

Get me something for my jealous mind,
You don't get something for free
You just bring it down home to me
Ha-Ha-Ha
