There's a time for living
Time keeps on flying
Think you're loving baby
But all your doing is crying


Can you feel
Are those feelings real
Look at your game, girl
Look at your game, girl

What a mad delusion
Living in that confusion
Frustration and doubt
Can you ever live without the game

The sad, sad game
Mad game
Just to say loves' not enough
it can't be true
Oh, you can tell those lies
but you're only fooling you

Can't you feel
All those feelings ain't real
Look at your game girl
Go on
Look at your game girl
Can't you feel
All those feelings ain't real
Then you better stop trying
Or you're gonna play crying
Stop trying
Or you're gonna play cryin
Stop tryin
That's game
Sad,sad game
Mad game
Sad game

Thanks, Chas
