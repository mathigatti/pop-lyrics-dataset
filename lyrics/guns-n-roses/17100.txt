Kickin' back in the shadows
Got no need for the light
Who's sorry now old timer
Look at how you've spent your life
Scroungin' for change
to put some money in your pocket
My how scratch does burn
Laughin' at the suckers as you pissed it away


But i got the time and i got the muscle
I got the need to lay it all on the line
I ain't afraid of you smoke screen hustle
It's a perfect crime
Goddamn it is a perfect crime
Motherfucker it's a perfect crime
I said it's perfect

Keep the demons down
and drag the skeletons out
I got a blind man followin' me in chains
I said he's fun to watch
when the world has stopped
An i think he's got somethin' to say
"you wanna fuck with me, don't fuck with me
'Cause i'm what you'll be so don't fuck with me
If you had better sense
You'd step aside from the bad side of me
Don't fuck wit'da bad side o' me
Stay away from the bad side o' me
Don't fuck wit'da bad side"

T minus 1:09 and counting

Ostracized but thats all right
I was thinkin' about somethin' myself

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

Call on everybody who's got last rites
Said it's better if you locked 'em away
Runnin' through the visions
at the speed of light
Won't ya let me be
Motherfucker just let me be
Goddamn it better let me be
Don't ya know ya better let me be...

Perfect crime
Goddamn it is a perfect crime
Motherfucker it's a perfect crime
Don't cha know
It's a perfect crime
