My child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while i was away
He was talkin' fore i knew it
And as he grew he said,
i'm gonna be like you, dad,
You know i'm gonna be like you.


(Chorus)
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man 'n the moon.
when you comin home?
son, i don't know when. we'll get together then.
You know we'll have a good time then.

Well, my son turned ten just the other day.
He said, 'thanks for the ball, dad. come on, let's play.
Could you teach me to throw?
I said, 'not today. i got a lot to do.
He said, 'that's okay.' and he walked away and he smiled and he said,
'you know, i'm gonna be like him, yeah.
You know i'm gonna be like him.

(Chorus)

Well, he came from college just the other day,
So much like a man i just had to say,
i'm proud of you. could you sit for a while?
He shook his head and he said with a smile,
what i'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys.
See you later. can i have them please ?

(Chorus)

I've long since retired, my son's moved away.
I called him up just the other day.
i'd like to see you, if you don't mind.
He said, i'd love to, dad, if i could finnnnd the time.
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, dad.
It's been sure nice talkin' to you.
And as i hung up the phone it occurred to me,
He'd grown up just like me.
My boy was just like me.

(Chorus)
