He lost his mind today
He left it out back on the highway
On 65


She loved him yesterday
Yesterday's over, I said: Okay
That's all right

Time moves on, that's the way
We live an hope to see the next day
That's all right

Sometimes these things they are so easy
Sometimes these things they are so cold
Sometimes these things just seem to rip you right in two
Oh no, man, don't let 'em get to you

She loved him yesterday
He laid her sister, she said: Okay
And that's all right

Buried her things today
Way back out deep behind the driveway
And that's all right

Sometimes these women are so easy
Sometimes these women are so cold
Sometimes these women seem to rip you right in two
Only if you let 'em get to you

You get out on your own
And you take all that you own
And you forget about your home
And then you're just fucking gone

There's no logic here today
Do as you got to, go your own way
I said: That's right

Time's short, your life's your own
And in the end we are just
Dust n' bones
Dust n' bones
Dust n' bones

That's all right
Dust n' bones
