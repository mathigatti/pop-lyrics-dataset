She's a good girl, loves her mamma,
Loves Jesus, and America too.
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses, and her boyfriend too.
And it's a long day, livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway, runnin' thru the yard


And i'm a bad boy
'Cause i don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy, for breaking
And i'm free, free falling.
Yeah i'm free, free falling.

And all the vampires walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Boulevard.
And all the bad boys
Are standin' in the shadows
And the good girls
Are home with broken hearts.

And i'm free, free falling.
Yeah i'm free, free falling.
I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write her name in the sky.
I'm gonna free fall out into nothin'
Gonna leave this world for a while.
