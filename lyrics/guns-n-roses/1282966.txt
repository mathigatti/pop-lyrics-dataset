If the world would end today
And all the dreams we had
Would all just drift away
You know there's nothing more to say
If the world would end
And our love slipped away


I never knew the way that you looked at me
Would ever mean so much to me
But in my heart I found
The feelin's that I've never shown
And now they've
Got the best of me

If the world would end today
And all the dreams we had
Would all just drift away
You know there's nothing more to say
If the world would end
And our love slipped away

Oooooh,
La la...
La la...

I never thought all the love I was lookin' for
Could ever be so close to me
But you're the only one
I have ever loved that has ever loved me
And now you got the best of me

If the world would end today
And all the dreams we had
Would all just drift away
You know there's nothing more to say

If the world would end today
And all the dreams we had
Would all just drift away
You know there's nothing more to say
If the world would end
And our love slipped away
If the world would end
And our love slipped away
