Come together

Here come old flat top
He come groovin´up slowly
He got joo joo eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please


He wear no shoeshine
He got toe jam football
He got monkey finger
He shoot coca cola
He say i know you, you know me
One thing i can tell you is you got to be free

Come together
Right now
Over me

He bag production
He got walrus gumboot
He got ono sideboard
He one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease

Come together
Right now
Over me

He roller coaster
He got early warning
He got muddy water
He one mojo filter
He say one and one and one is three
Got to be good lookin´´cause he´s so hard to see

Come together
Right now
Over me
