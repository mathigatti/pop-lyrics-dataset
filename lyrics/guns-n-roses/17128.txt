When you're talking to yourself
And nobody's home
You can fool yourself
You came in this world alone (alone)


So nobody ever told you, baby, how it was gonna be
So what'll happen to you, baby?
Guess we'll have to wait and see
One, two

Old at heart, but I'm only 28
And I'm much too young to let love break my heart
Young at heart, but it's getting much too late
To find ourselves so far apart
I don't know how you're supposed to find me lately
And what more could you ask from me?
How could you say that I never needed you?
When you took everything
Said you took everything from me

Young at heart, and it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out

Still talking to myself and nobody's home (alone)

So nobody ever told us, baby, how it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us, baby?
Guess we'll have to wait and see

When I find all of the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way
Find another day
With all the changing seasons of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time
And now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
You're back down on the ground
You don't talk so loud, and you don't walk so proud
Anymore, and what for?

Well I jumped into the river
Too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own
Drifting all alone
If it doesn't show
Give it time to read between the lines
'Cause I see the storm is getting closer
And the waves, they get so high
Seems everything we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die?

I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through
This time, oh this time, without you
I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everything we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die
