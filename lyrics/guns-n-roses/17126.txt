One, two, one, two, three, four

Shed a tear cause I'm missing you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now


Said: Woman, take it slow
And it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said: Sugar, make it slow
And we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
Patience

I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider

Said: Woman, take it slow
And things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said: Sugar, take the time
'Cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it

We won't fake it
I'll never break it
'Cause I can't take it

Little patience
Need a little patience
Just a little patience
Some more patience

I've been walking the streets at night
Just trying to get it right (need some patience)
It's hard to see with so many around
You know, I don't like being stuck in the crowd
(Could use some patience)

And the streets don't change but, baby, the names
I ain't got time for the game
(Gotta have some patience)
'Cause I need you
But I need you (all it takes is patience)

I need you (just a little patience)
I need you (is all you need)
This time
