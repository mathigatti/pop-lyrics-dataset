How could she look so fine?
How could it be she might be mine?
How could she be so cool?
I've been taken for a fool, so many times


It's a story of a man
Who works as hard as he can
Just to be a man who stands on his own
But the book always burns
As the story takes it turn
And leaves a broken man

How could she be so cool?
How could she be so fine?
I owe a favor to a friend
My friends, they always come through for me
Yeah!

It's a story of a man

As the story takes it turn

If you could only live my life
You could see the difference you make to me
To me

I'd look right up at night
And all I'd see was darkness
Now I see the stars alright
I wanna reach right up and grab one for you

When the lights went down in your house
Yeah that made me happy
The sweat I make for you
Yeah, I think you know where that comes from
Guitar, come on

Well, I'd look right up at night
And all I'd see was darkness
Now I see the stars alright
I wanna reach right up and grab one for you

When the lights went down in your house
Yeah that made me happy
The sweat I make for you
I think you know where that comes from

How could she look so good? (so good)
How could she be so fine?
How could she be so cool?
How could it be she might be mine?

Yeah
