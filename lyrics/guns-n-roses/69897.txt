All the love in the world couldn't save you
All the innocence inside
You know I tried so hard to make you
To make you change your mind


And it hurts too much to see you
And how you left yourself behind
You know I wouldn't want to be you
Now there's a hell I can't describe

So now I wander through my day
Trying to find my way
Still these feelings that I felt
I saved for you and no one else

And though as long as this road seems
I know its called the street of dreams
But that's not stardust on my feet
It leaves a taste that's bittersweet

That's called the blues

I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you

Although its what you planned, this much is true, oh oh
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore...

I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you

You know it's what we planned, this much is true, oh oh
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore...

What this means to me
is more than I know you believe
What I thought was you now
Has cost more that it should for me

What I thought was true before
Were lies I couldn't see
What I thought was beautiful
Was only memories...
