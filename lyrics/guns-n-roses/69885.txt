I been thinkin' 'bout, thinkin' 'bout sex
Always hungry for somethin' that I haven't had yet
Maybe baby you got somethin' to lose
Well I got somethin', I got somethin' for you


My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes

Panties 'round your knees with your ass in debris
Doin' dat grind with a push and squeeze
Tied up, tied down, up against the wall
Be my rubbermade baby an' we can do it all

My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight

My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight ooh yeah
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Anything goes tonight
Said anything goes
Tonight!
