Found a head and an arm in the garbage can
Don't know why I'm here
Livin' on the run for so long
I gotta go collect


Double talkin' jive
Get the money motherfucker
'Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin', I got (lies)
No more patience, man

Back in town and a all new friends
They saying: How you been?
Fucked up and out of place
That's how I felt back then

Double talkin' jive
Get the money motherfucker
'Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin', I got (lies)
No more patience man
You dig what I'm saying?
