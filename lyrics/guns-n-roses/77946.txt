It don't really matter
Gonna find out for yourself
No, it don't really matter
I'm gonna leave these thing to
Somebody else


If they were missionaries
Real time visionaries
Sittin' in a Chinese stew
To view my disinfatuation

I know that I'm a classic case
Watch my disenchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong
They've seen the end
And you can't hold on now

Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To end the fascination
Even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
When I all I've got is precious time

It don't really matter
I guess I'll keep it to myself
Said, it don't really matter
It's time I look around
For somebody else

Cause it would take a lot more time than you
Have got for masturbation
Even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
When all we got is precious time
More than you've got to fool the nation
When all I've got is precious time

It don't really matter
I guess you'll find out for yourself
No, it don't really matter
So you can hear it now
From somebody else

You think you got it all locked up inside
And if you beat them enough, they'll die
It's like a walk in the park from a cell
And now you're keeping your own kind in hell
When your Great Wall rocks, blame yourself
While their arms reach up for your help
And you're out of time
