Took my chances carelessly
I said I choked on my own cigarette
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby
But you haven't seen the worst yet


Now I'm reckless
Gonna have some fun
I had a woman who had said it was all alright
Now I'm back the only one

And I ain't standing
Never standing in the
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Oh no

Stole my changes helplessly
I said yeah but I got no regrets
Money it was on the table
So I booked with all the bets

Living like your livin'
Ain't so hot
You ain't my idea
Of a high-rollin' shot

So I ain't standin'
I'm never standin'

Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Oh no

High price calling
Hangin' over your head
I hope you're heard,
Baby all I've said
You've gone cold
Or even misread
No use crying
You're as good as dead

Now I'm reckless
Gonna have some fun
I had a woman who had said it was all alright
Now I'm back the only one

And I ain't standing
Never standing

Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow
Shadow
Shad-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d
Shadow of your love
Oh no
