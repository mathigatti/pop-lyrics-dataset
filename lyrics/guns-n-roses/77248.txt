Ah, ah
Is it true
What they say of you?


Gonna call the president
Gonna call a private eye
Gonna get the IRS
Gonna need the FBI

There's not anymore that I can do
All the reasons that you give
I'd follow you
To where you'd lead
And if that'd be
The end of time, it's true

Wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong
Wouldn't be the last I'm sure I've known
Through all the rumors I can tell
Some things didn't work so well
Well anyway, it feels the same

As when you first told me you were gone
So long ago, but I still held on
Through all the emotions, the love and the sex
And that's the truth and here's the worst yet
Would it even mattered the things that I’d say
You made your mind up and gone anyway
There's no use now in draggin' it on
Shoulda seen it coming all along

Well, it's true
Ooh I had my doubts of you

Gonna call the president
Gonna call myself a private eye
Gonna need the IRS
Gonna get the FBI

Gonna make this a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it baby with your morning news
With a sweet hangover and the headlines too now

Ah ah
Ah ah

I bet you think I’m doin’ this all for my health
I shoulda looked again babe at somebody else
Feelin’ like I done way more than wrong
Feelin’ like I’m livin’ inside of this song
Feelin’ like I’m just too tired to care
Feelin like I done more than my share
Could it be the way that I’ve carried on
Like a broken record for so long?

And I do
Ooh, ooh

Gonna call the president
Gonna call a private eye
Gonna get the IRS.
Gonna need myself the FBI

Ooh What shall I do?
If I gave my heart to you, oh
It’s such a crime
You know it’s true

Gonna call the president
Gonna get myself a private eye
Gonna need the IRS
Gonna get the FBI

Gonna make this a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it baby with your morning news
With a sweet hangover and the headlines too

There’s not anymore that I can do
