"Back In The Fuckin' U.K."

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
Oh, the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the fuckin' U.K.
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you say, boys
Back in the fuckin' U.K., yeah


Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
I'm back in the fuckin' U.K.
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you say, boys
Back in the fuckin'
Back in the fuckin'
I'm back in the fuckin' U.K.

Well the England girls really knock me out
They leave the west behind
And London girls make me sing and shout
They Wembley's always on my my my my my my my my my mind

Oh, come on
Hu Hey Hu, hey, ah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm back in the fuckin' U.K.
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you say, boys
Back in the fuckin' U.K.

Well the England girls really knock me out
They leave the west behind
And London girls make me sing and shout
They Wembley's always on my my my my my my my my my mind

Oh, show me round your snow peaked
mountain way down south
Take me to you daddy's farm
Let me sing your Beatles tunes ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the fuckin' U.K.
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you say, boys
Back in the fuckin' U.K.
Oh, let me tell you honey
