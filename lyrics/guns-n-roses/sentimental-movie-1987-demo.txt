You better change your attitude
Cause you know you want it to
You bring me all your pride
But I know you hold it too
I can feed you bounty, yeah
If you feed my head as well
And I won't give you empty promises
When the quarter's in the wishing well
But this ain't no sentimental movie
Where dreams collect like dust
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes
So now, who can you trust?
You think you look so cool
Yes you do
You take me for your fool
Itching' for your... Of the hug
Baby I want a new start, but don't you be
True, yeah
I can see through your door
You put my head into these walls
You take my heart to the dockside
You put me in the car
And take me for another ride
But this ain't no sentimental movie
Where dreams collect like dust
You talk to me with innocence in your eyes
So now, who can you trust?
Put a path on to your veins
And antique and old whore's our new pain
The tears you cried
All the tears you cried tonight
You put me down
But you can't get out of sight
And this ain't no sentimental movie
You push it on
You grab it on
But I don't see the t.v.?
This ain't no sentimental movie
See the screen
You're startin' to scream
Abusin' confusin'
Your program's over?
This ain't no sentimental movie
You look so cool
Don't take me for another one of your scenes?
This ain't no sentimental movie
The tears you cried
All the tears you cried tonight
This ain't sentimental movie
This ain't sentimental movie
Yea
