Is she really going out with him?
Hey !
I got a feeling inside of me,
It's kinda strange, like a stormy sea
I don't know why, don't know why
These kind of things gotta be
I got a new rose, I got her good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town.
See the sun, see the sunny skies
Don't get too close, it'll burn your eyes
Don't you run away that way
Come back another day
I got a new rose, I got her good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town.
I never thought this could happen to me
Oh so strange, why should it be
I don't deserve somebody this sane
I haven't met her, maybe too late
Hey !
I got a feeling inside of me,
It's kinda strange, like a stormy sea
I don't know why, don't know why
These kind of things gotta be
I got a new rose, I got her good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town.
