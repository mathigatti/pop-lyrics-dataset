Ain't it fun when you're always on the run
Ain't it fun when your friends
Despise what you've become
Ain't it fun when you get so high
Well...that you just can't come
Ain't it fun when you know
That you gonna die young


It's such fun

Ain't it fun when you taking care of number one
Ain't it fun when you feel like
You just gotta get a gun
Ain't it fun when you just
Can't seem to find your tounge
Cause you stuck it too deep
Into something that really stung

It's such fun

Well, so you come up to me
And spit right in my face
I didn't even feel it
It was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glass
I didn't even feel it
It happened so fast

It's such fun

Ain't it fun when you tell her
She's just a cunt
Ain't it fun when you
She splits you and leaves you on the run
Well, ain't it fun when you broken up
Every band that you ever begun
Ain't it fun when you know
That you're gonna die young

It's such fun
