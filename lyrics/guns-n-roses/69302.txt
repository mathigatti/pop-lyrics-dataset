...3, 4

I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
I was out at night in the pouring rain
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas!
I said it's all right now, I said a Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas! gas! gas!
Wooh yeah, na na na na na na now honey


I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was down with a strap right across my back
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas!
I said it's all right now, you know a Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas! gas! gas!
Wooh yeah, na na na na na na now honey

I was down, I was washed up and left for dead
I looked down and my feet and I saw they bled
I looked around, there was no sign of a friend
I was crowned with a spike right through my face ah!
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas!
I said it's all right now, you know a Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas! gas! gas! Oh yeah

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas oh
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas I said a
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas you know a
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas I said a
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas you know a
Jumpin' Jack, n' Jumpin' Jack, n' Jumpin' Jack, n' Jumpin' Jack n' oh
Hey
Yeah!
Ow!
