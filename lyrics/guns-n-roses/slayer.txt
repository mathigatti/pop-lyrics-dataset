I am a man cold and ugly,
Within me take a terrible hatred
Have killed thousands of people without knowing that
Looks like i'm immortal
That never came close to death


Matador i'ma murderer, baby
Do not try to approach me because i
I can also kill you, murderer!
I'm a murderer!

I am a killer white skin
Ingenues like scary people
I am very sinister and there
Nothing i can do now
In my blood i can not stop,
But after a few hours i started
Reflect on my actions and that was when i realized
He did not like me to be forgiven
Killer killer am
I did not want that shit!

Now i am left alone to die
Also
