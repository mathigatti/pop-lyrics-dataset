Well, on a train, I met a dame,
She rather handsome, but (???) the same
She was pretty, from New York City
I'm walkin' down that old fair lane,
I'm in heat, I'm in love,
But I just couldn't tell her so


I said, train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
With a "heave!", and a "ho!"
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

Well, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way,
I'm in heat, I'm in love,
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

Well, we made a stop in Albequerque
She must'a thought I was a real cool jerk
Got off the train, and put her hands up
Lookin' so good I couldn't let her go
But I just couldn't tell her so
