I've known my share of pain
It's a crown of thorns
That never seems to break the skin
There's no blood in the scars
Just your broken heart


You used to be so sweet
You walked with a smile
Life tastes funny and the coffee's cold
Amuse yourself, make you useful

You've got nothing good to say
Keep your mouth shut
Nothing good to do
Keep it to yourself
Nothing's ever good enough for you

Sick of everything that you say
It's going down
Sorry for everything
Sick of everything that you do
It's going down
You look like a fool
You never mean to hurt no one
They just happen to be there next to you
'Cause you're going down

I know this dark place
I heard these words
On the tip of a million tongues
I've heard them yelled
I've even heard them sung

Get into your car and drive
Just as fast as you can
You've had your 15 minutes
You tried to take an hour but
Now no one, hears your call

You've got nothing good to say
Keep your mouth shut
Nothing good to do
Keep it to yourself
Nothing's ever good enough for you

Sick of everything that you say
It's going down
Sorry for everything
Sick of everything that you do
It's going down
You look like a fool
You never mean to hurt no one
They just happen to be there next to you
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down

'Cause you're going down
You're going down
You're going down

'Cause you're going down
You're going down
'Cause you're going down
'Cause you're going down

Nothing's good enough for you
