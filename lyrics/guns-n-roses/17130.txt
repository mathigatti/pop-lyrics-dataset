Been hidin' out and layin' low
It's nothin' new ta me
Well you can always find a place to go
If you can keep your sanity


They break down the doors and they rape my rights but
They won't touch me
They scream and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me
I lose my head, I close my eyes
They won't touch me
'Cause I got somethin' I been buildin' up inside
For so fuckin' long

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm fuckin' innocent
They won't break me

Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'
Sometimes it's harder to leave
And everytime you think you know just what you're doin'
That's when your troubles exceed

They push me in a corner just to get me to fight but
They won't touch me
They preach and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me
I lose my head, I close my eyes
They won't touch me
'Cause I got somethin' I been buildin' up inside
I'm already gone

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
Yes, I'm innocent
They won't break me

Some people got a chip on their shoulder
An some would say it was me
But I didn't buy that fifth of whisky that you gave me
So I'd be quick to disagree

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm fuckin' innocent
They won't break me

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
Yes, I'm innocent
So you can suck me

Take that one to heart
