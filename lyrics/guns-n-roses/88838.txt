Give me a little bit of volume on this

Heart-breaker, soul-shaker
I've been told about you
Steam-roller, the midnight shoulder
What they been sayin' must be true


Red hot mama, there'll be trouble
I said time's come to pay your dues

2X
Now you're messin' with A SON OF A BITCH
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch

Talking jive and poison ivy
You ain't gonna cling to me
Minute-taker, fall-faker
I ain't so blind I can't see

Red hot mama, there'll be trouble
I said time's come to pay your dues

2X
Now you're messin' with A SON OF A BITCH
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch

10X
Now you're messin' with A SON OF A BITCH
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
