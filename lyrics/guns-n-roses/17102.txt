I can't stop thinkin'
Thinking 'bout sinkin'
Sinkin' down into my bed
I call my mother
She's just a cunt now
She said I'm sick in the head
She said you ain't special
So who you foolin'
Don't try ta give me a line


But I can't stop thinkin'
'Bout seein' ya one more time
(Oh no)
But I already left you
And you're better off left behind

It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind

Too bad
You're fucked up

I used to be wasted
Always tried to take it
Take it down into my vein
I call the doctor
He's just another
He said I'm sick in the brain
He said you ain't special
So who you foolin'
Don't try ta give me a line

But I can't stop thinking
'Bout doin' it one more time
(Oh no)
But I already left you
And you're better off left behind
(Oh yeah)

It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind

So bad
Boy

It's a
It's a
Heads up

It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind

But I can't stop thinking
'Bout doin' it one more time
(Oh no)
See I already left you
And you're better off left behind
(Oh no, oh no)

It's a bad obsession
And you're always messin' my mind
See I already left you
And you're better off left behind
Uh huh, no

Maybe you'll do better next time
Punk!
