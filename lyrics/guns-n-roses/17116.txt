Why do you look at me when you hate me
Why should I look at you when you make me hate you too
I sense a smell of retribution in the air
I don't even understand why the fuck you even care


And I don't need your jealousy yeah
Why drag me down in your misery

And when you stare you don't think I feel it
But I'm gonna deal it back to you in spades
When I'm havin' fun ya know I can't conceal it
'Cause I know you'd never cut it in my game, oh no

And when you're talkin' about a vasectomy, yeah
I'll be writin' down your obituary, history

You got your bitches with the silicone injections
Crystal meth and yeast infections
Bleached blond hair, collagen lip projections
Who are you to criticize my intentions
Got your subtle manipulative devices
Just like you I got my vices
I got a thought that would be nice
I'd like to crush your head tight in my vice, pain

And that goes for all you punks in the press
That want to start shit by printin' lies
Instead of the things we said
That means you Andy Sercher at Hit Parader
Circus magazine
Mick Wall at Kerrang!
Bob Guccione Jr. at Spin
What you pissed off cuz your dad gets more pussy than you?
Fuck you
Suck my fuckin' dick
You be rippin' off the fuckin' kids
While they be payin' their hard earned
Money to read about the bands
They want to know about
Printin' lies startin' controversy
You wanta antagonize me
Antagonize me motherfucker
Get in the ring motherfucker
And I'll kick you bitchy little ass
Punk

I don't like you, I just hate you
I'm gonna kick your ass, oh yeah, oh yeah!

You may not like our integrity, yeah
We built a world out of anarchy, oh yeah

And in this corner weighing in at 850 pounds
Guns n' roses

Get in the ring
Yeah

Yeah this song is dedicated to
All the guns n' fuckin' roses
Fans who stuck with us through all the
Fucking shit
And to all those opposed
Hmm, well
