Riad N' The Bedouins
Had a plan, and thought they'd win
But I don't give a fuck 'bout them
Cause I am crazy


Oh, my salvation
N' all my frustration
Caught in the lies
No one had wove as well
Somewhere in time
Where only I could tell
Ooh

Riad N' The Bedouins
Say that's a war that you can't win
But I have had enough of them
And who can blame me

Sands of time and desert winds
Nomads and barbarians
I won't bend my will to them
You aggravate me

Oh, my salvation
N' all my frustration
Caught in the lies
No one had wove as well
Somewhere in time
Where only I could tell

Oh, sweet salvation
Like all my frustration
Caught up in lies
No one had wove as well
Somewhere in time
Where only I could tell
Ooh

Oh, sweet salvation
And all my frustration
Caught up in lies
If you had wove so well
Somewhere in time
Then only I could tell

Ohh!

Riad N' The Bedouins
Had a plan and thought they'd win

Riad N' The Bedouins
Crossed the line and lost again
