I'm from south Philadelphia
Up on Avenue C.
I've seen empty hands that was waitin'
to freeze up from the power at home.


I Don't Care About You
Fuck you!
I Don't Care About You
Fuck you!

I seen Hollywood Boulevard Welfare Hotel
And I spent the night in jail
At the Wilkins Hotel

I seen an old man have a heart attack
in Manhattan
Well, he died while we just stood
their looking at him
Ain't he cute?

I seen men rolling drugs
I seen bodies in the streets
I saw a man who was sleeping
in his own puke
And a man with no leg
crawlin' down Fifth Street

Trying to God to get something to eat
