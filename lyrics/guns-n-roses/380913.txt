Indiana Ain't My Kinda Town

Down in Indiana
You get by real ????
On a Sunday, afternoon
So we'll drive, up to Michigan
Gonna have some fun
If anyone is ????
For your ????


Well, Indiana ain't my kind of town
Well I drove for miles 
But I couldn't find my way around
I said, Indiana ain't my kind of town
Well I drove for miles 
But I couldn't find my way around

Now Duff is, from Seattle
That's why he was here
Cause they don't like punks or rockers
Way out there

Well Indiana just ain't my kind of town
I said, I drove for miles 
But I can't find my way around
I said, Indiana just ain't my kind of town
Well I drove for miles 
But I couldn't find my goddamn way around

Well there's a place
We call ????
It's really ????, man
We stay up, all fucking night
And on the ????
Make noise California
Well I'll be here ????
????
And stay out of my view

I said, Indiana, just ain't my kind of town
Well I drove for miles 
But I couldn't find my way around
I said, Indiana just ain't my kind of town
I drove for miles 
But I couldn't find my way around

I said, Indiana, ain't my kind of town
Well I drove for miles 
But I couldn't find my way around
Indiana ain't my kind of town
Well I drove for miles 
But I couldn't find my way around
