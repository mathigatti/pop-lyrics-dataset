I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her (ooh, yeah)
But I had to kill her


I had to put her, six feet under
And I can still hear her complain

I used to love her (whoa, yeah)
But I had to kill her
I used to love her (ooh, yeah)
But I had to kill her

I knew I'd miss her
So I had to keep her
She's buried right in my backyard
(Whoa, yeah)
(Whoa, yeah)
(Whoo-oo, yeah)

I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her (whoa, yeah)
But I had to kill her

She bitched so much
She drove me nuts
And now we're happier this way
(Whoa, yeah)
(Whoa)
(Whoo-oo, yeah)

I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her (ooh, yeah)
But I had to kill her

I had to put her (ooh, yeah)
Six feet under
And I can still hear her complain
