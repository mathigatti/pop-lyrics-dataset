Listen motherfuckers to this song that should be heard
Thrown down in the gutter, it's more than you deserve
Kneeling fucking virgin, you know that's what you are
Pussy for a maggot, isn't that a shock


What can I do with a bitch like you?
You know that it's true
All I have ask of you
I'll be dammed
If it's not true
A bitch like you

Get your head down in the sky
Fucking little schemer got yourself a broken heart
Syphilitic preachers baby I know who you are
Parasitis demons sucking acid through your heart

What can I do with a bitch like you?
You know that it's true
All I have ask of you
I'll be dammed
If it's not true
A bitch like you

What can I do with a bitch like you?
You know that it's true
All I have ask of you
I'll be dammed
If it's not true
A bitch like you
