Dance to the beat of the living dead
You'll see baby, stay away from there.
Raw power is sure come a runnin' to you
If you're alone and you got the feel
So am I baby let's roll on out ta' here
Raw power is sure to come a- runnin' to you.
Raw power's got a magic touch
Raw power is much too much
Happiness is a guaranteed
It was made for you and me.
Raw power, honey, just won't quit
Raw power, I can feel it.
Raw power, hear it, can't be spared,
Popin' eyes and a fashion feed
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
I was tryin', I was tryin' a tell ya what to do
"And you know that ain't right."
I look in the eyes of the seventh girl
Fall deep in love in the underworld
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you.
If you're alone and you got the shakes
So am I baby and I got what it takes
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you.
Raw power's go a healing hand,
Raw power can destroy a man
Raw power is so more than soul
Got a son called rock and roll.
Raw power, honey, just won't quit
Raw power, I can feel it
Raw power honey, give me a spin
Get up baby and kiss my feet.
Ev'rybody always tryin' a tell me what to do,
Don't you try, don't you try o tell me what to do
Ev'rybody always tryin' a tell me what to do,
Don't you try, don't you try o tell me what to do
Raw power it's got no place to go.
Raw power honey, you don't wanna know
Raw power is a guaranteed. O.D.
Raw power is a laughin' at you and me
"I wanna know."
Can you feel it ? Can you feel it ?
Can you feel it ? Can you feel it ?
Raw power, raw power
Can you feel it ? Can you feel it
