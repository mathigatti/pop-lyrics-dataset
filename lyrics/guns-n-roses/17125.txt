Welcome to the jungle
We got fun and games
We got everything you want
Honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find
Whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey
We got your disease


In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
Oh, I wanna watch you bleed

Welcome to the jungle
We take it day by day
If you want it, you're gonna bleed
But it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl
That's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights
But you won't get there for free

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
I, I wanna hear you scream

Welcome to the jungle
It gets worse here everyday
You learn to live like an animal
In the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see
You'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want
But you better not take it from me

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
Oh, I wanna watch you bleed

And when you're high, you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down, yeah

You know where you are?
You're in the jungle, baby
You're gonna die

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
Down in the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your, it's gonna bring you down
