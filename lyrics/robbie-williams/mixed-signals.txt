I tried your number at 9 but to no avail
Tried again at 11, got sent straight to voicemail
You said you needed a calm, quiet night alone
But that don't explain why you're not picking up the phone
Now I'm driving through the city like a bullet in my seat
And I hold my breath when I hit your street
You were restless when you told me everything was alright
One quiet night alone
If nothing is wrong
How come you're not home


And it's almost 3AM
When you decide to show?
You're gonna tell me where you've been
Don't spare me details, I wanna know
What does he look like?
What does he talk like?
Thought you wanted to make this work
But you're sending me mixed signals

With lowered emotion
You greet me and I'm overcome
'Cause your body language is speaking in another tongue
First you tell me that you needed some excitement in your life
Then you grab the handle and turn the knife
Accusations of obsessive misbehaviour
Like we ain't been down to hell and back
And made untrue
I thought that was you

And it's almost 3AM
When you decide to show
You're gonna tell me where you've been
Don't spare me details, I wanna know
What does he look like?
What does he talk like?
Thought you wanted to make this work
But you're sending me mixed signals

And in the dusk we fall apart
The sun's got his elbow
In the rib cage of town
I'm breaking down

And it's almost 3AM
When you decide to show
You're gonna tell me where you've been
Don't sugarcoat it, girl, I want the blow-by-blow
What does he look like?
What does he talk like?
Thought you wanted to make this work
But you're sending me mixed signals
Yeah, sending me mixed signals

Darling, darling believe me
Know that, no you don’t need me
Break up, you know it won’t please me
Sweetheart, let me down easy
Cut me loose, baby, don't tease me
Oh Lord, let me down easy
Sending me mixed signals
