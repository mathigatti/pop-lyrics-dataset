You know the song
Forget everything that went wrong
And I'll sing along
It's the time of the year where we all
Get along, 'cause as long as there's beer
The real festive cheer
The money disappears


So come on, you sad sacks
You're not gonna win the human race
Put on your glad rags
Go get off your face

Grab Bad Sharon from the office
Nick the champagne, let's get off it
Just in time for Auld Lang Syne
(Can't believe it's Christmas)
There's still a few crackers left to pull
Under the mistletoe, you fools
Love your friends, spend, spend, spend
(Can't believe it's Christmas again)

You know the score
As soon as you sink that shot, there'll
Be one more
As sure as your face hits the floor

Come on, you sad sacks
A hand jives not out of place
Put on your glad rags
Go get off your face

Grab Bad Sharon from the office
Nick the champagne, let's get off it
Just in time for Auld Lang Syne
(Can't believe it's Christmas)
There's still a few crackers left to pull
Under the mistletoe, you fools
Love your friends, spend, spend, spend
(Can't believe it's Christmas
Can't believe it's Christmas again)

Here he comes, I can see him
Go to bed you sleepy dossers

Santa's on his way
With the presents on his sleigh
So go to bed you sleepyhead
Before he flies away

(Away, away, away, away, away)

Grab Bad Sharon from the office
Nick the champagne, let's get off it
Just in time for Auld Lang Syne
(Can't believe it's Christmas)
There's still a few crackers left to pull
Under the mistletoe, you fools
Love your friends, spend, spend, spend
(Can't believe it's Christmas
Can't believe it's Christmas
Can't believe it's Christmas)

Santa's on his way
With the presents on his sleigh
Santa's on his way
With the presents on his sleigh
Santa's on his way
With the presents on his sleigh
Santa's on his way
With the presents on his sleigh
