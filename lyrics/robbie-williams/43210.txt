It's the end of the night I want to know ya
Get the phone call a cab and take you home yeah
I think there's something you should know


I'lll send my boys an order through InterFlora
Tell you lies like I love ya and I adore ya
I think there's something you should know

I'm a love cheat and you look so sweet
Can't take you home where I live, lay you by the fire
Love me, Lady, I'm a liar

The curtains closed and the night is fun
And I think it's time for me to not be home alone
I think I'll put the cat out and give the dog a bone
I hardly know ya but I like your figure
Suppose I read about you in the Mirror
They think there's something everybody should know

Chorus x 2

You love me x 3 You need me I'm a liar
You want me You need me You want me I'm a liar
