She lies on the bed
With her hands in her head
And she screams
He gets a kick out of losing the plot so it seems
He makes you all laugh so she's the one
Doing harm
But how can you fight when she's not
The one under his arm


These dreams have let you down
Take it don't break it just turn it around
These dreams won't let you down

You never stopped loving his misfortunate
Lazy ways
All the memories that you should've had
Are a cabaret haze
There's just a hole where you know he
Should've been
There's no one worse off than you
When you can't describe what you've seen

These dreams have let you down
Take it don't break it just it turn around
These dreams won't let you down

Where do you go when you're all alone
In your bed
Do you cry in your sleep cos it's
Better unsaid
Have you forgotten your past because
That's how it seems
Is it too hard to think so you edit
Your dreams
And play them back again and again

These dreams have let you down
Take it don't break it just turn it around
These dreams won't let you down

These dreams have let you down
Take it don't break it just turn it around
These dreams won't let you down

You've got tomorrow tomorrow
You've got tomorrow tomorrow
You've got tomorrow tomorrow
You've got tomorrow tomorrow
You've got tomorrow tomorrow
