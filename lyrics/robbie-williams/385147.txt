When we were only 17 
and thrown into society 
that was the end of you and me 
from what we could have been 


And if we didn't keep in touch 
I guess we didn't care that much 
We never understood that stuff 
but now I need you 

I never meant to let you down 
but letting you down was easy 

Didn't it break your heart 
Maybe I'm just too needy 
Do any of you still need me 
in your lives, in your heart 
Don't say yes 
just to please me 
If you're still you and you want 
Don't say no 

We fought together 
Laughed together 
Said things that we hoped were clever 
The thought of missing you forever 
makes me want to cry 
And now that you've grown up to be 
a sentimental memory 
Are you still you cuz I'm still me 
At least I hope so 

A life beginning somewhere else 
It was our time to die 

Didn't it break your heart 
Maybe I'm just too needy 
Do any of you still need me 
in your life, in your heart 
Don't say yes 
just to please me 
If you're still you and you want 
Don't say no 

So, what do you know 
Where do you go 
Has it been fun 
Oh did you survive being buried alive 
like I did 

Didn't it break your heart 
Maybe I'm just too needy 
Do any of you still need me 
in your life, in your heart 
Don't say yes 
just to please me 
If you're still you and you want 
Don't say no
