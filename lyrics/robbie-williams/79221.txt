I've been hanging around
Just in case you fall in love with me
I know you have doubts 
I hear when you shout
'Cos I understand you seeI was concerned when you said
You'd rather wake up dead
Than spend a day with me
I know that's not you
I know and it's true
They don't understand you like I doI've been hanging around
Just in case you fall in love with me
I know you have doubts
I hear when you shout
'Cos I understand you see[Spoken] 
Hi, it's me again...Yay, I got on parole! 
Yeah, umm..If you could just..er..pick up the phone, 
I'd like to talk to you, please!I've seen misery
And have a strange empathy
With the woman who kidnaps her lover
This love ain't a dream
I know it's obscene
The calls that I left for your motherI've been hanging around
Just in case you fall in love with me
I know you have doubts
I hear when you shout
'Cos I understand you see[Spoken]
I love you, too...everyday...perhaps someday we could meet...
face to face this time...[laughs]
I'm sorry about that letter I sent you...
the newspaper cuttings and stuff...and blood... [laughs]I've been hanging around
Just in case you fall in love with me
I know you have doubts
I hear you when you shout
'Cos I understand you seeJust tell me that you love me...hidden bonus track of the album "I've Been Expecting You"
