Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing


Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly, like birds on high
Then straight to her arms, I'd go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond the doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

I know beyond the doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

No more sailing
So long, sailing, sailing, sailing
Goodbye, farewell, my friend, no more sailing
So long, sailing, no more sailing
No more, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen to you
No more sailing
No more
Oh, no more sailing
No more, no more
No more sailing
No more, one more time
No more sailing
