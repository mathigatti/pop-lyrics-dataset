[spoken]
Jonathan: (american accent) Johnny and Robbie
Robbie: What you talking like that for, you're from Stoke!
Jonathan: I dunno but I can't stop here pally


Like the wallpaper sticks to the wall
Like the seashore clings to the sea
Like you'll never get rid of your shadow
You'll never get rid of me

Let all the others fight and fuss
Whatever happens, we've got us.

[Me and my shadow]
We're closer than pages that stick in a book
We're closer than ripples that flow in a brook
[Strolling down the avenue]
Wherever you find him, you'll find me, just look
Closer than a miser or the bloodhounds to Liza

Me and my shadow
We're closer than smogto all of L.A.
We're closer than Ricky to confessing he's gay??
Not a soul can bust this team in two
We stick together like glue

And when it's sleeping time
That's when we rise
We start to swing
Our clocks don't chime
What a surprise
They ring-a-ding-ding!
Happy New Year!

[Me and my shadow]
And now to repeat what I said at the start
They'll need a large crowbar to break us apart
We're alone but far from blue

Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll hit a few late spots, and then a few more
We'll start up at Stringy's and maybe ? show
Life is gonna be we-wow-whee!
For my shadow and me!

[spoken]
Jonathan: Can we do that again
Robbie: No, I'm too tired
Jonathan: Please Rob
Robbie: No, I'm swung out
Jonathan: I'll give you some money
Robbie: I don't need money
Jonathan: What about a cup of tea
Robbie: Not thirsty
Jonathan: I'll won't tell anyone you're gay.
(Both Laugh)

Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll hit all the late spots, and then a few more
We'll start up at Stringy's and maybe ? show
Life is gonna be we-wow-whee!
For my shadow and me!
