Rolling Stone

25 and I've come alive
21 was the time to come undone
Doesn't everyone
Very young and very ape
I would drink and stay up very late
And hate the sun


And now my heart kicks up a fuss
I'm a rolling stone
They say I'm dangerous but I'm never alone
I know that you're like me
You want your kids to free
We'll be a rolling stone

Got an A in attitude
Spent money on drugs to suite my mood
Guess I'm just like you
Being young is over rated
One day I'll be old and understated
But before I'm through

I run naked through the streets
Be a rolling stone
Define indid feet
In joy being alone
I know that you're like me
You want your kids to free
Be a rolling stone

Oh When we die we'll find out other ways
For getting drunk and throwing it all away
Today is tomorrow
I worry about yesterday
Its all in your head
So get out of your hair


And now your heart kicks up a fuss
Your a rolling stone
They say I'm dangerous but your  never alone

I know that you're like me
You want your kids to free
We'll be a rolling stone

You rolling stone

STONE
