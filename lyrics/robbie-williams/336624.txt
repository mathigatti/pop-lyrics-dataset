You see the trouble with me
I've got a head full of fuck
I'm a basket case
I dont think I can love, love, love


You see the trouble with you
Is your in love with me
What a strange thing to do
What a brave place to be

So we dive
On sunset strip
Our hearts so deep
I drown in it
And as it breaks
I swim through cracks
And leave with words
I can't take back

You see the trouble with me
Monkey see monkey do
There's no u in tomorrow
A better offer came through
You see the trouble with you
There's no trouble with you
So when you say that you love me
That stops me loving you

So she stays
On sunset strip
Our hearts so full
I drown in it
She's waiting for
My words to break
The one true love
I couldn't make

So she walks
That golden mile
Men will try
And catch her eye
We both know
What could have been
On sunset strip
Our broken dream
