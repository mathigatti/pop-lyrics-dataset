I smoked Consulate and Park Drive 
Drank Newcy Brown, learned how to skive 
Polo mints to hide my breath from my Mum 
Did a little weed 'cause it felt like fun 
Did a little speed if my friends had some 
Nicked Volkswagon badges, I'm a Beastie Boys son 
Me so horny, me so young, and I still get my washing done


Auntie Jo died of cancer, God didn't have an answer 
Rhythm was a dancer, any room for a chancer 
That's me in the corner, thanks Sir 
Wore a Troop track suit, British Knights shoes 
Kangol hat like L.L. Cools 
Before I was having it, having it large 
They nicked the B.M.X. from out my garage

And I knew it was Tire from off the estate 
'Cause every time I saw him he smiled like we were mates 
From then on in, I'd have to walk to me Nan's and I'll dream my dreams for a sea of prams 
Like a hooligan on the football stands and I threw the V's to Leeds and West Ham 
And then I ran, I ran so far away 
Down Scotia Road to a taxi bay 
Then I ran again 'cause I couldn't pay 
Young Muslim didn't get his fare that day 
I apologise today

Things look better when they start 
That's how the 80's broke my heart

And who are you calling poof 
You like Wham, man 
I hate that stuff 
And then my Granddad died and left a hole in the family 
And lots of women there to nanny me

School was a laugh, they didn't have A.D.D 
Thick was the term they used for me 
Over and over, repeatedly, over and over 
Take my breathe away, pass the bidley bidley bidley bidley bong 
Pass it on the left hand side 
Right turn, Clyde

That girl in the fourth year got pregnant 
She was raised Catholic, brilliant 
I cried, she cried, we cried 
Her youth died

Drank cider in the cemetery 
The year above us had discovered 'E' 
And I said it weren't for me 
Twelve pounds fifty 
I could rob my mum's purse and buy one off Chalky

Met a girl on Monday, drank fizzy pop on Tuesday 
Fingered her on Wednesday, and on Thursday and Friday, and on Saturday 
Dumped by Sunday

Things look better when they start 
That's how the 80's broke my heart 
The wonder years I've played my part 
That's how the 80's broke my heart

I lost my virginity to a girl called Anne-Marie 
Well, she said she fancied me 
And then she said "Fuck me" and I thought fuck me 
And I'm all talk and it'll be over too quickly 
And it was but I couldn't care less 
I'd seen a girl's part, made a mess on her dress 
Oh yes, you're now rocking with the best 
Second person in my year that had seen a breast

I'm in my 30s now and I'm still impressed 
Why the Falklands Mum, and what have they done 
Where do girls come, where do girls come from, where do girls come from 
It's the 80's what you looking at, you mong 
So young, so long, so young, so long 
Too short, so long 
What you looking at, you mong 
Too short, so long, too short, so long 
So long
