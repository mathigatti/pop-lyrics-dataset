We get it on most every night
When that moon is big and bright
Its a supernatural delight
Everybodys dancing in the moonlight


We get
Everybody here is out of sight
They dont bark and they dont bite
They keep things loose they keep it tight
Everybodys dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the moonlight
Everybodys feeling warm and bright
Its such a fine and natural sight
Everybodys dancing in the moonlight

We like our fun and we never fight
You cant dance and stay uptight
Its a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the moonlight
Everybodys feeling warm and bright
Its such a fine and natural sight
Everybodys dancing in the moonlight

We get in on most every night
And when that moon is big and bright
Its a supernatural delight
Everybodys dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the moonlight
Everybodys feeling warm and bright
Its such a fine and natural sight
Everybodys dancing in the moonlight

[repeat and fade]
