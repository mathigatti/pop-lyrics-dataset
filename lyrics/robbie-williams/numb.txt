Hey, you, how is your life?
Has something in you died?
Please don't think me rude
I've got a good excuse


Oh, 'cause I've been ticking like a time bomb
I've bit my tongue so much it's all gone
My hands are tied and I've become so numb
So numb, so numb, so numb

Sending out a message to the corners of the universe
A mayday from mother earth
The situation's so much worse than I thought
Can you hear the boy stood in the middle of the milky way
From ten billion miles away?
This is not where I belong
Never was, take me home

Come dance while we still can
'Cause the plans they have for man ain't no good
I tried to warn you all, you all, you all

'Cause I've been ticking like a time bomb
I've bit my tongue so much it's all gone
My hands are tied and I've become so numb
So numb, so numb, so numb

Sending out a message to the corners of the universe
A mayday from mother earth
The situation's so much worse than I thought
Can you hear the boy stood in the middle of the milky way
From ten billion miles away?
This is not where I belong
Never was, take me home

Sending out a message to the corners of the universe
A mayday from mother earth
The situation's so much worse than I thought
Can you hear the boy stood in the middle of the milky way
From ten billion miles away?
This is not where I belong
Never was, take me home
