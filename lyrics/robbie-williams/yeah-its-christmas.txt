There's twinkle lights
And colored balls
And holly bells
To deck the halls
But the turkey's burnt
All those arguments
Oh, it's Christmas
With neighbors Bob
And Betty here
The folks you see
But once a year
Eatin' all my food
Drinkin' all my beer
Yeah, it's Christmas


The red-suited, bearded, fat, man is on his way
But all I get is socks and bills to pay
'Cause we're celebratin' Christmas

And paper hats
And in a heap
And cracker kings
Are sound asleep
And the TV's on
But it all repeats
Yeah, it's Christmas

The red, cheap, jolly, fat, guy's on his sleigh
Oh, we're in debt, but there's a year to pay
'Til we're celebratin' Christmas

All hush falls on
The neighborhood
Kinda like
We knew it would
All is calm
All is good
Yeah, it's Christmas
