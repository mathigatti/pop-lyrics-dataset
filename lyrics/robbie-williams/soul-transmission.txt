Vacant in a photograph waiting
This isn't just a hurricane
When you know what's coming
It's a soul transmission


As we walk through history together
Do you think we still come from
This world we live on?
It's a sole condition

How does it feel
What do you want me to say?
I said it feels like being
Alone on Christmas day

Pretty soon the world will start shaking
Living in a tremolo
And I don't get injured
In my soul transmission

How does it feel
What do you want me to say?
I said it feels like being
Alone on Christmas day
Sights and sounds
At the end of the day
Make me feel like being
Alone on Christmas day

Go keep it up
It's your soul transmission
Go keep it up
It's your soul transmission
Go keep it up
It's your soul transmission
Go keep it up
It's your soul transmission

Waiting in an empty cathedral
To look at what I'm running from
And I don't get nervous
It's a soul transmission

How does it feel
What do you want me to say?
I said I feel like being
Alone on Christmas day
Sights and sounds
At the end of the day
Make you feel like being
Alone on Christmas Day
