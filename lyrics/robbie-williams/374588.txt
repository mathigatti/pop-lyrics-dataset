It's in the laxative they're cutting in the cocaine baby 
It's in the heroin, the ecstasy they're mixing lately 
Give me the boys and girls in bathrooms getting plenty friendly


With just the thought of us debauched and in the missionary 

Watch me out of my skull 
Watch me out of my mind 
I'm out of control 
But I'm still alive 
Go get me cigarettes 
Watch the circus pass by 
Twos up on an eighth 
All back to mine 

What a feeling 
Got steep my sweet dysfunction 
I'll keep on kneeling 
For my chemical devotion 
Let me kiss the ceiling 
It's just a notion for you 
More than a feeling 
That sweet devotion for you 

It's in the black sick and the choking on the blood and your
tears 
It's in the echo of the jackdaw ringing in your ears 
Watch me out of my gates 
Ill advised, unprepared 
No one gave a shit 
When nobody cared 
Another wasted talent 
But that's just fine 
Two's up on an eighth 
All back to mine 

What a feeling 
Got steep my sweet dysfunction 
I'll keep on stealing 
For my chemical devotion 
Don't kiss the ceiling 
More than a potion for you 
More than a feeling 
That sweet devotion for you 

I can't take the fever from you 
I don't want to neither 
They're dropping science on you 
You just need a breather 
I'll be looking over you 

Overlooking me 
It's all in God's time 
All back to mine 

What a feeling 
Got steep my sweet dysfunction 
So appealing 
This chemical devotion 
Got to kiss the ceiling 
More than an ocean for you 
More than a feeling 
That sweet devotion for you 

Shallow in the deep end 
Got steep my sweet dysfunction 
And I can depend 
On chemical devotion 
It's like my best friend 
That keeps the world in motion 
I've got to defend 
My chemical devotion
