I got this in my system
Takin' over
My imagination
Getting wider
This elastication
Automatic
No self-preservation
Pull me into shape


My testimony never fails
Like a metronome,on the nail
First thing in the morning
Late at night
Stretch me to the maximum
'Till I feel alright

Want you to
Push stronger
I need your elastic for tension
Wait longer
I need to release your potential

I want you to
I want you to
I want you to

Since you put your hand then
In the pocket
I've been rubberbandin'
I can't stop it
Stretch it to the distance
Don't you get it?
Makin' no resistance
Please don't let me go

My testimony never fails
Like a metronome on the nail
First thing in the morning
Late at night
Stretch me to the maximum
'Till I feel alright

Want you to
Push stronger
I need your elastic for tension
Wait longer
I need to release your potential

I want you to
I want you to
I want you to

It's your intervention
So demanding
Feel my surface tension
I'm expanding
Step into the same shape
Where I started
For your fascination
Elasticate my soul

My testimony never fails
Like a metronome on the nail
First thing in the morning
To late at night
Stretch me to the maximum
'Till I feel alright

Want you to
Push stronger
I need your elastic for tension
Wait longer
I need to release your potential
Push stronger
I need your elastic for tension
Wait longer
I need to release your potential

I want you to
I want you to
I want you to
