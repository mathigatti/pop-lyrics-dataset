I started a joke, 
which started the whole world crying, 
but I didn't see that the joke was on me, oh no. I started to cry, 
which started the whole world laughing, 
oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me. I looked at the skies, 
running my hands over my eyes, 
and I fell out of bed, 
hurting my head from things that I'd said. Til I finally died, 
which started the whole world living, 
oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me. I looked at the skies, 
running my hands over my eyes, 
and I fell out of bed, 
hurting my head from things that I'd said. 'Til I finally died, 
which started the whole world living, 
oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was one me. (appears on the compilation "Tribute to the Bee Gees")
