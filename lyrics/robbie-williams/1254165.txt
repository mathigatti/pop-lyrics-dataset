In (and out) 
In (and out) 
In (and out) 
In (and out) of love 
[4x] 


I can make no sense of the nonsense said 
That thing that is sad and bare 
My filter's broke so I'm resigned 
To say the first thing that comes to me mind 
Chisels off the chestnut Bonaparte 
How much for a broken heart 
Came for the money 
Staying for the art 
Now be a good girl and play your part 

Your precious heart 
It scared me from the start of this 
My soul in the dark 
Prepare me for the light 

I'm in and out of love 
Just like anyone 
I'm in and out of love 
Can't you see 
I'm in and out of love 
Just can't get enough 
You're in and out of love 
Just like me 

Time don't change things I do 
Cold and dead 'cause I'm sicker than you 
Careless now, if you care back 
Wish I could do a little better than that 
I'll admit that I'm out of my depth 
When I leave it with nothing left 
The DNA is not all mine 
It's not my fault 
It's my design 

Your precious heart 
It scared me from the start of this 
My soul in the dark 
Prepare me for the light 

I'm in and out of love 
Just like anyone 
I'm in and out of love 
Can't you see 
I'm in and out of love 
Just can't get enough 
You're in and out of love 
Just like me 

In (and out) 
In (and out) 
In (and out) 
In (and out) of love 
[2x] 
In (and out) 
In (and out) of love 
In (and out) 
In (and out) 

I've been told I could if I tried 
I did not like what was implied 
So I tried, the flowers died 
I guess I'm just a short term ride 
I'll be a cameo in your dream 
A big pop hero soda stream 
How good was I on your team 
You'd like me now, I'm really clean 

Your precious heart 
It scared me from the start of this 
My soul in the dark 
Prepare me for the light 

I'm in and out of love 
Just like anyone 
I'm in and out of love 
Can't you see 
I'm in and out of love 
Just can't get enough 
You're in and out of love 
Just like me 
[3x]
