Tell me a story
Where we all change
And we'd live our lives together
And not estranged


I didn't lose my mind it was
Mine to give away
Couldn't stay to watch me cry
You didn't have the time
So I softly slip away...

No regrets/ they don't work
No regrets now/ they only hurt
Sing me a love song
Drop me a line suppose it's just a point of view
But they tell me I'm doing fine

I know from the outside
We looked good for each other
Felt things were going wrong
When you didn't like my mother

I don't want to hate but that's
All you left me with
A bitter aftertaste and a fantasy of
How we all could live

No regrets/ they don't work
No regrets now/ they only hurt
(we've been told you stay up late)
I know they're still talking
(you're far too short to carry weight)
The demons in your head
(Return the videos they're late)
If I could just stop hating you
(goodbye)
I'd feel sorry for us instead

Remember the photographs (insane)
The ones where we all laugh (so lame)
We were having the time of our lives
Well thank you it was a real blast

No regrets/ they don't work
No regrets/ they only hurt
Write me a love song
Drop me a line
Suppose it's just a point of view
But they tell me I'm doing fine

Everything I wanted to be every
Time I walked away
Everytime you told me to leave
I just wanted to stay
Everytime you looked at me and
Everytime you smiled
I felt so vacant you treat me like a child
I loved the way we used to laugh
I loved the way we used to smile
Often i sit down and think of you
For a while
Then it passes me by and i think of
Someone else instead
I guess the love we once had is
Officially dead
