Take your time to unwind 
You will find it's love you are living 
Give it space, find your place 
You will see it's love you are giving Take your time and make things last
For the future and not the past 
I can't change the way I am 
It's all I've got, this cheap love song Take your time, make it right 
You will see it's all believing 
One fine day, you'll find a way 
You will reach your destination Same old crowds but different faces 
It's love we lost, but we're still chasing 
One day we'll leave this town 
It's all we've got, this cheap love song Take your time , feeling right 
You will see , it's all believing 
One fine day, you'll find a way
You will reach your destination Come on carry on now Baby make you proud now 
Hold your head up high now 
We're in love 
It's not superficial ... 
I'll make it official 
In love Carry on now(B-Side of the single "South of the border")
