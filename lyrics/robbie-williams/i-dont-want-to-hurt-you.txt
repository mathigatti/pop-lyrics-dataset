You can have anything
Anything, they say
A million sweet temptations
A billion times a day
Pale imitations is all I got
I want it all and you got the lot


I don't want to hurt you
Ain’t that what the players say?
While they seal your fate
And lie right to your face
I don't want to hurt you
'Cause I recognise the truth
That you cannot be replaced
So I'm just not going to

So you've chosen me
And honoured me with your love
You showed me a world
And what it could be made of
Thought you were crazy
To put your trust in me
'Cause I doubted myself
From the beginning so completely

I don't want to hurt you
Ain’t that what the players say?
While they seal your fate
And lie right to your face
I don't want to hurt you
'Cause I recognise the truth
You cannot be replaced
So I'm just not going to

I don't want to hurt you
Ain’t that what the players say?
While they seal your fate
And lie right to your face
I don't want to hurt you
'Cause I recognise the truth
You cannot be replaced
So I'm just not going to
