How Peculiar


I am all of the above babe
Johnny long strokes to the grave
Saving all the stamps and spend it on a kettle


Rub me rub me up right lovely
If you lick it, then lick it battery
Good and properly all night if you want

I haven't got a clue what to do with you
Need for you to love me so much
Jesus what am I gonna do with this crush
So get the old fella and whack it up against her tush

How peculiar

Bend your long legs against the sofa
In the Dorchester you can get your all bran
I'm not into hard sports

Oh I haven't got a clue what to do with you
Jesus all the things my head is going through
God what am I going to do with this crush
Just whack the old man out and get it up 
against your tush

How peculiar

Jesus what am I to do man
I am a depressed man
Not sure what I'm doing all of the day
How peculiar

I am all of the above man
I am what you want man
If you want me here I am
Come and get it baby
Uhh!
