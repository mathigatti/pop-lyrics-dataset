I,I,I
I'm on a mission
To abuse my position
Abuse it with you


Love, I'm a cynical bitch
I'm gonna scratch that itch
With a bitch like you

Modern thinking's made me miserable
Everything is unforgivable
If not for you
I wouldn't come at all

Find a place to crash
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
Move your boney ass
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)

Love me like I'm cash
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
You can feel the class
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)

Guitar

If there's a freak in here
Looking for someone like me
I fit that description
Perfectly

Boom boom boom
I bet they resent you
They would if they met you
Met you with me

Every move you make is poetry
They all fake what you do naturally
If not for you
I wouldn't come at all

Find a place to crash
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
Move your boney ass
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)

Love me like I'm cash
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
You can see the class
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)


Kiss me with your mouth
Teach me with your brain

All Right

Things that I say
When I say nothing at all
It leaves a taste in my stomach
And its no taste at all

I can sing, I can't dance
But it don't stop me at all
Its a ball and I'll call , if I call you at all

Love is the reason but it wont pay my rent
Only baloney fill your dish in the dent
I wont be happy till the moneys been spent
I forget to forget, oh forget, oh forget

yeah yeah yeah yeah
