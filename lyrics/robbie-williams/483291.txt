This is how I pray for the summertime
This is how I pray for the summer
Got my my glass of shandy
Now I feel fine
This is how I pray in the summer


If the more you pray
The more you stay
The less it's gettin you down

If the more you pray
The more you stay
The less it's gettin you down

Autumn time leaves fallin' all around
Wintertime follows suit
Little bunnies freezin' in the snow
Winter's such an ugly brute

Mid city blues gettin' you down
Take a break from the strain
Get out your card
And drink a glass of wine
Admit it you feel great
It's the summertime

This is how it feels in the summertime
This is how I feel in the summer

Got my glass of shandy
Now I feel fine
This is how I play, yeah

This is how I feel in the summertime
This is how I feel in the summer
Got my glass of shandy
And I feel fine
This is how I play, yeah

And if your love has met it's sad refrain
Believe me you will love again
All the best laid plans of my mice and men wrong
It's written in this song, oh

This is how we feel in the summertime
This is how we feel in the summer
What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine
This is how I play, yeah

This is how we feel in the summertime
This is how we feel in the summer
Take it back to the summer of 89
This is how I play, yeah, oh

This is how we feel in the summer, oh

Spoken:
The Mondays, the Roses
Blocking all your noses
Wearing baggy clothes
In our Buffalo poses
Bank tellers, stroppy little fellas
Loved up in the clubs
Of football thugs
No malice
A dicky dread locks
Boozin' off your socks
Big fish little fish
Card board box
Gimme french kiss
I'll love you from the rain
I dream of Santa Ana on the road to Mandalay
In the summertime
Where the weather is hot
In the summertime
Where the weather is hot
On my mind
On my mind
In the summertime
Where the weather is hot
In the summertime
I got shivers
Down my spine
