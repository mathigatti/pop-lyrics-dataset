December in London
Think I just been made redundant
95 or 96, I really can't remember which
Pack effects, no bags
Man, I like to travel lightly
Who knows what tonight or tomorrow will bring
Will I fall into a quiet room sayin', hold me now?


And even on the darkest night of the coldest year
(It's not Christmas night every night so come on bring your sex alive)
Hold my hand til' the last day of the year
(It's not Christmas night every night so come on bring your sex alive)

Made a bill, made a sin
I want my sex and drugs again
I call you up, to get a fix of northwest sex
Many cab, two patsies
I'm dodging paparazzi
I bet they wish they could see me now
As we fall into a quiet room sayin', hold me now?

And even on the darkest night of the coldest year
(It's not Christmas night every night so come on bring your sex alive)
Hold my hand til' the last day of the year
(It's not Christmas night every night so come on bring your sex alive)
And even on the darkest night

Now look at us, we're all grown up
No one to tell us when to stop
And you know we couldn't anyway
Yes, we'll have our way on Christmas day

And even on the darkest night of the coldest year
(It's not Christmas night every night so come on bring your sex alive)
Hold my hand til' the last day of the year
(It's not Christmas night every night so come on bring your sex alive)
And even on the darkest night
(Ooh, ooh)
Walk me out of here (ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
I'll walk you out of here (ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
I'll walk you out of here (ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
