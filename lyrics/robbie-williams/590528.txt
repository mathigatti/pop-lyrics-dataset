I walk into a room 
I say how do you do 
They look at me and I look back at them 
I slip into a chair
They say are you prepared I said I do not know 
Sometimes I feel it but I can't explain 
Sometimes I need and want them through my vains 
Now there's ten in front of me 
Asking me what do I see 
I see nothing but butterflies and 
Tests I did not know 
The answers will not show 
And all I see is butterflies and 
Sometimes I feel it but I can't explain 
Sometimes the answer's running to my brains 
And in the long run you always said I'll be there beside you 
And in the long run you always thought I'll be there to guide you 
Sometimes I feel it but I can't explain 
Sometimes I need it like a running train 
Sometimes I feel it in my pride 
Sometimes I take it in my stride 
Slow down feelings 
Loved up with you 
I can't feel my legs 
I can't feel you 
Slow down feelings 
Loved up with you 
The night before an hour, too 
On my back and leaving you 
Falling down the stairs and seen it through 
Falling down feelin' this 
Monday morning I feel out of sorts 
But that's ok 
Dried up and dreaming 
Punching and screaming 
Feeling the morning through 
Duuududududuudu 
Duuududududuudu 
Duuududududuududududu 
Duuududududuudu 
Duuududududuudu 
Duuududududuududududu
