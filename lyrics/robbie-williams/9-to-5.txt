She's a working girl, in a modern world
She's a working girl, in a modern world


Tumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come alive
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
Out on the street the traffic starts jumping
And folks like me on the job from nine to five

Working nine to five, what a way to make a living
Barely getting by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Wanna move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me

They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just another step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship will come in
Then the tide's goin' to turn and it's all gonna go your way

Working nine to five, what a way to make a living
Barely getting by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five and they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game, no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in their wallet

She's a working girl, in a modern world
She's a working girl, in a modern world
She's a working girl, in a modern world
She's a working girl

Working nine to five what a way to make a living
Barely getting by it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five and they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in their wallet
