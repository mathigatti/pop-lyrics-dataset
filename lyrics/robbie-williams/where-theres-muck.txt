Oh, I could tell you
Please try and understand
'Bout this ship left unmanned out at sea
The laughter there is canned
Cause the jokes are secondhand
God forbid, I didn't plan this mutiny


Before the boats were wreck
Send a dove to land on deck
Cause the noose around my neck is killing me

The anger makes me boil
The mistakes I make are royal
There's a sadness in the silent part of me.

Where there's muck
There's brass
Kiss my ass
Where there's muck
There's brass
Kiss my ass

I'm not asking you
I'm telling you
Kiss my ass

Don't tell me the truth
I know I've been uncouth
Well my breath's a hundred proof, I cannot breath.

Callin' ship to shore
Dunno what all the fuss is for
Save the women and the children after me

Before the boats were wreck
Send a dove to land on deck
Cause the noose around my neck is killing me

The anger makes me boil
The mistakes I make are royal
There's a sadness in the silent part of me.

Where there's muck
There's brass
Kiss my ass
Where there's muck
There's brass
Kiss my ass

I'm not asking you
I'm telling you
Kiss my ass
My ass
