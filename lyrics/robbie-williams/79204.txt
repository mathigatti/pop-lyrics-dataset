Oh, I'm your new best mate
Help me self-medicate
Things can all look great Stopped in this town to quench my thirst
The bad man got here first
Then the bubble burst Who's telling stories I can't handle shit
And it's beginning to bore me
Just get on with it
Kill me or cure me My love life's gone stiff
Don't know who I've been with
And I'm gonna take it cos they wanna give
Can you blame me? Don't need to spend my bread
People do that for me instead
Must be thinking that I'll wake up dead
In the morning I can't handle shit
And it's beginning to bore me
Just get on with it
Kill me or cure me You've got a powerful lawyerWell I've got money for ya
I know why I appall ya
But I fucked your daughter I got friends stay up till the end
Try to screw me or my girlfriend
Until I'm not the latest trend
Fetch me butler I can't handle shit
And it's beginning to bore me
Just get on with it
Kill me or cure me I can't handle shit
Kill me or cure me I can't handle shit
Kill me or cure me(B-Side of the single "Kids")
