Wasn't restless
I was fine
Casting pearls before swine
You weren't a tempest
Not at all
Just kind and beautiful


Little by little
You started making me love
We started making it up
We made up over and over and over
Little by little
You started making me love
Don't stop making it up
Let's make it over and over and over

Baby your cure could change the world
Cause your cure sure changed me
Little by little
You started making me love
You started making me love

I was reckless
You joined in too
I liked that about you
You saw it all that first night
The best and worst of me
But it didn't make you leave

I was never going to fall in love
That sort of thing  just wasn't for me
I made a promise to myself
A promise that I couldn't keep

It all make sense now
Me and you
Somehow we made it through
