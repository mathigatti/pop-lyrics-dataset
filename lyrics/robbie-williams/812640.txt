Oh, Madonna, Madonna

I don't miss you just who you used to be
And you don't ring true
So please stop calling me
Your "I love you" is are ten a penny
You're dropping clues like you've got any
You got to choose
There's been so many
ohhhh


(CHORUS)
I love you baby, but face it she's Madonna
No man on earth could say that he doesn't want her
This look of love says I'm leaving
You're frozen now
I've done the freezing
I'm walking out
Madonna's calling me

She's got to be obscene to be believed
That's her routine
Not what she means to me
I found myself by circumstance
Across a room where people dance
And quite by chance she' danced right next to me

(CHORUS)
I love you baby, but face it she's Madonna
No man on earth could say that he doesn't want her
It's me not you
I've got to move on
You're younger too, but she's got her groove on
I'm sorry love, Madonna's calling me

Oh, Madonna, Madonna

I want to tell you a secret

We're having drinks with Kate and Stella
Gwyneth's here, she's brought her fella
But all I wanna do is take Madonna home

(CHORUS)
I love you baby, but face it she's Madonna
No man on earth could say that he doesn't want her
It's me not you
I've got to move on
You're younger too, but she's got her groove on
I'm sorry love, Madonna's calling me
