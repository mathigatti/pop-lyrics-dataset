My breath smells of a thousand fags
And when I'm drunk I dance like me Dad
I've started to dress a bit like him
Early morning when I wake up
I look like Kiss but without the make up
And that's a good line to take it to the bridge
And you know and you know
'Cos my life's a mess
And I'm trying to grow so before
I'm old I'll confess
You think that I'm strong you're wrong
You're wrong
I'll sing my song my song my song


My bed's full of takeaways and fantasies
Of easy lays
The pause buttons broke on my video
And is this real cos I feel fake
Oprah Winfrey Rikki Lake
Teach me things I don't need to know

And you know and you know
'Cos my life's a mess
And I'm trying to grow so before
I'm old I'll confess
You think that I'm strong you're wrong
You're wrong
I'll sing my song my song my song

If I did it all again I'd be a nun
The rain was never cold when I was young
I'm still young we're still young
Life's too short to be afraid
Step inside the sun

And you know and you know
'Cos my life's a mess
And I'm trying to grow

And you know and you know
'Cos my life's a mess
And I'm trying to grow

And you know and you know
'Cos my life's a mess
And I'm trying to grow

You think that I'm strong you're wrong
You're wrong
I'll sing my song my song

You think that I'm strong you're wrong
You're wrong
I'll sing my song my song

Life's too short to be afraid
So take a pill to numb the pain
You don't have to take the blame

Life's too short to be afraid
So take a pill to numb the pain
You don't have to take the blame

Life's too short to be afraid
So take a pill to numb the pain
You don't have to take the blame
