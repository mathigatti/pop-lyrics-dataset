Out of a million seeds
Only the strongest one breathes
You made a miracle mother
I'll make a man out of me


Daddy where's the sun gone from the sky?
What did we do wrong, why did it die?
And all the grown ups say 'sorry kids we got no reply

If you're willing to change the world
Let love be your energy
I've got more than I need
When your love shines down on me

Every tear that you cry
Will be replaced when you die
Why don't you love your brother?
Are you out of your mind?

Daddy where's the sun gone from the sky?
What did we do wrong, why did it die?
And if you've got no love for me then I'll say goodbye

If you're willing to change the world
Let love be your energy
I've got more than I need
When your love shines down on me

If you're willing to change the world
Let love be your energy
I can't contain how I feel
When your love shines down on me

Well if you want it come and make a stance
So when it's in your hands
People show me love
Well if you want it come and make a stance
So when it's in your hands
People show me love

If you're willing to change the world
Let love be your energy
I got more than I need
When your love shines down on me

If you're willing to change the world
Let love be your energy
I can't contain how I feel
When your love shines down on me
