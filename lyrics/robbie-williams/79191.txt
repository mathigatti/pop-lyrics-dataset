I could be an animal, for many years to come
It would be understandable if this animal had fun
My wayward soul will never set me free
And commitments a miracle, I'm physical you see I'm not your lover, baby
I'm not the one
I won't meet your mother, lady
I, dont do love You won't buy my attitude, 
so its solitude for free
And I can't help being rude, 
if you get to close to me
You are the one, with your finger on the gun
So I am that animal, and animals will run I'm not your love's, baby
I'm not the one
I won't meet your mother, lady
I, dont do love I cant believe
It's not in me
You see me leave
If I can't breathe I could be an animal, for many years to come
It would be understandable, if this animal had fun
And Ive got my alibi, so I'll say goodbye I'm not your lover, baby
I'm not the one
Ive been too smothered lately
I, dont do love I can't believe
That you cant see
It's not in me
Now see me leave I, don't do love
I, don't do love
I, don't do love
I, don't do love
I, don't do love
I, don't do love(B-Side of the single "Supreme")
