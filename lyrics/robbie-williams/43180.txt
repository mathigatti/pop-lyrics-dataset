Where were you when you stole my pride
Did you ever get the feeling that someone died
Hide away in your ivory tower
And cover me in your golden shower
Did I make you laugh when I played the clown
And was I the dog that bit you when you put it down
Break it nicely break it slow
Break it so I got no place to go


Ego a go go now you've gone solo
Living on a memory
Where you been lately
And do you still hate me
Could you offer an apology

Aaah turn away
Aaah fade to grey

Where were you when the party ended
Were you stiching up the wounds that you thought I need mending
Wonderland has crashed to the ground
The circus has gone all that's left is the clowns
Did I break your heart when I stole your thunder
Was there woodworm in the table your feet are under
Break it nicely break it slow
Break so I got no place to go

Ego a go go now you've gone solo
Living on a memory
Now you've gone stately
And yes you do hate me
Could you offer an apology

Aaah turn away
Aaah fade to grey
Aaah I hope you've strayed
Aaah and got laid

Ego a go go
