When he saw her getting of the bus 
It seemed to wipe away the years 
Her face was older, just a little rough 
But her eyes were still so clear 
He drank his coffee and he hurried out 
Across before she walked away 
Then he approached her like a little child 
Too scared for what he had to say 


Hello, louise, 
Remember me? 
Now should we part 
Or stay awhile? 
As if we were still lovers 

She took a moment just to recognise the man shed known so well before 
And as he started to apologise 
Lose any bitterness she bore 
She gently put her finger on his lips 
To let him know she understood 
And with her suitcase standing on the floor 
Embraced him like a lover would 

He told louise 
You look so good 
Its just you see 
You make me feel 
As if we were still lovers 

Its not always true that time heals all wounds 
There are wounds that you dont wanna heal 
The memories of something really good 
Something truly real, that you never found again 

And though they talked for just a little time 
Before she said she had to go 
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign 
That told him all he had to know 

And so louise 
Waved from the bus 
And as she left 
She gave that smile 
As if they were still lovers
