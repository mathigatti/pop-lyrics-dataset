Put my hand on the Bible 
Doing it for liable 
It's suing season 
And I am broke Buy me some happy 
Find me some passion 
Will it ever happen? 
Heaven knows Sometimes you've got to get the joke 
It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat 
Who put this spanner in my spokes? 
I can't change how it's wrote Classy or flashy 
At home with Lassie 
They all walk past me 
I wouldn't know Make me a new man 
Find me a new plan 
I am a sports fan 
A real bloke Sometimes you've got to get the joke 
It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat 
Who put this chainsaw in my spokes? 
I can't change how it's wrote When my ship comes in 
She'll be on it 
Eating a fresh kebab 
And I want it 
And I want it now (Scat) Sometimes you've got to get the joke 
It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat 
Who put this chainsaw in my spokes? 
I can't change how it's wrote Sometimes you've got to get the joke 
It's the only thing that keeps this bloke afloat 
Who put this chainsaw in my spokes? 
I can't change how it's wrote Arse? (B-Side of the single "Angels")
