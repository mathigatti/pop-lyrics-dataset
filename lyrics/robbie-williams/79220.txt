Singing for the lonely
You're not the only one who feels this
So scared of what I'm doing
All the timeHere comes wasted head space
Paranoia, anger, misplaced
Feelings leave me nowhere
All the time
I don't wake up early every morning
'Cause the more I sleep the less I have to say
Scared of you always thinking that I'm boring
Stop me yawning my life away
Tender young confusion
Send black mariah for blue delusions
Lays heavy, oh so heavy
On my mindI'm so sick of people's expectations
Leaves me tired all the time
If your home's full of useless aggravation
Then don't bring it to mine
I seem to spend my life just waiting for
'Cause the verse is never nearly good enough
The hooligan half of me that steals from Woolworths
While the other lives for love
I'm so sick of people's expectations
Leaves me tired all the time
If your home's full of useless aggravation
Then don't bring it to mineSinging for the lonely
We're not the only ones who feel this
So scared of what I'm doing
All the time
Singing for the lonely
We're not the only ones who feel this
So scared of what we're doing
All the time
