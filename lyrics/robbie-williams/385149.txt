All aboard the family coach 
It's leaving Greenbank Road 
Christmas 1981 
Christmas when it snowed. 
Whilst on board the family coach 
They were circling the moon 
No one had been there before 
They were landing there in June 


Hey hey family coach 
My family coach 
You've got to make the most 
The most of your family coach

Meanwhile on the family coach 
The postillion quietly spoke 
He said, "You can not leave your family coach 
This is not a joke 
We must work out our differences 
Though none of us may change 
We all take different routes through life 
But your coach will stay the same". 

Hey hey family coach 
My family coach 
You've got to make the most 
The most of your family coach 

Hey hey family coach 
My family coach 
You've got to make the most 
The most of your family coach

Back on board Apollo 8 
They had gone behind 
And the human family held its breath 
And wondered what they'd find. 
Our family coach can stay on earth 
Or be a rocket ship 
But wherever, wherever you may go 
Your kin will share the trip. 

Hey hey family coach 
My family coach 
You've got to make the most 
The most of your family coach

Now it might well appear to you 
That they were simpler days 
And the family coach is smaller now 
Some have passed away 
But there's never been a golden age 
Nostalgia's for the lame 
The best is yet to come 
It's that kind of game. 

Hey hey family coach 
My family coach 
You've got to make the most 
The most of your family coach

Hey hey family coach 
My family coach 
You've got to make the most 
The most of your family coach
