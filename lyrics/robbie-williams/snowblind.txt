I'm snowblind
Looking at you
Let me melt a while in your company
I unwind in your rapture
I'm an overture to your symphony


Time makes time
A memory between us
Am I still impossible to read?

While the whole world was looking at you
You came and wrapped yourself around me

You feel the sun
A work in progress
I'm so far away from where I wanna be
You stole my heart
But my madness
Is taking the man right out of me

You said, we could have been good together
I complicate so easily

While the whole world was looking at you
You wrapped yourself around me

So wonderful
Feeling so vulnerable
You'll never know what you did to me
Can't disguise
I'm hiding behind my eyes
You could've meant the whole world to me
