There was a time
When crazy days would start with wine
And now I tow a different line
I stay in bed and use my loaf instead of my bread
And stroll on 'cos I've been thinking so long
That something's gonna go wrong
It's gone to my head my vision's all blurred
And my legs feel like lead


But I'm clean yeah
Friends with Mr. Sheen yeah
Don't have to wean myself off of nothing
I'm two minutes clean and that's not very often
Stroll on

There was a time
When I would dread waht I had said
Waking up in someone's bed
Wondering who I was
Naked and cold with an ache in my head
And stroll on 'cos I've been thinking so long
That something's gonna go wrong
It's gone to my head my vision's all blurred
And my legs feel like lead

But I'm clean yeah
Friends with Charlie Sheen yeah
Gonna meet the Queen yeah
She's two minutes clean
And that's not very often
Stroll on and on

Clean yeah
Friends with Mr Sheen yeah
Don't have to wean myself off of nothing
I'm two minutes clean
And that's not very often
I'm clean yeah
Gonna meet the Queen yeah
I won't be obscene yeah
'cos I'm two minutes clean
And that's not very often
Stroll on and on and on and on and on
Oh yeah
