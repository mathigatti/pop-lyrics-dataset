Into bursting, into flames
You burn so brightly
To shame the shamed 
Feeling feelings, were never yours 
You woke up screaming

74, 74, 74, 74 
Child of the 80's
The Hillsborough crush 
That girl in the fourth year
That was up the duff 
Lisa Parkes I loved you
But you never saw 
A year below you
1974
1974 
You're face now fear here 
You're getting skanks 
Must be a reason 
why i'm shooting blanks
If you were the somewhere
Right in my life 
The only saviour
You're mine tonight 
Big wheel turning
Down by the river 
Found my calling
Down by the river 
Wanna live forever
So far so good 
Now I trust myself better
God I wish you would
I've never been unfaithful
Good with the law 
I know I've been faithful 
1974
1974 
I'll die in your footsteps 
Trade on your name 
I'll kill you with kindness 
If you hurt me again 
Standing in the rain 
Thinking of you tonight 
I've been searching for a meaning 
Trying to find a wife 
Loving all persons
To make it alright 
I've been singing in the rain
Watching over you tonight 
Stunned by the saddest 
songs she used to sing 
Don't look for tomorrow today
Goodbye dear Sunday
It's been fun now it's Monday 
Everything's coming up roses
