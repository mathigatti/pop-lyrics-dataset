I box 'em up with a bow
Then I go pole to pole
Rudolph, follow your nose
(Rudolph, follow your nose)
To Japan, Isle of Man
Down to Cannes and Kazhakstan
Rudy knows where to go
(Rudy knows where to go)


Rudy knows where to go
(Rudy knows where to go)
Through the sky and the snow
Man, it's forty below
Watch me as I go, oh

Hear the Christmas choir
Chorus from the street below
Boys and girls that say they saw us
Dashing through the snow, oh

Over the hills and far, far away
You can be sure that I'm on my way

I meet myself, coming back
Now I'm going faster than fast
I go back to the past
(I go back to the past)
Down the flutes, in my boots
Now I'm covered in soot
Mrs. Claus will go mad
(Mrs. Claus will go mad)

Mrs. Claus will go mad
(Mrs. Claus will go mad)
I'll be dealing with that
But it's all in the plan
And she knows I'm the man

Hear the Christmas choir
Chorus from the street below
Boys and girls that say they saw us
Dashing through the snow, oh

Over the hills and far, far away
You can be sure that I'm on my way

Hear the Christmas choir
Chorus from the street below
Boys and girls that claim they saw us
Dashing through the snow, oh
