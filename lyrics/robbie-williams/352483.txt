I don't remember it's even your postcard
I never got much post so it should'nt have been too harm
You were on holiday with your school in some french town
And while you were away I took Debby to the crown


I feel that all the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

I found your postcard and I put on the wall
I found your picture ya know tears are about to fall
I didn't write you songs when we were going out
So why should I start now you're not about

I feel that all the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

We hardly used to even drink we didn't smoke
We walk on from the pub 'cause we were always broke
So when your mother called and said that you were dead
I thought she's talking of another Kim instead

I feel that all the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

She said it seems you're accidentally overdosed 
It was so long since I talked to her and once we were so close 
And I am left with all these things I didn't say 
And a picture of you in my arms the day you went away 

I feel that all the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

I feel that all the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly
