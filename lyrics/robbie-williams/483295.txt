You've done it all 
You've broken every code 
Pull this level to the floor 
You've spoilt the game 
Don't matter what you say 
The lonely metal, what a ball 
Oh blue eyes, blue eyes 
How could you tell so many lies 
Come up and see me 
Make me smile 
And do what you want 
For a little while 


Come up and see me 
Make me smile 
And do what you want 
For a little while 

( Mr Tom Jones ) 

You Can Leave Your Hat On 

Let me take off your coat ( tell 'em Tom ) 
Real slow 
Let me take off your shoes 
I'll help you take off your shoes 
( Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah ) 
You give me reason to live 
You give me reason to live 
You give me reason to live 
You give me reason to live 

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 

Well you can leave your hat on 
You can leave your hat on 
You can leave your hat on 

You can leave your hat on 

Land Of A 1000 Dances 

One Two Three 
One Two Three 

You've got to know how to pony 
Like a mony de roady 
Mashed potato 
And do the alligator 




Put your hand on your hip 
And let your back bone slip 
Do wah tootsie 
Like your auntie Lucy 

Na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na
