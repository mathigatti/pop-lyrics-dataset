Don't... 
Don't stop talking 
'Cause when you start gain 
It won't make sense. 


Don't.. 
Don't stop breathing 
You've got to carry on 
Despite the evidence. 
'Cause we.. we'll fall in love 
Because we need.. to fall in love. 

Chorus: 
I am here 
Dumb enough to care too much 
And young enough to believe in love 
Where are you? 
Overdose on liberty. 
I was never meant to be that free… 
So.. I believe.. that you… and I.. 
Must go out. 

Don't.. 
Don't stop walking 
'Cause when you start again 
Nothing starts again. 
And don't… 
Don't stop singing 
When you start a song 
Sing it to the end 
'Cause we.. we'll fall in love 
Because we need.. to fall in love. 

Chorus 

As sure as men created God 
We were meant to be in love 
I'm sure if God created us 
He'd realise 
That we are right 
We must go out tonight 

Chorus 

Ooh oh 
Must go out tonight 
Yeah yeah 
Must go out tonight 
Ooh oh 
Must go out tonight 
I'm right 
Must go out Tonight
