Have you met Miss Jones
Someone said as we shook hands
She was just Miss Jones to me
And then I said Miss Jones
You're a girl who understands
I'm a man who must be free
And all at once I lost my breath
And all at once was scared to death
And all at once I on the Earth and sky


And now I've met miss Jones
And we'll keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I

(All repeat once)

Miss Jones and I
Miss Jones and I
Ha!
