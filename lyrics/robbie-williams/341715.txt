For those about to die
We salute you
For those of about to cry
We love you
For those of us who live in fear
Of happy christmas and new year
I raise a toast to you


And if it hurts
To be so blind
Why dont you try
Being kind

They decided to become
A little more romantic
Creep up on you
While you sleep
I´ll make you less attractive

Born without a spine
Why dont you try
Being kind

For those attempting their mother´s way
You´ll find a way to soldier on
For those whose love evaporates
I pray you find where you belong
All the words i have repressed
Are coming out today
I guess
It is justice not respect and avarice

And that just leaves comtempt
For you all
Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
Yeah

I am just a simple man
With simple expectations
Deep regrets
They´re seldom met
God speed my generation

And with ? on my mind
I should try being kind

For those about to die
We salute you
For those of about to cry
We love you
For those about to die
We salute you
For those of about to cry
We love you
