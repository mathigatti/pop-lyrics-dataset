She's taking me places I should never have been
She's showing me faces I should never have seen
Well these are strange days we're living in today
C'est la vie I say


I hope I'm old before I die
I hope I live to relive the days gone by
I hope I'm old before I die
But tonight I'm gonna live for today
So come along for the ride
I hope I'm old before I die

She's not feeling stable, she's unable to breathe
Her heart's beating faster so I'll ask her to leave
These are strange days we're living in today
Am I straight or gay ?

I hope I'm old before I die
I hope I live to see the day the Pope gets high
I hope I'm old before I die
Well tonight I'm gonna live for today
So come along for the ride
I hope I'm old before I die

Well these are strange days we're living in today
C'est la vie I say, I say. I say

I hope I'm old before I die
I hope I live to relive the days gone by
I hope I'm old before I die
But tonight I'm gonna live for today
So come along for the ride
I hope I'm old before I die
I hope I'm old before I die
Old before I die
Old before, old before I die and die and die and die
Old before I die
Old before I die
