(Robbie)
Come on hold my hand,
I wanna contact the living.
not sure I understand,
this role I've been given.


I sit and talk to God
and he just laughs about plans,
my head speaks a language I don't understand.

I just wanna feel real love,
fill the home that I live in.
'Cause I got too much life,
running through my veins, going to waste.

I dont wanna die, 
but I ainÂ´t keen on living either.
Before I fall in love,
I'm preparing to leave her.
I scare myself to death,
that's why I keep on running.
Before I've arrived, I can see myself coming.

I just wanna feel real love,
fill the home that I live in.
'Cause I got too much life,
running through my veins, going to waste.

and I need to feel, real love 
in a love ever after.
I cannot get enough.

(Lucy)
Tell me what is it you feel,
All the things that you've achieved,
When you say that you're not hurting,
You cannot hide the truth,
Even though they lied to you,
Tell me what's the game,
What is it you feel?

(Robbie)
I just wanna feel,
I just wanna feel,
I just wanna feel real love,
fill the home that I live in,
I got too much love, 
running through my veins,  to go to waste.
And I need to feel real love,
fill the home that I live in,
I got too much love, 
running through my veins,  to go to waste.

not sure I understand.
not sure I understand.
not sure I understand.
not sure I understand.
