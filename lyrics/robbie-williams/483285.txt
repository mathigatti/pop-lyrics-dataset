Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away


Come fly with me, let's float down to peru
In lama land, there's a one man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

Once I get you up there,
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You may here, angels cheer - just because we're together

Weather wise it's such a lovely day
Just say the words, and we'll beat the birds
Down to acapulco bay
It's perfect, for a flying honeymoon - they say
Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away

Hit it jack

Once I get you up there,
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
And you may here, angels cheer - just because we're together

Weather wise it's such a kooky day
Just say the words, and I'll beat the birds
Down to acapulco bay
It's perfect, for a flying honeymoon - they say
Come fly with me
Pack up let's fly away
