On the road to Damascus 
I met you and the task was thankless 
We were carefree and classless 
And then you changed 
I´m nouveau rich 
What can I do 


You´re legionnaires on a summer breeze 
It´s who you do 
You had something to put to me now 
I got something I´m gonna stick in you 

I couldn´t give a flying toss ´bout the relatives you lost 
I think it´s better that 
Your bloodline stops from here 
On in and 
Whoops there I go again 
With friends that I wanna rip apart 

Limb by limb 
Soak the skin with paraffin 
Drop a row 
Hit´n the limb 
And Max let´s see what happens 
Hey now you´re getting in my way now 
You´re a waste of time 
You´re a waste of time 

You got under my radar 
You said kicking shins in the clock end 
Was just a phase so I paged ya 
And you became my new best friend 
For a while 

I should have known you were a psychopath 
It´s who you do 
I was lonely we were having a laugh 
Should have known but worshipped a few 

I couldn´t give a flying toss ´bout the relatives you lost 
I think it´s better that 
Your bloodline stops from here 
On in and 
Whoops there I go again 
With friends that I´d like to tear apart 

Limb by limb 
Soak the skin with paraffin 
Drop a row 
Hit´n the limb 
Oh Max let´s see what happens 

Hey now there´s nothing left to say now 
You´re just a waste of time
