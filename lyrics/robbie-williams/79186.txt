"Ok settle down you all, settle down lady,
he's gonna be on stage real soon, that's right
Mama put your popcorn down, he's turning to the
band, yeah he's running his legs off, ladies
and gentlemen Mr Robbie Williams" Just because your dyslexic
Doesn't mean your not fake 
We know you're not that stupid 
You'll marry someone rich 
Bet you won't steal his watch 
When your down by near his crotch 
That'll explain the itch
You were such a lying bitch I know you hold my suitcase
Down in Kensington 
And you were screwing Ewen 
When I wasn't in. 
Did it to me, you'll do it to him
Your friends just gave me grief 
I will make this brief
You were such a lousy thief
You were such a lousy thief
But you were good in bed
You were good in bed
So good in bed Now you tell my girlfriend
That I'll never change
You've been up since Wednesday
Don't you find that strange
You're ex-boyfriend is deranged
You'll tell them down in Browns Haven't been for years 
It's full of coke &amp; tears
Full of coke &amp; tears
Full of coke &amp; tears
But you were good in bed
Good in bed [Elvis Impersonator - Spoken]
