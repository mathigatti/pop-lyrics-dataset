When I look you in the lies,
Something deep inside me dies,
’Cause I know you won’t get better, better, better…
You’d rather be right done with love,
The only thing I understood
Nothing’s ever good enough.


I stumble through the words as they’re leaving me,
Tremble at the side of your majesty,
And I cut myself just to get them out.

This time I’ll be different, I promise you,
This time I’ll be special, you know I will,
Just don’t leave with me in your eyes.
This time I’ll be better, I want you to know,
This time I’ll be special, oh God, make it so,
Just don’t leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes…

You took my youth, you took my health,
And if you’re not here I find myself
You’re supposed to make this better, better, better
No self-control and no reason why,
If I don’t change, then we both die,
This is it for you and I.

Blisters at the end of my fingertips,
Praying to a God I don’t think exist
Will you listen now?
Can you forgive me somehow?

This time I’ll be different, I promise you,
This time I’ll be special, you know I will,
Just don’t leave with me in your eyes.
This time I’ll be better, I want you to know,
This time I’ll be special, oh God, make it so,
Just don’t leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes…

Closer now to the end,
If love was the answer,
Then what was the question?
Closer now, let’s pretend
We’ve never been out here before.

This time I’ll be different, I promise you,
This time I’ll be special, you know I will,
Just don’t leave with me in your eyes.
This time I’ll be better, I want you to know,
This time I’ll be special, oh God, make it so,
Just don’t leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes…
