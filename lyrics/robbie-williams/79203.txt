Did you do that girl that was in that soap
..... Did ya
Will you save the whale, 
will you be Bob Hope.... Will ya
I'll tell you about my Pepsi deal if you like
A celebrity village bike with a mike
I get more press when there's a war on Come sing a song with me
A simple symphany
I'll be a karaoke star
Lush strings and Timpani
Have got it in for me
Look how i'm dancing...love Justify what you get paid..Can ya
Doctors save lives and you get layed
...Dont ya
Apologise for the job that you do
It would be nice if you were talented too
I think you better lock up your daughter Come sing a song with me
My simple symphany
I'll be a kareoke star
Lush strings and Timpani
Have got it in for me
Look how im dancing...love (Instrumental &amp; soft spoken words) Everyone say I'm pretty
Everyone say I'm handsome(B-Side of the single "Kids")
