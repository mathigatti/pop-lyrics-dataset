We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late,
Millennium


Some say that we are players
Some say that we are pawns
but we've been making money
since the day that we were born
Got to slow down, cause we'll low down.

We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late,
'cause we know we're falling from grace
Millennium

Live for liposuction, detox for your rent
Overdose for Christmas and give it up for Lent
My friends are all so cynical
refuse to keep the faith
We all enjoy the madness
'cause we know we're gonna fade away.

We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late,
'cause we know we're falling from grace
Millennium

Come and have a go
if you think you are hard enough
Come and have a go
if you think you are hard enough
Millennium

Millennium
And when we come we always come too late
I often think that we were born to hate
get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes.
