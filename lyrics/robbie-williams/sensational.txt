You've been sensational
You really did your bit
It's been emotional
You know I love that shit
You look incredible
Even from afar
I think you're sexy and you're funny
And I love you 'cause you love me
And I wish that you could always stay
Now go away


It's so unusual to feel this good
I'd sing forever if I could
Maybe I should
I'm that good
You better believe it

You've been so beautiful
It's just who you are
I'd have you up here
But I'm the star
I wanna get physical
But ain't that about a bitch
And isn't it a pity
That I gotta leave the city
But you knew it had to end this way
Now go away

It's so unusual to feel this good
I'd sing forever if I could
Maybe I should
I'm that good
You better believe it

You've been affectionate
You dirty bunch of sluts
So disproportionate
Loving you so much
I'm hung like a dolphin
Maybe I've said too much

Yeah, I'm semi-serious with you right now
God bless you all, I love you so much
I love you so much
Auf Wiedersehen
Bless you all, I love you so much
I love you so much
Auf Wiedersehen
Bless you all, I love you so much
I love you so much
Auf Wiedersehen
Bless you all, I love you so much
I love you so much
Auf Wiedersehen
