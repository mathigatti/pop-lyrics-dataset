The snow's coming down
I'm watching it fall
Lots of people around
Baby please come home


The church bells in town
All ringing in song
Full of a happy sounds
Oh baby please come home

They're singing, Deck The Halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

Pretty lights on the tree
Yeah I'm watching them shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home

They're singing, Deck The Halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

If there was a way
I'd hold back this tear
But it's Christmas day
Please please please please
Please please please please
Please baby please come home
Please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Yeah yeah yeah
Baby please come home
Please come home
Yeah yeah
