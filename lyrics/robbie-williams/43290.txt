Every night I sit here by my window (window)
Starin' at the lonely avenue (avenue)
Watching lovers holdin' hands 'n' laughin' (laughin')
And thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do


CHORUS
(Thinkin' bout things) Like a walk in the park
(Things) Like a kiss in the dark
(Things) Like a sailboat ride
(Yeah-yeah) What about the night we cried?
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do

Memories are all I have to cling to (cling to)
And heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to (betcha got menow)
When I'm not thinkin' 'bout just how much I love you (I love youtoo)
I'm-a thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do

CHORUS

Still can hear the jukebox softly playin' (playin')
And the face each day I see belongs to you (belongs to you)
Though there's not a single sound and there's nobody elsearound
It's just me thinkin' of the things we used to do

CHORUS

And the heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to
You got me thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do (I hope so)
Thinkin' bout the things we used to do
