Will you stay in our lover's story 
If you stay you won't be sorry 
Cos we believe in you 
Soon you'll grow, So take a chance 
With a couple of Kooks hung up on romancing We bought a lot of things 
to keep you warm and dry 
A funny old crib on which the paint won't dry 
I bought you a pair of shoes 
A trumpet you can blow and a book of rules 
Of what to say to people when they pick on you 
Cos if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty 
Kooky too Won't you stay in our lover's story 
If you stay you won't be sorry
Cos we believe in you 
Soon you'll grow, So take a chance 
With a couple of Kooks hung up on romancing If you ever have to go to school 
Remember how they messed up this old fool 
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads 
I'm not much cop at fighting other people's dads 
And if the homework brings you down 
Then we'll throw it on the fire 
And take the car down town Won't you stay in our lover's story 
If you stay you won't be sorry 
Cos we believe in you 
Soon you'll grow, So take a chance 
With a couple of Kooks hung up on romancing Won't you stay in our lover's story 
If you stay you won't be sorry 
Cos we believe in you 
Soon you'll grow, So take a chance 
With a couple of Kooks hung up on romancing(B-Side of the single "Old before I die")
