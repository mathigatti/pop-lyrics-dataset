Dear Eva Friedel 
Got a brand new needle for you 
You said weed was evil 
So we smoked it in the lobby in the hotel foyer 
It wasn't even noon yet 
We didn't want to peak too soon yet 
But when the sun goes down through the after glow 
The night is yours, but your mother should never know


Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star 
You rock like a bastard, plastered
You should have seen her 
Everything we did was wunderbar 
'Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus

Eva tore my heart out 
I got wasted in action 
But you know that I am a sucker for 
instant satisfaction 
There's nothing more obscene now than seeing where I've been 
But you learn you know, to see the after glow 
You've got to burn to grow, but your 
mother should never know

Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star 
You rock like a bastard, plastered
You should have seen her 
Everything we did was wunderbar 
'Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus

You were everything, everything, 
everything to me 
You were everything, everything, 
everything to me 
You were everything, everything, 
everything to me 
You were everything, everything, 
everything to me

Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star 
You rock like a baster, plastered 
You should have seen her 
Everything we did was wunderbar 
'Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus 
everything, everything, everything to me you were everything,
everything, 
everything to me 
Everything we did was wunderbar 
'Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus 
You were everything, thing, thing, 
everything to me 
I still love you, I do 
Everything, everything, everything now
