Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words can burn a happy home
It's true
I've got words for you
The past is done
It's gone forever
Don't tell me my pain is pleasure
You, you haven't got a clue


(Chorus)
I, I wanna cry but I don't make a sound
I am your child and your child is feeling down
Everybody's toxic in this town

All God's children fade and die
In the name of let's get high
Amen, you'd do it again
I pray to lord, my soul, my kid
When you're coming down I'll be asleep
I can't pretend
It's killing me again

Chorus

Call me my Lord
I'm coming down
Call me my Lord
I'm coming down

Chorus x 2

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words can burn a happy home
It's true
I've got words for you
