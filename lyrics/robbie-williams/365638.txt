First they ignore you
Then laugh at you and hate you
Then they fight you - then you win
When the truth dies
Very bad things happen
They're being heartless again 


I know it's coming
There's going to be violence
I've taken as much
As I'm willing to take
Why do you think 
We should suffer in silence
When a heart is broken 
There's nothing to break

(Chorus Backing Vocal: 
Want you to love me 
Want you to be
The heavens above me
Eternally) 

You've been mixing 
With some very heavy faces
The boys have done a bit of bird
They don't kill their own
And they all love their mothers
But you're out of your depth son 
Have a word 

I know it's coming 
There's going to be violence
I've taken as much 
As I'm willing to take
Why do you think 
We should suffer in silence
The heart is broken 
There's nothing to break 

All is wonderful in past lives
Dreaming of the sun she warms
You should see me in the afterlife
Picking up the sons of dust 

When you think we're lost 
We're exploring
What you think is worthless
I'm adoring
You don't want the truth 
Truth is boring
I got this fever need to
Leave the house leave the car
Leave the bad men where they are
Leave a few shells in my gun
Stop me staring at the sun 

I know it's coming 
There's going to be violence
I've taken as much 
As I'm willing to take
Why do you say 
We should suffer in silence
My heart is broken 
There's nothing to break
