That old black magic has me in a spell
Old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine
The same old tingle that I feel inside
And then that elevator starts to ride
Down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire
For ever, lover, I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Darling, down and down I go, round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
Oh, in a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with burning desire
That only your kiss could put out the fire
For ever, lover, I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Darling, down and down I go, round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in 
Under that old black magic called love
Oh, in a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
Under the old black magic called love, love, love, love, love
