Unsealed, on a porch a letter sat
Then you said, 'I wanna leave it again'
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I wanna leave it again, yeah
On a weekend, I wanna wish it all away, yeah
And they called and I said that I want what I said
And then I call out again
And the reason, oughta' leave her calm, I know
I said, 'I know what I wear, not a boxer or the bag'
Ah yeah...can you see them?
Out on the porch, yeah, but they don't wave
I see them, round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know I don't want to stay
Make me cry
I see, ooh...I don't know why there's something else
I wanna drum it all away
Oh, I said, I don't, I don't know a-where there's a boxer or the bag'
Ah yeah, can you see them?
Out on the porch, yeah, but they don't wave
I see them, round the front way, yeah
And I know, and I know, I don't wanna stay alone
I don't wanna stay
I don't, don't wanna
