I,ve got your rainbows seen your sunbeams
I know a place where heaven breathes
And it's through her window
Your baby girl's windowI know your happy where you are
Singing to the moon talking to the stars
Through her window
Your baby girl's windowThere's finger marks around her soul
But your laughter fills the hole
Through her window
Your baby girl's window Aaah I wish you would stay
Aaah to see what she made of herselfPeople say you were gone too soon
I see your face when flowers bloom
Through her window
Your baby girl's windowI'm looking for the words to say
Something to take the pain away
Through her windowAaah I wish you would stay
Aaah to see what she made of herself
