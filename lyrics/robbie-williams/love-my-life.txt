Tether your soul to me
I will never let go completely
One day our hands will be
Strong enough to hold me


I might not be there for all your battles
But you'll win them eventually
I'll pray that I'm giving you all that matters
So one day you'll say to me

I love my life
I am powerful
I am beautiful
I am free
I love my life
I am wonderful
I am magical
I am me
I love my life

I am not my mistakes
And God knows I've made a few
I started to question the angels
And the answer they gave was you

I can not promise there won't be sadness
I wish I could take it from you
But you'll find the courage to face the madness
And sing it because it's true

I love my life
I am powerful
I am beautiful
I am free
I love my life
I am wonderful
I am magical
I am me
I love my life

Find the
Others
With hearts
Like yours
Run far
Run free
I'm with you

I love my life
I am powerful
I am beautiful
I am free
I love my life
I am wonderful
I am magical
I am me
I love my life
I am powerful
I am beautiful
I am free
I love my life
I am wonderful
I am magical
I am me
I love my life

And finally
I'm where I wanna be
