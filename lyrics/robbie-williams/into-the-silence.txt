When karma reaches you I wanna be there just in case it needs to
You made me be so cruel to myself
The love of power or the power of love
You need help


When karma reaches you i wanna be there to catch that fall
Get down beside you and watch you crawl
How does it feel to be alone?
Down there?

When you fall apart again
It won't break my heart

If i told you my secrets
You’d never look at me the same way
Well i guess you’re right, some things i can’t change

When karma reaches you i wanna be there just in case, let me tell

I won’t fall apart again
I don’t test my heart

Is there any wonder
With the sadness inside us
Was it sent for the hunger?
Was it meant to divide us?

Into the silence
Into the silence
Into the silence
Into the silence

When karma reaches you i wanna be there to catch that fall
Get down beside you and watch you crawl
How does it feel to be alone?
Down therer

Don't  fall apart again
Don’t test my heart

Is there any wonder
With the sadness inside us
Was it sent for the hunger?
Was it meant to divide us?

Into the silence
Into the silence
Into the silence
Into the silence
