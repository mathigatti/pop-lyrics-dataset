You do something that reminds me
The days of rage are now behind me
I have to live outside the law
Cause i’m a naughty boy with a dirty habit
Tryin to use some teenage magic beacon
Panties off the floor


And when she comes, she comes for hours
No, she don’t fake for no one, she don’t fake for no one
And the flaw gives it away with you
It’s true, i was close to do
And fall in love

Oh baby, please
Begging, my darling please
Under the covers
You and me are not like the others
You and me are not like the others

Please
Begging, my darling please
God loves the lover
You and me are not like the others
You and me are not like the others

You do something that reminds me
I’ve no resistance, follow blindly
And baby, that’s what i came here for
Cause i pulled me out of my sedation
Back to the side street, levitation
Another sexual makes a fall

So when you come, she crawl for hours
No, i don’t fake for no one
She don’t fake for no one
And the flaw gives it away with you
It’s true, i was close to do
And fall in love

Please
Begging, my darling please
Under the covers
You and me are not like the others
You and me are not like the others

Please
Begging, my darling please
God loves the lover
You and me are not like the others
You and me are not like the others

We are not like the others
Under, under the covers
God loves, god loves the lover
We are not like the others

We are not like the others
Under, under the covers
God loves, god loves the lover
We are not like the others

Please
Begging, my darling please
Under the covers
You and me are not like the others
You and me are not like the others

Please
Begging, my darling please
God loves the lover
You and me are not like the others
You and me are not like the others
