Lazy days, calling to you
Come out to play, the future lies with you
Now you can be sure, love is the cure 
What we're waiting for 
Is to have a jolly good time 


[chorus]
Guess being young ain't such a crime 
You're worth a million every time
It's just me and you
Your yesterday is far away 
Don't wanna go home, wanna stay
Nothing left to lose, my friends
My friends

Crazy days, but you'll get me through
And here I'll stay, holding onto you 
Now you can be sure, our thoughts unpure
Will unlock the door 
And we will have a jolly good time 

[chorus]
Guess being young ain't such a crime 
You're worth a million every time
It's just me and you
Your yesterday is far away 
Don't wanna go home, wanna stay
Nothing left to lose, my friends
My friends

But well, don't let them get you down
So wear a smile, I don't wanna see you frown
Now you can be sure, love is the cure 
What we're searching for 
Is to have a jolly good time

[chorus]
Guess being young ain't such a crime 
You're worth a million every time
It's just me and you
Your yesterday is far away 
Don't wanna go home, wanna stay
Nothing left to lose, my friends
My friends
