Tell me where the autumn went
I missed it
Spring and summer flew by
In an instant


I've always said the wasted times
Are the minutes I'm not by your side
And now I travel through the night
Just to be there

I told you I'm never too far away
And if you need me then I'm on my way
Believe me when I tell you that I wanna stay
And we're all together now

You are the light that
Is guidin' me back
And I'll be home for Christmas
(Home)
Home for Christmas
(Home)
Home for Christmas now
(Home now)
(Ooh)

How many sleeps
Do I have to wait now
To throw these loving arms
Around my world?

I've always said the wasted times
Are the minutes I'm not by your side
Now I travel through the night
I will be there

I've told you I'm never too far away
And if you need me then I'm on my way
Believe me when I tell you that I wanna stay
And we're all together now

You are the light that
Is guidin' me back
And I'll be home for Christmas
(Home)
Home for Christmas
(Home)
Home for Christmas now
(Home now)

My family, not so ordinary
You'd love them too
A little out of tune
But we'll still sing for you

I told you I'm never too far away
And if you need me then I'm on my way
Believe me when I tell you that I wanna stay
And we're all together now

You are the light that
Is guidin' me back
And I'll be home for Christmas
(Home)
Home for Christmas
(Home)
Home for Christmas now
(Home now)
(Ooh)

I'll unlock the door and
I'll crawl into bed
You've got a big day tomorrow
So sleep, sleepy-head

(I'll unlock the door and)
(I'll crawl into bed)
And I'll be home for Christmas
(Home)
Home for Christmas
(Home)
Home for Christmas now
(Home now)

I'll unlock the door and
I'll crawl into bed
You've got a big day tomorrow
So sleep, sleepy-head

(You've gotta unlock the door and)
(I'll crawl into bed)
(You've got a big day tomorrow)
(So sleep, sleepy-head)
(Ah-ah)
