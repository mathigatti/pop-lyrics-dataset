Sometimes I feel like I am
Sailing on a sunken dream
I try to read the signs
But don't know what they mean
I know when I'm with you
I'm a rich man baby


Grace, I'm not yet born
Come embrace
A soul that's torn

I have got so much to give you
My heart is starved of love
In these radio days
I try to listen hard
To what my conscience says
I know I've sold my soul
I'm going to earn it back now

Grace, I'm not yet born
Come embrace
A soul that's torn

I have got so much to give you
Now that you believe in me

We can fly away
Somewhere safe
I know that you will always be
Giving me more then you take
I know when I'm with you
I'm a rich man baby

Grace, I'm not yet born
Come embrace
A soul that's torn
Grace, it can mend if you make my heart
Your friend
Grace (x4)
