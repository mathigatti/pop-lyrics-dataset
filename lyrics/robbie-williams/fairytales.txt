Raise up your glass, mighty heathen
Raise it up while we're still breathin'
You and I don't need a season
To start it all off for no reason


Here we come
Howlin' at dawn at the Sun
Bring a friend
We'll need someone to blame when we're done

Two, three, four
I hear them callin', the angels are singin'
From far away
When I get this feelin' then I start believin'
In fairytales
Even though sometimes we're driftin' apart
'Tis the season to make a new start
'Cause I believe in Christmas

Next year, I'll wish you more laughter
And plenty of whatever you're after

Here we come
Let's howl at the Moon then the Sun
Laugh along
We'll need someone to blame when we're done

Two, three, four
I hear them callin', the angels are singin'
From far away
When I get this feelin' then I start believin'
In fairytales
Even though sometimes we're driftin' apart
'Tis the season to make a new start
And we all believe in Christmas

Here we are
Let's howl at the Moon from the bar
Come on, star
Everyone knows who we are

Two, three, oh
I hear them callin', the angels are singin'
From far away
When I get this feelin' then I start believin'
In fairytales
Even though sometimes we're driftin' apart
'Tis the season to make a new start
Sometimes you've gotta look deep in your heart
Zero the score and follow the stars
And we all believe
All believe in Christmas
