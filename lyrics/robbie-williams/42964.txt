We didn't think it'd last beyond summer
I met her father, she met my mother
We didn't have anywhere else to go
She said to me when we grow older
Will we still need young love on our shoulders
Does it just fade away, will we ever know ?
She touched my face and called me her lover
I never thought that I'd need another
Your cool suburban sun
You're fooling everyone
You win some, you lose some
I didn't know what we had found
Just caught the bus and rode it to town
She wouldn't notice anything else but me
Your cool suburban sun
You're fooling everyone
You win some, you lose some
Dancing at discos and moaning at phone bills
Torremolinos and sunburnt in high heels
Swap it and sell it and drop it and smell it
All those years ago
She touched my face and called me her lover
I never thought that I'd need another oh
Your cool suburban sun
You're fooling everyone
You win some, you lose some
Your cool suburban sun
You're fooling everyone
You win some, you lose some
Now it's gone, now it's gone
You win some, you lose some
Now it's gone, now it's gone
You win some, you lose some
Now it's gone, now it's gone
You win some, you lose some
Now it's gone, now it's gone
You win some, you lose some
Win some.
