Twisted little hurricane
I am a believer
If i take i take you home again
I will never leave you


Cause this ain’t my first rodeo
We could make a video
Pumping on your stereo
To the shit that’s on the radio

To the shit that’s on the radio
To the shit that’s on the radio
Shit that’s on the radio
To the shit that’s on the radio
Shit that’s on the radio

She was a saint aye
Sexy little mover
And i’ve been up all night
So i don’t wanna lose er

Cause this ain’t my first rodeo
We could make a video
Pumping on your stereo
To the shit that’s on the radio
To the shit that’s on the radio
To the shit that’s on the radio
Shit that’s on the radio
To the shit that’s on the radio
Shit that’s on the radio

Searching for the girl, searching for the girl
That made the pretty headlight
Cause she was such a pretty girl, such a pretty girl
That made the pretty headlight

I know that you know
When we get together
Love you like a hurricane
I know that you know
When we get together
Love you like a hurricane

To the shit that’s on the radio
Shit that’s on the radio
To the shit that’s on the radio
Shit that’s on the radio

I know that you know (shit that’s on the radio)
When we get together
Love you like a hurricane (shit that’s on the radio)
I know that you know (shit that’s on the radio)
When we get together
Love you like a hurricane
