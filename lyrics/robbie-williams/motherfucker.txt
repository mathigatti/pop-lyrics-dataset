Come in and close the door
I think it's time you knew the score
Why you feel weird
One day you're gonna be told about
How daddy had let his demons out
Yeah, he made 'em scream and shout


One day soon you'll be old enough
You'll go out on your own and stuff
If you start losing hold of love
It's because

Your uncle sells drugs
Your cousin is a cutter
Your grandma is a fluffer
Your granddad's in the gutter
Your mother is a nutter
Your mother is a nutter
We are mad motherfuckers
You're a bad motherfucker
And I'd like to sing a song that says that you'll be fine
Now you know me so you know that I'd be lying
One of the things you get from me and your mother
Is that we're bad motherfuckers
You're a bad motherfucker

Helps to know where you come from
When days are hard and things go wrong
I pray our weakness makes you strong
Well, strangers come and lovers leave
You can rest assured we'll always be
Your ever loving family

So before you leave when you're old enough
When you go out on your own and stuff
You start losing hold of love
It's because

Your uncle sells drugs
Your cousin is a cutter
Your grandma is a fluffer
Your granddad's in the gutter
Your mother is a nutter
Your mother is a nutter
We are mad motherfuckers
You're a bad motherfucker
And I'd like to sing a song that says that you'll be fine
Now you know me so you know that I'd be lying
One of the things you get from me and your mother
Is that we're bad motherfuckers
You're a bad motherfucker

But we all believe that you're gonna break the chain
And we all believe you're the one
We all believe that the angels are watching over you
My son

Because
Your uncle sells drugs
Your cousin is a cutter
Your grandma is a fluffer
Your granddad's in the gutter
Your mother is a nutter
Your mother is a nutter
We are mad motherfuckers
You're a bad motherfucker
And I'd like to sing a song that says that you'll be fine
Now you know me so you know that I'd be lying
One of the things you get from me and your mother
Is that we're bad motherfuckers
You're a bad motherfucker
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Bad motherfucker
You're a bad motherfucker

Your uncle sells drugs
Your cousin is a cutter
Your grandma is a fluffer
Your granddad's in the gutter
Your mother is a nutter
Your mother is a nutter
We are mad motherfuckers
You're a bad motherfucker
And I'd like to sing a song that says that you'll be fine
Now you know me so you know that I'd be lying
One of the things you get from me and your mother
Is that we're bad motherfuckers
You're a bad motherfucker
