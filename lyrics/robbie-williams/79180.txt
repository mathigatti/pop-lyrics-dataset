Well I'm standing here looking at you 
What do I see? 
I'm looking straight through 
It's so sad 
When you're young 
To be told You're having fun 
So unplug the jukebox 
And do us all a favour 
That music's lost its taste 
So try another flavour 
"Antmusic" Well I'm standing here what do I see? 
A big nothing 
Threatening me 
It's so sad 
When you're young 
To be told 
You're having fun(B-Side of the single "No regrets")
