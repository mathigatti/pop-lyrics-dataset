Close your eyes so you don't feel them
They don't need to see you cry
I can't promise I will heal you
But if you want to I will try


I sing this summer serenade
The past is done we've been betrayed
It's true
Someone said the truth will out
I believe without a doubt
in you(chorus)

You were there for summer dreaming
and you gave me what I need
and I hope you'll find your freedom
for eternity, for eternity

Yesterday when we were walking
You talked about your mum and dad,
What they did that made you happy,
What they did that made you sad.

We sat and watched the sun go down
Picked a star before we lost
the moon
Youth is wasted on the young
before you know it's come and gone, too soon

You were there for summer dreaming
and you gave me what I need
and I hope you find your freedom
for eternity, for eternity

I sing this summer serenade
the past is done we've been betrayed
it's true
youth is wasted on the young
before you know it's come and gone
too soonyou were there for summer dreaming
and you are a friend indeed
and I hope you'll find your freedom
for eternity
you were there for summer dreaming
and you are a friend indeed
and I know you'll find your freedom
eventually
For eternity, for eternity
