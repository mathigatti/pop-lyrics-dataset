What's behind your eyes makes you a star

I want to take my time on earth
And give it meaning
They say you get what you deserve
I know the feeling
Those dumb looks only get you so far
What's behind your eyes makes you a star


I'm gonna walk onto that stage like it's my destiny
Stand and tell the truth, make no apologies
If tomorrow I should die, these are my memories
I'm gonna take this simple life and make history

I dream a fantasy and then achieve it
Repeat the greatest lie till they believe it
You and me, not gods, define us now
You come in screaming, leave in silence

Oh, I'm gonna walk onto that stage like it's my destiny
Stand and tell the truth, make no apologies
If tomorrow I should die, these are my memories
I'm gonna take this simple life and make history

Let's fly higher than the mocking birds
They won't touch us way up here
In the sole asylum of the universe
A man can disappear
Raise a glass to the disfunctional
It's never ever too late
I fell like miracles are happening
If I could just get out the way

I want to take my time on earth
And give it meaning
They say you get what you deserve
I know the feeling, feeling, feeling

You've gotta walk onto that stage like it's your destiny
Stand and tell the truth, make no apologies
If tomorrow you should die, these are your memories
You've gotta take this simple life and make history
