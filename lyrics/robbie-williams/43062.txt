Canned laughter for applause
You've opened up doors
In and out of their wives
In and out of your smalls
It's not a BAFTA you're after
You want a million dollar lay
By all means necessary
You will get your way


It all seems so easy
But so are you
That's what I've heard them say

All the make up that you wear
Can't hide the flaws
Your work in charity for your own cause
You won't be dating a teacher
You'd rather shag a manic street preacher
By all means necessary
You will get your way

It all seems so easy
But so are you
That's what I've heard them say

Sex with a stranger
You've been laid in a manger
And you think he's your saviour
Will he leaves his pager?
You could be his daughter
Look what he's bought ya
But the money won't change ya
Of that there's no danger

Now your life's getting darker
It's you that they're after
Fifteen minutes a matyr
Blame it on your father
That dress nearly fitts ya
Girl what's possessed you
Can we please take your picture
You know they'll forget ya
Ooh yeah

It all seems so easy
But so are you
That's what I've heard them say

By all means necessary
You will get your way
By all means necessary
You will get your way
By all means necessary
You will get your way

you don't get your way
By giving it away

Repeat...
