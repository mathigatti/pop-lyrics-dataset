I feel a sudden urge to sing the kind of ditty that invokes the Spring 
So, control your desire to curse while I crucify the verse 
This verse I've started seems to me the "Tin Pan-tithesis" of melody 
So to spare you all the pain, I'll skip the darn thing and sing the refrain 


The night is young, the skies are clear 
And if you want to go walkin', dear 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely 

I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely 

You can tell at a glance what a swell night this is for romance 
You can hear, dear Mother Nature murmuring low "Let yourself go" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee 
And when I kiss ya, just say to me 
"It's delightful, it's delicious, it's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's de limit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely" 

You can tell at a glance what a swell night this is for romance

It's dilemma, it's de limit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely"
