So I sing a song
To reel 'em in
It's a song I sung before and
a song I'm going to sing again
I mean every word and I don't mean
a single one of them
Oh Lord Make me pure But not yet


Tell a joke
Tell it twice
If noone else is laughing there why am i
I split myself both times and laugh till i cry
Oh Lord, please make me pure But not yet

Don't have to try
I just dial it in
I've never found a job That for me
was worth bothering
I've got a ton of selfish genes and
lazy bones beneath this skin
Oh Lord Make me pure But not yet

Smoking kills
Sex sells
I've got one hand in my pocket But the
other one looks cool as hell
I know I'm gonna die So my revenge is living well
Oh Lord Make me pure But not yet

I stopped praying So I hope this song will do
I wrote it all for you
I'm not perfect But you don't mind that,
do you?
I know you're there to pull me through
Aren't you?

So I look for love
I like the search
And I'll be standing for election All across
the known Universe
Every president get the country she deserves
Oh Lord Make me pure but not yet

And I've been seeing
Somebody's wife
She said she'd leave him for me
And I said that wasn't wise
You can't lie to a liar Because of all the lies
Oh Lord, please make me pure But not yet.
