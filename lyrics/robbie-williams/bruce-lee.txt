I was a sick child
Teardrop in the rain now
Whole life a hurricane of pain and doubt
No redemption if you call my name
I'm gonna rock you till you sing it
Again and again
Come on


I'm getting better
I'm so much better
Bruce Lee told me to be
Like water flowing

Don't you go throwing shade at me
Don't you go throwing shade
Oh, when you do that thing
Baby cuts a beautiful line
When you're a bright young thing
Ain't it just a beautiful life

I'm like a jet plane, crusing at velocity
A cut vain dripping my biology
Got no dimentions
Ain't got no novacaine
I'm gonna sing it till I bleed it
Again and again
Come on

I'm getting better
I'm so much better
Bruce Lee told me to be
Like water flowing off

Don't you go throwing shade at me
Don't you go throwing shade
Oh, when you do that thing
Baby cuts a beautiful line
When you're a bright young thing
Ain't it just a beautiful life

I've got to leave this house and go and find the others
There's got to be some freaks like me
A bit mental but we make damn good lovers

I'm getting better
I'm so much better
Bruce Lee told me to be
Like water flowing off

Don't you go throwing shade at me
Don't you go throwing shade
Oh, when you do that thing
Baby cuts a beautiful line
When you're a bright young thing
Ain't it just a beautiful life
A beautiful life
I love her mind
She’s out of her mind
But I don’t mind
I don’t mind
But I don’t mind
