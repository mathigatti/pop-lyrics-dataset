In a Northern Town
In a Northern Town
We were getting down
In a Northern Town
We were getting down


Having good times
Having good good times
In a Northern Town
In a Northern Town

Get together
Have some good times baby
Can you feel it

Have a good time
Good times coming to you
Good times
Good times

I was dancing
I was singing
Good times

In a Northern Town
In a Northern Town
We were getting down
In a Northern Town
We were getting down

Having good times
Having good good times
In a Northern Town
In a Northern Town

Get together
Have some good times baby
Can you feel it

All alone
All alone
But I'm all alone now
But I'm all alone now

We're good friends
Having good times
Yah, yah
Yah, yah
