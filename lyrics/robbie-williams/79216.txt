Dont fight the feeling relax,
Oh child the knots are in your back,
cuz' you've been holding on,
I feel you when you are reaching outI'll talk you through memories, 
just keep breathing with me,
It's time to hold my hand,
And walk in to the revolution,And there's no one to touch,
And you've been thinking too much,
You only hurt yourself,
When it's all about retributionI see the pain in your face,
And praying with of the space,
Its time to lead you on,
Come on, into revolutionAnd you can't keep on keepin' on,
And everything you lead upon is all but gone,
Everybody falls sometimes, but love shines onAnd on And on And On...With love in your eyes,
With a flame in your heart,

And you can leave it at last,
It's time to run yourself,
Walking with the revolutionAnd you cant keep on keepin' on,
And everything you lead upon is all but goneAll but goneEverybody hurts sometimes,
