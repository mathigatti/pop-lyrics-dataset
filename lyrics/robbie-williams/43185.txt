I know a freaky young lady
Name of Cocaine Katie
She makes my temperature freeze
She's got a blood red powder
When she gives a shout
She'll bring you to your knees


Well we were being clever playing God games forever
She said she only meant to please
But I'm someone's brother, got a father and a mother
You know I'm going to have to leave

South of the border
I think you oughta
South of the border
I think you oughta

'cos you know you're gonna have to leave
To a place where you can breathe
And you know there's no reprieve

There'll be tears on leaving
But there won't be no grieving
'cos a city soon forgets
To me it's magic
To the landlord it's tragic
He's got another room to let

There'll be the same old faces in the same old places
Where my youth was well misspent
But I tow the line and move the time
To a town called "No Regrets"

South of the border
I think you oughta
South of the border
I think you oughta

'cos you know you're gonna have to leave
To a place where you can breathe
And you know there's no reprieve

'cos you know you're gonna have to leave
To a place where you can breathe
And you know there's no reprieve
