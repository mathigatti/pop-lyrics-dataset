It was me and my monkey
Him with his dungarees and rollerblades
Smoking filter tips reclining in the passenger seat 
of my supercharged jet black Chevrolet
He had the soft top down 
He liked the wind in his face
He said 'Son, you ever been to Vegas?' 
I said 'No' he said 'That's where we're gonna go, 
you need a change of place'
And when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels 
and the neon signs he said 
'I left my wallet in El Segundo' 
and proceeded to take two grand of mine
We made tracks to the Mandalay Bay hotel 
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well
He looked in the passenger seat of my car
and with a smile he said
'If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, 
and we've got a monkey bed'Me and monkey 
With a dream and a gun
Hoping my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and monkey 
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid
Trying to understand 
Why he did what he did 
Why he did what he didAnd at the elevator I hit the 33rd floor
He had a room up top with a panoramic view 
it's like nothing you've ever seen before
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages 
Called up escort services and ordered some oki doke
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
In walked this big, bad-ass baboon into my bedroom 
with 3 monkey whores 
'Hi, my name is Sunshine. These are my girls. 
Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah 
and they'll rock your world'
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine 
'What's up?' - 'You better get your ass in here boy y
our monkey is having too much of a good time'Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone 
Me and my monkey 
Like Billy the Kid
Trying to understand 
Why he did what he did 
Why he did what he didGot tickets to see Sheena Easton
The monkey was high
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
We left before encores
He couldn't sit still 
Sheena was a blast baby
But my monkey was ill
When I played black jack 
Kept hittin' 23
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
Or was it my monkey
I couldn't be sure
It's not like you've never seen a monkey in rollerblades
and dungarees before 
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run 
That's a bad-ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
'My name is Rodriguez' he says with death in his eye
'I've been chasing you for a long time amigos
And now your monkey is gonna die'Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
We don't wanna kill no Mexican 
But we got ten itchy fingers 
One thing to declare
When the monkey is high
You do not stare 
You do not stare
You do not stareLooks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy
And I ain't about to run 
Put your gun down boy 
How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow
