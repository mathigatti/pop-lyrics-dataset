Your daddy didn't love u let me give u validation
Nice tits nice ass, no class, no conversation
In the school u got picked on for being a geek
What a wonderful woman you turned out to be


I got women I got women everybody
I like to get my feet with their teeth
I think its time I found myself a supermodel
I haven't had one of those yet

You said you dealt well when your parents separated
Lots of drugs, lots of blows, lots of bags, hurry up already
Oh daddy do look what you did to your daughter
Shes got an eating disorder

I got women I got women everybody
I like to get my feet with their teeth
I think its time I found myself a supermodel
I haven't had one of those yet

Oh baby blue what happened to you
I love you for who you are
A disco queen, a working machine
...

I got women I got women everybody
I like to get my feet with their teeth
I think its time I found myself a supermodel
I haven't had one of those yet
