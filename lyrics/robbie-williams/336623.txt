I used to live 'round here 
I was the boy with the flash clothes 
She was the girl with the acid stare 
I saw her at the place 
You knows she knows you know 
How she shakes 
When she jacks her body 
To the sounds of Oran Juice Jones 
and Jocelyn Brown 


Oh spread your wings 
Before they fall apart 
Home is where the hurt is darlin' 
Follow your heart 

So she walks into this dead end bar 
Sticks her handbag 
On the chair 
So she walks into this dead end bar 
Puts hers handbag on the chair 
And she waits 
For words we shared 
When we were 15 and still cared 
Cos she feels I'm a scar from the wound that time cant heal 
And I said 
Don't let your dreams out of your head 
Stick it to the man instead 
Don't fool your heart 
Lying about the fears that you had back then 

Did you try to change your life 
Did you ever try to change your life 
You repeat and repeat and repeat 
Now what's up with that 

Now she loves somebody else 
In flash clothes 
She was the girl with the acid stare 
And now she paid to have 
One of those 

And she weighs the word she says 
And she knows 
You exist 
Now she feels I'm the scar from the wound that time cant heal 

Oh spread your wings 
Before they fall apart 
Home is where the hurt is darlin 
Follow your heart 

Spread your wings 
Before they fall apart 
Home is where the hurt is darlin 
Follow your heart 

Heart, heart, heart
