You can't manufacture a miracle
The silence was pitiful - that day
And love is getting too cynical
Passion's just physical - these days


You analyse everyone you meet
But get no sign - the loving kind
Every night you admit defeat
And cry yourself blind

If you can't wake up in the morning
'Cause your bed lies vacant at night
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely
Can't control it - try as you might
May you find that love that won't leave you
May you find it by the end of the day
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely
Something beautiful will come your way

The DJ said on the radio 
Life should be stereo - each day
And the past that cast the unsuitable
Instead of some kind of beautiful
You just couldn't wait

All your friends think you're satisfied
But they can't see your soul, no, no, no
Forgot the time feeling petrified
When they lived alone

If you can't wake up in the morning
'Cause your bed lies vacant at night
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely
Can't control it - try as you might
May you find that love that won't leave you
May you find it by the end of the day
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely
Something beautiful will come your way

(It'll come your way) Some kind of beautiful            
(It'll come your way) Some kind of beautiful
(It'll come your way) Some kind of beautiful
(It'll come your way) 

All your friends think you're satisfied
But they can't see your soul, no, no, no
Forgot the time feeling petrified  
When they lived alone

If you can't wake up in the morning
'Cause your bed lies vacant at night
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely
Can't control it - try as you might
May you find that love that won't leave you
May you find it by the end of the day
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely
Something beautiful will come your way            
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely
Something beautiful will come your way
