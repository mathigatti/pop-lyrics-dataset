For once in your life, make it matter
For once in your life, let it be
Why don't you hand it all over?
And sing it out loudly with me?
Soon we will all be forgotten
But while we're all still here on Earth
Sing about love and forget about loss
And shout for whatever you're worth


(Christmas time)
C'mon, spread the word
(Christmas time)
Doesn't everyone hurt?

Do you remember the good old days
When all the children would cheer?
Well, the time's around, my friends
Santa's nearly here
Christmas time, Christmas time, merry Christmas
And a happy new year
Seasons come, seasons go, winter song
A time for change is here

Mum's got a lot to get together
And dad, he provides what he can
They've been saving up forever and ever and ever
Just to do it all over again

(Christmas time)
Got me dreaming of home
(Christmas time)
Fills my heart full of hope

Do you remember the good old days
When all the children would cheer?
Well, the time's around, my friends
Santa's nearly here
Christmas time, Christmas time, merry Christmas
And a happy new year
Seasons come, seasons go, winter song
A time for change is here

A time for a change
Must be here
So send all your loving out into the world
It's your gift

Do you remember the good old days
When all the children would cheer?
Well, the time's around, my friends
Santa's nearly here
Christmas time, Christmas time, merry Christmas
And a happy new year
Seasons come, seasons go, winter song
A time for change is here
