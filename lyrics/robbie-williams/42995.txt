Sitting in the cheap seats underneath
The stars
I'm heading back to base, I'll drop you off
At Mars
I'm sure I know your face or what star
You're from
I try to make conversation but I'm too
Far gone


I'm a man machine
Drinking gasoline
Super human being
Shooting laser beams

How you gonna leave, when your bags
Ain't packed
And how you gonna shoot, when we're
Back to back
How d'you tell a joke, when you can't laugh
You know that you're the punchline, baby
Take a bath

I'm a man machine
Drinking gasoline
Super human being
I'm a queen's dream

The dog has ate my homework today
It's not done, it ain't done
I have heard they're not very well
In the sun

'Cos I'm a man machine
I'm a queen's dream
Drinking gasoline
I'm a queens dream

Yeah .... Help

How you gonna live for love lying on
Your back
And how you gonna keep it clean in a
Dirty mac
How you gonna breathe when you're lost
In space
You're dazed and amused
Talking through a different face

'Cos I'm a man machine
Drinking gasoline
I'm a teen dream
I'm a man machine
I'm a man machine
I'm a man machine
Drinking Gasoline
