Do nothing till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head


Do nothing till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the words of others you've heard
I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
That doesn't mean I've been untrue?
Whole we're apart, all the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing till you hear it from me
And you never will

True, I've been seen with someone new
That don't mean I've been untrue?
While we're apart, the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing till you hear it from me
Please do nothing till you hear it from me
Please do nothing till you hear it from me
Baby you never will

That's the truth I'm a liar
And don't tell your mama
