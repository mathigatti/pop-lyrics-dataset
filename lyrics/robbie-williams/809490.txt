Chocolate Starfish 
Gonna keep on rollin' baby 
Who's in, now who's out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up 
Tell me what you gonna do now 
Breathe in, now breathe out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up 
Tell me what you gonna do now 
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' … 
Now I know ya'll be lovin' this shit right here 
L. . I. . M. . P... Bizkit is right here 
People in the house put them hands in the air 
'Cause if you don't care, then we don't care (yeah) 
1. . 2. . 3. . times 2 to the 6, Jonesin' for your fix 'cause the Limp Bizkit mix 
So where the fuck you at ? 
Punk shut the fuck up 
And back the fuck up 
Before we fuck this track up 
(Throw your hands up) 
Who's in, now who's out… 
You... wanna mess with Limp Bizkit (yeah) 
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit (why ?) 
Because we get it on (when) 
Everyday and every night (oh) 
And this platinum thing right here (uh huh) 
We're doing it all the time (huh) 
So you better get some better beats 
And, uh get some better rhymes (doh) 
We got the game set so don't complain yet 
Twenty-four seven, never beggin' for a raincheck 
Old school soldiers passin' out the hot shit 
That rocks shit and bounces the mosh pit 
(Throw your hands up) 
Who's in, now who's out… 
Hey Ladies, Hey Fellas 
And the people that don't give a fuck 
All the lovers, All the haters 
And all the people that call themselves playas 
Hot mommas, Pimp daddies 
And the people rollin' up in Caddies 
Hey rockers, Hip-Hoppers 
And everybody all around the world...
