Close the door turn out the light
There's something really wrong tonight with you
Me and you You say your too young to love
And too old to hate
Remote control keeps you awake
So turn me on Maybe you could talk and make my day
You don't have to walk away to...
Stay with me
Make me change
Answer me
Break the chain News at Ten, Eastenders and another cup of tea
And then I fight
Baby not tonight Cos I'm not dressed to be a clown
I'm not in the mood for shouting out
Talk to me
Break the chain
Talk to me
Make me change Do you keep your lover out of sight
Cos you smell like someone else tonight
Alright Alright Talk to me 
Break the chain
Talk to me
Make me change Answer me
Answer me
Answer me
Answer me(B-Side of the single "Rock DJ")
