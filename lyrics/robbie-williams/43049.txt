This is love calling earth
Do you know how much it hurts?
I didn't die overnight
In the wind I had candlelight
I'm controlled by my fear
All the voices in my head
That I can hear


Please don't hurt me

How do I learn
To give love and be loved in return
If this is heaven I'm falling
I'd rather jump and run away
Than see it burn
I feel I could die
Before I sleep I kiss your cheek
And say goodbye

I'm so sorry
Please don't hurt me

This is love calling earth
Do you know how much it hurts?
I didn't die overnight
In the wind I had candlelight
I'm controlled by my fear
All the voices in my head
That I can hear

I'm so sorry
Please don't hurt me

If you could see me through my mother's eye
Only then would you begin to realise
All the places I have ever been
Have scared me half to death or
somewhere in-between

I'm so sorry
Please...
