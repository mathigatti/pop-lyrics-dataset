Is it getting better 
Or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame
You say
One love
One life
When it's one need 
In the night 
It's one love 
We get to share it 
It leaves you baby 
If you don't care for it
Did I disappoint you ? 
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth ?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
Well it's too late 
Tonight
To drag the past out 
Into the light 
We're one 
But we're not the same 
We get to carry each other
Carry each other 
One
Have you come here for forgivness
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much 
More than a lot 
You gave me nothing 
Now it's all I got 
We're one 
But we're not the same 
We hurt each other 
Then we do it again 
You say
Love is a temple 
Love a higher law 
Love is a temple 
Love the higher law 
You ask me to enter 
But then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on
To what you got 
When all you got is hurt
One love
One blood 
One life
You got to do what you should
One life
With each other 
Sisters
Brothers
One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other 
One
One
