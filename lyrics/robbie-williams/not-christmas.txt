What if I don't come, what if I die?
What if I ruin Christmas night again?
Know that shit's been on your mind, babe
Every time Santa comes, oh-ooh
I guess we'll all find out tomorrow


It's all that I am, all that I'm not
Not gonna give everything I've got
Who's gonna give it all to you?
You're probably just returnin'
You'll still be disappointed
Guess we'll all find out tomorrow

I'm not queuin' up to take the abuse
I know it seems so cold, but I finally refuse
What the hell are you so angry for?
Let's not do Christmas anymore

Too many judgements, too many times
Too many I'll apologise
You know they've all come back to haunt you
Just like the ghost of Christmas, oh-whoa-oh
I'll never come to pass

What if I'm right, what if you're wrong?
You knew you'd end up in a song of mine
But the melody's disjointed
The words are cobbled together, oh-whoa-oh
Just like me and you

I'm not queuin' up to take the abuse
I know it seems so cold, but I finally refuse
What the hell are you so angry for?
Let's not do Christmas anymore

Don't like that, don't like that
Hey, baby, don't like that thing for me
I don't like that, don't like that
Hey, baby, don't like that thing for me
Don't like that, I don't like that
Hey, baby, don't like that thing for me
You do you and I'll do me

I'm not queuin' up to take the abuse
I know it seems so cold, but I finally refuse
What the hell are you so angry for?
Let's not do Christmas anymore
(Not this time)
Let's not do Christmas anymore
