That girl is whoa, whoa, whoa
Yo, need no mistletoe
My girl's the finest, the fliest
No ho, ho, ho
Y'all feel me?


Hop in my car
Wanna ride shotgun down the boulevard?
You know who we are
I sing your favorite song
(Eh-hey-yeah)

It's that time of the year
No snow in LA, but at least you're here
I hold you while you melt in my arms

Yes, tonight you're mine
(You're mine)
December 25th
Goin' down like this

Put your lips on my lips
Wish me merry kissmas
Make it easy as one, two, three
Close your eyes, make a wish
Wish me merry kissmas
And the rest is just history

That girl is whoa, whoa, whoa
Yo, need no mistletoe
My girl's the finest, the fliest
No ho, ho, ho
Y'all feel me?

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yo, need no mistletoe
My girl's the finest, the fliest
No ho, ho, ho
Y'all feel me?

Everyday's a holiday
Where baby's makin' out with me
Sit on my lap like I'm Santa Claus
(Eh-hey-yeah)

One time for the man, oh
Gotta say thank you, put my hands up
Look at this angel that's on my arm

Yes, tonight you're mine
(You're mine)
December 25th goin' down like this

Put your lips on my lips
Wish me merry kissmas
Make it easy as one, two, three
Close your eyes, make a wish
Wish me merry kissmas
And the rest is just history

That girl is whoa, whoa, whoa
Yo, need no mistletoe
My girl's the finest, the fliest
No ho, ho, ho
Y'all feel me?

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yo, need no mistletoe
My girl's the finest, the fliest
No ho, ho, ho
Y'all feel me?

Put your lips on my lips
Wish me merry kissmas
Make it easy as one, two, three
Close your eyes, make a wish
Wish me merry kissmas
And the rest is just history
(Yeah)
Y'all feel me?

(Oh, ho-oh)
(Yeah)
(Oh, ho-oh)
(Yeah)
(Oh, ho-oh)
(Yeah)
Y'all feel me?

Y'all feel me?
