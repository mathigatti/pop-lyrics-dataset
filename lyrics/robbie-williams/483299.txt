I shuffled through the modes of bad behaviour
And hankered for the desolated dawn 
I couldn't cope with yet another saviour 
To steer me from the way that I was born 


Then like a ton of bricks the dawn descended 
Recalcitrance was hurtled to the floor 
The citadel lay breached and undefended 
You brought a love I'd never known before 

Chorus: 
I'll want you till the seasons lose their mystery 
I'll need you till the birds forget to fly 
I'll love you more than anyone in history 
Wherever there's a wherefore you're the why
