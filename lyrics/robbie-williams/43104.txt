Silence shields the pain
So you say nothing
Feel they've rigged the game
And you're done with lovin'
Only you can see the darkness in the northern lights


CHORUS
Phoenix from the flames
We will rise together
They will know our names
Can you feel it?
Shelter me from pain
I always wanna feel this way
Oh yeah
Just like a phoenix from the flames

Wish they'd take you back
'Cos you miss heaven
Too many bags to pack
So leave them where they are
Tonight you're flying on a golden dream

(Repeat CHORUS)

Everybody's talking
Nobody's listening
Too busy thinking 'bout what you've been missing
Everybody said you're gonna take it
Too far baby now
Well come on

When you're done with lovin'
It comes down to nothing
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

(Repeat CHORUS)

Why don't you come and deny it?
You know you can't deny it
I always wanna feel this way
Just like a phoenix from the flames
