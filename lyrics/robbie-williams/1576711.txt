Stand by me,
I've been stood by you for ages.
Stay calm and carry on,
maybe nothing is wrong.


Is it the comfort of
this information or
is it the freedom that you feel.
Sit on the angel of liberation oh,
for a second I believe her.

And all you hear, aaaah
while you're here, aaaaah.

Don't call it a comeback,
look what I invented here..
I thought it was easy,
they came it took it away from us.

The last days of disco.

All raved up,
bitter is the pill of devotion.
Read between the noise,
all you discoboys (all you discoboys)

The fascination of
a boy and girl in love,
for a second I can see her.
In the mirror ball,
the human animal,
the creature that I fear.

And all you hear,aaaaah,
while you're here, aaaaaaaaaaah

Don't call it a comeback,
look what I invented here..
I thought it was easy,
they came it took it away from us.

The last days of disco.
The last days of disco.
The last days of disco.

And all you hear,aaaaah,
while you're here, aaaaaaaaaaah

Don't call it a comeback,
we'll hold an event in here
this space is beautiful,
I decide when it is over

Don't call it a comeback,
look what I invented here..
I thought it was easy,
they came it took it away from us.

The last days of disco.
The last days of disco.
The last days of disco.
