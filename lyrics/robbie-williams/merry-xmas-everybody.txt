Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
It's the time that every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer?
Does a ton-up on his sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?


So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell you
That old songs are the best?
Then she's up and rock-'n'-rolling with the rest

So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

What will your daddy do when he sees your momma kissing Santa Claus?

Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you've been slayed

So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
(It's only just begun)

So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
(Everybody's having fun)
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
