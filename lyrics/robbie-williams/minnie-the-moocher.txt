Folks, here's the story about Minnie the Moocher
She was a real hot hoochie-koocher
She was the roughest, toughest frail
but Minnie had a heart as big as a whale


Hodee-hodee-hodee-ho
Heedey-hee-dee-hee-dee hee
Hidee-hidee-hidee-ho
Oo

She messed around with a bloke named Smoky
She loved him though he was a tad cokey
He took her down to Chinatown
Where he showed her how to kick the gong around

Hidee-Hidee-Hidee-hi
Wooh
Heedey-hee-dee-hee-dee hee
Ahooyop

She had a dream about the King of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin'
he gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with platinum wheels

hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hi
hodee-hodee-hodee-hodee-hodee-hodee-ho
Uoo -woo
Uoo ho ho

He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
He had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat around and counted them a million times

Hidee-Hidee-Hidee-hi
Uoo uou
Heedey-hee-dee-hee-dee hee
Uoo uoou uou uou

Poor Min, Poor Min, Poor Min
