And they want us to grow up
But we don't wanna get a job
We all need a decent rock
Where it's all kicking off


Baby It's Alright
Baby It's Alright
You don't need to cause a fuss
Baby It's Alright
Baby It's Alright
It's only us

We're just after cheaper thrills
Since the price went up on pills
From stoke-on-trent to beverly hills
We know it's all kicking off

Baby It's Alright
Baby It's Alright
You don't need to cause a fuss
Baby It's Alright
Baby It's Alright
It's only us
It's only us

Well it's all kicking off
Baby It's Alright
Baby It's Alright
You don't need to cause a fuss
Baby It's Alright
Baby It's Alright
It's only us
It's only us
