Hi out there. This is Shaun Goldberg and you're listening to W.A.N.K.
This evening I've got someone really interesting with me.
He's over from old England and his name is... Robbie Williams. 
[Rob:]
Cor blimey bleedin' Mary Poppins!
[Announcer:]
Great, right on! You know we've been hearing about this boy band that was really big over there. 
Can you tell us a little bit about it Robbie?
[Rob:]
First of all, I'd like to say thank you very much for having me in the first place 
but to answer your question I can't really answer it.
I suppose it was a bit like this.................. 


Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 
Riding in your limos 
Hanging with your bimbos 
Riding my old faithful 
Bigger pin-up than Betty Grable
Kipper in the papers 
Coke and whisky chasers 
I ain't supposed to pose 
But I don't care 

I was a teenage millionaire 
A teenage millionaire 
A teenage millionaire
Yeah, yeah

Services for Britain
Pouting like a kitten 
Dinner with Diana
I'm a social Stokey spanner
Waiting for my knighthood
She can pin it on my manhood 
I ain't supposed to pose 
But I don't care

I was a teenage millionaire 
A teenage millionaire
A teenage millionaire 
Yeah, yeah
A teenage millionaire

(It works out sometimes it's funny 
Being stupid makes you lots of money) 

Bothered Judy Garland
When I ordered Barbara Cartland 
Champagne in my bidet 
The press all had a field day 
You may think it's an outrage 
My cleaner¡äs wearing bondage 
She makes my place a mess 
But I don't care

I was a teenage millionaire 
A teenage millionaire
A teenage millionaire
Yeah, yeah 
A teenage millionaire

Come on waif 
It looks as if you need a good feeling
