I guess now it's time
For me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark
Still on your coffee cup,
Wash it off


Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it,
Gotta leave it all behind me now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

Unaware but underlined
I figured out the story
It wasn't good
And in the corner of a mind
I celebrated glory
But it wasn't to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

And we'll be together
This time is forever
No more fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

I guess now it's time
For you get back for good
