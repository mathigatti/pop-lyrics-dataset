When you're young you hope to be
Menacing in vanity
6 feet tall, maybe more
Bigger now than before


They said it was leaving me
The magic was leaving me
I don't think so
I don't think so

They said it was leaving
They said it went on
Now i could make this last forever
And be a boy, and be a boy

When you're young you hope to see
And carve your name into the street
Bout your words of satellites
That keep the wasted up tonight

They said it was leaving me
The magic was leaving me
I don't think so
I don't think so

They said it was leaving
They said it went on
Now i could make this last forever
And be a boy, and be a boy

There's safety in the jungle
If you treat it like a toy
Make sure you talk to strangers
And be a boy, and be a boy
Be a boy

They said it was leaving me
The magic was leaving me
I don't think so
I don't think so

All of the boys are gonna be someone
The time you caught but it was gone
The time you caught but it was gone
It takes a big man to be someone

All of the boys are gonna be someone
The time you caught but it was gone
The time you caught but it was gone
It takes a big man to be someone

I'm half your age and lived twice your life
And hide on streets, you walk tonight
The time you caught but it's not mine
It takes a big man to be someone

I'm half your age and lived twice your life
And i don't sleep alone tonight
The time you caught but it's not mine
It takes a big man to be someone
