One can have a dream baby
(Two can make a dream so real)
One can talk about being in love
(Two can see how it really feels)


One can wish upon a star
(Two can make a wish come true)
One can stand alone in the dark
(Two can make a light shine through)

It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

One can have a broken heart living in misery
(Two can really ease the pain like a perfect remedy, oh, yeah)
One can be alone in a bar like an island he's all alone

Two can make just any place seem just like bein' at home

It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

One can go out to a movie looking for a special treat
(Two can make that single movie something really kind of neat)
One can take a walk in the moonlight thinking that it's really nice (oh, nice)

Two lovers walking hand in hand is like adding just a pinch of spice

It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

You know it takes two

You know it takes two
You know it takes two
Two, two
You know it takes two
You know it takes two
