You gonna meet some strangers
Welcome to the zoo
Bitter disappointments
Except for one or two


Some of them are angry
Some of them are mean
Most of them are twisted
Few of them are clean

Now when you go dancing with young man
Down at the disco
Just keep it simple
You don't have to kiss though
Don't waste time with the idiots
That think that they're heroes
They will betray you
Stick with us weirdos

For all your days and nights
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there
Yes, I will
Go gentle through your life
If you want me I'll be there
When you need me I'll be there
For you

Don't try to make them love you
Don't answer every call
Baby be a giant
Let the world be small

Some of them are deadly
Some don't let it show
If they try and hurt you
Just let your daddy know

Now when you go giving your heart
Make sure they deserve it
If they haven't earned it
Keep searching, it's worth it

For all your days and nights
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there
Yes, I will
Go gentle through your life
If you want me I'll be there
When you need me I'll be there
For you

Go gentle through the light
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there
Yes, I will
If all your days are nights
When you want me I'll be there
Say my name and I'll be there
For you
