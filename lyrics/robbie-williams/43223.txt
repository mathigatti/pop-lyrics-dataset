I know I'll stand in line,
until you think you have the time
to spend an evening with me


And if we go some place to dance
I know that there's a chance
you won't be leaving with me

And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all
by saying something stupid
like :"I love you"

I can see it in your eyes
you still dispise the same old lies
you heard the night before

And though it's just a line to you
for me it's true
it never seemed so right before

I practice everyday
to find some clever lines to say
to make the meaning come true

But then I think I'll wait
until the evening gets late
and I'm alone with you

The time is right
your perfume fills my head
the stars get red
and oh, the night's so blue

And then I go and spoil it all
by saying something stupid
like: "I love you"

The time is right
Your perfume fills my head
The stars get red
and oh, the night's so blue

And then I go and spoil it all
by saying something stupid
like: "I love you"

"I love you" (3x)
