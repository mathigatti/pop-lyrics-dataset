For the first time the morning light
All glory is in the sky
Crossed upon it's afternoon and the evening's flies high
Ordered our first cup of coffee... ordered cup of tea
We can pretend to live on different planets you and me
In this collision of worlds watch the new day gone on a distance shore
In this collision of worlds oh you can sit this out no more
Happy road route 66 cia to the ma6 right lane left lane
Match interior power dollars how material
Va ground to v12 street hell to the chef
Well gossip the queen cops...
Cause when I go
In this collision of worlds it's too late you can't stop it now
In this collision of worlds fin your place and just watch it now


Good old boy while you are at decent look
I say it's happening I say it's a joke
When I look around now I can't see
It ain't so different you and me

Meat and potatoes bag and a mash
Pounds dollars... cash... to the rising sun
The a10 to the m1... parliaments presidents the queen
Patrol usage gasoline grab your... and get your girl now
It's a small world
In this collision of worlds watch the new day gone on a distance shore
In this collision of worlds oh you can sit this out no more
It's a collision of worlds
It's too late you can't stop it now
In this collision of worlds fin your place and just watch it now
