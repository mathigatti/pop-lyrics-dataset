Me with the floorshow
Kickin' with your torso
Boys getting high
And the girls even more so
Wave your hands if your not with a man
Can I kick it?
(Yes you can)
I got
(Funk)
You got
(Soul)
We got everybody
I've got the gift
Gonna stick it in the goal
It's time to move your body


Babylon back in business
Can I get a witness?
Every girl, every man
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land

I don't wanna rock, DJ
But your making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
Cause you're keepin' me up all night

Singin' in the classes
Music for your masses
Give no head
No backstage passes
Have a proper giggle
I'll be quite polite
But when I rock the mic
I rock the mic
(Right)
You got no love, then you're with the wrong man
It's time to move your body
If you can't get a girl
But your best friend can
It's time to move your body

I don't wanna be sleazy
Baby just tease me
Got no family plan
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me ?
Need permission to land

I don't wanna rock(rock) DJ (DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop), DJ?
Cause you're keeping me up all night

I don't wanna rock (rock), DJ(DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop), DJ?(DJ)
Cause your keeping me up all night

Pimpin' aint easy
Most of them fleece me
Every night
Pimpin' ain't easy
But if you're sellin' it
It's alright

Come on

I don't wanna rock (rock), DJ(DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop(stop), DJ?(DJ)
Cause you're keeping me up all night

I don't wanna rock(rock), DJ(DJ)
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop (stop), DJ?(DJ)
Cause you're keeping me up all night
