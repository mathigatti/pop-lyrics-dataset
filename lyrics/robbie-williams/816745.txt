I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be


I lost all faith in what I know
The future doesn't need me so
I kick a bow
Again a woah
And yet
Until it don't hurt no more
Use my cuts and lacerations 
Feed myself a new sensation

Woah
Woah

I take a ride on your high horse
The horse is blind
Use the force
A falcon flies in two straight lines
Red five standing by
Start a morning subspace station
It feels good the good vibration

Woah
Woah

I'm all that you know
Some lovely people
Send them all an invitation
Party to a segregation

Woah
Woah

Viva life on mars
I'm calling
Sending my frequency
To the galaxy
See as only you can see
Be more than me

They don't want us to discuss
The picture in the gaze of us
A nosebleed and a bag of coal
Then they put you in a hole
We're knee deep in information
They cant stop this conversation

No
Woah

I'm all that you know
Some lovely people
Send them all an invitation
Party to a segregation

Woah
Woah

Viva life on mars
I'm calling
Sending my frequency
To the galaxy
See as only you can see
We're all down here

I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be

Love is natural
Love is good 
Not everybody does it 
But everybody should
Them and us
We've made a mess
Till they decide which God is best
Free yourself from liberation
From Lake Geneva to the freeland station

Woah
Woah

I know that you know
Some lovely people
Send them all an invitation
Party to a segregation

Woah
Woah

Viva life on mars
I'm calling
Sending my frequency
To the galaxy
See as only you can see
We fall down here

Viva life on mars I'm calling
Viva life on mars I'm calling
Viva life on mars I'm calling
Viva life on mars I'm calling
