Little ones, it's time for bed
Time to rest your buzzy head
The land of dozy dreams ahead
For you


Driftin' like the fall of snow
Feathers floatin' down below
If you've been good then Santa knows
Just keep those eyes closed

Softly sleeps the silent night
Fade your troubles out of sight
With a Christmas lullaby
For you

Whisper soft and drift away
Soon it will be Christmas day
For now, just dream sweet and sleep tight

Little ones, it's time for bed
Time to rest your buzzy head
The land of dozy dreams ahead
For you

Drifting like the fall of snow
Feathers floatin' down below
If you've been good then Santa knows
Just keep those eyes closed

Softly sleeps the silent night
Fade your troubles out of sight
With a Christmas lullaby
For you

Whisper soft and drift away
Soon it will be Christmas day
For now, just dream sweet and sleep tight

For now, just dream sweet and sleep tight
