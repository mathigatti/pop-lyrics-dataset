Leave slowly but come back quick
Eat so much, it makes us sick
Start to look just like Saint Nick
And fall down like a snowflake


Uncle Dylan's late to lunch
Nana Gwen's drank too much
My lovely wife was buzzed at brunch
We're all a bunch of snowflakes
We're all a bunch of snowflakes

Murray the step-dad has brought Mary-Lou
Tryin' to tell us why Trump good for you
The table goes quiet 'cause that's what we do
We're all liberal snowflakes

My dad's new girlfriend from Taiwan
Brand new to the country and she's 21
They met online and now she's my mum
She's never seen a snowflake
'Cause they don't get no snowflakes

Once in a lonely lifetime
There'll be peace for all mankind
I went out to the world
And I was searchin' for my tribe

Now it's a family vibe
In this home of mine
The reason I'm alive
The snowflakes of mine

Mum's bringin' up the past again
And somehow World War III begins
Think I know how this one ends
I'm off to watch the snowflakes

Time won't change us, nothin' will
I know they're not perfect but I love them still
Much makes me happy but my family will
Love this bunch of snowflakes
God bless this bunch of snowflakes

Once in a lonely lifetime
There'll be peace for all mankind
I went out to the world
And I was searchin' for my tribe

Now it's a family vibe
In this home of mine
The reason I'm alive
The snowflakes of mine

All my life
A love insane
These are my people
Ooh-oh, oh, oh, oh

Time won't change us, nothin' will
I know they're not perfect but I love them still
Not much makes me happy but my family will
I love this bunch of snowflakes
God bless this bunch of snowflakes
