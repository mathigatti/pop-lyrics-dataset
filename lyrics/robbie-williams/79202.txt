We're all so chic, living in class A 
Partying is such sweet sorrow today 
When you don't know who your friends are 
and neither do they 
We're all so amused, 
and maybe it's better that way She's been seen with him, 
he's been seen with her 
Happy propaganda, just add vodka and stir 
Sing "My Way" and mean it, karaoke overkill 
We all should know better 
but I bet we never will! We're insecure, 
making me think I'm not fit to lace your drink 
I've seen you in Marbella, 
you're a real player, taking it easy We all know we shouldn't
and that is why we do it 
Here's my glass house, 
why don't you come and view it? 
Sing "My Way" and mean it karaoke overkill 
We all should know better, 
but I bet we never, the sooner the better,
I'll send you a letter, said... Hanging with your sister, 
playing naked Twister(tm) 
Down to your toga,
playing strip poker 
Give us a clue, 
seeing the night through 
And you're so vain the song ain't about you Hanging with your sister, 
playing naked Twister(tm) 
Down to your toga, 
playing strip poker(B-Side of the single "Angels")
