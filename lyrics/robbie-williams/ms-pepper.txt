Not your normal city girl
Getting caught up with the world
Dressed up for the city lights
She’s going home but not tonight
Yes I’ve known her for a while
She kinda got used to my smile
Its gone in and out of style
And everybody knows it


We’ve been holding back
And there’s some history to that
But we’re on fire, fire, fire

Do it, do it you crazy angel
So in tune with magic
Don’t be a stranger
Coz I know that you know
When we get together
There’s never been a better time
Never been a better time than now

Guess I found some courage now
Just to tell you what goes down
In my mind when you’re not around
I hope you feel the same way too
Got a photograph of you
I always stop when I flick through
Man it’s such a lovely view
I don’t want to spoil it

We’ve been holding back
It’s such an unnatural act
But we’re on fire, fire, fire

Do it, do it you crazy angel
So in tune with magic
Don’t be a stranger
Coz I know that you know
When we get together
There’s never been a better time
Never been a better time

Do it, do it, you crazy angel
So in tune with magic
You could be my savior
Coz I know that you know
When we get together
There’s never been a better time
Never been a better time than now

Why do you have to leave me now
You don't have to leave me
Why do you have to leave me now
You don't have to leave me

Why do you have to leave me now
You don't have to leave me
Why do you have to leave me now
You don’t have to leave me

Love me, love me you crazy angel
So in tune with magic
Don’t be a stranger
Coz I know that you know
When we get together
There’s never been a better time
There’s never been a better time

Love me, love me, you crazy angel
So in tune with magic
Don’t be a stranger
Coz I know that you know
We’ll be here together
There’s never been a better time
There’s never been a better time than now
