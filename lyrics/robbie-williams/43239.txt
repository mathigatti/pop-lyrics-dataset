I knew a man Bojangles
And he'll dance for you
In worn out shoes
With silver hair and ragged shirt baggy pants
He will do the old soft shoe
He would jump so high
Jump so high
That he lightly touched down


Told me of the time
He worked with, with minstrel shows
Travelling troughout the south
He spoke with tears for fifteen years
How his how his dog and him
They will travel about
But his dog up and died
Got up and died
After twenty years he still grieves

He said 
I dance now
at every chance in honky tonks
for my drinks and tips
but most the time I, I spend behind these country bars
You see I drinks a bit
Then he shook his head
Oh Lord, when he shook his head
I can swear I heard somebody saying please, please

That's mister Bojangles
Calling mister Bojangles
Mister Bojangles come back and dance and dance and dance pleasedance

That's mister Bojangles
Calling mister Bojangles
Mister Bojangles come back and and dance and dance and danceplease dance

Come back and dance mister Bojangles
