Let me lie down
Please don't wake me
Nothing's sacred
And no one saved me


In my black eye
I can feel it
Moving closer
Can't you hear it

The only gift you gave to me
Was self-fulfilling prophecy
I need to change the sounds
That shape my life

And if you die before i leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around there's no one here
To love me and hold me

Take me dancing
I love music
Keep on singing
We won't lose it

Picture me there
Missing no one
If young hearts run free
Why can't we go on

Go on 'til they kick us out
We've everything to talk about
I could bring a song into your life

If you should die before i leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around there's no one here
To love me and hold me

Maybe i've been away too long
I know i'm not always right but is that wrong
They say there's nothing i can do
But talk to strangers and wait for you

If you should die before i leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around there's no one here
To love me and hold me

And if you die before i leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around there's no one here
To love me and hold me now
