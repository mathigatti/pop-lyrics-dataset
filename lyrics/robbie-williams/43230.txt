I wouldn't be so alone
If they knew my name in every home
Kevin Spacey would call on the phone
But I'd be too busy
Come back to the old five and dime
Cameron Diaz give me a sign
I make you smile all the time
and your conversation would complement mine


I will talk and Hollywood will listen
See them bow my every word
Mr. Spielberg look just what you're missing
Doesn't that seem a little absurd bow at my every word

Buy up the rights to my book
And live on a ranch from what the box office took
I go on visit the set
They'll call me their savior
All the people wills come
Celebrity lives on the moon
But I'll be back home in June
To promote 'The sequel'

I will talk and Hollywood will listen
See them bow my every word
Mr. Spielberg look just what you're missing
Doesn't that seem a little absurd bow at my every word
