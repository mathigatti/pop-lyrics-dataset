You say i'm sick and tired,
I'm feeling sick and tired,
I walked and told the truth,
Do you wish I stayed and lied.
Coz she said that you said that I said,
She said that I said the loves dead,
well I try to explain don't expect you to be the same.
All this rockin rollercoster and emotional ride,
We were just an average 'b' side,
We were just an aversge 'b' side.
We watched the past run by,
On the silver screens,
we played our parts and died,
Scene by scene.
Coz she said that you said that I said,
She said that I said the loves dead,
Well i'll try to explain don't expect you to feel the same.
All this rockin rollercoster and emotional ride,
We were just an average 'b' side,
We were just an average 'b' side.
Pretend you like me,
Pretend I like you,
Pretend, Pretend, Pretend,
This is not happning,
(rockin rollercoster and emotional ride)
This is not happning,
(we were just an average 'b' side)
This is not happning,
(rocking roller coster and emotional ride)
We were just an average 'b' side,
We were just an average 'b' side,
We were just an average 'b' side.
