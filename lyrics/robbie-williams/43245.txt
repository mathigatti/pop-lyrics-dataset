The way you wear you hat
The way you sip your tea
The mem'ry of all that
No, no! They can't take that away from me


The way you smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you hunt my dreams
No, no! They can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On this bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep 
The mem'ry of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you've changed my life
Oh, no! They can't take that away from me
No! They can't take that away from me

NOT WITHOUT A LAWYER, ANYWAY

We may never, never meet again 
on this bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep
The mem'ry of

The way you hold your knife
The way we dance till three
The way you've changed my life
Oh, no! They can't take that away from me
No! They can't take that away
No they won't take that away 
Can't take that away
Can't take that away
Won't take that away
Won't take that away
Can't take that away from me
