When I was seventeen
It was a vary good year
It was a very good year for small town girls and soft summernights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen


When I was twentyone
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all the perfume hair
And it came undone
When I was twentyone

When I was thirtyfive
It was a vary good year
It was a very good year for blue blooded girls of indipendantmeans
We'd hide in limousenes
There chouffers would drive
When I was thirtyfive

But now the days are short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as village wine from fine old keggs
From the brim to the dreggs
It poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year
