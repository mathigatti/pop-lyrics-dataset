If a man could beat his own fancy
Then to only breed in captivity
is pointless
I've been doing what I like when I like how I like it's joyless
Only you know me


What a waste of all this peace ,
baby steps and two more sleeps
Till I get to say sorry
I get hysterical, historical; of love is just chemical
Give us something to stop me
Only you know me

Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday
You don't know cos you're not there
You simply found the words to make a lot of feelings fade away
Only you know me

I'm doin' fine
And the sun often shines
What are you thinking?
At the worst of my mind
With this thunderbird wine
Baby, I'm drinking
Only you know me

Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday
You don't know cos you're not there
You simply found the words to make a lot of feelings fade away
Only you know me
Only you know me

Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday
You don't know cos you're not there
You simply found the words to make a lot of feelings fade away
Only you know me
Only you know me
Only you
Only you
Only you know me
