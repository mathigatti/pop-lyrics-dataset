Hold on to this
There's something crawling up my wrist 
I think it's dying 
Bless the Lord 
I can't think straight anymore 


You won't see me crying 
There'll be tears before bedtime for sure 

Singing 
I won't go to war 
Lay down your guns 
What are we fighting for 

I wanna swim in the ocean 
I wanna play in the sea 
I wanna love my brother 
Love my brother loving me, me 

I'm gonna buy a farm 
Write a song 
It won't change the earth 
Just the people on it 

I was born with 
A silver shovel in my mouth 
Golden balls and a platinum smile 

You won't hear the last of 
the good, the bad or the brassed off, for sure 

Singing 
I won't go to war 
Lay down your guns 
What are we fighting for 

I wanna swim with the dolphins
I wanna play in the sea 
I'm gonna love my brother 
Love my brother loving me 

Then buy a farm 
Write a song 
It won't change the earth 
Just the people on it 

Hear the sound of a million people sitting down 
Hip to hip 
Lip to lip 
Free your love 
Free love 
Free love 

Singing I won't go to war 
Lay down your guns 
What are we fighting for 

I wanna swim with the dolphins 
I'm gonna play in the sea 
I'm gonna love my brother 
Love my brother loving me, me 

Singing I won't go to war 
Lay down my guns 
What are we fighting for 

I wanna play with the dolphins 
I want to play in the sea 
I'm gonna love my brother 
Love my brother loving me, me 

Hear the sound of a million people sitting down 
Hip to hip 
Lip to lip 
Free your love 
Free love 
Free love
