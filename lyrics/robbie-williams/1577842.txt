You laugh at us with difference,
we laugh cause you're all the same.
By the look on your face baby,
I've been enjoying myself again.
I know that you cried,
I know why you try so hard.


Ready, steady go,
Everybody famous.
Everyone you know.
Why did it take you ages?
I don't have to listen, read love like you
I've got no problem with the physical
minimal real life, living in hysterical
For everybody, it's been too much
Isn't it a miracle?
Everybody's starstruck!

Guess the odds are very good
But the goods are very odd
Even though i talked with the devil,
I only made the deal with god.
I am a long list,
I want a ___ist
So odd!

Ready, steady go,
Everybody famous.
Everyone you know.
Why did it take you ages?
I don't have to listen, read love like you
I've got no problem with the physical
minimal real life, living in hysterical
For everybody, it's been too much
Isn't it a miracle?
Everybody's starstruck!
Everybody's starstruck!

You want to stop, but you can't, can you?
I was lovely on a way up, on a way up.

Ready, steady go,
Everybody famous.
Everyone you know.
Why did it take you ages?
I don't have to listen, read love like you
I've got no problem with the physical
minimal real life, living in hysterical
For everybody, it's been too much
Isn't it a miracle?
Everybody's starstruck!
Everybody's starstruck!

I don't have to listen, read love like you
I've got no problem with the physical
minimal real life, living in hysterical
For everybody, it's been too much
Isn't it a miracle?
Everybody's starstruck!
