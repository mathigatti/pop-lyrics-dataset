One more sleep to go
I'm gettin' that buzz
This candy-coated Christmas feels like it should
And ba-ba-ba-ba-bing sings love (sings love) again
We're watchin' the box
The oldies are on
Eric, me, and Ernie, all havin' fun
And who's the Christmas number one?
It's me


It's just you and me
The lights on a tree
And magic that's everywhere (everywhere you go)
The gin and the juice
The goose and the spruce
And jingle bells in the air (happy Christmas)
I've counted them up
With pleasure enough
And no one else could disagree
So I know that it's a wonderful life for you and me

(Have yourself a merry Christmas)
(Sing those songs you reminisce with)
(Hope there is snow and maybe a kiss or two)
(Presents wrapped and kids sleep tight)
(Starry night the moonbeams bright)
(And just for some fun)
(But I'm cozy, warm with you)

It's just you and me
The lights on a tree (lights on a tree)
The magic that's everywhere (everywhere you go)
The gin and the juice
The goose and the spruce
And jingle bells in the air (happy Christmas, happy Christmas)
I've counted them up
With pleasure enough
And no one else could disagree
So I know that it's a wonderful life
I know that it's a wonderful life
I know that it's a wonderful life for you and me
For you and me
Go on, grump
For me and you
For you and me

Merry Christmas, poppa
