Picking up the story from where I left off It's 1990 now so school can fuck off I got no GCSEs, nothing higher than a 'D'
I couldn't tell me mum because she'd batter me Me and Tate sat on the bowling green, life was a shitter We had five quid between us and bought six cans of bitter I took me ten Benson home and I smoked through the sorrow If I could just avoid me Mum, maybe I'd tell her tomorrow I stumbled through the door I said "Mum it's like this"
She said "That man's been on the phone and you've made the list You're in that boy band son, come and give us a kiss"
Phoned up Martin and Rich and carried on getting pissed Boys I don't believe it, I'm goin' to be famous Pick you up in a Porsche and buy you lots of trainers I met the other guys, one seemed like a cock I think it's going to be like New Kids On The Block
I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I can't forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Baa baa baa, ba baa baa
Do you know who you are, baby
(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)
I adopted four brothers, some I liked more than others One was like a brother from another mother But the lead singer made it hard to like him And I still loved him, despite him The first three months, you know I nearly quit I played snooker with my Dad, he said "Don't be a dick Unload the bullets, you're mind is a gun You're gonna shoot yourself when they're number one"
I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I can't forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Baa baa baa, ba baa baa
Do you know who you are, baby
(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)
Now it's dinner with Versace lunch with Princess Diana And I'm gonna get battered if I go out in my manor 'Cause as much as we were loved we were also hated The boys got jealous 'cause the girls got plated And now we're famous and that, and we're dancing and that And I'm thinking I can sing why am I stood at the back
So fuck the band give me Sambuka and gak
I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I can't forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Baa baa baa, ba baa baa
Do you know who you are, baby
(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)
And now it's breaking my heart because the dream's turned to shit It ain't broke but I'll break it in a little bit And I'm always in trouble but I've stopped saying sorry Everybody's worried "What the fuck's wrong with Robbie He not answering his phone, he's not talking to me I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury"
And now I'm running away from everything that I've been And I'm pissed and I'm fucked, and I'm only nineteen I can't conform no more, I can't perform no more
But the boys know I'm fucked and so they show me the door And if the truth be told I wasn't fit enough to stay So I put my head down and walked away That was the 90's, 90 to 95
I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I can't forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Baa baa baa, ba baa baa
Do you know who you are, baby
(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)
