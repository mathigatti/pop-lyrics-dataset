The year before I thought of leaving 
I cant remember what I did 
Us in bed in Maida Vale basements 
When you left 
Westend winters 
High heel clatters 
Morning dawning 
Nothing matters 


When we took a cab 
Back when cabs had somewhere to go 
And we'd meet the stars 
When stars were people you'd want to know 
We were new to fame 
woaooh oh oh oh 
I'm so glad you came 

Some of us fell by the wayside 
Others had it and threw it away 
Some carried on pretending 
That it was not ending today 
Once admired 
Oh so tired 
Lose it all 
In the night time 

And we took a cab 
Back when cabs had somewhere to go 
And we'd meet the stars 
When stars were people you'd want to know 
We were new to fame 
I'm so glad I came 

It took me years to find my own song 
And for years I thought I'd just sing along 
But the words were wrong 
A tune that is true lives on and on 
It will still be here when I'm gone 

And we took a cab 
Back when cabs had somewhere to go 
And we'd meet the stars 
When stars were people you'd want to know 
We were new to fame 
wo oho hoh 
I'm so glad we came 

And we'd take a cab 
Back when cabs had somewhere to go 
And we'd meet the stars 
When stars were people you'd want to know 
We were new to fame 
wo oho hoh 
I'm so glad I came
