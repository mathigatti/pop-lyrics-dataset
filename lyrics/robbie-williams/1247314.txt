How lucky can one guy be?
I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said
Ain't that a kick in the head?
The room was completely black
I hugged her and she hugged back
Like the sailor said, quote
Ain't that a hole in the boat?


My head keeps spinnin'
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
If this is just the beginnin'
My life is gonna be bee-yoo-tee-ful

I've sunshine enough to spread
It's just like the fella said
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?

Like the fella once said
Ain't that a kick in the head?
Like the sailor said, quote
Ain't that a hole in the boat?

My head keeps spinnin'
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
If this is just the beginnin'
My life is gonna be bee-yoo-tee-ful

She's tellin' me we'll be wed
She's picked out a king-size bed
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick
Tell me quick oh, ain't love a kick?
Tell me quick ain't love a kick in the head?
