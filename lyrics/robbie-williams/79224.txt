There she goes 
There she goes again 
Racing thru' my brain And I just can't contain This feeling that remains There she blows 
There she blows again 
Pulsing thru' my vein And I just can't contain This feeling that remains There she goes, there she goes again 
She calls my name, pulls my train 
No-one else can heal my pain And I just can't contain This feeling that remains There she goes 
There she goes again 
Chasing down my lane And I just can't contain This feeling that remains
