The Egyptians built their pyramids
The Romans did what they did
Now everything's come down to this
It's just you and I, our kid
We could send a million to the moon
But why can't I get on with you?
Cellophane around my mouth
Stops the anger seeping out
Our deaf and dumb dinners
Gravy in the mud
No singles, just fillers
Sometimes I wish I could
But I can't behave
Though it's not the healing in me
It's just that I've been bleeding lately,
Internally


Don't turn to me,
Bite your tongue, plethoric weapon
We could learn a useful lesson
What's so great about the Great Depression
It's not a blast for me,
Blasphemy

Words cut like a knife through Vaseline
You can't really mean what you mean
When you say what you say
Tourettes make them come out that way
Wish I was here well I wish you weren't
Your gift of anger's better burnt
If nothing's said then nothing's learnt
I thought I wasn't but I'm really hurting

Our deaf and dumb dinners,
There's gravy in the mud
And I can't behave
No, it's not the heathen in me
It's just that I've been bleeding lately,
Internally

Don't turn to me
Bite your tongue, plethoric weapon
We could learn a useful lesson
What's so great about the Great Depression
It's not a blast for me,
Blasphemy

A great adventure Christmas in the snow
Seen our dimension baby, what a way to go
I won't behave
And although it's not the healing in me
It's just that I've been bleeding lately,
Internally
So turn to me
Bite your tongue, plethoric weapon
We could learn a useful lesson
In a greatness great depression
It's not a blast for me,
This blasphemy
