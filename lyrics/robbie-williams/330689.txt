Here I stand victorious
The only man who made you come
When you cried, you cried for us
And when we died, you died alone
Gravity's calling
Don't go home
Where are we


Did what I could
For one of us
I always thought it was for you
And when I lied
Oh I lied for us
Because you never heard the truth
I am lying alone tonight
Don't go home
Where are we

If we are ghosts
(A long long time ago)
It looks like we could have made it baby
We are ghosts
(A long long time ago)
Me and you
We are ghosts
(A long long time ago)
We could have made it
We are ghosts
(A long long time)
Me and you
(Ago)

Look at the time its taken me
To get away from what was said
I'll never leave
I'll always love
You know that all those words are dead
Buried in yours tonight
Move aside
I'm taking you home

On the radio
She was that summer song
Packing them in
Making them dance
A law of her own
Taking the time to sing it
I don't need you
But I'm lost
I'm lost with out you tonight
Have you no heart
Where are we
(Everybody sing it)

Ghosts
We love like ghosts
We are ghosts
They're taking down our satellite
We are ghosts
Josephine
I'll follow your star tonight
We are ghosts
If not tonight
Then when will she say
(Everybody sing it)
We're not ghosts
