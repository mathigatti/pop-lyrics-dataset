We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out 
Because I love you too much baby 
Why can't you see 
What you're doing to me 
When you don't believe a word I say? 
We can't go on together 
With suspicious minds 
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds 
So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello 
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes? 
Here we go again 
Asking where I've been 
You can't see these tears are real 
I'm crying 
We can't go on together 
With suspicious minds 
And be can't build our dreams 
On suspicious minds 
Oh let our love survive 
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die 
When honey, you know 
I've never lied to you 
Mmm yeah, yeah
