This is a song full of metaphors
All I be needing is tobacco and draw
Better let me in to your country though
Then I can show you what you're missing me for
I'm a night kind of animal
Got a receiver what you testing me for
I was scared so I ate 'em all
They tasted good but they make me look old


And ooh, you teach like a toothache,
I'm not here for my sake, how long will this mickey take
And ooh, there's heavy entertainment, out here on the pavement
The men about you gotta get away

Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya?
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya?

I'll think you're famous if that's what ya want
But you can pick your own pulpit, you must fill your own fonts
Bring some wine and some Sensodyne
Then you can be my favourite dodo
Anyone fancy Monaco
I'm a placebo they're chasing me fool
Don't be scared you could eat 'em all
They taste good but they make you look old

Ooh, you sick little cup cake,
You could be a keepsake, you jukebox to generate
And ooh, I'm heavy entertainment, in need of containment
I'm mad about you, gotta get away

Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya?
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya?

Anyone fancy Monaco?

Go get a portable recliner brain
Must take a photo for sure
Got our problems and a real long name
And she gets high on rollin' roll-ups

Ooh, you teach like a toothache,
I'm not here for my sake, how long will this mickey take
And ooh, there's heavy entertainment, out here on the pavement
The men about you gotta get away

Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya?
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya?
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya?
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind, if I, II, I, I, II, I touch ya?
