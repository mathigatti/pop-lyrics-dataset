You don't need anyone to know 
That you exist 
You don't want anyone to know 
You can't resist 


All this time, 
All those prayers, 
All this hanging around, 
All these hopes, 
All these fears, 
All this, all this... 

Our love 
Is better than their love, 
We could give you more love 
There's not enough of 
This thing called love, love... 

Do you believe that love will make 
everything alright? 
Do you believe stars disappear 
when it gets light? 

All these dreams, 
All these lies, 
All that sleeping around... 
More receptions, 
Empty rooms, 
All this, all this... 

Aren't we cruel? 
Isn't it all so cruel? 
The things we do with love... 
And the things we do without love
