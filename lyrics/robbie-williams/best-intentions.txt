Every now and then I wanna feel the escape
When the depression sets in and my spirit breaks
And I go out hunting demons and they make me beg
Got me pissing in the wind, down my own damn leg
If God wrote a book 'bout everything that he's done
I'd go searching for my name, now wouldn't every one?
And you can tell me point-blank that I'm a narcissist
I'm just needing confirmation that I exist


Please don't read my mind
I'm so scared of what you'll find
I haven't left it all behind
So much hate 'cause of all the hurt
No idea what I'm really worth
I'm holding out for peace and air time

You have to understand that my intentions are good
And everything I do I do for love
I got two little souls and I love them, man
That I'm trying to lead to the promised land
We take ego trips out to the country side
Got a big old house where we reside
And there's a big old boy with a big old gun
Stays up all night in case the weirdos come

I had a job but I resigned
Then I had a change of mind
I will again if I'm inclined
Another moan from a millionaire
I don't know why I'm telling you 'cause you don't care
I'm holding out for peace and air time

I'm a little bit older but not wiser still
I was smoking marijuana, taking sleeping pills
But I get up in the morning, take the kids to school
And my other indiscretions are so miniscule
And I really pray to God it stays that way
'Cause deep inside I think I'm still hurting
When you take your chances and you ride your luck
All you're really saying is 'I could fuck this up'
You have to understand that my intentions are good
And everything I do I do for love
I made a ton of mistakes, it's either fight or flight
But every now and then
I kinda get it right
(He kinda gets it right)
I kinda get it right
(He kinda gets it right)
