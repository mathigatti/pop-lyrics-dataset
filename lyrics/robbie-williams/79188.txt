Dig your polished nails into the dirt
Rip your skirt off, wipe the hurt off
You know it tears my heart out when you
Flirt with danger and any strangerYou're not as stupid as I look
Before I could read, you wrote the bookCursed, since your birth dear
And your worst fears have all come trueHeld my hand when I got my first tattoo
I was naked when it penetrated
Told everyone I'd slept with you
Thought you'd like it, knew you wouldn't deny itSt Peter's gonna be unfaithful
Tell God he's got a dirty angelCursed, since your birth dear
And your worst fears have all come true
Babe you're not the first here on earth dear
'Cause I'm still here and I'm cursed too,
cursed like youHush, baby sleep now
We all love you we always didCursed, since your birth dear
And your worst fears have all come true
Babe you're not the first here on earth dear
'Cause I'm still here
And I'm cursed too, cursed like youHush, baby sleep now
We all miss you, we always will
