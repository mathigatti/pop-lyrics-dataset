I used to think about it when I was a little one all alone
Used to be so excited, so excited on my own
I used to think about it when I was a little one all alone
Used to be so excited, so excited in my home


You wouldn’t believe it even if I told ya
This little girl had too much exposure
Big bad world, eyes black like a raven
I knew right then my soul needed saving

You were way out of my league back then
Go anyway, be a man

I am sixteen and I love you and I’m standing on your step
Back to before the love in my mind but I don’t know where I skipped
Turn out there, never see the limited force, I have a breast
But I’m sixteen and I love you and I have a lot to give

I used to think about it when I was a little one all alone
Used to be so excited, so excited in my home
I used to think about it when I was a little one all alone
Used to be all about it, all about it on my own

You wouldn’t believe it even if I told ya
This little girl had too much exposure
Big bad world, eyes black like a raven
I knew right then my soul needed saving

This is the end
You were way out of my league back then
Go anyway, be a man

I am sixteen and I love you and I’m standing on your step
Back to before the love in my mind but I don’t know where I skipped
Turn out there, never see the limited force, I have a breast
But I’m sixteen and I love you and I have a lot to give

Let me be your gospel
Baby, we’ve got history
Let me be your gospel
Baby, we’ve got history

This is the end, my faithful friend (Let me be your gospel / Baby, we’ve got history)
The bits of it, coming home again (Let me be your gospel / Baby, we’ve got history)
This is the end

I drink to you, you always wish me well
And toast to a “go fuck yourself”
I drink to you, you always wish me well
And toast to a “go fuck yourself”

This is the end
