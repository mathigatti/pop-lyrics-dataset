I met her at an aftershow party 
I said have we met before? 
She said hardly 
She had a curry stain 
That was down her cardie 
But her teeth were clean 
So I said smartly I'm falling in love again 
I'm so in lust with you 
Pillow over head again 
I'll suffocate with you 
If you ask me to She was educated at this school called RADA 
She was made to go by her mother 
And financed by her father 
She said Room 211 and I said (laugh) rather 
I got her name wrong once or twice 
I said I'll call ya Carol, yeh? 
She said that would be nice I'm falling in love again 
I'm so in lust with you 
My Pillow over head again 
I'll suffocate with you 
If you ask me to So I strolls of to the reception 
And I ask for me room key 
The Maitre'D - Hello 
He seemed pleased to meet me 
I went to the lift and pressed button two 
But very discreetly 
The doors close and she went for my briefs See me 
F alling in bed again 
I'm so in lust with you 
Pillow over head again 
I'll suffocate in you 
If you ask me to 
Ohhhhh to But in the throws of passion 
It hit my right between the head 
I looked down at her 
She had a bit of cabbage stuck between her teeth 
And I said I think I'm in love with ya 
I want ya kids an' getting married to ya 
And she said 
Chill out 
Rome wasn't built in a day 
And I said I wasn't on that job (B-Side of the single "Lazy days")
