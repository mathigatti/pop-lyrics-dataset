We've got stars directing our fate
and we're prayin' it's not too late
Millennium


Some say that we are players
Some say that we are pawns
But we've been making money since the day that we were born
Got some slow down (slow down)
'Cos we're low down (low down)
Run around in circles live a life of solitude,
'Till we find ourselves a partner someone to relate to,
Then we will slow down (slow down,slow down)
Before we fall down (ha ha)

We've got stars directing our fate
and we're prayin' it's not too late
'Cos we know we're falling from grace
Millennium

Live for liposuction
and detox for your rent
overdose at Christmas and give it up for Lent
My friends are all so cynical, refuse to keep the faith
We all enjoy the madness cos we know we're gonna fade away

We've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late
Cos we know we're falling from grace
Millennium

Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough
Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough
Milleninum
Millennium

We've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late
'Cos we know we're falling from grace
Millennium
(spoken) sounds like children...?

And when we come we always come too late
I often think that we were born to hate
Get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes
And when we come we always come too late
I havta think that we were born to hate
Get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes

We've got stars directing our fate
(Millennium)
and we're prayin' it's not too late
(Millennium)
Cos we know we're falling from grace

And we won't stop

We've got stars..............
(fade out)
