Can you hear me? 

In your face 
There's nowt left 
They have defaced 
The marks you left 
Upon the wall 


The writing not on there at all 
Can you stand what you stood for 
Are you more normal then before? 

Goodbye to the normals 
Goodbye to the normals 

In your place 
There's just chaps 
The kids aren't alright 
They know 
They're born today 

Reaching out to feel the sun 
At the time it seemed like fun 
I was there when you got done 
Lived two weeks by the surf 
We used to know what we were worth 
Before the normals fell to earth 

Goodbye to the normals 
Goodbye to the normals 

Whatever happened 
To the mean mortals crew 
The fine young casuals blew a fuse 
And all the Burslem lads 
Now that they're all dads 
They meant so much to me 
It makes me sad 

In your wake 
There's nowt left
