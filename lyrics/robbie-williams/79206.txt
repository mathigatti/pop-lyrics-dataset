Baby, baby i feel this sweet sensation
Honey Honey looks like a superstar
shes got a promise of lovestruck fascinationWhat am i to do?
How am i to know?
Who are you. She shimmers
like a california sunset
honey, honey glitters but
theres no gold she carries
sweetly infectious magic
formulas, so delerious
is she that serious? is she bringing me on?
Ive been waiting so longAnd this love, fool, osophy
is killing previous illusions that i had in my mind
about you seems so true
all the lies your telling tragically compelling
and my love means nothing to you so
maybe im still a love fool 
i dont want to be a love fool 
i dont want the world
i want you!
