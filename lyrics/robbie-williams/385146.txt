You a'right, how's it going yeah 
Yeah fine fine 
fine fine 


Gloomy Manchester 
Always raining 
Full of chippie max
Entertainment 
Groovy Madchester 
June split the atom 
0161 
England Seattle 

And I know I should have written it down 
And southern comfort I've forgotten you somehow 

Last night this girl in my bed 
I was telling her what I said 
When all I had was potential 
And a head full of dreadful 
With a bag full of silly 
Walking through Picadilly 
and I ...well anyway, anyway 

Gloomy Worsley 
Do so much to hurt me 
Parts of Manchester 
Make me feel dirty 
Hacienda 
On a gay night 
Droppin' little fellas 
To make me feel right 

And I think about you now and then 
When I'm talking towns to my friends 

Last night this girl in my bed 
I was telling her what I said 
When all I had was potential 
And a head full of dreadful 
With a bag full of silly 
Walking through Picadilly 
and I.... well anyway, anyway 

We're all made out of places 
And I've been to a few 
What I need now is an aerial view 
Cos I can see for myself 
That I cant see for myself 
But oh... anyway, anyway 

How I'd like to go to Manchester 
To my surprise 
8 5 hundred and 6 
When I just close my eyes 
Close my eyes 
Close my eyes 

ooh ooh ooh ohh 

Last night this girl in my bed 
I was telling her what I said 
When all I had was potential 
And a head full of dreadful 
With a bag full of silly 
Walking through Picadilly 
And I .... well anyway, anyway 

oh oh oh oh 
ooh ooh ooh 
oh oh 
oh oh
