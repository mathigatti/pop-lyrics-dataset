(Where we met on Christmas Eve)


She's an [?] I'm working class
And I treated her real bad
I never got to apologize
About the man who made you sad
I know I set the lock 'cause I was wild
When you're young you're a machine

We were drinkin' with the Idlewild
In the days of speed
And we met on Christmas Eve

We drank until the mornin' light
Like we were never goin' home
And we sang a song a million sing
Just like we scored a goal
I must've made promises I couldn't keep
But if you trust the fool then the fool you will be
But I looked into your eyes and sold you a dream
Then we fled the scene where we met on Christmas Eve

Then I moved into her big ol' house
I never been to Saint John's wood
There were movie stars and media types
We were all up to no good
And we are [?] 'cause we were wild
Body twisted where we went (Body twisted where we went)
We were livin' with the Idlewild
In the days of speed
And we met on Christmas Eve

We drank until the mornin' light
Like we were never goin' home
And we sang a song a million sing
Just like we scored a goal
I must've made promises I couldn't keep
But if you trust the fool then the fool you will be
But I looked into your eyes and sold you a dream
Then we fled the scene where we met on Christmas Eve

I know who you're with
I know where you are
I know you found love and you deserved it
I was just a kid but I know what I did
I ask for forgiveness if I'm worth it

We drank until the mornin' light
Like we were never goin' home
And we sang a song a million sing
Just like we scored a goal
I must've made promises I couldn't keep
But if you trust the fool then the fool you will be
But I looked into your eyes and sold you a dream
Then we fled the scene where we met on Christmas Eve
