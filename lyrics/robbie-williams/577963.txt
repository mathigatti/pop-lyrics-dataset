Ah-h-h-h...
Ah-h-h-h...
Things got weird
Like a three-year-old with a beard
Like a vision of Britney Spears
Like the tuna I eat seared
Do you like it a lot?
Guess what's on the clock
Or shall I fanny about on a yacht?
Stop start now it's started stop


(Ah) Save the children
(Ah) Save the children

Things got weird
Like a three-year-old with a beard
Like a vision of Britney Spears
Like the tuna I eat seared
Do you like it a lot?
Guess what's on the clock
Or shall I fanny about on a yacht?
Stop start now it's started stop...

(Ah-h-h-h to fadeout)
