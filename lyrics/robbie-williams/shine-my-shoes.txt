Another dawn
Another day
Another dollar to be made


I got a pocket in my soul
Where a little rock
A little roll
Assimilate

And I don't care what you think you know
About who I am and how it goes
I made it easy to be me
So yeah, it's easy to be me

And that's why I say
I know you can't stand me
Cos I make you so angry
More and more each day
Hey, hey, hey
The way you don't love me
Kinda makes you look ugly
Every word you say
Hey, hey, hey
Come up and see me
Ho, ho, ho
I kind of like the abuse
Hey, hey, hey
There's no room in my bed
But while you're here just by your head
Then you can shine my shoes
Shine my shoes

Get out of my lane boy
You're not in my league

Some are born to thrive
And some to under-achieve

Here's something that'll make you sick
I'm as happy as a pig in shhhhhh
I've been amused
I've been admired
I've been amazed
I've been betrayed

That's what I say
I know you can't stand me
Cos I make you so angry
More and more each day
Hey, hey, hey
The way you don't love me
Kinda makes you look ugly
Every word you say
Hey, hey, hey
Come up and see me
Ho, ho, ho
If you can take the abuse
Hey, hey, hey
There's no room in my band
But while you're here then lend a hand
And you can shine my shoes
Shine my shoes

Kneel down boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah

That's why you can't stand me
I make you so angry
More and more each day
Hey, hey, hey
The way you don't love me
Kinda makes you look ugly
Every word you say
Hey, hey, hey
Come up and see me
Ho, ho, ho
I kind of like the abuse
Hey, hey, hey
There's no room in my bed
But while you're here just by your head
Then you can shine my shoes
Shine my shoes

Shine my shoes
Until I see my face
