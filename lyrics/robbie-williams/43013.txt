You're one of God's better people
And you don't know
That's why you're special
And I cry so I can talk like this
From my downbeat existence
And I know that you can make my wish
If my wish is pure


But I don't know
I just don't know
I don't know
Let me love you so

Now I can't live this without you
I'd die wihtout you
Without you, without you

You're one of God's better people
And you don't know
That's why you're special

It must hurt to see your favorite man
Lose himself again and again
And I know you that you're my only friend
From way back when

My wish was pure
It was oh so pure
It was pure
I couldn't love you more

Now I can't live this without you
I'd die without you
Without you
Now I can't live this without you
I'd die without you
Without you, without you

And everybody's going to step aside
As you spread your wings and you will fly
And take me to the other side where they know
'cos I don't know no more
I just don't know no more
I don't know
Let me love you so

Now I can't live this without you
I'd die without you
Without you
Now I can't live this wihtout you
I'd die without you
Without you, without you

You're one of God's better people
And you don't know
That's why you're special
