I don't feel proper


I went to the dr to get a prescription
I told him little fact and lots of fiction
About a bad back that I ain't got
He tried to sell me faith healing
But I think not
I want Xanax, Vicadin and Oxycotton
Funky fill the form out
So I can drop em'
I've got all these demons
And I can't stop em'
To tell you the truth Doc
I might have a problem
Robert Williams take one adoral with water in the morning
As if I'm goin' to take one tablet I'm Keith Moon Dick head

He said this one's to take you up
Wow how
He said this one's to take you down
When I take um I don't feel sound
And I look rather round

You know what Doc its alright and all
I just heart me leg its not terminal
But a pain killer could help for whats wrong with my knee
And I'm a little bit down from too much tea
Got me own collection can't get an erection
If I take em' too long they'll fuck me complextion
That's right If I take em for like more than a few days I get that haunted look
Give me loads of pills, Give me loads of pills, Give me loads of pills, Give me loads of pills

He said this one's to take you up
Wow how
He said this one's to take you down
Wow how
When I take um I don't feel sound
And I look rather… Round

Middle 8 ish
Now if you go to the barber shop long enough then you're goina' get a hair cut
And if go to the doctors regular, then you gots to be a fuck up
Well I've got 5 or 6 if I'm at a loss
Do I have a history of drug abuse, well I never tick that box
And I now that some of you are going to be really really cross
The drug's stop working so prescription pills are boss
The glory days are gone and we've all stopped havin' it
No raves no more just bedside cabinet
Sleepers are great but don't start dabbing it
The world carries on spinning we're mad in'it

He said this one's to take you up
Wow how
He said this one's to take you down
Wow how
When I take um I don't feel sound
And I look rather… Round
