We've learnt to kick a ball, 
but we're not quite cynical 
And we've written on the wall, John's gay... 
He's gay 
And Janet's friends with John 
and she says that we're all scum 
He just gets his homework done 
and won't play not today What will we grow up to be 
(ask your brother)
What will we grow up to see 
(can't be bothered)
Will you still be friends with me 
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen Martin grew out of his A-team vest 
Nicked the pedals off my BMX 
And he says that he's had sex 
with a girl, for effect 
I lost my virginity, 
the year above us had discovered E
And I said it weren't for me, Â£12.50 What will we grow up to be 
(ask your brother)
What will we grow up to see 
(can't be bothered)
Will you still be friends with me 
fourteen, fifteen We hide in bandstands and talk in the dark 
Rain's never cold when you're young 
We were devoted to us from the start 
I know too much how to feel ... 
YOUNG! We've learnt to kick a ball, 
and we're not quite cynical 
And we've written on the wall, John's gay... 
He's gay What will we grow up to be 
(ask your brother) 
What will we grow up to see 
(can't be bothered) 
Will you still be friends with me 
fourteen, fifteen What will we grow up to be 
(ask your brother) 
What will we grow up to see 
(can't be bothered) 
Will you still be friends with me 
fourteen, fifteen YOUNG!(B-Side of the single "Kids")
