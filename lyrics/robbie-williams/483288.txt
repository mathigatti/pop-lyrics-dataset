It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
but when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry,
oh I wanna' die 


It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when I see you out and about 
it's such a crime
if you should ever want to be loved by anyone,
It's not unusual it happens every day 
no matter what you say
you find it happens all the time
love will never do what you want it to
why can't this crazy love be mine 

It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual, to be sad with anyone
but if I ever find that you've changed at anytime
it's not unusual to find out 
that I'm in love with you
