Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey


It takes a certain kind of man with a certain reputation
To alleviate the cash from a whole entire nation
Take my loose change and build my own space station
(Just because you can, man)

Ain’t no refutin’ or disputin’ I’m a modern Rasputin
Subcontract disputes to some brutes in Louboutin
Act highfalootin’ while my boys put the boot in
(They do the can-can)

Spasibo

Party like a Russian
End of discussion
Dance like you’ve got concussion, oh
Put a doll inside a doll

Party like a Russian
Disco seduction
Party like a Russian, oh
Have it like an oligarch

I got Stolly and Bolly and Molly so I’m jolly
And I’m always off my trolley so I never say sorry
There’s a doll inside a doll inside a doll inside a dolly
(Hello dolly)

I put a bank inside a car inside a plane inside a boat
It takes half the western world just to keep the ship afloat
And I never ever smile unless there’s something to promote
I just won’t emote

Spasibo

Party like a Russian
End of discussion
Dance like you’ve got concussion, oh
We’ve got soul and we’ve got gold

Party like a Russian
Disco seduction
Party like a Russian, oh
Have it like an oligarch

Raz, dva, tri, chetyre

We’re the Russian boys, we’re everywhere
There’s revolution in the air!
Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh

Party like a Russian
End of discussion
Dance like you’ve got concussion, oh
Put a doll inside a doll

Party like a Russian
Disco seduction
Party like a Russian, oh
Have it like an oligarch
