Peace and mercy to all men 
We're gonna get boozed up again 
Amber nectar, pub Messiahs 
Roast our nuts on open fires 
Push to find three wise men 
You definitely won't find a virgin 
It ain't my round, so I'll be cheering 
I believe in Christmas what do you believe in? Mine is yours and yours is mine, 
I believe in Christmas time 
Everybody's feeling fine, 
We believe in Christmas time 
Mine is yours and yours is mine, 
I believe in Christmas time 
Everybody's feeling fine,
'Cause we believe in Christmas time Happy birthday Jesus Christ 
Here's the Spice Girls' merchandise 
Got Christmas spirit without a doubt
I robbed Santa while he was out 
I don't care if lords are leapin' 
I'll take a gat to the back while they are sleepin 
And make sure that they won't be breathin' 
I believe in Christmas what do you believe in? Mine is yours and yours is mine, 
I believe in Christmas time
Everybody's feeling fine, 
We believe in Christmas time 
Mine is yours and yours is mine, 
I believe in Christmas time 
Everybody's feeling fine, 
'Cause we believe in Christmas time (B-Side of the single "Angels")
