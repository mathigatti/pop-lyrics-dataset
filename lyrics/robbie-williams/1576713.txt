Microwave yourself today,
save you for a rainy day.
Hello Deceptacon,
this will not be going away.


From all of us here to all over there,
we wish you all of the best,
all of the years she said
"Well, he's never been quite bright"
and I know we'll be stepping on eggshells tonight.

And all over Britain,
we wait for permission
to form another queue.
We stand in position,
though somebody's listening,
and that somebody's you.
But what can I do?

"I love you but I don't like you right now"
is all she had to say.

Send my best to all concerned,
I know I've been a gracious host.
Goodbye Deceptacon.

Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
What are you to be?
What can I do for you?
What can you do for me?
Who are you?
What are you to be?
