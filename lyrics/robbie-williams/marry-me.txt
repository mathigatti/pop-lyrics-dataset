Silence in the courtyard
Silence in the street
The biggest smile in the world
Is just about to speak
What I want to say is
Four simple words
In this particular order
So here it goes


You make me feel
Like nothing has been real
Until now

Please, I'm on my knees
I concede
Will you marry me?

Silence for a moment
Silence from the world
These are the four words
That simply must be heard
I'm not very romantic
And I know I get things wrong
And 'bout the time I get to say I'm sorry
It's been too long

But you make me feel
Like nothing has been real
Until now

Please
(I'd love you in my life)
I'm on my knees
(I want you for my wife)
I concede
(Lead me to the light)

Will you marry me?
Oh, my darling
Please
(I'd love you in my life)
I'm on my knees
(I want you for my wife)
I concede
(Lead me to the light)

I won't give up
I won't break down
In a little while
So give it up
Or put me down
Anyway meanwhile

Please
(I'd love you in my life)
I'm on my knees
(I want you for my wife)
I concede
(Lead me to the light)

Will you marry me?
Everybody say
Please
(I want you in my life)
I'm on my knees
(I want you for my wife)
I concede
(Lead me to the light)
Will you marry me?

(I'd love you in my life)
(I want you for my wife)
(Lead me to the light)
Will you marry me?
