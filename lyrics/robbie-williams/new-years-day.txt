If I had to die tonight
I'd like to think, we'd be alright
What a life, man
What a life


From the cradle to the grave
I scream and echoes will remain
What a life, man
When you're strange

Did you learn to ride the pain
Like tears in the rain? (Ah-ah)
Was your world insane? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Did you take aim?

Happy days are here again
If we can't be lovers, let's be friends
I just called to say
Happy New Year's Day

Don't know what we're fighting for
But I can't do it anymore
I just called to say
Happy New Year's Day
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

You're out of sight
Not out of mind
If I could pause or rewind
I'd rewind man, I'd rewind
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

When I die, I'll die laughing
Don't cry 'cause it's over
Smile 'cause it happened
What a life, man
What a life

I'm still learning to ride the pain
Like a bike through the rain (ah-ah)
Is anything changed (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Should I take aim? (Fire)

Happy days are here again
If we can't be lovers, let's be friends
I just called to say
Happy New Year's Day

Don't know what we're fighting for
But I can't do it anymore
I just called to say
Happy New Year's Day

Oh, it's an energy (ooh-ooh)
Oh, the memories (ooh-ooh)
I hope you remember me and be happy! (Oh-oh)
Oh, it's an energy (ooh-ooh)
Oh, the memories (ooh-ooh)
I hope you remember me and be happy!

(Happy, happy)
(Happy, happy)
(Happy, happy)
(Happy New Year's Day)

Happy days are here again
If we can't be lovers, let's be friends
I just called to say
Happy New Year's Day

Don't know what we're fighting for
But I can't do it anymore
I just called to say
Happy New Year's Day

Happy days are here again
If we can't be lovers, let's be friends
I just called to say
Happy New Year's Day

Don't know what we're fighting for
But I can't do it anymore
I just called to say
Happy New Year's Day
