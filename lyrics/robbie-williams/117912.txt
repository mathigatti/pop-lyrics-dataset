Trying to be misunderstood
But it doesn't do me any good
Love the way they smile at me
And their face for eternity
Now let them all fly half
When it comes down
It all comes down
And you will not be found
When it's over
It's all over
Even if I make a sound


I'll be misunderstood
By the beautiful and good in this city
None of it was planned
Take me by the hand
Just don't try and understand

Trying to be misunderstood
Just a product of my childhood
Still I find myself outside
You can't say I haven't tried
Perhaps I tried to hard
No excuses
I Won't apologise
To justify your lies
Come find me
Tell them to me
Look me in the eyes

I'll be misunderstood
By the beautiful and good in this city
None of this was planned
Take me by the hand
Just don't try and understand

Can't forgive sorry to say
You don't know you're guilty anyway
Isn't it funny how we don't speak the language of love?
