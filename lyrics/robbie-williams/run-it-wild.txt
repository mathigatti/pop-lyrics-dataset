Your mother’s downtown and there's no one at the station
Steal your daddy’s money and pick a destination
Run it wild, run it wild
Take the money and run it wild
It’s another chance for another generation
When you kicked up your heels, you picked a vocation
Run it wild, run it wild
Like we used to, run it wild


When you were running wild
When you let your love run wild
When you let your love run wild
My run it wild, run it wild, run it wild, baby
Run it wild
Go out and run it wild

Run to, run to the ocean
Run to the ocean
Run away as fast as you can from here
It’s not enough
Run to, run to the ocean
Run to the ocean
Run away as fast as you can from here
While you’re still young

When you were running wild
When you let your love run wild
When you let your love run wild
My run it wild, run it wild, run it wild, baby
Run it wild
I’m losing hope in my heart
That the end is better than the start
We get hung up on the past, nothing lasts
You’ll get lost, you’ll get caught
They’ll tell you everything’s your fault
But you’re only a child for a while, and you got style
Go out and run it wild

Julia
Julia
Are we gonna crumble under your weight?
Lord, I hope so
Julia
Julia
Are we gonna crumble under your weight?
Lord, I hope so

You would run it wild
When you let your love run wild
When you let your love run wild
My run it wild, run it wild, run it wild, baby
Run it wild
I’m losing hope in my heart
That the end is better than the start
You get hung up on the past, nothing lasts
You’ll get lost, you’ll get caught
They’ll tell you everything’s your fault
But you’re only a child for a while, and you got style
Go out and run it wild
