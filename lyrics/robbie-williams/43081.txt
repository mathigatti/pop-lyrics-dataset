I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got


I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around, stickaround

Heaven knows I was such a young boy
I didn't know what I wanted to be

I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me

To win the race? A prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV

But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
And now I'm gonna get me so happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Somehow the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me yeah yeah

(Freedom) I won't let you down
(Freedom) I will not give you up
(Freedom) You've gotta have some faith in the sound
(You've gotta give for what you take) it's the one good thingthat I've got
(Freedom) I won't let you down
(Freedom) So please don't give me up
(Freedom) Because I would really really love to stick around,stick around
(You've gotta give for what you take)

Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
What a kick just my buddies and me

(What a kick just my buddies and me)
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV (boys on MTV)


But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
And now I'm gonna get myself happy



I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man



All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me yeah yeah


(Freedom) I won't let you down
(Freedom) I will not give you up
(Freedom) You've gotta have some faith in the sound
(You've gotta give for what you take) it's the one good thingthat I've got
(Freedom) I won't let you down
(Freedom) So please don't give me up

(Freedom) Because I would really really love to stick around,stick around
(You've gotta give for what you take)



Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
And when you shake your ass
They notice fast
Some mistakes were built to last
That's what you get
That's what you get
I just hope you understand sometimes the clothes do not make theman
All we have to see now

Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me yeah yeah


(repeat chorus)
