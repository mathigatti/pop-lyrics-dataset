How do you rate the morning sun
After a long and sleepless night
How many stars would you give to the moon
Do you see those stars from where you are
Shine on the lost and loneliest
The ones who can't get over it


You always wanted more than life
But now you don't have the appetite
In a message to the troubadour
The world don't love you anymore
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun

Stuck inside the rainbow
You could happen to be
Cause I've been close to where you are
Drown to places you have seen
It all seems so familiar
Like they've been sent to kill'ya

It doesn't take an astronaut
To float in a space is just a thought
The morning brings a mystery
The evening makes it history
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun

And the village drunk
Sadly passed away,
It was a shame, I never knew his name
I wonder if he sat there in the morning
And watched the sunrise

How do you rate the morning sun
It was just too heavy for me
And all I wanted was the world
If you were the star that lit the sun
Don't go wasting your time
Cause there is no finish line
And you don't see anything,
Not even love not anthing,
The night can take the man from you
A sense of wonder overdue
The morning brings a mystery
The evening makes it history
Who am I to rate the morning sun?
