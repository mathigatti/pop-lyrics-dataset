Are you cut up or do you easily forget ?
Are you still around, why haven't you managed to die yet ?
You could prop up the bar in hell
How do you sleep, you've never loved
Why was I never good enough ?
You thought you'd leave me falling forever
Karma killer
Needless to say, I guess you know I hate you
You're so full of sin even the devil rates you
I hope you choke on your Bacardi and Coke
How do you breathe, why don't you cry ?
How come you never ask me why ?
You're not a man, stand and deliver
Karma killer
How do you sleep, you've never loved
Why was I never good enough ?
You thought you'd leave me falling forever
Karma killer, karma killer
Karma killer, karma killer
I hope you choke on your Bacardi and Coke
Look what you didn't take from me
Look what you didn't take from me
Look what you didn't take from me
Look what you didn't take from me
No no no no no no no no no no no no
(I don't need to take revenge cos they're coming to get you)
No no no no no no no no no no no no
(There's no hope for you my friend cos they're coming to getyou)
Karma killer
Karma killer
Karma killer...............................
