There's scary monsters in my bedroom tonight
They´re playing off-on-off-on-off with the lights 
Without permission they just dizz up the lights 
And they're not seeing the lights, alright 
I wish they go and talk to Jesus instead 
Cause now they're bored and want to mess with my head 
I know I´m lonely but I won´t share my bed 
All the things that you do when you´re dead 
Please, please 
Aahaahaahaaa 
Please, please 
Aaahaaahaahaa 
Please, please 
Aaahaaahaahaa 
Please, please 
Aaahaaahaahaa 
Oh, you're breaking my heart 
When I was young I didn't know what to do 
I started thinking maybe I was dead too 
A world of actors watching me, watching you 
Till I hadn´t a clue what was true 
Don´t send the sandman to a sensitive kid 
And make-up monsters in my house where they live 
You'll beat the demons that they scare themselves with 
I know cause you know that I did 
Please, please 
Aahaahaahaaa 
Please, please 
Aaahaaahaahaa 
Please, please 
Aaahaaahaahaa 
Please, please 
Aaahaaahaahaa 
You're breaking my heart 
Oh, I´m so scared 
With knowing there´s no one 
Or knowing there´s somebody there 
Mental arithmetic 
Make me a lunatic 
Hey to the heretic 
I´m feeling alright, it´s alright 
Please, please 
Aahaahaahaaa 
Please, please 
Aaahaaahaahaa 
Please, please 
Aaahaaahaahaa 
Please, please 
Aaahaaahaahaa 
Oh, are you breaking my heart
