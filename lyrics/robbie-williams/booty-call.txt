I like your style, I like your hair, I like your humour too
I like you here but you were there, send me your digits through
You're like a ray of sunshine on an otherwise boring night
Send me your address over, I'll uber myself a ride


Oh, do they call it a booty call?
'Cause I've never been hip, chic or down with the kids
And oh, what are they being politically correct for?
Let's call it a booty call, baby, if that's what it is

I like your eyes, the way they smile, you've got that special brew
I been online all of the night trying to get a message to you
'Cause you're like a ray of sunshine on an otherwise lonely night
I'll send a carriage over, it sounds like a good compromise

Do they still call it a booty call?
'Cause I've never been hip, chic or down with the kids
Oh, let's take a break from this punch and judy talk
And call it a booty call, baby, 'cause that's what it is

B-double o-t-y, why? 'cause I love it
B-double-o-t-y 'cause I can
B-double-o-t-y, you above it
B-double-o-t, why can't you think like a man?

Do they still call it a booty call?
'Cause I've never been hip, chic or down with the kids
Oh, let's take a break from this punch and judy talk
And call it a booty call, baby, 'cause that's what it is
That's what it is
That's what it is
