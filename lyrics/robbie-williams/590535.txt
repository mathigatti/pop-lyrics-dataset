I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy but nothing is no When I feel heavy metal
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Well, I lie and I'm easy
All the the time but I'm never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem When I feel heavy metal
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Well, I lie and I'm easy
All the time but I am never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you
