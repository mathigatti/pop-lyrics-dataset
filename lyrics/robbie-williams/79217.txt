Rome Munich Rome 
All the women and the money I've blown 
Rome Munich Rome 
There's still a shedload of seeds to be sown 
And I've been stung 
I plan to have it all while I'm still young 
And I know you're low 
We'll be alright tomorrow You know it's not enough to kiss you in my sleep 
A dream is not long enough 
So give me something I can keep Rome Munich Rome
So many people so alone 
Rome Munich Rome
Pack your bags take me home 
In time you'll see
How much I mean to you and you to me 
And I know you're low 
We'll be alright tomorrow You know it's not enough to kiss you in my sleep 
A dream is not long enough 
So give me something I can keep Rome Munich Rome
Rome Munich Rome Rome Munich Rome 
All the women and the money I've blown 
Rome Munich Rome 
There's still a shedload of seeds to be sown You know it's not enough to kiss you in my sleep 
A dream is not long enough 
So give me something I can keep You know it's not enough to kiss you in my sleep 
A dream is not long enough 
So give me something I can keep So give me something 
Give me something 
Give me something 
Give me something 
Give me something 
I can keep(B-Side of the single "Millennium")
