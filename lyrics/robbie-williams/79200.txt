Ask me why,
I say it's most unusual
How can I even try to explain
Why today I feel like dancing
Singing like lovers sing
When I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing.Ask me when (ahhhhh)
I say it started when I met you (ahhhhh)
And ever since then I knew that the past couldn't last
For right now I think I'm running
A race I know I'm gonna win
And I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing.If people say I'm crazy, I tell them that it's true
Let them watch with amazement
Say it won't last beyond breakfast
It's a phase he's going through
Denigrate or speculate on what I'm going through
Because it ain't the sort of thing I'd normally doAsk me what (ahhhhh)
I say I think it's good for you (ahhhhh)
Believe it or not, I know where it's all leading to
I feel like taking all my clothes off
And dancing to the Rite of Spring
And I wouldn't normally do this kind of thingI wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
I wouldn't normally do this kind of-
Wouldn't normally do this kind of-
Wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
