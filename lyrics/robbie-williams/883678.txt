Mama was Queen of the mambo
Papa was King of the congo
Deep down in the jungle
I started banging my first bongo
Every monkey'd like to be
In my place insteed of me
'Cause I'm the King of bongo, baby
I'm the King of bongo, bong


I went to the big town
Where there is a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city
Looking for a bigger crown
So I play my boogie
For the people of the big city
But they don't go crazy
When I'm banging on my boogie

I'm the King of the bongo,
King of the bongo, bong
Hear me when I come, baby
King of the bongo,
King of the bongo, bong
Hear me when I come

Nobody'd like to be
in my place instead of me
'Cause nobody go crazy
when I'm banging on my boogie
I'm the King without a crown,
hanging loose in the big town
But I'm the King of the bongo, baby,
I'm the king of bongo, bong

I'm the King of the bongo,
King of the bongo, bong
Hear me when I come, baby
King of the bongo,
King of the bongo, bong
Hear me when I come

They say that I'm a clown,
making too much dirty sound
They say there is no place
for little monkey is this town
Nobody'd like to be
in my place instead of me
'Cause nobody go crazy
when I'm banging on my boggie

I'm the King of the bongo,
King of the bongo, bong
Hear me when I come, baby
King of the bongo,
King of the bongo, bong
Hear me when I come

Banging on my bongo,
all that swing belongs to me
I'm so happy there's nobody
in my place instead of me
I'm the King without a crown,
hanging loose in the big town
But I'm the King of the bongo, baby,
I'm the king of bongo, bong

I'm the King of the bongo,
King of the bongo, bong
Hear me when I come, baby
King of the bongo,
King of the bongo, bong
Hear me when I come

Mama was Queen of the mambo
Papa was King of the congo
Deep down in the jungle
I started banging my first bongo
Every monkey'd like to be
In my place insteed of me
'Cause I'm the King of bongo, baby
I'm the King of bongo, bong

I'm the King of the bongo,
King of the bongo, bong
Hear me when I come, baby
King of the bongo,
King of the bongo, bong
Hear me when I come
