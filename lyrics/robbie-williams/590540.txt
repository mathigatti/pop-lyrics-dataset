They're out of sorts in Sunderland
And terribly cross in Kent
They're down in Hull
And the isle of Mall
Is seething with discontent
They're nervous in northumberland
And Devon is down the drain
They're filled with wrath on Firth of Forth
And sullen on Salisbury plain
In Dublin they're depressed lads
Maybe because they're Celts
For drake is hurrying West, lads
And so is everyone else
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!
Misery is here to stay


There are bad times just around the corner
There are dark clouds hurtling through the sky
And it's no good whining
About a silver lining
For we know from experience they won't roll by
With a scowl and a frown we'll keep our peckers down
And prepare for depression and doom and dread
We're going to unpack our troubles from our old kit bag
And wait until we drop down dead

They're nervous in Nigeria
They're all going crazy in Crete
In Bucharest they're so depressed
They're frightend to cross the streets
In Maine the melancholia
Is deeper than tongue can tell
In Monako all the croupiers know
They haven't a hope in hell
In far away Australia
Each wallaby is well aware
The world's a total failure
Without any time to spare
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!
Suffering and dismay

There are bad times just around the corner
The horizon is gloomy as can be
There are black birds over
The greyish cliffs of Dover
And the rats are preparing to leave the BBC
We're unhappy breed and very bored indeed
When reminded of something that Nelson said
While the press and the politicians nag, nag, nag
We'll wait until we drop down dead

There are bad times just around the corner
And the outlook's absolutely vile
There are home fires smoking from Windermere to Woking
And we're not going to tighten our belt and Smile Smile Smile
At the sound of shots
We'd just as soon as not
Get a hot water bottle and go to bed
We're going to unpack our troubles from our old kit bag
And wait until we drop down dead
I like your story Land of Hope and Glory
Wait until we drop down dead
