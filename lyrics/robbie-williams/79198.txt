Yoko's cutting keys in Soho 
I've been there and I should know oh face it 
I'll stick up for auntie Sally
Worzel's just a dirty scally fragrant 
Mia Farrow's patching marrows down 
at the place where all the face fit 
Robin Cousins doing dozens 
on a little pudding so he rakes it I'm the reserection 
I may steal your soul 
I am very evil 
I live for rock and roll Shirley Bassey's playing Lassie 
up a pole in Tallahassee hates it
Norris McWhirter's doing furters 
in a little place how's he fake it 
It's another appetiser I can go 
and buy a Tizer laced fit 
I don't know where I've been 
but I know where I've been is near a lake I'm an erection
I may steal your soul
I am very evil 
I live for rock and roll I'm an erection
I may steal your soul
I am very evil 
I live for rock and roll (B-Side of the single "Let me entertain you")
