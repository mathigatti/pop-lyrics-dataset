I'm gonna write you a letter 
I think the sooner the better 
Cause the time is right to find a better day I'm an angry young man 
Man I wish I was young 
My guitar is out of tune even that's highly strung And the words we didn't say last night 
Shook the world to the core 
We had nothing to say last night 
We'd said it all before 
And I say Lonely times and lonely tears 
Will fade away when you disappear 
The time is right for me to stray 
I'm gonna find a better day Kickin off cause it suits me 
I'm gonna leave the country 
And the time is right to find a better day Makin sense of my past now 
I'll only love when I want to 
Cause the time is right to find a better day Maybe I didn't love you 
Maybe you loved her less 
Would you have preferred it 
If I'd have worn the dress 
Cos I say Lonely times and lonely tears
Will fade away when you disappear
The time is right for me to stray 
I'm gonna find a better day Lonely times and lonely tears 
Will fade away when you disappear 
The time is right for me to stray 
I'm gonna find a better day No where to run to baby 
No where to hide 
I got no where to run to baby 
And nowhere to hide(B-Side of the single "Old before I die")
