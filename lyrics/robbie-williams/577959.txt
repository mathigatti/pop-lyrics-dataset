With all the will in the world
I'm still powerless
I found myself breaking the girl
The king is half undressed
She's not my saviour
(I don't want your love)
Don't take my seed
(It's not your love that I need)
You're in no danger caressing me
But you're talking to a man I'm not supposed to be


And the clothes remain the same
I fear to face the walk of shame
Been nice to know you
I'm soaking in the morning rain
Find my car forgot your name
Been nice to hold you

Don't feel small
When I don't call
If I could talk I'd tell you
If I ever did don't answer kid
I've only lies to sell you
I'll be your stranger
(I don't want your love)
If you're in need
(It's not your love that I need)
It's odd behaviour seducing me
I'm a million miles away and she's too blind to see

And the clothes remain the same
I fear to face the walk of shame
Been nice to know you
I'm soaking in the morning rain
Find my car forgot your name
Been nice to hold you

Step on board the gravy train
Same old faces different names
You bet your life I will complain
Cause I'm a sensitive boy
The real McCoy
Don't wanna stick me on your bed post
And I never really will forget you
I'm sorry dear have I met you
All that you take from me is coffee and tea and sympathy

And the clothes remain the same
I fear to face the walk of sham
Been nice to know you
I'm soaking in the morning rain
Find my car forgot your name
Been nice to hold you

I have my needs
I hope she leaves
(All that you take from me is coffee and tea and sympathy)
I have my needs
I hope she leaves
(All that you take from me is coffee and tea and sympathy)

And the clothes remain the same
I fear to face the walk of sham
Been nice to know you
I'm soaking in the morning rain
Find my car forgot your name
Been nice to hold you
