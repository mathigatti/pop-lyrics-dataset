You were always trippin
I was always stoned 
You knew I was a piss-head
That's why I never phoned
So why'd you act surprised
I was drunk on the day we met 


When I see you with your new man
Something stirs inside of me
It's not that I want you back 
It's how ugly love can be
Be still my foolish pride
I couldn't love you anyway

Like a baseball cap worn backwards
Like calling cocaine gear 
Like a pair of Evisu jeans 
We were so last year

And we got high all the time
Night after night 
Line after line
How did I make 'I love you' sound sincere
When you were just a one-night-stand
That lasted a year

We were always fighting 
You thought the drama did us good
Well I found it really boring 
Get off the cross we need the wood
Say hi to your mum and dad
It's all their fault anyway

Like Patrick Cox and girl power
Jean Claude van Damme and Cheers
Vanilla Ice and Take That 
We were so last year

Getting high all the time
Night after night 
Line after line
How did I make 'I love you' sound sincere
When you were just a one-night-stand
That lasted a year

Like a baseball cap worn backwards
Like calling cocaine gear
Like a pair of Evisu jeans 
We were so last year

Getting high all the time
Night after night 
Line after line
How did I make 'I love you' sound sincere
When you were just a one-night-stand
That lasted a year

All in the name of entertainment
We could come to some arrangement
Just a one-night-stand
That lasted a year
