The snow crunches underfoot
As I walk up to your door
And I realize this face of mine's been ravaged for the longest time
And you might not recognize me anymore
But, darlin', it's your daddy
Please forgive me for what I've done
I know you despise the tears
That lines the fear that holds them in inside
I'm sorry, I was wrong


Just give me one last Christmas
I'll make it up to you
Sadness is a friend of mine
I've let you down a million times
Give me one last Christmas with you

I know I don't deserve it
If I was you, I'd slam the door
We paid the cost for the things we lost
I blew up all the lines I crossed
'Cause I don't come 'round here anymore

Give me one last Christmas
I'll make it up to you
Sadness is a friend of mine
I've let you down a million times
Give me one last Christmas with you

Darlin', I know I hurt you bad
And I don't deserve your kindness or fuse
I left your mother
To be a father too
And I realize I lost my life
When I walked out on you

Give me one last Christmas
I'll make it up to you
Sadness is a friend of mine
I've let you down a million times
Give me one last Christmas with you
Just give me one last Christmas
I'll make it up to you
Sadness is a friend of mine
I've let you down a million times
Give me one last Christmas with you
