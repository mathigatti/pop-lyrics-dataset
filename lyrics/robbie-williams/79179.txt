How lucky can one guy be?
I kissed her and she kissed me.
Like a fella once said:
"Ain't that a kick in the head?"
The room was completely black,
I hugged her and she hugged back.
Like a sailor said quote:
"Ain't that a hole in a boat?"
My head keeps spinnin',
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
If this is just the beginnin'
My life is gonna be beautiful.
I've sunshine enough to spread,
It's just like the fella said.
Tell me quick,
ain't that a kick in the head?

She's telling me we'll be wed,
She's picked out a king size bed,
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sad.
Tell me quick,
Oh, ain't that a kick...?
Tell me quick,
ain't that a kick in the head?
