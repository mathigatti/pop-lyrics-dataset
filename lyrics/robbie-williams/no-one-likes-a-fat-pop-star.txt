I come from a land of kebabs and curries,
Second helpings - no worries.
Piled up carbs upon the plate,
Then one day it's too late
No breakfast, no luncheon,
Just carpets I'll munch on
A thimble of self esteem


Glazed nothings for afters and absence of laughter,
The saddest that I've ever been
You just can't be portly, not this side of fourty,
Showbiz's a single-chinned game
Scum paparazzi and weight police
Nasties have narrowed the hall of fame

No one likes a fat pop star
Pop is a place for the thin,
No one likes a fat pop star
We want to hear thin people sing!
When I get faint I chew through my restraints
It's the best meal that I've had all week,
If I could eat my own words, I'd tear through the verbs
But nobody pays me to speak

No one likes a fat pop star
Pop is a place for the thin,
No one wants a fat pop star
I'm sorry, we can't fit you in!
Now you've upset me - I feel like a snack!
A packet of minstrels, a pie and a nap
So whats wrong with that?

No breakfast, no luncheon,
Just carpets I'll munch on
And a thimble of self esteem.
Glazed nothing for afters and absence of laughter,
The thinnest that I've ever been
Thank you!
