Once upon a northern city
Where I lay my head
Trying to hear Saint Nick's footsteps
Awake in my bed
All the presents I hope I'll get are runnin' through my mind
But I'm not sure Santa's real anymore
'Cause I heard it from my teacher at school
I don't care what they say to me


'Cause I still believe it'll be the best Christmas ever
(The best Christmas ever)
(The best Christmas ever)
The best Christmas ever
(The best Christmas ever)
(The best Christmas ever)

Many years have passed since then and
More has been revealed
Now I sit with all my children
I know Santa's real
I can't wait to tuck them in tonight
'Cause I need a moment with the love of my life
I don't think she could mean more to me

'Cause I still believe it'll be the best Christmas ever
(The best Christmas ever)
(The best Christmas ever)
The best Christmas ever
(The best Christmas ever)
(The best Christmas ever)

I remember those dark Christmas days
When fairy lights would vanish in the haze
Sure, I heard a voice sayin' "Stick around" to me
'Cause you will believe, you and your family
Just you wait and see

It'll be the best Christmas ever
(The best Christmas ever)
(The best Christmas ever)
The best Christmas ever
(The best Christmas ever)
(The best Christmas ever)
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la
