If I don't kick your back door in, 
Then no one will, your buzz is shit 
Without some weight and a wonky gate 
I'll bring my mates and we'll bounce it on the water 


Try to decide for my accent is from over Scotia, 
I don't think you know it 
Now I can't sing, but I could lift heavy things 
And when I get nervous I get loaded 

No one shows that no one knows I'm right 
(Being the alien act, catching the bills or not) 
You could be a stranger over night 
(Provocative and revile, let's break America) 

(Ha ha, we'll break it 
Ha ha, we'll break it 
Ha ha, we'll break it 
Let's break America) 
[2x] 

All your kids are fat 
They sit where they sat 
So big you could bounce 'em on the water 
My UK's in entropy 
And its Dollars fu.ck 
Let's bounce sh.it on the water 

Try to decide for my accent is from over Scotia, 
I don't think you know it 
Now I can't sing, but I deserve everything 
And when I get nervous I throw sh.it 

No one shows that no one knows I'm right 
(Being the alien, actual belzebub) 
You could be a stranger over night 
(Provocative and revile, let's break America) 

(Ha ha, we'll break it 
Ha ha, we'll break it 
Ha ha, we'll break it 
Let's break America) 
[2x] 

We're gonna know it now 
We're getting on a plane 
We gonna do a radio show and they will play this record 
We're gonna know it now 
We're getting on a plane 
We gonna do a radio show and break me with this record 
We're gonna know it now 
We're getting on a plane 
We gonna do a radio show and they will play this record 
We're gonna know it now 
We're getting on a plane 
We gonna do a radio show and break me with this record 

No one shows that no one knows I'm right 
(Being the alien, actual belzebub) 
You could be a stranger over night 
(Provocative and revile, let's break America)
