Superblind...
Sleep sleep feel the deep,
Get away from the devil in all?
Don't you want to see
What you could have won
Bittersweet, your defeat baby
I'm much sicker than you
All you are is colours
And your colours run


Isn't it genius that you give tonight
You just keep on doing harm
Could only see the sense in being superblind
And just keep on keeping on

I can't help thinking about me
put a thought in for me
I'm the genius behind me
Maybe I shouldn't have said it
Here's to the next century
What will they think if they think about me

Here it is, what a lie say a prayer,
For the way it should be
We are people they don't believe
Wish your mother wouldn't bother
Won't she just stay out of your mind?
Or should they stay when you make them leave

Isn't it genius that you give tonight?
You just keep on doing harm
Could only see the sense in being superblind
And just keep on keeping on

I can't help thinking about me
put a thought in for me
I'm the genius behind me
Maybe I shouldn't have said it
Here's to the next century
What will they think if they think about me

I can't help think about me
Won't you put a prayer in for me
You could talk and think about me

It's like these props know when we're dancing
We can pray our way out of here
You're like a new wave old romantic
Try to break our heart but got stuck on it
Superblind

When your superblind
Keep you out of mind
Because we all know
Cos we didn't care.
