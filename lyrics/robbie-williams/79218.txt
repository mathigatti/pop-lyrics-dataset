Ah, yeah, yeah 
Oh Baby She is calling 
And you don't want to answer back
I'm falling 
Trying to find my way back 
Maybe I'll never know 
Where I've been (what I've seen) 
I hope she'll meet me inbetween
So I hope I get through this hurricane
And teach me how to smile again 
She makes me high (She makes me high 
She makes me high (She makes me high) 
She don't even try (She makes me high) 
And I wanna know why (why, why, why) 
Do, do, do, hey yeah Do, do, do The world's calling 
And it's falling at your feet 
And you're sorry 
Is it so hard to believe 
There's an innocence surrounding you
I see the way that people look at you 
So hold my hand through this hurricane
And teach me how to smile again 
She makes me high (She makes me high)
She don't even try (She makes me high) 
She makes me high (She makes me high) 
And I wanna know why (why, why, why) She puts her turn out 
She is good 
She suits me like I wish you would 
She is honest now 
She is true 
She's the complete 
Opposite of you (cheers, applause) 
She makes me high (She makes me high) 
She makes me high (She makes me high)
She makes me high (She makes me high)
(Why) I wanna know 
She makes me high (She makes me high)
She makes me high (She makes me high) 
And I wanna know why 
She makes me high(B-Side of the single "Lazy days")
