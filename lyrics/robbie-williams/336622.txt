Don't let your eyes tell the brain
You should feel ashamed
Everyone needs it baby
And I feel the same
Didn't quite catch your name
Hush, hush, hush
Don't say a thing
Let's see what the night will bring
It might be everything


Oh it hurts
When you're too blind to see
Please don't read my mind
I tell the truth to me

Sin sin sin
Look where we've been
And where we are tonight
Hate the sin not the sinner
I'm just after a glimmer
Of love and life
Deep inside

Hush hush hush
To speak is a sin
And neither of us
Need rescuing
Just relax
It's what Jesus would do
We're made in his image baby
Let's ride this thing through

Oh it hurts
When you're to blind to see
What about us
Well it was just for me

Sin sin sin
Look where we've been
And where we are tonight
Hate the sin not the sinner
I'm just after a glimmer
Of love and life
Deep inside

I won't sing of amore
It don't sound sincere
Love is a cliche
But it fits not here
I'll disappear

Sin sin sin
Look where we've been
And where we are tonight
Hate the sin not the sinner
I'm just after a glimmer
Of love and life
Deep inside

Deep inside

It's loves great sex joy
I love you
You love my
Hate how it it feels inside
Feels inside
Feels inside
