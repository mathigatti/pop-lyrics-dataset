When I wake up in the morning, with my hair down in my eyes
And she says hi
And I hurry to the breakfast table
While the kids are going off to school goodbye
And she reaches out and takes my hand
Squeezes it and says, how you feelin', hon?
And I look across at smiling lips that warms my heart
And I see my morning sun


And if that's not lovin' me
Then all I've got to say

God didn't make the little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
There's no such thing as Dr. Zeuss
Or Disneyland and Mother Goose, no nurs'ry rhyme
God didn't make the little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feeling low
I think about your face aglow and ease my mind

Sometimes I call him up, knowing he's busy
And ask if he can get away and meet me
Maybe grab a bite to eat
And he drops what he's doin' and hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But he sits waiting patiently and smiles when he first sees me
Cause he's made that way

And if that's not lovin' me
Then all I've got to say

God didn't make the little green apples
It don't snow in Minneanapolis when the winter comes
There's no such thing as make-believe
Puppy dogs or autumn leaves, no B.B. guns
God didn't make the little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feeling low
I think about your face aglow and ease my mind
