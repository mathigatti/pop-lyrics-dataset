Come into the parish of wisdom 
But leave your nervous system 
With the bouncer on the door 


Sell your innocence 
For a decade of decadence 
Everything all at once all the time is yours 

Don't believe in Jesus Christ 
Since i believed in your cocaine 
All that praying and wailing will leave a stain 
So take your Sunday songs and shove it 

Hey now, my baby, maybe now we´re free 
With the appliance of science, 
We can be anyone, we want to be 

They'll come bearing you 
And charge the earth for it 
If you're lucky they'll let you breathe 

So scream as you go faster 
If that's the world you're after 
But make sure you're home for tea 

Don't believe in clever people 
Clever people drop the bomb 
Don't believe your big and evil 
They´re aliens... 
So take your rocket science and shove it 

Hey now, my baby, maybe now we´re free 
With the appliance of science, 
we can be anyone, we want to be 

Shubidu ... 

We interrupt this song for a newsflash 
Daisy, the first sheep to be cloned 
Has died today at the rivaled age of 101... days 
Other news: 
Two people burned to death whilst they were on the internet 
And now to the sport 

Hey now, my baby, maybe now we´re free 
With the appliance of science, 
we can be anyone, we want to be 

Repeat chorus
