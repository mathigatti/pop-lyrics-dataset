Have you met Miss Jones
Someone said as we shook hands
She was just Miss Jones to me 


Then I said Miss Jones
You're a girl who understands
I'm a man who must be free.

And all at once I lost my breath
And all at once was scared to death
And all at once I own the earth and sky

Now I met Miss Jones 
And well keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I

And all at once I lost my breath
And all at once was scared to death
And all at once I own the earth and sky

Now I met Miss Jones 
And well keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I
Miss Jones and I

Miss Jones and I
