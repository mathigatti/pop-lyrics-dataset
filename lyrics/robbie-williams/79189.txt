I danced with the devil, he told me a story
About all the love that he wished he could send
I said buy me a pint, it will be alright in the end He don't like to fight cos he thinks he's too pretty
He's misunderstood and he just needs a friend
I said give me a light, it will be alright in the endHe's finished with his mission
Like to square it with god if he gets permission
He sold his sole to Bill Gates
And he don't feel alright, cos the money was shite
And it's all so sadI danced with the devil, he told me a story
About all the love that he wished he could send
I said buy me a pint, it will be alright in the endHe granted me three wishes
Said I just need clean clothes and can you do the dishes
He don't get on with Judas
He's been to rehab, couldn't pay his bar tab
And it's all so sadI danced with the devil, he told me a story
About all the love that he wished he could send
I said buy me a pint, it will be alright in the end(appeared on the DVD "Where egos dare")
