Is the Richard Gere-Gerbil story true?
Who came third in World War Two?
Did Sooty sleep with Sue?
These things i think about,
When im out, 
With youWhat are the holes in biros for?
Which ones which in the Corrs?
Did Geoff Hurst really score?
Coz frankly your a bore,
And im not,And if its leaving season,
Your second on the bill,
If you wont leave me baby,
I'll find someone who will,
I tried love, im sorry,
I tried l-love,Does God ever get it wrong?
Where has Gary Barlow gone?
Why is Christmas day so long?
It just goes on and on ,
And on,
Like you,And if its leaving season,
Your second on the bill,
If you wont leave me baby,
I'll find someone who will,
I tried love, im sorry,
I tried l-love,doo doo doo doo doo do doo dooo dooI tried love, im sorry,
I tried love,Why is there ketchup on my sleeve?
D'ya think Adam fancied Eve?
What if Eve couldnt conceive,
And he had to breed with Steve,
We'd all be GAY!
