Liberate a whale
Liberate Wales
Liberate abortion
Liberate males
I don't mind
Ban the bomb
Bang a gong
Ban fake fur
Put a real one on
I don't mind


Oh my head
I'm moving to the Med
Those cats know how to boogie
This E's done nothing to me
Her retort was just a passing thought
Put the munchies down now Scooby
I'm leaving in an hour
You better do me now

Prosecute Ghandi
Persecute God
Elevate Bono
Eliminate Rod
I don't care
World War 4
The Beatles tour
And Chernobyl fallout
Global warming
I don't care

Oh my head
I'm moving to the Med
Those cats know how to boogie
This pill's done nothing to me
Her retort was just a passing thought
Put the munchies down now Scooby
I gotta catch a plane
You'd better do me now

In for me, in for me
You've all got it in for me
In for me, in for me
Don't tell me a story kid
You fucking bore me

Oh my head
I'm moving to the Med
Those cats know how to boogie
This speed's done nothing to me
Her retort was just a fleeting thought
Put the munchies down now Scooby
Going in an hour
You better do me

Oh my head
I'm gonna stay in bed
This cat don't wanna boogie
The pills just pass right through me
Her retort was just a fleeting thought
Put the Scooby snacks down, Dooby
I'm getting on a plane
You better do me now
