We're in land on fire
In the middle of the sea
When you close your eyes
Tell me what you hear
Tell me what you feel
When you cross that heart
And you hope to die
You might get your chance
It could be tonight, could be tonight


Oooooo
Can you feel it coming
Oooooo
Can you feel the calling

So put your hand in my hand
Watch them burning down this island
To see your brown eyes there
Lit by the riots that they're running from

It's just a bad day
Not a bad life
I've seen your eyes
You were bona fide
Born to fight
There'll be someone here
When they come for me
They need to cross that place
Where a heart should be,
Where a heart should be

Oooooo
Can you feel the calling
Oooooo
Can you feel the calling

May this moment of surrender
Live in your heart forever
The earth will move and shake
But they can never keep us apart
Born to the life they gave us
Of bitterness and failures
Though i may lose myself
They can never keep us apart
We're in a land on fire
In the middle of the sea
When i close my eyes
Only you, only me

Oooooo
This is our finest hour
Underneath the seats of power
The earth will break the chains
You know they'll never
Keep us apart
So put your hand in my hand
God knows, we own this island
The truth will move and shake
But they can never keep us apart
