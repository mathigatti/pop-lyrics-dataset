She's glamorous and ridiculous
Ivy league but one of us
And she made me drop the knife, the knife, the knife
I thought I'd never let it go, go, go
I'm gonna love her all my life, life, life
Till I die and she gets old, older


And boy she knows
I'm a tornado
But she won't let go
'Cause she's in every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope
Every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of
Hope brings heartache
When the lord has forsaken me
When death's in my eyes
She is every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope

I'm bueno para nada
An addict's such a hot mess
She holds me in the night, the night, the night
Never let's me go, go, go
I've loved her all my life, life, life
Even when I didn't know, know her

And boy she knows
I'm a tornado
But she won't let go
'Cause she's in every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope
Every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of
Hope brings heartache
When the lord has forsaken me
When death's in my eyes
She is every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope
Every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope

So what have we become
Now we're so ashamed of everything we've done
Raised on strange love
We were never ever good enough
From a nowhere garden
In a nowhere city
You will see our trail
From here to mars
From here to mars
Come on

But you were sent to me
Hope breaks heartache
When the lord has forsaken me
When death's in my eyes
She is every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope
