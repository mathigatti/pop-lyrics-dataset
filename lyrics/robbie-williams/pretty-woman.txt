Hey pretty woman, I wanna take you out
I know a place, we can move our feet downtown
Ease into the rhythm when I hear that sound
My momma taught me and I do not back down
Hey pretty woman, I love the way you move
Winding down low to that baseline groove
The way you're dancing got me in the mood
Daddy told me it's what grown folks do
Let me tell ya now
Hey pretty woman Imma testify
Hey pretty woman make a grown man cry


You can make me beg
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar)
Oh honey, you can take it anyway you wanna
The way you move your legs
Well, it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma?

Hey pretty woman, come and hold my hand
Dance the Charleston to that old swing band
I know that it's getting late but you don't mind
Let's take a taxi and get back to mine
Hey pretty woman, your daddy don't know
Take what you want from me, I can't say no
Just put your hands on my body, let me taste your lips
I put my hands on your body, baby, work those hips

You can make me beg
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar)
Oh honey, you can take it anyway you wanna
The way you move your legs
Well, it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma?

Hey pretty woman, na, na, na, I'm in love
You are the only one I'm thinking of
Hey pretty woman, if you feel the same
Just say "hey there, boy, bring that beat back again"

You can make me beg
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar)
Oh honey, you can take it anyway you wanna, wanna
The way you move your legs
Well, it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma?
You can make me beg
Take my last dollar, dollar (take my last dollar)
Oh honey, you can take it anyway you wanna
The way you move your legs
Well, it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma?
