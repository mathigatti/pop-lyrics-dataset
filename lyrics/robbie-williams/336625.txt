Woohoo!

Hey hey here comes noone
Another friend to have a go on
And she asks me do i miss her when shes gone
And i reply as much as i miss anyone


Oh! woohoo
And i'll be your gay friend
Cus your marriage never ends
Till we f*** and fight again
Theres a space between us
So jump into my bed
Pretend the world is dead
Always in my head is a space between us

Hey lord forgive us if we're wrong
Make sure that he never hears this song
And she says that im the opposite of a hallmark card
She asked me how im feeling
When i dont want to think that hard

Oh! woohoo!
And i'll be your gay friend
Cus your marriage never ends
Till we f*** and fight again
Theres a space between us
Jump into my bed
Pretend the world is dead
Always in my head is a space between us

It's the late show now
When does the late show end
When god is in the details
Forget to show my friend
I have a friend again
You my friend again
My gay friend

Oh! woohoo! erhh
So jump into my bed
Pretend the world is dead
Always in my head is a space between us
And i'll be your gay friend
As your marriage never ends
Till we f*** and fight again
Theres a space between us
Oh! woohoo!
