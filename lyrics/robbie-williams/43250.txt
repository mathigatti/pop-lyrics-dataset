Mack The Knife

Oh the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear,
And he shows them, pearly white,
Just a jackknife has old MacHeath, babe,
And he keeps it, out of sight,


Ya know when that shark bites with his teeth, dear,
Scarlet billows start to spread,
Fancy gloves, oh, wears old MacHeath, babe,
So there's never, never a trace of red

On the sidewalk, oh, Sundy morning, dontcha know,
Lies a body just oozin' life,
And someone's sneakin' 'round the corner,
Could that be our boy, Mack the knife?

From a tug boat, down by the river, dontcha know,
There's a cement bag just dropping on down,
That cement's there, it's there for the weight, dear,
Five'll bet ya ten old Macky's back in town

D'ja here 'bout Louie Miller, he disappeared, baby,
After drawing out all, his hard-earned cash,
And now MacHeath spends, he spends just like a, like a sailor,
Could it be, could it be, could it be, our boy's done somethingrash?

Now Jenny Diver, oh Sukey Tawdry,
Look out Miss Lotte Lenya, and ole Lucy Brown,
Yeah, the line forms on the right, babe,
Now that Macky's back in town

I said Jenny Diver, woah, oh Sukey Tawdry,
Look out Miss Lotte Lenya, and ole Lucy Brown,
Yes, the line forms on the right, babe,
Now that Macky's, back in town...

Look out, old Macky is back, WOW!!!
