[spoken]
Robbie: (american accent) Johnny and Robbie
Jonathan: Youth, why are you you talking like that,
we're from Stoke!
Robbie: I know but I can't stop here pallyLike the wallpaper sticks to the wall
Like the seashore clings to the sea
Like you'll never get rid of your shadow
No you'll never get rid of meLet all the others fight and fuss
Whatever happens, we've got us.[Me and my shadow]
We're closer than pages that stick in a book
We're closer than ripples that flow in a brook
[Strolling down the avenue]
Wherever you find him, you'll find me, just look
Closer than a miser or the bloodhounds to LizaMe and my shadow
We're closer than smog gets to all of L.A.
We're closer than Ricky to confessing he's gay
Not a soul can bust this team in two
We stick together like glueAnd when it's sleeping time
That's when we rise
We start to swing
[Ooh, you think you're so jazz you...]
Our clocks don't chime
What a surprise
They ring-a-ding-ding!
Happy New Year![Me and my shadow]
And now to repeat what I said at the start
They'll need a large crowbar to break us apart
We're alone but far from blueBefore we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll hit a few late spots, and then a few more
We'll start up at Stringy's and maybe Groucho
Life is gonna be wow-wow-whee!
For my shadow and me![spoken]
Jonathan: Can we do that again
Robbie: No, I'm too tired
Jonathan:Oh please Rob
Robbie: No, I'm swung out
Jonathan:Oh, come on I'll, I'll, I'll give you some money
Robbie: I don't need money
Jonathan: Well then a cup of tea
Robbie: Not thirsty
Jonathan: I won't tell anybody you're gay.
(Both Laugh)Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll hit all the late spots, and then a few more
We'll start out at Stringy's and maybe right shore
Life is gonna be wow-wow-whee!
For my shadow and me!
