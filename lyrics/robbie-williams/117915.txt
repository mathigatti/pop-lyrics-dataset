Everytime we say goodbye 
I die a little 
Everytime we say goodbye 
I wonder why a little 
Why the gods above me 
Who must be in the know 
Think so little of me 
They allow you to go 


When you're near 
There's such an air 
Of spring about it 
I can hear a lark somewhere 
Begin to sing about it 
There's no love song finer 
But how strange the change 
From major to minor 
Everytime we say goodbye 

There's no love song finer 
But how strange the change 
From major to minor 
Everytime we say goodbye
