Hello.
Did you miss me?
I know I'm hard to resist
Y'all can come and help me
pick the sweetcorn out of this.


It's hard to be humble
When you're so fucking big
Did you ever meet a sexier male chauvinist pig

I'm gonna milk it till I turn it into cheese
Tell your babes in arms and OAP's
Come take a piece of me

If you drop me I'll fall to pieces on you
If you don't see me
I don't exist
It's nice to meet you
Now let me go and wash my hands
Cause you just met the world's most handsome man
The world's most handsome man

Y'all know who I am
I'm still the boy next door
That's if you're Lord Litchfield and Roger Moore

If I've gone up in the world
Or is the world gone down on me
I'm the one who put the Brits in celebrity

Give in and love it
What's the point in hating me
You can't argue with popularity
Well you could
But you'd be wrong

If you drop me I'll fall to pieces on you
If you don't need me
I don't exist
You voted for me
Now let me see a show of hands
Keeping for your stands

Can you make me laugh and sign this autograph
Though it's not for me
Flip a grin, shake a thing, name a shame
Then I'm out of here
It's not very complicated
I'm just young and overrated

Please don't drop me I'll fall to pieces on you
If you don't see me
I don't exist
It's nice to meet you
Now let me go and wash my hands
Keeping for your stands

Please don't drop me I'll fall to pieces on you
If you don't need me I don't exist
It's nice to meet you
Now let me go and wash my hands
Cause you just met the world's most handsome man
The world's most handsome man
The world's most handsome man
The world's most handsome man
