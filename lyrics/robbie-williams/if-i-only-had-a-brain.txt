I could wile away the hours
Conferrin' with the flowers
Consultin' with the rain
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain


I'd unravel every riddle
For any individ'le
In trouble or in pain

With the thoughts I'd be thinkin'
I could be another lincoln
If I only had a brain

Oh, I could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things I never thunk before
And then I'd sit and think some more

I would not be just a nothin
My head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain
Perhaps I deserve you
And be even worthy erve you
If I only had a brain

I could wile away the hours
Conferrin' with the flowers
Consultin' with the rain
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only
If I only had a brain
