You say you're sick and tired
Of feeling sick and tired
I walked and told the truth
Do you wish I'd stayed alive


Cause she said that you said that I said
She said that I said the love's dead
And I tried to explain
Don't expect you to be the same

On this rockin rollercoaster, an emotional ride
We were just an average b-side
We were just an average b-side

I watched the past run by on the silver screen
We played our parts and died, scene by scene
When she said that you said that I said
She said that I said the love's dead
And I try to explain
Don't expect you to feel the same
On this rockin rollercoaster, an emotional ride
We were just an average b-side, oh b-side

Pretend you like me
Pretend I like you
Pretend pretend pretend
This is not happening

Oh rockin rollercoaster, an emotional ride
We were just an average b-side
Oh rockin rollercoaster, an emotional ride
We were just an average b-side
We were just an average b-side
We were just an average b-side
