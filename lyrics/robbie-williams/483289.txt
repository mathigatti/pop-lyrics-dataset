I'm a gigolo, I'm joseph, I'm a sad lad in song
I'm everybody that I know 
and being known for being wrong


and if I'm not mistaken
this is my heart breaking
I'm the man that threw it all away

destiny is calling, telling me to be boring 
and I don't care anyway,
gonna be nobody someday
gonna be nobody someday

I'm the demon that you fear
I'm the joker, I'm the thief
I'm the lonesome cowboy ridin'
I'm the indian chief

gotta watch my figure
boy, if I get much bigger
they'll stick a pin in me 
and I'll blow away

but I get richer
while they take my picture
taking my soul away
gonna be nobody someday
gonna be nobody someday

I'm a moonlight serenade
I'm your bed when you are cold
I'm the captain of Titanic
I'm the passenger in the hall

from the way I'm thinking
we'll both be sinking
I knew before we sailed away

hit the tip of my eagle
it's all you saw anyway
gonna be nobody someday
gonna be somebody
gonna be somebody, la la la
