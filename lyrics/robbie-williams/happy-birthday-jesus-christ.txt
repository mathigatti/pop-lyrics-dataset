I'm not religious but I'll take advice
Man, that day you gave was nice
Happy birthday, Jesus Christ
You make people here so happy
Love that thing you did with the scampi
Happy birthday, Jesus Christ


I'll break bread with you
If you really need me too
You can turn water to wine
And your actual birthday is at Christmastime

I get a feeling, deep in my soul
It's a four-letter word and it's taking me home
It goes L-O-V-E
The message is love, and you feel like Jesus to me

Everything's so overprice
Like Justin Bieber's merchandise
Happy birthday, Jesus Christ
(Happy birthday, Jesus Christ)
Healed the lame, forgave the foolish
And on your first birthday you Jewish
Happy birthday, Jesus Christ

I'll break bread with you
If you really need me too
You can turn water to wine
And your actual birthday is at Christmastime

I get a feeling, deep in my soul
It's a four-letter word and it's taking me home
It goes L-O-V-E
The message is love, and you feel like Jesus to me
The message is love, and you feel like Jesus to me
The message is love, and you feel like Jesus to me

(All I want)
Take me to church now
(All I need)
Take me to, take me to, take me to church

I get a feeling, deep in my soul
It's a four-letter word and it's taking me home
It goes L-O-V-E
The message is love, and you feel like Jesus to me
The message is love, and you feel like Jesus to me
The message is love, and you feel like Jesus to me
