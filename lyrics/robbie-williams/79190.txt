I always have an alibi 
And you allow me there 
But tonight I have no concience 
So what comes after that You're coming down already 
This howl wants see us through 
Nothing I can change now 
I've learnt to lie to you What happened to me 
What happened to you 
You were putting me on 
I was leading you through 
Lie to me I always have a vision 
That love would see us through 
What's the point of wishing 
When my dreams depend on you Gonna needs a porter 
Your friends can get around 
And you can tell the story 
On how I let you down(B-Side of the single "No regrets")
