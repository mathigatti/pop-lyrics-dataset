Come Take Me Over

Is this a long range effort, cause I'll pitch a tent
I'm kinda used to feeling cold
Should I walk naked should I bear my sould
Won't you help me fill this hole


And what I'm trying to say is be the one
Love me anyway...though I'm too far gone

Come take me over - I'm riddled with my past
Come take me over - is that too much to ask
Before I leave this town - love me or put me down

Got semi heaven, I wanna fall in love
You said the walking wounded could
I know I've sent the 'morrows to an early grave
Is this the price I have to pay.

What I'm try'na say, if you could touch
The love I fantasize, is that too much

Come take me over - I'm riddled with my past
Come take me over - Is that too much to ask?
Before I leave this twon - love me

Take me to the shops, tie me up and abuse me
I'm looking good, so how could you refuse me
Say I'm so special, why ain't you cooking for two?

I'll meet your mum, I'll meet your friends
When you coming down,
I'll love you through the bends
I know I'm special, but why ain't you cooking for two?

Is this a long range effort, cause I'll pitch a tent
I'm kinda used to feeling cold
Should I walk naked, should I bare my soul
Won't you help me fill this hole

Guess what I'm trying to say, is be the one
Love me anyway...though I'm too far gone

Come take me over - I'm riddled with my past
Come take me over - Is that too much to ask?
Before I leave this town - love me

Take me to the shops, lock me up and abuse me
I know I'm looking good,
so how could you refuse me?
Say I'm so special, then why ain't you cooking for two?

I'll meet your mum, I'll meet your friends
When you coming down,
I'll take you through the bends
I know I'm so good, then why ain't you cooking?

[PIANO SOLO]

I guess what I'm try'na say,
is what I've never known
Can't use it anyway, just give me love

Come take me over - Gonna be the last
Come take me over - If she don't meet this task
Before I leave this town -
Love me or put me down
