One eye on the shadows protecting his fellows 
From sun up to the moon on his back 
Sent the villains to Hades 
A hit with the ladies 
A stallion in the sack 
You can't get your life back 
When right follows left Jack 
The more you see the less you know 
When others would leak it 
His service is secret 
Plays God when it's your time to go 


Queen and country safe and sound 
With villians six feet underground 
And no one knows cause no one's found 
Any trace of a man for all seasons 
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone 
And you and I wouldn't have a clue 
Who's doing what, why, when and who, 
Up the creek with no canoe, 
Watch out for the man for all seasons 
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone 
But safe at home 

From the House of Lords 
Saving Norfolk Broads 
Commoners and landed gentry 
His word his bond 
Whether brunette or blonde 
Baby it's so elementary 
For the man never messed up your life with one stare 
See the film you'll know how it goes 
But this ain't no fiction 
Just check the diction quid pro quo a proÂ´s pro 
Fellas 
Don't be jealous 
When they made him they broke the mould 
So charismatic, 
Willing, automatic 
Never prematurely shooting his load 

Queen and country safe and sound 
With villians six feet underground 
And no one knows cause no one's found 
Any trace of a man for all seasons 
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone 
And you and I wouldn't have a clue 
Who's doing what, why, when and who, 
Up the creek with no canoe, 
Watch out for the man for all seasons 
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone 
But safe at home
