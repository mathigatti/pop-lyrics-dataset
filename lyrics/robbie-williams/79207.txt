Always and forever is forever young
Your shadow on the pavement
The dark side of the sun
Gotta dream the dream all over
And sleep here tight
You don't wanna sing the blues
In black and whiteAnd it's hope that spring's eternal for everyone
If it ain't broken break it or the damage doneTrying to love somebody
Just wanna love somebody right now
There's just no pleasing me
Trying to love somebody 
Just want to love somebody right now
Baby lay your love on meViolet in the rainbow just melt away
There's not enough minutes in the hour
Or hours in the day
The song played in a circle that never skips a beat
The stranger in a country that I have yet to meetAnd it's hope that springs eternal for everyone
Got a lifetime in a second oh the damage doneTrying to love somebody
Just wanna love somebody right now
Guess there's just no pleasing me
I want to love somebody
Just want to love somebody right now
Baby lay your love on meIt'll come in your sweet time, Lord
I just gotta let you in
The blind leading the blind, Lord
Getting underneath your skin
I can feel you in the silence
Saying let forever be
Love, only love, will set you freeI wanna love somebody
Wanna love somebody right now
There's just no pleasing me
I wanna love somebody
Just wanna love somebody right now
Lay lay, lay your love on meIt'll come in your sweet time, Lord
I just gotta let you in
The blind leading the blind, Lord
Getting underneath your skin
I can feel you in the silence
Saying let forever be
Love, only love, will set you free
