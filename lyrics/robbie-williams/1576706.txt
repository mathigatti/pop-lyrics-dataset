In this bag of stuff I brought to you,
you didn't mind sorting it through.
You would never be the trouble and strife,
if i made you my swiss army wife.
I could give this up,
I could walk away.
It doesn't fill me up, it didn't anyway


I won't do that to you, won't
do that to you
do that to you, won't
do that to you

I don't mind when the boys look at you,
if I was them, I'd be doing it too.
I mean more to you than handbag and shoes,
I'm so sorry, there's been a few.
I don't trust to much
I don't love and love
but I'm giving up,
All is given up.

I won't do that to you.
Won't do that to you,
do that to you won't
do that to you.

Suddenly im not the jealous guy,
another sign that we're doing it right.
I could give this up, i could walk away,
cause you fill me up.
Each and every day.
I promise that

I won't do that to you.
Won't do that to you,
do that to you won't
do that to you.
Won't do that to you,
won't do that to you,
do that to you won't
do that to you.
do that to you, won't
do that to you.
