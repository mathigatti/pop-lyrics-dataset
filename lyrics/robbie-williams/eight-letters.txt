We became the parade
On the streets that
We once cleaned
Expendable soldiers
Smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling
Our lives would have meaning
Eventually


We were once the answer,
And then you discover
You're actually just one thing
After another
And what was the question
And why was the lesson
So deafening

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened
Anyhow
You can look back
But don't stare
Maybe i can love you
Out of there

And when i went away
What i forgot to say
Was all i had to say
Eight letters, three words
One meaning

And outside forces didn't
Make it easy
So i thought i'd go
Before you leave me
Self reservation
Was no explanation
For anything
But the truth is more than
We'll ever comprehend
I'm just starting to
Understand my friend
All of that distance
Cause i fell in love
With the enemy

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened
Anyhow
You can look back
But don't stare
Maybe i can love you
Out of there

And when i went away
What i forgot to say
Was all i had to say
Eight letters, three words
One meaning
And when i went away
What i forgot to say
Was all i had to say
Eight letters, three words
One meaning

At last
We meet on no man's land
Footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land
At last

And when i went away
What i forgot to say
Was all i had to say
Eight letters, three words
One meaning

And when i went away
What i forgot to say
Was all i had to say
Eight letters, three words
One meaning,
One meaning
Just one meaning.
