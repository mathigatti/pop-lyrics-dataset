Spoken: 
I'm the sum total of my ancestors 
I carry their DNA 
We are representatives of a long line of people 
And we carried them around either with 
This long line of people 
That goes back to the beginning of time 
And when we meet - they meet other lines of people 
And we say bring together the lines of me 
When I look back over the years 
At the things that brought tears to my eyes 
Papa said we have to be wise 
To live long lives 
Now I recognize 
What my father said before he dies 
Vocalize things I've left unsaid 
Left my spirit unfed for too long 
I'm coming home to my family 
Where I can be strong 
Be who I planned to be 
Within me my ancestory 
Givin'me continuity 
Would it be remiss to continue in this way 
Would you rather I quit 
Come with the other shit 
Making people's hips sway 
Lip service I pay but I´m nervous 
I pray for all the mothers who get no sleep 
Like a lifeline I light lines cause my compassion is deep 
For the people who fashioned me my soul to keep 
And this is who I happen to be 
And if I don't see that I'm strong than I won't be 
This is what my Daddy told me 
I wished he would hold me 
A little more 
Than he did 
But he taught me my culture 
And how to live positive 
I never wanna shame 
The blood in my veins and bring pain 
to my sweet grandfathers face 
In his resting place 
I made haste to learn and not waste 
everything my forefathers earned in tears 
For my culture 
Chorus: 
Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
(For my culture) 
Water to air 
You're on your feet again 
Your feet again. 
Hello Dad, 
Remember me? 
I'm the man you thought I'd never be. 
I'm the boy who you 
Reduced to tears 
Dad, I'd been lonely for 27 years 
Yeah, that´s right 
My name´s Bob 
I'm the one 
Who landed the popstar's job 
I'm the one who 
You told look, don´t touch 
I'm the kid 
Who wouldn´t amount to much. 
I believe in the senses sight and sound 
I have always been too loud 
Won't you help me drown it out? 
I'm what I feel 
What I´m feeling is surreal 
I'm a mass of spinnin' wheels 
Always digging in my heels 
Now I got the faith to 
Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
Water to air 
You're on your feet again 
Your feet again. 
Lace up your boots we're going back to the roots 
Speaking to my ghetto youths freak freaking for loot 
And nice things, better check what your future brings 
It's now and your forefathers for the know how 
Go now into the world without hatred 
Use your head 
If the needle is wise be the thread 
And weave ancestral wisdom, yours by birth 
Spreading the Lords word over this broad earth 
This is what my Daddy told me 
I wished he would hold me 
A little more 
than he did 
But he told me my culture 
And how to live positive 
I never wanna shame 
The blood in my veins and bring pain 
To my sweet grandfathers face 
in his resting place 
I make haste to learn and not waste 
everything my forefathers earned in tears 
For my culture 
Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
Water to air 
You're on your feet again 
Your feet again 
(For my culture) 
Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
Water to air 
Your on your feet again 
Your feet again 
(For my culture)
