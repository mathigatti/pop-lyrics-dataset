We're the love brigade
That sings serenades
Flying in G6 jets
Over woodland glades
These are canap√©s and not hand grenades
And that's the choice we made


Go USA
Or Taliban chic
If you got massive hands
Or tiny feet
Life hands you lemons then sell lemonade
It's the choice we made

So
I'm gonna sell a soda pop
I wanna sell soda pop
I'm gonna sell soda pop
I wanna sell soda pop
Soda!
yoda!
Bop shoo wop

We like the birds
We go likely lads
I go on strike
We're not scab scab scabs
The love we lost when no one stayed
It's the choice we made

They wanna know
About the clothes we wear
If we swing both ways
But who stays there
As long as we get paid we don't care
The choice is theirs

So
I'm gonna sell a soda pop
I wanna sell soda pop
I'm gonna sell soda pop
I wanna sell soda pop
Soda!
yoda!
Bop shoo wop

Come enjoy the madness
How you dance through the fire is all
That matters now
How can you resist us?
We are the business

So
I'm gonna sell a soda pop
I wanna sell soda pop
I'm gonna sell soda pop
I wanna sell soda pop
Soda!
yoda!
Bop shoo wop

Come enjoy the madness
How you dance through the fire is all
That matters now
How can you resist us?
We are the business
So, so, so, so!
