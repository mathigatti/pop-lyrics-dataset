There may be trouble ahead
But while there's music and moonlight and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance


Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill and while we still have the chance
Let's face the music and dance
Soon we'll be without the Moon, humming a different tune and then

There may be teardrops to shed
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance
