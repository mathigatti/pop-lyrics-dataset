Sun is shining
So am why am i feeling the cold?
Bah-um
Bah-um
Not surprising
Something has fallen from the fold
Bah-um
Bah-um
Bah-um

Lonestar rising
God only knows where i'll go
Bah-um
Bah-um
Oh what timing (?)
And how blue is the tone
Bah-um
Bah-um

Seems like i was always drunk
I lost myself in someones song
And when all is said and done
I only wanna feel the sun
Bah-um

Every others' passed to remind of the time
All the lovers
Living in limbo divine
Bah-um
Bah-um
Bah-um
Every reason
Has every reason to go
Bah-um
All the seasons melt into one like the snow
Bah-um
Bah-um

Seems like i was always drunk
I lost myself in someone's song
And when all is said and done
I only wanna feel the sun
Bah-um

No sensation
Not even tears rolling down
Bah-um
Conversation
Echoes like ghosts on the town
Bah-um
Bah-um
Lonestar rising
Bah-um
God only knows where i'll go
Oh what timing (?)
and how blue is the tone
Bah-um
Bah-um

Seems like i was always drunk
I lost myself in someones song
And when all is said and done
I only wanna feel the sun
Bah-um
Bah-um
