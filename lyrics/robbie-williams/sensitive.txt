Let's get it on, and on, and on, and on
Girl, I don't know why you're not H-A-P-P-Y
So you wanna find a real man
Make him fall in love
No matter how thick your skin is
Never think enough
Someone that you can lean on
When times are tough
Living is a reason


Girl, I don't know why you get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
When I touch
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
And you love it, yeah
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
Some never wanna
Girl, I don't know why you're not H-A-P-P-Y
