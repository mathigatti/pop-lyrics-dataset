In my young life I have received 
Callers as though they were Christmas Eve 
Disappointed and I don't know why? 
She gave me laughter and hope 
And a sock in the eye. 


(A love like this is sealed with a kiss)
In my young life and I know something now. 
I've never tried to create a wow 
Wows are few frustration more common 
Now I can feel it in my soul 
That's why I gave the come on... 
Kiss me with your mouth 
Your love is better than wine 
But wine is all I have 
Will your love ever be mine? 
Faces fall before my feet 
Like blood onto a clean white sheet 
When I grow old I won't forget 
To innocence my only debt. 
Wow I feel so fresh today 
Barefoot in the snow to make love in the hay 
The stars are bright in the abyss 
Now I can feel you in my arms 
I explode inside your kiss. 

Kiss me with your mouth 
Your love is better than wine 
But wine is all I have 
Will your love ever be mine? 

Kiss me with your mouth 
Your love is better than wine 
But wine is all I have 
Will your love ever be mine?
