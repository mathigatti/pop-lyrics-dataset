Oh it seemed forever stopped today
All the lonely hearts in London
Caught a plane and flew away
The best women are married
The handsome men are gay
You feel deprived


Yeah are you questioning your size?
Is there a tumour in your humour
Are there bags under your eyes?
Do you leave dents where you sit
Are you getting on a bit?
Will you survive
You must survive

When there's no love in town
This new century is bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme

Oh what are you really looking for?
Another partner in your life to abuse and to adore?
Is it lovey dovey stuff
Do you need a bit of rough?
Get on your knees

Yeah turn down the love songs that you hear
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment
That echoes in your ear
Saying love will stop the pain
Saying love will kill the fear
Do you believe
You must believe

When there's no love in town
This new century is bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme

When there's no love in town
This new century is bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme, a love supreme
A love supreme

A love supreme
