Stand your ground
You're big enough
Stand your ground
You know too much
Today drifts into tomorrow
And you can almost taste the sorrow
Stand your ground
You've had enough
Lost and found
Diamond in the rough
Today drifts into tomorrow
You feel your soul's been borrowed
Oooh, oooh...Stand your ground
The water's deep
Feel the sand beneath your feet
I know your prayers seem hollow
But when it's hard they follow
Ooh, ooh...
