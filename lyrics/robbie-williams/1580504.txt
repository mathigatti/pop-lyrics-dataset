Where the future rests in the bistro
where the music is for weirdos,
We like it different
we like it strange
in our own way
we haven't changed


I got my eyes made up
at the bus stop
by my girlfriend
and you know what,
She likes me different
she likes me strange
in her own way
she's just the same

Chorus
Psycho evolution
your pollution
makes it difficult for weirdos,
Just another humanoid reaction
to the voices in this town

Every Saturday at the plaza
guess the gender
unless you'd rather,
He is a lesbian
but that's ok
she is the center of attention for another day
In the universe
we are magenta
you can join us if you enter,
Because you're different
and you are strange
in your own way you're just the same

Chorus
Psycho evolution
your pollution
makes it difficult for weirdos,
Just another humanoid reaction
to the voices in this town

Time
isn't lost where devotion is
I never wasted a life,
Space is the place
where the social is
far from the safe and the norm

In the off stream
they call it cavarade
but they'll say that won't they,
I want it different
I like it strange
in my own way I haven't changed

It's insulting
to be mislead
by the hairdo of a god head
They show reverence
but that's ok
we are the center of the universe anyway

Psycho evolution
your pollution
makes it difficult for weirdos,
Just another humanoid reaction
to the voices in this town

Psycho evolution
your pollution
makes it difficult for weirdos,
Just another humanoid reaction
to the voices in this town
