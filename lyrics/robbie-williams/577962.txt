Like to reminisce about a time I've never had
A book that no one read
A film that never made me sad
And you remind of a place I've never been
And something no one said
When I was 17


One fine day
In the middle of the night
You'll wake up in it
One fine day
In the middle of the night
But you probably won't admit it

Remember when we never struggled through
A bad time we never had
A love we never fell into
Please don't remind me to forget
'Cause forgiveness is a place
I ain't got used to yet

One fine day
In the middle of the night
You'll wake up in it
One fine day
In the middle of the night
But you probably won't admit it

All I ever wanted
Was to radiate your home
But I guess it doesn't matter

So come reminisce about a time we didn't have
I hear there's a sequel to that film that never made you sad
Don't rewrite my history
Cause you'll never really know
How much you didn't mean to me

One fine day
In the middle of the night
You'll wake up in it
One fine day
In the middle of the night
But you probably won't admit it

One fine day
In the middle of the night
You'll wake up in it
One fine day
In the middle of the night
But you probably won't admit it
But you probably won't admit it
