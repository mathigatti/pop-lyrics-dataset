"Everyone suggesting, inferring, in bold type
The idiots and actually the minority
That I'm wasted, that I'm strung out
Well, they all should be wondering why the hell I'm not!"


[Robbie Williams]
I'm gonna speak my truth, I think I'm losing it
Feel kinda liberated just a little bit
And I'm a Big Mac short of a Happy Meal
Not sure what to say or how to feel

[Rufus Wainwright]
Checking into Hotel Crazy
Leaving all my bags in the lobby
The velvet stairs don't make a sound
As we're hitting up to a higher ground
Holding on to something that's gone in the wind
Holding on to something that's gone in the wind

[Robbie Williams]
I've got the right to vote and I can reproduce
And I can tell a lie just like I tell the truth
I have crazy thoughts, I do crazy deeds
I have special times for my special needs
I present myself as a normal dude
Look you in the eye when I talk to you
Just a touch of the old socio
Is it empathy? I guess I'll never know

[Interlude]
It's sensational, I really only care about me
Is this the end of the road? I want a new road
And the only thing that they should be checking out is my ass

[Rufus Wainwright]
Checking into Hotel Crazy
Leaving all my bags in the lobby
The velvet stairs don't make a sound
As we're hitting up to a higher ground

[Rufus Wainwright]
Checking into Hotel Crazy
Do disturb me
Gonna make you mad
Gonna make you sad
Gonna make you all of it here

[Rufus Wainwright]
Holding on to something that's gone in the wind
Holding on to something that's gone in the wind
Holding on to something that's gone in the wind
Holding on to something that's gone in the wind

[Robbie Williams]
I think I can do it
I think I can do it
I think I can do it
I think I can do this

I think I can do it
I think I can do it
I think I can do this
