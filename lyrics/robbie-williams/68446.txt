Come join the band
Come shag the damned
God I blow them away
A heart of chrome
A broken home
I got plenty to say



Who are you doing?
Don't spoil my day
A bigger better offer baby
He's on his way
You gotta love LA


I feel gigantic
Gonna burst a vein
I'm stopping traffic
'Cause they dig the fame
And I'm just the same


So Ebay baby
Haven't seen you lately
Do you still give it away
So get my peeps
To call your peeps
'Cause we've got nothing to say


Don't feed the models
Don't look at police
Don't go to Crenshaw boule
'Cause whitey can get fleeced
God I love LA


I feel gigantic
Gonna burst a vein 
I'm stopping traffic
'Cause I dig the fame 
I'm hearing voices, voices 
Like a jumbo jay 
Too many choices, choices
Gotta love LA
Californi-a .. USA baby 

Who you doing baby?
Don't spoil my day
You've been gloating lately baby
And I dig LA
I'd have to say


I feel gigantic
Gonna burst a vein
I'm stopping traffic 
I kinda dig the fame
I'm hearing voices voices
I've gotta jumbo jay
Too many choices, choices
Gotta love LA
Californi-a
USA 
USA
USA
