Please don't think of me
If you do you gotta block it
I got chills tonight
And you can't be here to stop it
I'm not a parasite
It's just a lonely night
Tonight


I walked from the bar
Cause they were only laughing
I wished on our star
But they covered it in satin
I'm not a gigolo
That's what I want you to know
Tonight

Ooh ooh
I've hurt you I can see
Ooh ooh
Do you think it's not hurting me

Ooh ooh
The grass ain't always green
And if it's hurting you
You know that it's hurting me
You know that it's hurting me

You'll meet other men
Who will break your heart
If I see you with them
It will tear me apart

Maybe in another life
We wouldn't be alone
Tonight

Ooh ooh
I've hurt you I can see
Ooh ooh
Do you think it's not hurting me

Ooh ooh
The grass ain't always green
And if it's hurting you
You know that it's hurting me
You know that it's hurting me
You know that it's hurting me
You know that it's hurting me
