["Hey Robbie are you ready for this?"
"I'm always ready Tom, you know that"
"Yeah, you were born ready" Ha ha] 
Well come on! Hit me! 
[Tom:] I was born long ago I'm the chosen I'm the one 
[Robbie:] I have come to save the day 
And I won't leave until I'm done 
And that is why we've got to try 
You got to breathe and have some fun 
Though I'm not paid I play this game 
And I won't stop until I'm done 
But what I really want to know is 
Are you gonna go my way ? 
And I got to got to know I don't know why we always cry
We must leave and get undone 
We have to change and rearrange 
And turn this planet back to one 
So tell me why we got to die 
And kill each other one by one 
We've got to love and rub-a-dub 
We've got to dance and fall in love 
But what I really want to know is 
Are you gonna go my way ? 
And I got to got to know 
["Is that you telling it like it is?" 
"Yeah, exactly!"] Yeah! Yeah! ["Play your guitar son!" 
Come on!] Woh! Yeah! What I really want to know 
is Are you gonna go my way ? 
Well I got to got to know I got to know
