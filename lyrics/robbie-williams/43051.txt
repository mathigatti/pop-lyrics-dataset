You said I was Nothern scum
I was wounded baby
That's fighting talk where I'm from
And I'm not moving baby
Spent my life dancing with shadows in strobe lights
It's allright, everything mellows in sunlight


And now London's got its gimmicks
And New York's had its minute
But Knutsford City Limits
I'll never change

I've been running nearly all my life
It left me broken baby
When the meter ran out on life
I used my tokens lady
Spent my life dancing with shadows in strobe lights
It's allright, everything mellows in sunlight

And now London's got its gimmicks
And New York's had its minute
But Knutsford City Limits
I'll never change

London's got its gimmicks
And New York's had its minute
But Knutsford City Limits
I'll never change

I've been running nearly all my life
It left me broken baby
When the meter ran out on life
I used my tokens lady
You said I was Nothern scum
I was wounded baby
That's fighting talk where I'm from
And I'm not moving baby

London's got its gimmicks
And New York's had its minute
But Knutsford City Limits
I'll never change

Saw one transmission
On the television
Saying I can't do my job
Well I just kept dancing
Don't hate me 'cause I'm handsome
And the beat will never stop

Repeat...
