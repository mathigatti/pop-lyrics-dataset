Picking up the story 
from where I left off 
It's 1990 now 
So school can fu.ck off 
I got no GCSEs, 
nothing higher than a 'D' 
I couldn't tell me Mum 
because she'd batter me 


Me and Tate sat on the bowling green 
Life was a sh.itter 
We had five quid between us 
And bought us six cans of bitter 
I took me ten Benson home 
And I smoked through the sorrow 
If I could just avoid me Mum 
Maybe I'd tell her tomorrow 

I stumbled through the door 
I said Mum it's like this 
She said "That man's been on the phone 
And you've made the list 
You're in that boy band son 
Come and giz' us a kiss" 

Phoned up Martin and Rich 
And carried on getting pissed 
Boys I don't believe it 
I'm gonna be famous 
Pick you up in a Porsche 
and buy you lots of trainers 
I met the other guys 
one seemed like a cock 
I think it's going to be like New Kids On The Block 

I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy 
(I only wanted to get down) 
I hate those that hate me 
I can't forgive and it's crazy 
Baby 

Now I'm a video star 
(I'm making trouble in this town) 
Do you know who you are? 
(For the five of us) 
Baby 

I adopted four brothers, 
Some I liked more than others 
One was like a brother from another mother 
But the lead singer made it hard to like him 
And I still loved him 
despite him 
The first three months 
you know I nearly quit 
I played snooker with my Dad 
he said "Don't be a dick 
Unload the bullets 
you're mind is a gun 
You're gonna shoot yourself when they're number one" 

I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy 
(I only wanted to get down) 
I hate those that hate me 
I can't forgive and it's crazy 
Baby 

Now I'm a video star 
(I'm making trouble in this town) 
Do you know who you are 
(For the five of us) 
Baby 

Now it's dinner with Versace 
And lunch with Princess Diana 
And I'm gonna get belted if I go out of my manor 
Cause as much as we were loved 
We were also hated 
The boys got jealous 
Cause the girls got plated 

And now we're famous and that 
and we're dancing and that 
And I'm thinking I can sing 
why am I stood at the back 
So fu.ck the band 
give me Sambuka and gak 

Now we're all a bag of nerves 
Were not a band of brothers 


I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy 
(I only wanted to get down) 
I hate those that hate me 
I can't forgive and it's crazy 
Baby 

Now I'm a video star 
(I'm making trouble in this town) 
Do you know who you are? 
(For the five of us) 
Baby 

And now it's breaking my heart 
because the dream's turned to sh.it 
It ain't broke but I'll break it in a little bit 
And I'm always in trouble 
but I've stopped saying sorry 
Everybody's worried 
What the fu.ck's wrong with Robbie 
He's not answering his phone 
He's not talking to me 
I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury 

And now I'm running away 
from everything that I've been 
And I'm pissed and I'm fu.cked 
and I'm only nineteen 
I can't conform no more 
I can't perform no more 


But the boys know I'm fu.cked 
and so they show me the door 
And if the truth be told 
I wasn't fit enough to stay 
So I put my head down 
and walked away 

That was the 90's 
90 to 95 

I can't be bothered 'cause I'm lazy 
(I only wanted to get down) 
I hate those that hate me 
I can't forgive and it's crazy 
Baby 

Now I'm a video star 
(I'm making trouble in this town) 
Do you know who you are 
(For the five of us) 
Baby
