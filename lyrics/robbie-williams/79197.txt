Queen Bitch eat the rich
I'm on the second course today
I'm not the first and I won't be the worst
She's done most of L.A.
Can't find a virgin, I can get you a surgeon
24 Hours a day.
Collagen Jeanie you big lip meanie
I'm about to be blown away
Come on sing itTake me to the place where the sunshine flows
Oh my Sunset RodeoHot Fudge, here comes the judge
Theres a green card in the way
The Holy Ghost and the whole East Coast
Are moving to L.A.
Coz we've been dreaming of this feeling since 1988
Mother, things have got to change, 
I'm moving to L.A.Take the piss always English
God Bless you Uncle Sam
You got a cool gene pool and our winter is cruel
And God knows I love to tan
Making cents and dead Presidents
Before I could count to ten
With a nation behind me can't stop the limey
She's on her back again
Come on sing itTake me to the place where the sunshine flows
Oh my Sunset RodeoHot Fudge, here comes the judge
Theres a green card in the way
The Holy Ghost and the whole East Coast
Are moving to L.A.
Coz we've been dreaming of this feeling since 1988
Mother, things have got to change, 
I'm moving to L.A.L.A. L.A. L.A.
L.A. L.A. L.A.
L.A. L.A. L.A.Take me to the place where the sunshine flows
Oh my Sunset RodeoHot Fudge, here comes the judge
Theres a green card in the way
The Holy Ghost and the whole East Coast
Are moving to L.A.
Coz we've been dreaming of this feeling since 1988
Mother, things have got to change, 
I'm moving to Hot Fudge, here comes the judge
Theres a green card in the way
The Holy Ghost and the whole East Coast
Are moving to L.A.
Coz we've been dreaming of this feeling since 1988
Mother, things have got to change, 
I'm moving to L.A.Moving to L.A.
