KEEP ON
Hotel motel Holiday Inn
Hotel motel Holiday Inn
Hotel motel
Vein popping
Heart clogging
Name dropping
Life stopping
Got no strings
But I think with my dingalingaling
Can't sing can't speak ting tong's tong ting
I'm popping
And I'm locking
Pulse stopping
Hypnotic
Got no strings
But I think with my dingalingaling
Wing chang with the ching ching ting tong's tong ting
(I love my Mum and I love my Dad
They never had any love I've had
So much love it's driving me mad)
Blood clotter
Slender tone
Say très bon
Dingadingdongadongadong
Sound of the town
Gets a little louder
He saw and I saw in my soul mine
If you're in the club and you hear this sound
Come on everybody boogie down boogie down
Running in the fast lane
Speeding in the dark
Trying to maintain
The feeling in your heart
No leaving
Shallow breathing
Girl weeping
Teef teathing
Got no strings but I think with my dingaling
Wu tang with the bling bling
Sing a song sing sing
Naughty things
We're geezing
Day creeping
Got not strings but I think with my dingaling
Wu tang with the bling bling
I spin with a tin tin gin grin
(I love my Mum and I love my Dad
They never have any love I've had
So much love it's driving me mad)
Blood clotter
Slender tone
Say très bon
Like a dingadingdongadongadong
Sound of the town
Gets a little louder
He saw and I saw in my soul mine
If you're in this club and you hear this sound
Come on everybody boogie down boogie down
Running in the fast lane
Speeding in the dark
Trying to maintain
No feeling in your heart
Running in the fast lane
Speeding in the dark
Trying to maintain
The feeling in your heart
Hotel motel Holiday Inn
Hotel motel Holiday Inn
Hotel motel
Croups crouping
Roots rooting
Ludes looting
Loops hooping
Got no strings but I think with my dingalingaling
Two two for the two ting tong ting two stonking
Two's two
Looks luking
Fruits fruiting
Sleuths sleuthing
Got no strings I think with my dingalingaling
Root root for the rooting
Toot toot for the tooting
(I love my Mum and I love my Dad
They never have any love I've had
So much love it's driving me mad)
Blood clotter
Slender tone
Say très bon
Like a dingadingdongadongadong
Sound of the town
Gets a little louder
He saw and I saw my saw mine
If you're in this club and you hear this sound
Come on everybody boogie down boogie down
Running in the fast lane
Speeding in the dark
Trying to maintain
No feeling in your heart
Running in the fast lane
Speeding in the dark
Trying to maintain
No feeling in your heart
