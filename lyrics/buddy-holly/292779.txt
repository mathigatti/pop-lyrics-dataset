Blue days - black nights
Blue tears keep on fallin' - for you dear
Now you're gone
Blue days - black nights
My heart keeps on calling for you dear
And you alone


Memories of you make me sorry
I gave you reason to doubt me
But now you're gone and I am left here all alone
With blue memories - I think of you

Blue days - black nights
I didn't realize I would miss you
The way I do
And now somehow I know I will pay
For the times I have made you blue
