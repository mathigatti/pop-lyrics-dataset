Lonesome tears, sad and blue
I shed lonesome tears for you
Guess you know I know why
I cried when you said, "Goodbye"


When you left and you said, "I'm gone"
Lonesome tears fell all night long
Yes, you know I know why
I cried when you said, "Goodbye"

You left me here all alone
Hear me talkin', won't you come back home?
Love me like you did before
Now need I tell you more?

Lonesome tears, sad and blue
I shed lonesome tears for you
Guess you know I know why
I cried when you said, "Goodbye"

You left me here all alone
Hear me talkin', won't you come back home?
Love me like you did before
Now need I tell you more?

Lonesome tears, sad and blue
I shed lonesome tears for you
Guess you know I know why
I cried when you said, "Goodbye"
