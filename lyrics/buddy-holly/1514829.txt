Deborah, oh oh you so fine
There's only one girl
In my dreams
Wonder of my mind


Truly dear
I do love you
Deborah, don't make me blue

Other on
The whole life thro'
Deborah, I dream of you.

Deborah, oh oh you so fine
There's only one girl
In my dreams
Wonder of my mind

I adore you,
Can you see.
Deborah, I want to be.

By your side
For night and day.
Deborah, don't go away.

Deborah, oh oh you so fine
There's only one girl
In my dreams
Wonder of my mind

Wonder of my mind (2x)
