'Cause I'm a-gonna love you too

You're gonna tell me sweet things
You're gonna make my heart sing
Yes, you're gonna hear those bells ring
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

After all another fella took you
But I still can't overlook ya
I'm a-gonna do my best to hook ya
Afetr all is said and done

You're gonna say you'll a miss me
You're gonna say you'll a kiss me
You're gonna say you'll a love me
'Cause I'm a-gonna love you too
