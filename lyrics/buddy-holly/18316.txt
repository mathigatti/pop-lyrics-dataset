Wake up, a-little Suzy.
Wake up.
Wake up, a-little Suzy.
Wake up.


We've both been sound alseep.
Wake up, a-little Suzy, and weep.
The movie's over. It's four o'clock
And we're in trouble, deep.

Wake up, a-little Suzy.
Wake up, a-little Suzy.

Well, what're we gonna tell your mama?
What're we gonna tell your pop?
What're we gonna tell our friends
When they say, "Ooh-la-la."

Wake up, a-little Suzy.
Wake up, a-little Suzy.

Well, we told you're mama that we'd be in by ten.
Well, Suzy, baby, looks like we goofed again.

Wake up, a-little Suzy.
Wake up, a-little Suzy.
We gotta go home.

Wake up, a-little Suzy.
Wake up.
Wake up, a-little Suzy.
Wake up.

The movie wasn't so hot.
It didn't have much of a plot.
We fell asleep. Our goose is cooked.
Our reputation is shot.

Wake up, a-little Suzy.
Wake up, a-little Suzy.

Well, what're we gonna tell your mama?
What're we gonna tell your pop?
What're we gonna tell our friends
When they say, "Ooh-la-la."

Wake up, a-little Suzy.
Wake up, a-little Suzy.
Wake up, a-little Suzy.
