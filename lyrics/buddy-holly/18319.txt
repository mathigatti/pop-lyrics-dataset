Just you know why
Why you and I
Will bye and bye
Know true love ways


Sometimes we'll sigh
Sometimes we'll cry
And we'll know why just you and I know true love ways

Throughout the days our true love ways
Will bring us joys to share with those who really care

Sometimes we'll sigh
Sometimes we'll cry
And we'll know why just you and I know true love ways

Throughout the days our true love ways
Will bring us joys to share with those who really care

Sometimes we'll sigh
Sometimes we'll cry
And we'll know why just you and I know true love ways
