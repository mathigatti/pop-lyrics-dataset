I thought that I could forget 
even tried to tell myself we'd never met 
though you try - you can't deny 
the beating of your heart 
though you try - you can't deny 
a true love when it starts 
I guess that I was just a fool 


I guess I'll go on loving you 
even though I know our love will never do 
well, though you try - you can't deny 
the beating of your heart 
though you try - you can't deny 
a true love when it starts 
I guess that I was just a fool
