Put your arms around me now 
and try your best to squeeze me 
love me baby - you know how 
yes, a-rock me my baby 


Well, rock a-like a hockory-dock, dickory-dock 
rock-a-bye my baby 
up and down - around the clock 
well, a-rock me my baby 

Plant your kisses on my lips 
and make me bubble brightly 
thrill me to my fingertips 
well, a-rock me my baby 

Tell me that you love me too 
and say you'll never me 
no one loves you like I do 
so rock me my baby
