Well, rock a-baby rock rock rock 
I just love the way you dance 
rock a-baby rock rock rock 
don't tell me that you can't 
rock rock rock 
we're gonna rock the whole night long 


Well, you dance in here - you dance out there 
you powder your face and you comb your hair 
Oh rock - oh rock - oh rock - we gonna rock 
gonna rock the whole night long 

Well, hit high on the floor - and hold my hand so tight 
I love you more and more - when you dance with all your might 
ah rock rock rock - gonna rock the whole night long 

Put on your shoes and hit the floor 
I'm telling you again like I told you before 
oh rock - oh rock - oh rock - yes rock 
oh rock - yes rock - gonna rock the whole night long
