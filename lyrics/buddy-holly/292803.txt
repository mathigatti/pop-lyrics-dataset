Love - love is strange
Lot of people take it for a game


Once you get it - you're in an awful fix
After you've had it - you never want to quit

Many people don't understand, no no
They think lovin', yeah yeah - is money in the hand

Your sweet lovin' - is better than a kiss, yeah yeah
When you leave me - sweet kisses I miss
