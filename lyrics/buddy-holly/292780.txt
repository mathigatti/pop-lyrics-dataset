Bo Diddley buy baby a diamond ring 
if that diamond ring don't shine 
he gonna take it to a private eye 
if that private eye can't see 
he better not take that ring from me 


Won't you come to my house back at home 
take a-my baby on away from home 
love a-that photo, where ya been 
up to your house and gone again 

Bo Diddley caught a fat cat 
to make a-pretty baby a Sunday hat 
Bo Diddley caught him a nanny goat 
to make a pretty baby a Sunday coat 

Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley have you heard 
my pretty baby says she wants a bird
