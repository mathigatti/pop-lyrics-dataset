Last night as I watched
The stars from my window
I prayed Lord above
To guide and protect you
Tho' I'm not wanted now
I still love you somehow
That is my only prayer
For you


Last night as I gazed
Thru the mist in my eyes
I wanted you here
To hold you so near
But silence tells me
You didn't hear my plea

I missed you so much since you left me
My heart ached apart since you left me
Tho' I'm not wanted now
I still love you somehow
That is my only prayer
For you

Last night
Last night
Last night I prayed for you
