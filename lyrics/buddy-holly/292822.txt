You got two lips that look so fine
You got one heart I wish was mine
Love, sweet love
You've got love (genuine love)


You got two arms that you could use
To make me lose my blues
Love, sweet love
You've got love (real fine love)

You've got love,  real love
You've got love, sweet love
You've got love, that is true
I want only you

You got two eyes so you can see
Your love was meant for me
Love, sweet love
You've got love (you've got love)

You've got love, real love
You've got love, sweet love
You've got me in a spin
I like the spin I'm in
