Well, I found you're a rover
And it's made me blue
Like a talent scout
You want some love that's new


Don't come back knockin'
At my heart's closed door
For I won'r be home
Don't call an' knock no more

Well, when you went away
And left me all alone
While you played around
I waited at home

Don't come back knockin'
At my heart's closed door
For I won'r be home
Don't call an' knock no more

You had all my heart
It was your very own
You weren't satisfied
Now, I'll go on alone

Don't come back knockin'
At my heart's closed door
For I won'r be home
Don't call an' knock no more

Oh, let's really knock it this time boys

Well, pity those with hearts
So empty and cold
To never know true love
A treasure to hold

Don't come back knockin'
At my heart's closed door
For I won'r be home
Don't call an' knock no more
