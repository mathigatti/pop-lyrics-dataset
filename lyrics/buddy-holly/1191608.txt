Though
You're the nearest
To my heart
Please don't ever
Umm ya
Ever say we'll part


You scold
And you were so bold
Yes together
Umm ya
Our love
Will grow old
Umm ya
Our love
Will grow old

You may be
A million miles away
Please believe me
Umm ya
When you hear me say
I love you
I love you

Come home
Keep me
From these
Sleepless nights
Try my love again
Umm ya
I'm gonna
Treat you right
Umm ya
I'm gonna
Treat you right
