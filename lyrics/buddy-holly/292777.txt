Well a-go baby - go baby - go baby go baby 
Go baby - go baby - go baby go baby 
Go baby - go baby go baby 
won't you come out tonight 


Well baby won't you come out tonight 
underneath the moon so bright 
we'll have fun cuttin' a rug 
won't you come out my little honey bug 
oh baby won't you come out tonight 

Well baby the moon is so bright 
and if you'll only come out it'll be just right 
we'll make all the night spots 
and for you - that's not a lot 
oh baby won't you come out tonight 

Well baby I love you so 
and I hope your answer won't be "no" 
if you'll come out - we'll rock and roll 
come on baby - let's go 
baby won't you come out tonight
