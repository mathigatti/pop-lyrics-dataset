Well, you say you're mine 
but baby you don't show it 
you'd better fly right cause before you know it 


I'm gonna set my foot right down on you 
gonna stop your struttin' baby 'til you say you're through 

I'm gonna turn you around 
and put you upside down 
if that don't stop your runnin' around (chorus) 

Ah well, you tell me this and you tell me that 
how come your dog bites me instead of that other cat (chorus) 

I'm gonna turn you around 
and put you upside down 
if that don't stop your slippin' around (chorus)
