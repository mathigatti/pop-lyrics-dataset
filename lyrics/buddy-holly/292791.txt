Have you ever been lonely
Have you ever been blue
Have you ever loved someone
Just as I love you


Can't you see I'm sorry for each mistake I've made
Can't you see I've changed dear
Can't you see I've paid

Be a little forgiving - take me back to your heart
How can I go on living - while we're apart
If you knew what I'd been through
Then you'd know why I ask you

Have you ever been lonely - have you ever been blue
