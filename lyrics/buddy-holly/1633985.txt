Hello mary Lou, goodbye heart
sweet Mary Lou I´m so in love with you.
I knew Mary Lou, we´d never part
so hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart.


You passed me by one sunny day
flashed those big brown eyes my way
and oh I wanted you for ever more.
now I´m not one that´s get around
I swear my feet´s stuck to the ground
and though I never did meet you before,
I said:

Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
sweet Mary Lou I´m so in love with you.
I knew Mary Lou, we´d never part
so hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart.

I saw your lips, I heard your voice
belive me I just had no choise
wild horses couldn´t make me stay away
I thought about a moonlit night
my arms around you good and tight
that´s all I had to see for me to say
hey,hey,hey.
Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
sweet Mary Lou I´m so in love with you.
I knew Mary Lou, we´d never part
so hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart.

so hello Mary lou goodbye heart
well hello Mary Lou goodbye heart
yes hello Mary Lou goodbye heart.
