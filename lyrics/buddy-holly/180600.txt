Well all right - so i?m being foolish
Well all right let people know
About the dreams and wishes you wish
In the night when lights are low


Well all right - well all right
We?ll live and love with all our might
Well all right - well all right
Our lifetime of love will be all right

Well, all right - so i'm going steady
It's all right when people say
That those foolish kids can?t be ready
For the love that comes their way
