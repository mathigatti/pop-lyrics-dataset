Maybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me


It's funny, honey. You don't care
You never listen to my prayer
Maybe, baby, you will love me someday

Well, you are the one that
Makes me glad
Any other one, that
Makes me sad
And when some day
You want t'leave, well
A-I'll be there
Wait and a-see-he-he

Maybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me

Well-a, you are the one that
Makes me glad
Any other one, that
Makes me sad
And when some day
You want t'leave, well
A-I'll be there
Wait and a-see-he-he

Maybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me
