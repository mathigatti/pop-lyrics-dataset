Get out from that kitchen and a-rattle those pots and pans
Well, a-roll my breakfast, 'cause I'm a hungry man.
Well, you wear those dresses the sun comes shining through
Yeah, you wear those dresses the sun comes shining through
I don't believe my eyes, I'm gonna dance with only you

Shake rattle and roll, shake rattle and roll
Well, you won't do right to save your doggone soul

I said, over the hill and way down underneath
You make me roll my eyes, and baby, make me grit my teeth
Well, I'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a sea-food store
I'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a sea-food store
I can look at you girl, you don't try no more
