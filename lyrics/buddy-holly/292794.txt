Baby baby baby baby baby 
come back baby I wanna play house with you 


You may go to college 
you may go to school 
you may have a pink cadillac 
but don't you be nobody's fool 

Now come baby come 
come back baby come 
come back baby 
I wanna play house with you 

Now this is one thing baby 
I want you to know 
well-a, come on back to me little girl 
we can make like we did before (chorus) 

Well now this is one thing baby 
that I'm talkin' about 
well, come on back to me little girl 
so we can play some house (chorus) 

Well, listen to me baby 
try to understand 
well, I'd rather see you dead little girl 
than to be with another man (chorus)
