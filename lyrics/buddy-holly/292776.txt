Sixty seconds of heavenly bliss 
one minute of your sweet kiss 
then my heart was all a mess 
it's love - baby, it's love 


Sixty minutes of you in my arms 
one hour to learn of all your charms 
then my heart's like a fire alarm 
it's love - baby, it's love 

Twelve hours of you to tantalize 
one day for me to realize 
my heart flutters like butterflies 
it's love - baby, it's love 

Seven days - a wedding to plan 
one week and then I begin 
my life of a happy married man 
it's love - baby, it's love 

Four weeks of quarrels and kisses 
one month of fighting the missus 
I'm wondering now what the heck that this is 
it's love - baby, it's love
