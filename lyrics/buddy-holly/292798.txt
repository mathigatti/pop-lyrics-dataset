It's too late, she's gone
It's too late, my baby's gone
Wish I had told her, she was my only one
But it's too late, she's gone


It's a weak man that cries
So I guess I'd best dry my eyes
Guess I will miss her more than any one
But it's too late, she's gone

She's gone, yes, she's gone
She's gone, my my baby's gone
She's gone, yes, she's gone
Where can my baby be?

I wonder does she know
When she left me, it hurt me so
I need your lovin', please don't make me weep
And tell me, it's not too late
