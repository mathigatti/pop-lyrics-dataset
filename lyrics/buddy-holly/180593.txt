I'm just sittin' here reminiscing
Wondering who you've been kissin'
Baby - wo oh baby
I've been wondering all around
There must be a new guy in town
You don't love me anymore
I'll get over you baby
Although my heart's still sore
Well, you know my heart's still sore


When i think of all the lies you told
To that young man my heart you sold
You're a cheater and a mean mistreater
When i think of all the fun we had
Kinda makes me feel so sad
I'm lonely - for your love
And the longest day i live
It's only you that i'll be thinking of
You know i'm thinkin' of
Well, it's you i'm thinking of
