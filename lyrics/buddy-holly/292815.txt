That makes it tough - wo, so tough 
when you tell me - -you don't love me 
that makes it tough - oh, so tough 
wo wo wo 
when you say you don't care for me no more 


Memories will follow me forever 
though I know my dreams cannot come true 
all those precious things we shared together 
time goes by - I'll still remember you 

And that makes it tough - oh, so tough 
when you tell me - you don't love me 
that makes it tough - oh so tough 
mmm wo 
when you say you don't care for me no more
