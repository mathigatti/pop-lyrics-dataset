Well my old car's a-rollin' down the line 
thoughts of my baby runnin' through my mind 
she's a-waitin' for me - I gotta be on time 
I gotta roll... 


Well, the white marker's flying off the road below 
when I'm really flying low 
my baby's waiting - I can't go slow 
I gotta roll... 

Well, the big policeman pulled along side of me 
he said "Boy, you ain't quite as fast as me" 
I showed him a picture of that baby of mine 
he said "Boy, you gotta roll on down that line"
