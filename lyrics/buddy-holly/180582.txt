You took me up to heaven,
when you took me in your arms.
I was dazzled by your kisses
blinded by your charms.


I was lost (I was lost)
in a fool's paradise (fool's paradise)
Good and lost (Good and lost)
in a fool's paradise.

When you told me that you loved me,
I gave my heart to you.
And I wondered if there could be
any truth in love so new.

I was lost (I was lost)
in a fool's paradise (fool's paradise)
Good and lost (Good and lost)
in a fool's paradise.

The whole world was my kingdom
and your love the gem in my crown.
Then I saw you glance at a new romance
and my love came tumbling down.

Well you treat me kinda coolish
and may never let me know
That you think I'm being fooling
because I love you so

I'll still get lost (I feel get lost?)
in a fool's paradise (fool's paradise)
Lost with you (lost with you)
in a fool's paradise.

(Repeat chorus)
