Well alright so I'm being foolish
Well alright let people know
About the dreams and wishes you wish
And the night when lights are low


Well alright, well alright
We will live and love with all our might
Well alright, well alright
Our lifetime's love will be alright

Well alright so I'm going steady
It's alright when people say
That those foolish kids can't be ready
For the love that comes our way

Well alright, well alright
We will live and love with all our might
Well alright, well alright
Our lifetime's love will be alright

Jackie
