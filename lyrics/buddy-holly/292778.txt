They say what you don't know - won't hurt you 
and I believe that's so - so don't tell me 
that you've found someone new 
to go through life with you 


Because I love you - my darling 
my dearest - I love you 
you're the one I want nearest me 
I love you - and I hope that you love me too 

I'd rather die thinking you love me 
than to go on through life without you 
and you with someone new 
to go through life with you 

Because I love you - my darling 
my dearest - I love you - I love you 
you're the one I want nearest me 
I love you - I love you - and I hope that you love me too
