Sweetheart I'm changing all those changes 
that I made when I left you 
because I made those changes when I thought you were untrue 

But now you're gone - I've found I'm wrong 
there's nothing I can do 
except to change up all those changes 
that I made when I left you 

I didn't stop to think - I just left without a care 
and know I know you're gone and I can't find you anywhere 

I should have reconsidered all those things I said I'd do 
so now I'm changing all those changes 
that I made when I left you
