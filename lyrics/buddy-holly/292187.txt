Tonight I'm so blue - thinking of you 
I've got those "gotta get you near me blues" 
so hurry here to me - darling can't you see 
I've got those "gotta get you near me blues" 


Have you ever had this feeling that I've been speaking of 
to be so far away from the one that you love 

So hurry here to me - darling can't you see 
I've got those "gotta get you near me blues" 

Gonna head it on back to our country home 
I've got those "gotta get you near me blues" 
and when I get there dear - no more will I roam 
I've got those "gotta get you near me blues" 

There's a big yellow moon smiling down from above 
that's no good to me without the one that I love 
So hurry here to me - darling can't you see 
I've got those "gotta get you near me blues
