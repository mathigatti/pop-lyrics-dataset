The little things you say and do
Make me want to be with you
Rave on it's a crazy feeling and
I know it's got me reeling
When you say I love you, rave on


The way you dance and hold me tight
The way you kiss and say goodnight
Rave on it's a crazy feeling and
I know it's got me reeling
When you say I love you, rave on

Well, rave on it's a crazy feeling
And I know it's got me reeling
I'm so glad that you're revealing your love for me
Rave on, rave on and tell me, tell me, not to be lonely
Tell me, you love me only rave on to me

Well, rave on it's a crazy feeling
And I know it's got me reeling
I'm so glad that you're revealing your love for me
Rave on, rave on and tell me, tell me, not to be lonely
Tell me, you love me only rave on to me
