When you've loved someone 
and then found you've lost 
why must a true heart be left to pay the cost 


Why must a heart that has been true 
be broken and sad - so empty and blue 

I gambled my heart and I lost it to you 
now I'll spend my life wondering why I love you 
someday you'll know - why I'm so blue 
when you've gambled your heart 
and you've lost it too 

Why must it be the one you want most of all 
they'll build you up and then let you fall 
they'll lead you on - you'll think that they're true 
they'll love you then leave you so empty and blue
