Take your time - I can wait 
for all the love I know will be mine 
if you take your time 


Take your time - though it's late 
heart strings will sing like a string of twine 
if you take your time 

Take your time and take mine too 
I have time to spend 
take your time - go with me through 
times 'til all time's end
