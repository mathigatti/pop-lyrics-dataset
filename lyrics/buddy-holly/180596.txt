Tell me how to keep your love
You know how i need your love
Tell me how you keep the love
Within your heart from me


Don't you know that i love you
Let me show why i'm true blue
When i know our love is true
Don't keep your love from me

If you would say to me today
The time for love is now
Could i sway your love my way
Then i say tell me how
