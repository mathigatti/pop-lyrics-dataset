All of my love, all of my kissin'
You don't know what you've been missin'
Oh boy! (Oh boy!) With you and me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me


All of my life, I've been waitin'
Tonight there'll be no hesitatin'
Oh boy! (Oh boy!) With you and me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me

Stars appear and the shadows are fallin'
You can hear my heart to callin'
A little bit of lovin' makes everything right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight

All of my love, all of my kissin'
You don't know what you've been missin'
Oh boy! (Oh boy!) With you and me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me

(Solo)

All of my love, all of my kissin'
You don't know what you've been missin'
Oh boy! (Oh boy!) With you and me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me

All of my life, I've been waitin'
Tonight there'll be no hesitatin'
Oh boy! (Oh boy!) With you and me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me

Stars appear and the shadows are fallin'
You can hear my heart to callin'
A little bit of lovin' makes everything allright
I'm gonna see my baby tonight

All of my love, all of my kissin'
You don't know what you've been missin'
Oh boy! (Oh boy!) With you and me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me
