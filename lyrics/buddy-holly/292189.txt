One day while I was eating down at Smokey Joe's Cafe 
a-sittin' there readin' down at Smokey Joe's Cafe 
a chicken walked in through the door 
that I had never seen before 
at least I never saw her down at Smokey Joe's Cafe 
and it scared me when she sat right down next to me 


Her knees were almost touching mine at Smokey Joe's Cafe 
a chill was runnin'down my spine at Smokey Joe's Cafe 
I could smell her sweet perfume 
she smiled and made my heart go boom 
and everybody room at Smokey Joe's Cafe 
they said "be careful - that chick belongs to Smokey Joe" 

And from behind the counter - I saw a man 
a chef's hat on his head and a knife in his hand 
he grabbed me by the collar and began to shout 
"you better eat up all your beans, boy &amp; clear right on out!" 

Well, I know I'll never eat again at Smokey Joe's Cafe 
&gt;and so I'll never see again at Smokey Joe's Cafe 
I'd rather eat my chili beans at Jim's or Jack's or John's or Gene's 
than take my chances eating down at Smokey Joe's Cafe 
&gt;I risked my life when that Smokey Joe's a crazy fool
