It's not my fault - if you're not falling in love with me 
it's not my fault - if a future love you can't see 
I should have known I could never win your hand 
I know I can't hold your heart with just a wedding band 


I'm just a fool in your broken chain of hearts 
each one is falling now and I can't hold the parts 
I guess you're one of those fond to be free 
it's not my fault - if you're not falling in love me
