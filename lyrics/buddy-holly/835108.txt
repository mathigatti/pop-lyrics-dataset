Blue Monday, how I hate Blue Monday
Got to work like a slave all day
Here come Tuesday, oh hard Tuesday
I'm so tired that I've no time to play


Here come Wednesday, I'm beat to my socks
My gal calls, and I tell her that I'm out
'Cause Thursday is a hard workin' day
And Friday I get my pay

Saturday mornin', oh Saturday mornin'
All my tiredness has gone all away
Find my money meet my honey
And go out on the town to play

Sunday mornin' my head is bad
But it's worth it for the time that I've had
But I've got to get my rest
'Cause Monday is a mess

Saturday mornin', oh Saturday mornin'
All my tiredness has gone all away
Find my money meet my honey
And go out on the town to play

Sunday mornin' my head is bad
But it's worth it for the time that I've had
But I've got to get my rest
'Cause Monday is a mess
