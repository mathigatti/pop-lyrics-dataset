Hearts that are broken &amp; love that's untrue 
these go with learning the game 


When you love her &amp; she doesn't love you 
you're only learning the game 

When she says that you're the only one she'll ever love 
then you find that you are not the one she's thinking of 

Feeling so sad and you're all alone &amp; blue 
that's when you're learning the game
