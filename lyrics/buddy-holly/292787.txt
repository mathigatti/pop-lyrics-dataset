One lonely night - at this drive-in
And now I know - what a fool I've been


She was to meet me (an empty cup, a broken date)
We had a date (a broken date, an empty cup)
A date at seven - I dreamed of heaven
Now it's way past eight

She just drove by - with another guy
No wonder I can't help but cry

To think she never cared - just tears me up
Now all I have to show for love - is this empty cup

Just like this Coke - my love is gone
I've hit the bottom - now I'm all alone
