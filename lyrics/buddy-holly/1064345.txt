I'd like to thank the guy who wrote the song,
That made my baby fall in love with me.


Who put the bomp in the bomp-a-bomp-a-bomp?
Who put the ram in the ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?
Who put the bop in the bop sh-bop sh-bop?
Who put the dip in the dip da dip da dip?
Who was that man? I'd like to shake his hand,
He made my baby fall in love with me.

When my baby heard,
Bomp, ba-ba-bomp ba bomp ba bomp bomp,
Every word went right into her heart,
And when she heard them singing,
Ram-a-lam-a-lam-a-lam-a-lam-a ding dong,
She said we'd never have to part.

Well,
Who put the bomp in the bomp-a-bomp-a-bomp?
Who put the ram in the ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?
Who put the bop in the bop sh-bop sh-bop?
Who put the dip in the dip da dip da dip?
Who was that man? I'd like to shake his hand,
He made my baby fall in love with me.

Each time that we're alone,
Boogity boogity boogity boogity boogity boogity shoo,
Set my babies heart all a-glow,
And every time we dance,
Dip da dip da dip dip da dip da dip,
She always says she loves me so.

Well.
Who put the bomp in the bomp-a-bomp-a-bomp?
Who put the ram in the ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?
Who put the bop in the bop sh-bop sh-bop?
Who put the dip in the dip da dip da dip?
Who was that man? I'd like to shake his hand,
He made my baby fall in love with me.

(spoken)
Yeah! Darling, Bomp-a-bomp-a-bomp-a-bomp-a-bomp my heart,
and my honey Ram-a-lam-a-ding dong for ever,
When I say dip da dip da dip da dip,
You know what I mean,
From the bottom of my boogity boogity shoes.

Who was that man,
I'd like to shake his hand,
He made my baby fall in love with me,
Who put the bomp in the bomp-a-bomp-a-bomp?
Who put the ram in the ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?
Who put the bop in the bop sh-bop sh-bop?
Who put the dip in the dip da dip da dip?
(Repeat to fade)
