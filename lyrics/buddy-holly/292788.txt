Do you think of me darlin' 
while we're many miles apart 
oh please be true to me my darlin' 
for you are the flower of my heart 


Many nights I've sat alone 
and I've worried over you 
but I'll never worry dear 
if your love is true 

Please come back to me my darlin' 
cause I can't live while we're apart 
Please come back to me my darlin' 
for you are the flower of my heart 

Many nights I've sat alone 
and I've worried over you 
but I'll never worry dear 
if your love is true 

Please come back to me my darlin' 
for I can't live while we're apart 
come back - come back to me my darlin' 
for you are the flower of my heart
