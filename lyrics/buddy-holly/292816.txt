To spend one night with you - in our old rendezvous
And reminisce with you - that's my desire


To meet where gypsies play - down in some small cafe
And dance 'til break of day - that's my desire

We'll sip a little glass of wine
I'll gaze into your eyes divine
To feel the touch of your lips
Pressing on mine

To hear you whisper low - just when it's time to go
Cherie, I love you so - that's my desire
