Well, that´ll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that´ll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you´re gonna leave, you know it´s a lie
´cause that´ll be the day when i die
Well, you give me all your loving and your turtle doving
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
Well, you know you love me baby, until you tell me, maybe
That some day, well i´ll be through
Well, that´ll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that´ll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you´re gonna leave, you know it´s a lie
´cause that´ll be the day when i die
------ instrumental break ------
Well, that´ll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that´ll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you´re gonna leave, you know it´s a lie
´cause that´ll be the day when i die
Well, when cupid shot his dart he shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and i leave you
You sit and hold me and you tell me boldly
That some day, well i´ll be blue
Well, that´ll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that´ll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you´re gonna leave, you know it´s a lie
´cause that´ll be the day when i die
Well, that´ll be the day, woo hoo
That´ll be the day, woo hoo
That´ll be the day, woo hoo
That´ll be the day
