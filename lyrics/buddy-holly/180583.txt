Heartbeat,
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me,
Heartbeat,
Why does a love kiss stay in my memory,
Piddly pat,
I know that new love thrills me,
I know that true love will be,
Heartbeat,
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me,


Heartbeat,
Why do you skip when my babies lips meet mine,
Heartbeat,
Why do you flip and give me a skip each sign,
Piddly pat,
And sing to me love's story,
And bring to me love's glory,
Heartbeat,
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me,
