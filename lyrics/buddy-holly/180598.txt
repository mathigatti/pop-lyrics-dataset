Wishing - that I could see you every day 
wishing - that I could steal your heart away 


Dreaming - of the time I can hold you tight 
wishing - that the time would come tonight 

I?ve been hoping all along - things would turn out right 
if I could find a wishing star - then I could spend the night 

Wishing - that I could see you every day 
wishing - that I could steal your heart away
