Send me some lovin' - send it I pray 
how can I love you - when you're far away 


Send me your picture - send it my dear 
so I can hold it - pretend you are near 

Can't you send me your kisses - I can feel their touch 
I need you so badly - I miss you so much 

My days are so lonely - my nights are so blue 
I'm here and I'm lonely - I'm waiting for you
