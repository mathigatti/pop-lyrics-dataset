Mustang Sally, guess you better slow your mustang down.
 
Mustang Sally, baby, guess you better slow your
mustang down. 
You've been running all over the town . 
Oh, I guess I'll have to put your flat feet on the
ground.


All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally,
ride.  
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally,
ride.
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally,
ride.
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally,
ride
One of these early mornings,  
You gonna be wiping your weeping eyes. 

I bought you a brand new mustang... 'bout nineteen
sixty five.
Now you come around signifying a woman, 
girl you don't wanna let me ride.
Mustang Sally, guess you better slow your mustang
down. 
You been running all over the town now.
I guess you gotta put your flat feet on the ground. 

All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally,
ride.
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally,
ride. 
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally,
ride.
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally,
ride.
One of these early mornings,
You gonna be wiping your weeping eyes.
