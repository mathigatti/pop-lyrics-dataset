Well, it's one for the money, two for the show,
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off
Of my blue suede shoes


Well, you can knock me down, step in my face,
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off
Of my blue suede shoes

You can burn my house, steal my car,
Drink my liquor from an old fruitjar
Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off
Of my blue suede shoes
