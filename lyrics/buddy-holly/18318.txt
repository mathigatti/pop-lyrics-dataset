There comes a time for everybody  (everybody)
when true love will come your way.
There comes a time for everybody  (everybody)
that´s what they tell me, that´s what they say.


I didn´t hear them say a word of when that time would be
I only know that what they say, has not come true for me.
You just keep waiting and love will come your way
that´s what they tell me, that´s what they say.

(repeat)
