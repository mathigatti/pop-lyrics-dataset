Mailman, bring me no more blues 
mailman, bring me no more blues 
one little letter is all I can use 


She wrote me only one sad line 
told me she's no longer mine 
Mr. Mailman - that'll do for some time 

Cry - like never before 
so hard - couldn' cry no more 
shoo shoo mailman - stay away from my door 

Mailman, bring me no more blues 
mailman, bring me no more blues 
one little letter is all I can use
