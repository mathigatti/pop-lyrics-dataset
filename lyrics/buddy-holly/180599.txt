Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Mm, mm, mm, mm


Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
Mm, mm, mm, mm

Let me hear you say
The words I want to hear
Darling when you're near
Mm, mm, mm, mm

Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm
