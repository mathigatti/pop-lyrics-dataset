Love can make a fool of you
You do anything it wants you to
Love can make you feel so good - when it goes like you think it should
Or it can make you cry at night - when your baby don?t treat you right


When you?re feeling sad and blue
You know love?s made a fool of you

You know love makes fools of men
But you don?t care, you?re gonna try again

Time goes by, it?s a-passin? fast - you think true love has come at last
But by and by you?re gonna find - crazy love has made you blind

When you?re feeling sad and blue
You know love?s made a fool of you
