Well! you're gonna miss me
Early in the morning, one of these days


Well, you're gonna want me
Early in the morning
When i'm away? hey!, hey!, don't ya know

Yes, you'll be sorry? for the times i cried
You'll be sorry? for the times you lied
Well, you're gonna miss me
Early in the morning, one of these days

Well, ya know a rolling stone -rolling stone-
Don't gather no moss -gather no moss-
And ya cross your bridge -cross your bridge-
When it's time to cross -time to cross-
Well, ya broke my heart -broke my heart-
When ya said goodbye -said goodbye-
Now the milk is spilt?but, you're gonna cry!

Yeah, early in the morning
You're gonna know, that i was right

Oh, yeah!, yeah!, early in the morning
When there's nobody
To hold you tight? oh, oh, oh !!

Well, you're gonna want me? want me bad
You're gonna miss? the best man you ever had
Yes, you're gonna miss me
Early in the morning, one of these days
