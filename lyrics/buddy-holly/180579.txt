Hey hey look at me and tell me
What's gonna happen to you
When you've broken too many people?s hearts
And can't find anyone new


Say say look at me and tell me
About that twinkle in your eye
Is the twinkle in your eye meant for me
Or meant for some other guy

Look at me from now on
Know the love we share
Look at me from now on
Let me know you care

Hey hey look at me and tell me
What's gonna happen to you
When you've spoken sweet words of love to me
And i want to marry you
