Little baby, baby me 
little baby, baby me 
in my heart you are the one 
look around and have your fun 
wo, you be my little baby 
and baby me 


Little baby can you see 
what your love has done to me 
can't you see love in my eyes 
love that leaves me full of sighs 
wo, you be my little baby 
and baby me 

Little baby, baby me 
little baby, baby me 
maybe I will baby you 
with a bunch of love for you 
wo, you be my little baby 
and baby me
