I've got a soft place in my heart for you 
and the dreams it's caused no one will ever know 


I guess you know dear - my love has always been true 
now there's nothing left to say or do but go 

These bitter tears I've shed for you - are all in vain 
but if you decide you want me back again 

Just come back dear and I'll no longer be so blue 
I've got a soft place in my heart, my darling for you
