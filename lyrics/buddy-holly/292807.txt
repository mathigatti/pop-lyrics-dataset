Strange things take place in my moondreams
As the lonely and loveless hours go by
Your face takes its place in every moonbeam
Moondreams bring thoughts gentle as a sigh


Moondreams can be a sensation
Moondreams may be fascination
Love can be our destination
You and I can share this dream

Wishing for you in my moondreams
As the lonely and loveless hours go by
Will do until you can share all my dreams
Moondreams - moondreams
Moondreams brought by moonbeams in the sky
