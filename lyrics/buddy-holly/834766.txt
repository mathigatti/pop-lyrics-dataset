You said that you were leaving me
You were gonna let me be
But now I find you here


I loved you, but don't you love me too?
But you said I'd never do
Now you and I are through

I loved you then my darlin' I loved you every day
But it seems my darlin' your love just fades away

You loved me but I just don't care
About the new love that I'll share
And you and I are through

You said that you were leaving me
You were gonna let me be
But now I find you here

I loved you, but don't you love me too?
But you said I'd never do
Now you and I are through

I loved you then my darlin' I loved you every day
But it seems my darlin' your love just fades away

You loved me but I just don't care
About the new love that I'll share
And you and I are through

I loved you then my darlin' I loved you every day
But it seems my darlin' your love just fades away

You loved me but I just don't care
About the new love that I'll share
And you and I are through
