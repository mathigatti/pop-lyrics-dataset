Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid
I'm a fool about my money, don't try to save
My heart says "go go, have a time"
Saturday night and I'm feelin' fine


Gonna rock it up, gonna rip it up
Gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
We're gonna rock it up, and a ball tonight

Well along about ten I'll be flying high
I'll rock on out unto the sky
I don't care if I spend my dough
It's Saturday night I'm a happy, happy soul

Gonna rock it up, gonna rip it up
Gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
Gonna rock it up, and a ball tonight - owww

Well along about ten I'll be flying high
I'll rock on out unto the sky
I don't care if I spend my dough
It's Saturday night I'm a happy, happy soul

Gonna rock it up, gonna rip it up, gonna rip it up
Gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
We're gonna rock it up, and a ball tonight
