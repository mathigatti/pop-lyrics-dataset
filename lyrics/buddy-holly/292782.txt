Come back baby - baby won't you come back
Come back baby to me
Now I know why all sad hearts cry
Baby baby come to me


Ah well I cried all night ever since you left me
Nothing has gone right - oh lonely old me

I say come back baby - baby won't you come back
Come back baby to me
Now you know I love you so
Baby baby come to me

When you left me all alone to sing the blues
I waited by the phone to get good news

That you would come back baby - baby won't you come back
Come back baby to me
Now you know I love you so
Baby baby come to me
Wo, come back baby to me
