You're the queen of the ballroom
You're in every man's arms
When I look upon you
How you thrill me with your charms


You have all the men at your feet
With your lovely, lovely ways
And I will love you forever and always

May I have - may I have this dance
Now I know - you're looking for fun, not romance

You're the queen of the ballroom
And I love you more and more
Queen of the ballroom
Queen of the ballroom floor
