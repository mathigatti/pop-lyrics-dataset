Stayin' at home, waitin' for you
Just won't get it 'cause you say we're thru an'


I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm lookin' for someone to love

Playin' the field all day long
Since I found out that I was wronged now

I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm lookin' for someone to love

Drunk man, street car
Foot slipped there you are now

I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm lookin' for someone to love

Caught myself, thinkin' of you
You can't love me and an other one too

Well I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm lookin' for someone to love
