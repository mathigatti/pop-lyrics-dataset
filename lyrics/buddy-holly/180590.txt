Please don't tell - no no no
Don't say that i told you so
I just heard a rumor from a friend


I don't say that it's true - i'll just leave that up to you
If you don't believe i'll understand

You recall a girl that's been in nearly every song
This is what i heard of course the story could be wrong

She's the one - i've been told
Now she's wearing a band of gold
Peggy sue got married not long ago
