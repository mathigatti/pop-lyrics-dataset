Now we're one and i love you so
Hold me - tight never let me go
Make the feeling run up my spine
You know i'm yours and you are mine
Now that we are married baby - we don't have to worry
Now we're one


Now we're one and a-you're my bride
We don't have to run and hide
Every time i want to hold your hand
I'm 'fraid someone won't understand
Now that we are married baby - we don't have to worry
Now we're one

Well, i wanna jump to the moon and yell out loud
I feel like i'm walking on an eighteenth cloud
We'll put all our fears and cares behind
Ever since we heard the wedding bells chime
