Well, I ain't nothin' but a man in love 
I ain't nothin' but a man in love 
the girls they say I'm their only one 
they even say I'm a modern Don Juan 


Well, there ain't but a-one thing puzzlin' me 
I got a girl and she can't see 
I want only to make her mine 
well, she thinks I'm just handing her a line 

Oh, I love her so 
I'll never - ever let her go 

Well, ain't nothin' but a man in love
