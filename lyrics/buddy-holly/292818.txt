I want you to me take me where I belong
Where hearts have been broken - with a kiss and a song
Spend the rest of my days dear - without any cares
Everyone understands me - in the valley of tears


Soft words have been spoken - so sweet and low
But my mind is made up and I must go
Spend the rest of my days dear - without any cares
Everyone understands me - in the valley of tears
