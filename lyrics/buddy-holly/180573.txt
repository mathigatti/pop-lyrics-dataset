Crying, waiting, hoping, that you'll come back
I just can't seem to get you off my mind
Crying, waiting, hoping, that you'll come back
You're the one I love and I think about you all the time


Crying, my tears keep fallin' all night long
Waiting, I feel so useless, I know it's wrong
To keep crying, waiting, hoping, that you'll come back
Maybe someday soon things will change and you'll be mine

Crying, my tears keep fallin' all night long
Waiting, I feel so useless, I know it's wrong
To keep crying, waiting, hoping, that you'll come back
Maybe someday soon things will change and you'll be mine

Crying, waiting, hoping
