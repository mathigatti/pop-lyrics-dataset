If you see old Annie better give her a lift
Cause Annie's been a-workin on a midnight shift


If Annie puts her hair up on her head
Paints them lips up bright, bright red
Wears that dress that fits real tight
Starts stayin' out 'til the middle of the night
Says that a friend gave her a lift
Well, Annie's been workin' on a midnight shift

If she acts a little funny, seems a little strange
Starts spendin' your money for brand new things
Tells you that she wants to use the car
Never explains what she wants it for
Brother, there just ain't no "ifs"
Cause Annie's been workin' on a midnight shift

Early in the morning when the sun comes up
You look at old annie and she looks kinda rough
You tell her "honey, get on out of that bed"
She says "leave me alone, I'm just about dead"
Brother, there just ain't no "ifs"
Cause  Annies been workin' on a midnight shift

If you got a good mama that's stayin' at home
You'd better enjoy it - cause it won't last long
When you think everything's all right
She starts slippin' round in the middle of the night
Brother, there just ain't no "ifs"
Cause  Annies been workin' on a midnight shift
