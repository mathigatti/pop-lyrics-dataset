Baby, baby, baby baby
Baby, baby, baby babe
Baby, baby, baby baby
Baby, baby, baby babe
Come back baby I wanna play house with you


Well now you may go to college
You may go to school
You may have a big Cadillac
But don't you be nobody's fool
Now baby, come back a-baby come
Come back a-baby come
Come back baby, I wanna play house with you

Well now this is one thing baby
That I want you to know
Well a-come on back to me a-little girl
We can make it like we did before
Now baby, come back a-baby come
Come back a-baby come
Come back baby, I wanna play house with you

Well now this is one thing baby
That I'm talkin' about
Well a-come on back to me a-little girl
So we can play some house
Now baby, come back a-baby come
Come back a-baby come
Come back baby, I wanna play house with you
