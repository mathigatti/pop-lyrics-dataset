You're the one - that's a-causing my blues 
you're the one - I don't want to lose 
you're the one that I'd always choose 
you're the that's meant for me 


You're the one - that I'm thinking of 
you're the one - that I'll always love 
you're the one - sent from heaven above 
you're the one that's meant for me 

Sometimes you make me feel so bad 
you make me cry deep in my heart 
I feel like an actor in a play 
who doesn't fit the part 

You're the one - and I want you to know 
you're the one - that thrills a-me so 
you're the one - I can't let you go 
you're the one that's meant for me
