Oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh
Baby, lately
Baby, yeah


The walls are all gone, did we melt them down? (baby)
Liquid in my hands, liquid in my mouth (oh)
Footage on my phone, did it with your tongue (oh)
And now we're sticking close, and I understand

Baby, I love you bad (oh)
'Cause lately I finally understand (oh)
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground (oh)

I finally understand, finally understand
My therapist said I hate myself really bad
You tell me it's fine, let me cry and hug it out

Baby, I love you bad (oh)
'Cause lately I finally understand (oh)
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground (oh)

Uh, baby, yeah, ba-baby, yeah
Uh, baby, yeah, ba-baby, yeah
'Cause lately, put me in the ground
Baby, yeah, ba-baby, yeah

Liquid in my hands, liquid in my mouth
Got me drippin' out, got me drippin' out
Many nights gone, finally understand
I finally understand, I finally understand
Feel it in my core and the feeling's raw
You love me even when I hate myself, I'm sure

Baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground
Baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground

Baby
