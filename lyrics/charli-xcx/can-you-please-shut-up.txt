Red lips are always moving fast
Never gonna make me laugh
Wanna smash your mouth, like glass, into a thousand pieces
Stop calling on my telephone
Can't you leave me left alone?
Push you in a volcano flames for your burning ego


In my ride, I got no room for you
In your mind, you know you hate me too

So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?

You never really turn me on
Tried, but always get it wrong
Now we're never gonna touch, and she's been seperated
Bored when I look into your eyes
Sparks were never meant to fly
Sometimes I just wanna die
Coffin feels like a vaca

In my bed, I got no room for you
In your mind, you know you hate me too

So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?

No sleep
Laying with your body
Cold to me
Trying to erase my memory
Need to breathe
Need to leave this destiny behind

Even though we're enemies
I don't really feel a thing
No love, no hate
Dead hearts won't break

No sleep
Laying with your body
Cold to me
Trying to erase my memory
Need to breathe
Need to leave this destiny behind

So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
So, can you please shut up?
