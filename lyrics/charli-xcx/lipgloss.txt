Bad bitch, make the way you can't get over me
Yo ass a pussy, Iâ€™m above it like a ovary (bad bitch)
I'm talkin' everyday, you gonna wanna hit on this
So sticky, Winnie The Pooh ain't got shit on this (nope)
Come get you a sample, lick between the camel
Pussy taste sweet 'cause I ate my pineapple (whoop)
Light a couple candles, prove you could handle
Pussy gooey like yolk before the egg scrambled (mmm)

Been fuckin' since yesterday, still 'bout to escalate
Do jumping jacks on that dick, I don't get tired like Evergate (mmm)
Go ahead, wash your face, got it sticky like paste
Hand-cuffed, wearing lace, yeah
That's how I catch your face (ahh ahh)
Want another taste, you can meet me at Chase (Chase)
Or catch me outside, I ain't coming to your place
Eating all these sweets, fuck around and get a cavity
Used to call you Daddy, but now I call you my majesty
Get in me from the back, but not talkin' 'bout a battery
Let's bring a hundred girls to the room, what's your capacity?
