Jungle time for me and you
You knew we were gonna have a cat fight sometime soon
Get your claws out and get ready to lose
Get your claws out, yeah


From the [?], you knew I was a bitch
From the [?], I was playing mind tricks with you
Made me mother all my friends, yeah you know I think she's a dickhead
Yeah you mother all my friends, yeah you know I think she's a dickhead

Jungle jungle jungle
Jungle time for me and you
Jungle jungle jungle
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
Jungle jungle jungle
Jungle time for me and you
Jungle jungle jungle
Get ready to rumble get ready to lose

You think you're such a special one, don't you darling?
Because of your big blue eyes and your [?] voice is charming
Stop making it useless, floor that big mistake you make
If you've always been like this then it's never gonna change

You don't have a pretty face and you don't have a brain
You say that you're rich and mannered, [?] boys are the same
But when I see you dancing now I just wanna punch you in the face
Just play a little [?], no shame

Jungle jungle jungle
Jungle time for me and you
Jungle jungle jungle
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
Jungle jungle jungle
Jungle time for me and you
Jungle jungle jungle
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
Get ready to rumble, get ready to lose
