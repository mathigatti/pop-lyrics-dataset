I'm speeding past the lights
I'm on the motorway
I feel my heart just burn again
I'm walking on a dream
Stuck in the time machine
Spinnin' round, take me out of all control


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)
I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)
I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)
I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)

I'm like a tape machine
I'm going on repeat
Echo intensity tonight
You're sewing up the seams
From where I used to bleed
Calling out, take me out of all control

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)
I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)
I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)
I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)

Take me out, take me out, take me out of control (ah ooh, ah ooh)
Take me out, take me out, take me out of control (ah ooh, ah ooh)
Take me out, take me out, take me out of control (ah ooh, ah ooh)

I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)
I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)
I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)
I feel it coming at the end of the night
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, I feel it coming (feel it coming around)

Oh, oh (I feel it coming at the end of the night)
Oh, oh (I feel it coming, I feel it coming)
Oh, oh (I feel it coming at the end of the night)
Oh, oh (I feel it coming, I feel it coming)
Oh, oh (I feel it coming at the end of the night)
Oh, oh (I feel it coming, I feel it coming)
Oh, oh (I feel it coming at the end of the night)
Oh, oh (I feel it coming, I feel it coming)
(I feel it coming at the end of the night)
(I feel it coming, I feel it coming)
