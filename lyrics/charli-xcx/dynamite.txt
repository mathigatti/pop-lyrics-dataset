See my face on your TV screen
Boom boom just like TNT
We glide right past security
Carbon poppin' in your wet daydream
I don't wear leather, I wear C4
Hand on the trigger, blowing off the doors
Candy taste like electrolytes
With a petrol fetish and a match to light


Just hold me like your hand grenade
The clock is ticking, no time for games
Will you just push the button and flick the switch
'Cause playing with fire can be dangerous

I'm just like dynamite
I'll blow you up the sky high
I'm just like dynamite
I'll set the night on fire
I'm just like dynamite
Show stops when I gotta blow up
Come on catch my gold burst
I'm just like dynamite

Fire cracker, fire cracker, bing bang boom
I'm TNT, dynamite, light my fuse

See my face in the magazine
Know me as the bomb machine
Big reward if you catch me
Blowin' up faster than the NYC
I don't eat snacks, I eat gun powder
Lazer blastin', gettin' louder
Try and get me if you can
But my bombs go boom bigger than Japan

Just hold me like your hand grenade
The clock is ticking, no time for games
Will you just push the button and flick the switch
'Cause playing with fire can be dangerous

I'm just like dynamite
I'll blow you up the sky high
I'm just like dynamite
I'll set the night on fire
I'm just like dynamite
Show stops when I gotta blow up
Come on catch my gold burst
I'm just like dynamite

My lipstick is ballistic, I'm blowin' up your mind
My kiss is a dead wishes, I'm lightin' up the sky

I'm just like dynamite
I'll blow you up the sky high
I'm just like dynamite
I'll set the night on fire
I'm just like dynamite
Show stops when I gotta blow up
Come on catch my gold burst

I'm just like dynamite
I'll blow you up the sky high
I'm just like dynamite
I'll set the night on fire
I'm just like dynamite
Show stops when I gotta blow up
Come on catch my gold burst
I'm just like dynamite

Fire cracker, fire cracker, bing bang boom
I'm TNT, dynamite, light my fuse
Fire cracker, fire cracker, bing bang boom
I'm TNT, dynamite, light my fuse
