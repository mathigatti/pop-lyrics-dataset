We were bad kids missing inhibitions
Kisses just like superstar collisions
Met you for the first time under black skies
We were running from the trouble at the right place, at the right time


Now he was my baby
Every night and day we
Jump on it! Jump on it!
Like a trampoline
This lovin' is amazing, it came from outer space
We jump on it! Jump on it!
Like a trampoline (like a trampoline)

Hold on closer
Supernova
You make me so crazy, you make me so lazy
And I will never be alone, never, never be alone
My supernova

Cruising through the sky
Yeah we're shining so bright
Lovin' so hot, burnin' like the sunlight
They say that what we've got is wrong
But we're feeling alright
Walk the world like a warrior, doing just fine

Always say you love me, keep on having fun
We jump on it! Jump on it!
Like a trampoline
We're so high above the clouds
Yeah, we never touch the ground
Jump on it! Jump on it!
Like a trampoline (like a trampoline)

Hold on closer
Supernova
You make me so crazy, you make me so lazy
And I will never be alone, never, never be alone
My supernova
My supernova

Never be alone, never, never be alone
Never, never, never, never, never be alone
Never be alone, never, never be alone
Never be alone, never, never be alone

Hold on closer
Supernova
You make me so crazy, you make me so lazy
And I will never be alone, never, never be alone
My supernova
My supernova
My supernova
