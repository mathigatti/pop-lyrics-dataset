You're a picture perfect page
Paper romance for a face
Yeah, I'm a lucky star
And my wish won't come true
I'm about to fall apart
Wish I held your rhinestone heart
But you would never open
You would never glow for me


You're with another girl
I'm never getting out
You'll never gonna know
These secrets in my mouth
I never knew before
But now I realize
I blossom like the Moon
When I fall through your eyes

Ah, ah-ah, ah, magazine
Ah, ah-ah, ah, I can feel you baby
Ah, ah-ah, ah, next to me
In these magazines

Lost in a corner of my mind
You sit and tangle of my lines
I read a thousand stories
Your whisper never starts to fade
I can smile and stare right through
Only happiness for you
Alone I cry an ocean
Ink and poisons starts to stain

I should've made my move
But it's too late to try
I lose myself to love
When I fall through your eyes

Ah, ah-ah, ah, magazine
Ah, ah-ah, ah, I can feel you baby
Ah, ah-ah, ah, next to me
In these magazines

Lines, space in your mind
You don't even know my heart is breaking
Ahh oh, ahh-ah-ah, oh

Ah, ah-ah, ah, magazine
Ah, ah-ah, ah, I can feel you baby
Ah, ah-ah, ah, next to me
Ah, ah-ah, ah, can you see me?
Ah, ah-ah, ah, magazine
Ah, ah-ah, ah, I can feel you baby
Ah, ah-ah, ah, next to me
In these magazines
In these magazines
