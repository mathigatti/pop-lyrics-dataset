I'm so bored of starting fights
Just wanna buy a house and live in the countryside
I'm so over getting high
But trouble always comes to me and I don't know why
It has always been the same
Since I was 14, I was bad, yeah, I lost my way
Nah, I don't wanna play no games
Pass me the dice, let me roll it, comes so naturally


Baby, mow that lawn
It really turns me on
Got no mobile phones
Cause the signals gone
Baby, mow that lawn, uh
It really turns me on, uh
Got no mobile phones
Cause the signals gone
