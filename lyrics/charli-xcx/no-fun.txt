No fun my babe
No fun
No fun my babe
No fun


No fun to hang around
Feelin' that same old way
No fun to hang around
Freaked out for another day

No fun my babe
No fun
No fun my babe
No fun

No fun to be alone
Walking by myself
No fun to be alone
In love with nobody else
Well maybe go out, maybe stay home
Maybe call mom on the telephone

Well c'mon, well c'mon
C'mon c'mon
Now ron, I say ron
C'mon and lemme hear you tell em
Lemme hear you tell em
Now I feel
I say lemme hear you
Tell em how I feel, yeah, my man

No fun to be alone
It's no fun to be alone
Hang on
Don't you lemme go
It's no fun to alone
To be alone
