Now is the time
We've both crossed the line
It's been way too long
And now we both see
How we can really be


And I see your face
And it reflects mine
Except mine isn't stained with teardrops and lines
'Cause like you, our friendship has withered
Quick, go away for a long time
Before I change my mind
If you stay, I'll only want more of you

So get out of my face, get off of my doorstep
And leave me, yeah, to cry on the inside
Well, I'll call you again just to see if we're friends
But I think we both know that our friendship
Cannot continue
Well, I'll say that I'm fine and just wait for the time
'Till I know that I can live up to your expectations

Quick, go away for a long time
Before I change my mind
If you stay, I'll only want more of you
Get out of my face, get off of my doorstep
And leave me, yeah, to cry on the inside, yeah, yeah
I didn't love you, but oh, when I'm not with you
I can't help but want you, you so bad, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Quick, go away for a long time
Before I change my mind
If you stay, I'll only want more of you
So get out of my face, get off of my doorstep
And leave me, yeah, to cry on the inside
