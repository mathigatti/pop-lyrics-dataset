'Cause every time I love you, I hate myself
So don't you pick it up
I'm out of my head, go get back in your bed 'cause


I'm done, uh huh, yeah
I'm done, ooh
I'm done, mhm, yeah
I'm done, ooh
I'm chained to your lips

I'm chained to your kiss, yeah
The way that it hits is a moment of bliss, yeah
I'm chained to your lips and I'm chained to your kiss, yeah
The way that it hits I will never forget, never forget, never forget, never, never

If I call you up
After 3 AM, with liquor in my blood
Please don't be my friend
'Cause every time I love you, I hate myself
So don't you pick it up
I'm out of my head, go get back in your bed 'cause
