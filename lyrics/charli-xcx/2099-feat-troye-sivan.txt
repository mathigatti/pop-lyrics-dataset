I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush


I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Don't make decisions for me
You don't know none
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future, future

I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush

I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Don't make decisions for me
You don't know nothin'
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future

Woo!
Killing, I'm so deadly, deadly
Ooh, I'm zooming like a jet ski, zoom zoom
Little dose of napalm, blow it up, yeah
Don't care what she talk about, nah
All she wanna do is my style, yeah

No one on my level, I play nice ‘cause I’m too clever
I won’t show it, never, never, but it’s crystal (woo!)
I’m way up, way better, she might pop but it's whatever
She might sell but what's she selling? Does she last long?

I know they write about me (yeah)
I know that they all see me (yeah)
Too scared so they don't play me
Some people try to save me

Ooh, but I'm feeling so good
Better than I ever could
Had bad people in my business - gone now
Cage, prison, now it's gone away
They wanna listen when I say
Think I care about the fame?
Na na na na

I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush

I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Don't make decisions for me, you don't know none
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future, future

I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush

I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Don't make decisions for me
You don't know nothin'
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, I roll up, future, future
