I don’t want no diamond rings
I don’t want that ol’ bling bling
All I want is all your love
Boy, you are my everything
I don’t need a single rose
I don’t want designer clothes
All I want is all your love
You’re my king, God save the queen


‘Cause you make me feel like Lizzy
Like Lizzy, like Lizzy
Yeah, you make me feel like Lizzy
Queen Elizzy, Elizzy
Yeah, you make me feel like Lizzy
Like Lizzy, like Lizzy
Yeah, you make me feel like Lizzy
Queen Elizzy, Elizzy

Ahh, I know you got a profile
Ahh, acting like a rough child
Ahh, I want something worthwhile
Bougie isn’t my style
I want what’s on the inside, ahh

So fuck all the people you know
Yeah, you could be living in your parents’ house
With no money, no cars, and no shoes
‘Cause I’m not impressed by the gold
Yeah, baby, all I want is you
I wanna be with you like 24/7
Don’t care if you’re rich or you’re broke
Ahh

I don’t want no diamond rings
I don’t want that ol’ bling bling
All I want is all your love
Boy, you are my everything
I don’t need a single rose
I don’t want designer clothes
All I want is all your love
You’re my king, God save the queen

‘Cause you make me feel like Lizzy
Like Lizzy, like Lizzy
Yeah, you make me feel like Lizzy
Queen Elizzy, Elizzy
Yeah, you make me feel like Lizzy
Like Lizzy, like Lizzy
Yeah, you make me feel like Lizzy
Queen Elizzy, Elizzy

You don’t gotta spoil me, ahh
Already feel that royalty, ahh
So love you when you’re forty
Let me be your shorty
Baby, I got loyalty, ahh

Yes, I love you for who you are
I’ll never go breaking your heart
Yeah, you could have nothin’
Or you could have millions
Without you I would fall apart
I’m captivated by your soul
And hopefully we can grow old
Just sitting’ together and looking’ at pictures
And walkin’ down memory road

I don’t want no diamond rings
I don’t want that ol’ bling bling
All I want is all your love
Boy, you are my everything
I don’t need a single rose
I don’t want designer clothes
All I want is all your love
You’re my king, God save the queen

‘Cause you make me feel like Lizzy
Like Lizzy, like Lizzy
Yeah, you make me feel like Lizzy
Queen Elizzy, Elizzy
Yeah, you make me feel like Lizzy
Like Lizzy, like Lizzy
Yeah, you make me feel like Lizzy
Queen Elizzy, Elizzy
