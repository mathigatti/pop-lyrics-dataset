And on, and on, and on, and?
What do you do when the dance goes on?
Run in the streets like a marathon
What do you do when the dance goes on
And on, and on, and on, and?


I'm here in the spotlights, I'm here waiting for you
Popped a thousand bottles now we 'bout to go roof
Turned up to 300, boy, I'm ready for you
Wanna take me down, yeah, I take you down, yeah
Yeah, baby

I've got so much liquor inside my body
Blazing and I'm enjoying my party
I pour all my 'tings myself
Crazy, but, I don't trust nobody
Hold on to me, rockin' still
Poppin' pills, droppin' bills
In a carnival like Notting Hill, gyal
Wait for me, I'm coming still

What do you do when the dance goes on?
Run in the streets like a marathon

And on, and on, and on, and?

I can't wait to feel your hands all on my body
In my devil-red dress, come and rip it off me
Turned up to 300, speedin' on the highway
Wanna take me down, I take you down, yeah
Yeah, baby
