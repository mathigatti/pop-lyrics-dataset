Delete your pictures from the internet
Try hard to pretend it's cool
Summer in August with our favourite friends
Now they're reminding me of you


I think about you
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you
All of the time
I think about you
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you
All of the time
All of the time

All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, you
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, all of the time
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, you
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time

I knew the second that I walked away
Things would never be the same, no no
Threw out our memories, forgot your name
But I could not forget your face

I think about you
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you
All of the time
I think about you
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you
All of the time
All of the time

All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, you
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, all of the time
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time, you
All of the, all of the, all of the
All of the time
