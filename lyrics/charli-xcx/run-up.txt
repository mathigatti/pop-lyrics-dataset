Ah, ah
Run up, run up
No, no I ain’t no shy girl
But if you need a reminder
I’m about to push you like a big button (big button)
I let you cuff me like I did something (did something)
I’ll be your ride or die girl
Our videos go viral
I’m dressing up like it’s a big function
I’m ‘bout to give it to you, no bluffin’


Here we go, here we go, go, go
I can make you scream my name, fucking on the balcony
Here we go, here we go, go, go
I’ma run up on you, oh baby
Here we go, here we go, go, go
Got you down upon on your knees, calling in the cavalry
Here we go, here we go, go, go

My love got flow like the ocean
You got it raining baby, go deep

Anytime, you hit my phone when you feel like you need company
I’ma make you feel so good, got you feeling like you’re royalty (yeah eh eh)
