You are somethin' special, oh-woah
Twenty carats, solid gold
What we had was precious, oh-woah
But I had to let you go


We had a connection, oh-woah
But I'm not the type of girl who wants
Serious affection, oh-woah
It doesn't belong in my world

It was only was one night
But I wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
It was only was one night
But I wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go

Do you wanna go?
Do you wanna go?
It was only one night
Do you wanna go?
Do you wanna go back to where we were?
It was only was one night
But I wanna go
Do you wanna go?
Do you wanna go back to where we were?
It was only was one night
But I wanna go
Do you wanna go?
Do you wanna go back to where we were?

Got that chain reaction, oh-woah
Didn't know what it was worth
Sixteen million mentions, oh-woah
Ain't pickin' up the whole damn earth, no no no

We had a connection, oh-woah
But I'm not the type of girl, oh you
You are an exception, oh yeah
Yeah, you blew my mind, I wanna rewind

It was only was one night
But I wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
It was only was one night
But I wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go

Do you wanna go?
Do you wanna go?
It was only one night
Do you wanna go?
Do you wanna go back to where we were?
It was only was one night
But I wanna go
Do you wanna go?
Do you wanna go back to where we were?
It was only was one night
But I wanna go
Do you wanna go?
Do you wanna go back to where we were?

It was only was one night
Do you wanna?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do you wanna?
It was only was one night
