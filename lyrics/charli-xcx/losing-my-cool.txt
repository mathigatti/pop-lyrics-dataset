Everybody's watching me, watching you
But this ain't gonna go the way I want it to
I've played this night a thousand times in my dreams
But standing here in front of you
I can't breathe


Don't need to admit this to know that it's true
There's fire in your eyes and I'm blinded by you
I'm searching for something better to say
I wanna be gold but you turn me to gray

And all that fire it burns right through
And I can't fight it, I'm losing my cool
And all that glitter, like wasted jewels
It all falls down because I'm losing my cool
I'm losing my cool, losing my cool
Losing my cool, losing my cool

Standing on the dark side of the dance floor
Trying to find protection from your smile
My heart is like a drum beat in the jungle
It's running with the tigers, running wild

I'm back in the corner, I'm covered with lies
I'm praying for water to put out the fires
And my imagination is burning away
I wanna be gold but you turn me to gray

And all that fire it burns right through
And I can't fight it, I'm losing my cool
And all that glitter, like wasted jewels
It all falls down because I'm losing my cool
It's too late, yeah, the rest is truth
I know this time, I'm, I'm losing my cool
My heart's unfrozen, the ice runs through
And I can't stop myself, I'm losing my cool

My heart starts to beat faster
As I see you move towards me
I think, This is it, what will you say?
But you walk straight past me
Into the arms of somebody else
And I'm left alone, again

And all that fire it burns right through
And I can't fight it, I'm losing my cool
And all that glitter, like wasted jewels
It all falls down because I'm losing my cool
It's too late, yeah, the rest is truth
I know this time, I'm, I'm losing my cool
My heart's unfrozen, the ice runs through
And I can't stop myself, I'm losing my cool
Losing my cool, I'm losing my cool
Losing my cool
