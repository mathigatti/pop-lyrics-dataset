Ripped jeans
Wanna see what's underneath
I just need a physical
Oohh, about to lose self control
Yeah, don't need star signs that align
Pick me up in 25
Oh, about to lose self control


My hands on your body never felt so good
My hands on your body never felt so
(Ah-ah)

You look so good when you're naked
Keep it natural, I just wanna see you naked, yeah
Picture in my mind, gonna save it, ooh ah ooh
I just wanna see you naked
You look so good when you're naked
X-Ray vision, I just wanna see you naked, yeah
Throwing all your clothes on the pavement, ooh ah ooh
I just wanna see you naked
Ooh ah, ooh ah, ah-ah, ooh ah, ooh ah, oooh, ah
Ooh ah, ooh ah, ah-ah
I just wanna see you naked

Don't care if you never say you would
Aphrodite got me good
Oh, now we're getting so close
My sheets when you're walking underneath
Mirror, mirror, you and me
Oh, now we're getting so close
Let me say

My hands on your body never felt so good
My hands on your body never felt so
(Ah-ah)

You look so good when you're naked
Keep it natural, I just wanna see you naked, yeah
Picture in my mind, gonna save it, ooh ah ooh
I just wanna see you naked
You look so good when you're naked
X-Ray vision, I just wanna see you naked, yeah
Throwing all your clothes on the pavement, ooh ah ooh
I just wanna see you naked
Ooh ah, ooh ah, ah-ah, ooh ah, ooh ah, oooh, ah
Ooh ah, ooh ah, ah-ah
I just wanna see you naked
Ooh ah, ooh ah, ah-ah, ooh ah, ooh ah, oooh, ah
Ooh ah, ooh ah, ah-ah
I just wanna see you naked
