I love you too
I love you too
I love you too
You know I love you too


Lookin' at you, lookin' at me
We think the same things
I wanna take this seriously, oh (oh)
Don't wanna dance alone
So come here with me
You're made of glass, I'm made of stone
One more thing to say before you go

I don’t talk a lot, talk a lot
So you should listen up, I mean it when I say
I’m not afraid, it’s okay
You know I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
You know I love you too

Now you're with me, now I'm with you
We're here forever
How does it feel knowing the truth, oh (oh)
Don't wanna dance alone
So come here with me
You're in a class, all on your own
One more thing I've got to let you know

I don’t talk a lot, talk a lot
So you should listen up, I mean it when I say
I’m not afraid, it’s okay
You know I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
You know I love you too

You know I never really thought about
How it feels to say these words aloud
It's so weird, but it's true
Do you ever even think about
How it feels when you were not around
But I stay here 'cause I love you too

I don’t talk a lot, talk a lot
So you should listen up, I mean it when I say
I’m not afraid, it’s okay
You know I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
You know I love you too
