I've been fantasizin' 'bout a Porsche
Get that dough-oh-oh-oh
I've been kneadin', kneadin' 'til I'm sore, 'til it grow-oh-oh-oh
(X C X)
I've been runnin' 'round now for so long, yeah
It seems that every day and everywhere I go, yeah, I see ya
Baby, I've just gotta let you know
I need dough-oh-oh-oh


Take back all your love 'cause
Fake words ain't enough, no
I gave it all, so emotional
But you only care how your money talks
One rose, layin' on your grave 'cause
You pushed everyone away, but
My mausoleum, pretty like Versailles
And I played it out, 'bout a thousand times, yeah

You won't hear my teardrops when they're falling
Engine drowning out the sound, you hear me comin'
Went and got it all, just to prove you wrong
Yeah, you spent my love, didn't spend my money

'Cause I've been fantasizing 'bout a Porsche
Get that dough-oh-oh-oh
I've been kneadin', kneadin' 'til I'm sore, 'til it grow-oh-oh-oh
I've been runnin' 'round now for so long, yeah
It seems that every day and everywhere I go, yeah, I see ya
Baby, I've just gotta let you know
I knead dough-oh-oh-oh

[MØ]
Take back all your love 'cause
Fake words they don't come, no
Yeah, I know your game
And you played it right
Wish I knew before, but my love is blind
One rose, layin' on your grave 'cause
You pushed everyone away, oh
Tell your new lover to enjoy the ride
Pop the Chardonnay, kiss your lips goodbye, yeah

You won't hear my teardrops when they're falling
Engine drowning out the sound, you hear me comin'
Went and got it all, just to prove you wrong
Yeah you spent my love, oh
Didn't spend my money
