I just wanna drink you up
Love, I do
Love, I do
Ooh
I blame it on your love
Love


Every time you get too close I run, I run away
And every time you say the words I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginning, really wish that I could change
I do, I do (I do)
Every time you get too close I run, I run away
And every time you say the words I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginning, really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

Sorry, I'm a little scared
But no one ever really cared
I took you for granted
Just a big misunderstandin'
I just want to spend the night
Fuckin' in your bed tonight
Watch a little TV
I love it when you need me

I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

Sorry, I blame it on your love, yeah
Sorry, I blame it on your love, yeah
I know to blame it on your love, yeah
Sorry, I blame it on your love, yeah
