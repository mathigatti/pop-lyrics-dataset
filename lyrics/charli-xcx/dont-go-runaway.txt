Oh na na

When the world is stalling up
I was only by my way
But I can't go
Cause your lies and I'm lied
And I'm wasted on my way
Then I don't


When you go
I can't take it, won't take it enough
When you're up and down, when you're up and down
Don't go
I can't take it no more when you
When you're up and down, when you're up and down I know
Cause I'm going to runa-runaway, imma go runa-runaway
Imma go long a-long away I don't know I don't know
So when you go
Don't come around, I'm coming down and I, I get it na na na

All in one night
I was only by your side, ye-ah
Just all for life I was only by your
But it ain't, na na

Cause I'm going to go a, go away
I just want to make you make you stay
Cause the world go up and down, go up and down, way out
Go a-, go-away
I just want to make you make you stay
Cause the world
Go up and down, no way, no way

So
When you go
I can't take it, won't take it enough
When you're up and down, when you're up and down
Don't go
I can't take it no more when you
When you're up and down, when you're up and down I know
I'm going to runa-runaway, imma go runa-runaway
Imma go long a-long away I don't know I don't know
So when you go
Don't come around, I'm coming down and I, I get it na na na
