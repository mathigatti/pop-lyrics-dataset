I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down


White pills, empty hotel
Teardrop, standstill
Phone calls, kiss through windows
Whisper, I'm true, burn through
Your palms open up
White pills, white raindrops
Don't choke, I'm here standing still

'Cause I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down

I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
No, I won't let you down

White pills, empty hotel
Good girl, don't tell
I feel like I've been here before
No one to say they hate me, no one at all
She says she couldn't save me
Said she'll never call

'Cause I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down

I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
No, I won't let you down

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
I know, it's so easy to blame me, the blame I take it all
(The blame I take it all)
White pills, empty hotels
I'm not staying strong (I'm not staying strong)
Give it up for you (Give it up for you)
Give it up for me (Give it up for me)
I promise, I'll be fine, but tonight I'm taking three

'Cause I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down

I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
No, I won't let you down
