You're a shot in the dark
And you're dancing in the danger zone
Tearing bits for your heart
I don't care you're not the one I want
We're just playing around
Let's take a chance on our bodies to feel the rush
And when we lay in your bed we're never talking
Cause we only have time to touch


You and me are young and free
We'll run forever
You and me are young and free
Don't need those three words

I'm not in love
I'm just messing around, just wanna live a little
I'm not in love
Wait a minute, I swear I'm never gonna listen
Not now, no no
I'm not in love (hey, hey)
We're just messing around
We're not falling in love, oh oh

Never wanna be bored
Don't wanna spend time with you on my own
Staying under the sun
We gotta fly, let's run away from home
I'm so sick of the TV
And the movies when they all seem to end the same
No I don't wanna keep you in a photograph
Locked in a silver frame

I'm not in love
I'm just messing around, just wanna live a little
I'm not in love
Wait a minute, I swear I'm never gonna listen
Not now, no no
I'm not in love (hey, hey)
We're just messing around
We're not falling in love, oh oh

We don't feel a thing
We don't feel a thing
We don't feel a thing
We're just messing around
We're not falling in love , oh oh

Hey, oh oh
Hey, hey, oh oh
You and me are young and free
We'll run forever
You and me are young and free
Don't need those three words

I'm not in love
I'm just messing around, just wanna live a little
I'm not in love
Wait a minute, I swear I'm never gonna listen
Not now, no no
I'm not in love (hey, hey)
We're just messing around
We're not falling in love, oh oh

We don't feel a thing, oh oh
We're not falling in love, oh oh
We are free
