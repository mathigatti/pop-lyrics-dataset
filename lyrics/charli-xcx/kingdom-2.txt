It's so black
Your kingdom's turned me black
I'm paper and I'm snow
I'm yours but I go slow
I'm lost but not alone
It's so light
The dark burns my eyes
My bones they used to glow
But now I'm throwing stones


I'm losing where to go?
Shadows on my back
Are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride these horses will take flight
Falling high, falling high, do you love?
Shadows in my head
Don't need no light
They still through the night

I found you
My lips are turning blue
The water pulls me down
I'm drown under your sound
This silence brings alive
I look up, your kingdom's like a drug
The chains are made of glass
I'm breaking through the glass
Our memory is not enough

Shadows on my back
Are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride these horses will take flight
Falling high, falling high, do you love?
Shadows in my head
Don't need no light
They still through the night

To every rose with bloody thorn
It lift you up, and lets you fall
To rivers flowing under factory holes
Your kingdom's coming, it's waiting still
This space between you'll never fill
I tried but I could not change your mind

I dance around, and I, lost you now
I breathe you out
I gets you out
But if I could, I'd turn back around
