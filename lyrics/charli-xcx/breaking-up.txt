You said you loved me (I said what?)
You said you loved me (okay, let's rock)
You said you loved me (I said what?)
You said you loved me (okay, let's rock)


You had an ugly tattoo and fucking cheap perfume
You couldn't dance, barely moved, didn't know what to do
You had a friend in a band, but they're not that cool
You said you loved me (okay, let's rock)

Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hated your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do
Breaking up! (Breaking up)
Breaking up! (Breaking up)

You said you loved me (I said what?)
You said you loved me (okay, let's rock)
You said you loved me (I said what?)
You said you loved me (okay, let's rock)

You tried to pull us apart and make a brand new start
You tryna drive me, force me, didn't get very much
You said, "Forever", but, baby, I'm not not so sure
You said you loved me (okay, let's rock)

Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hated your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do

Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hated your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do

Breaking up!
Breaking up!
Breaking up!
Breaking up! (Oh, oh)
Breaking up!
