I just wanna rob all the banks, and burn rubber
Black leather gloves on the wheel, and burn rubber
Roll the windows, hot box, and burn rubber
Twenty-thousand pencils in the bin, I burn rubber
I wanna smell the smoke in the air and burn rubber
People say I'm dread, I don't care, I burn rubber
Please throw some water on yourself, and burn rubber
Begging me to stay, no thanks, I'll burn rubber

Rub-rub-rubba-rubba-rub-rub, burn rubber
