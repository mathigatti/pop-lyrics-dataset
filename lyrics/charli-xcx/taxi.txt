C'mon
C'mon
C'mon
Get in


Blind date on a Tuesday
Bougie restaurant
N-n-n-non starter, didn't have a chance
You're playing twenty-one questions
Baby boy, give up
Got me feeling like Shania (woo!)
That don't impress me much (hey!)

Ay rookie, you're looking
A little bit shaky in the saddle
(Giddy up!)
Admit it, you bit off
A little bit more than you can handle
(Say what?)
I said it, forget it, I've had it
Don't make me cause a scandal
(Woop, woop!)
I'm sorry, but you're not my type
You're going home alone tonight

Boy, you're in over your head
Don't you know you'll be better off without me?
You're gonna wish you were dead
Think it's time that I call you a taxi
4AM, just getting started
Drive fast cars and crash your party
Boy, you're in over your head
Think it's time that I call you a taxi

C'mon, let's call you a taxi
Taxi for one
Taxi for one
C'mon, let's call you a taxi
Let's call you a taxi

Nightclub on a Friday
Get my Gucci on
F-f-f-firestarter
Yes, I'm in the zone
You coming on me like a player
But your game's all wrong
You get your words all twisted
It's the same old song

Ay rookie, you're looking
A little bit shaky in the saddle
(Giddy up!)
Admit it, you bit off
A little bit more than you can handle
(Say what?)
I said it, forget it, I've had it
Don't make me cause a scandal
(Woop, woop!)
I'm sorry, but you're not my type
You're going home alone tonight

Boy, you're in over your head
Don't you know you'll be better off without me?
You're gonna wish you were dead
Think it's time that I call you a taxi
4 A. M., just getting started
Drive fast cars and crash your party
Boy, you're in over your head
Think it's time that I call you a taxi

C'mon, let's call you a taxi
Taxi for one, taxi for one
C'mon, let's call you a taxi
Taxi for one, taxi for one
Taxi for them, taxi for him
Taxi for her, don't talk, get in
Taxi for them, taxi for him
C'mon, let's call you a taxi
