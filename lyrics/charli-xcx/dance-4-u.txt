Under your magic
Under your magic in the night
I twist and turn
But I can never put up a fight
You are like diamonds
You are like diamonds in the night
Ask me a question
You know I’ll do anything, I’m hypnotized


Just stay, just stay awake
Just lay, just lay for me

You know I can’t dance, you know I can’t dance
You know I can’t dance, but you want me to
You know I can’t dance, you know I can’t dance
You know I can’t dance but you like what I do
You know I can’t dance, you know I can’t dance
You know I can’t dance, but you want me to
You know I can’t dance, you know I can’t dance
You know I can’t dance but I’ll dance for you

My body electric
Lost in a hyper fantasy
You give me feeling
The movement of my arms, yeah, it’s happening
Lost all my feelings
I don’t really care who’s watching me
But we’re on a level
That if you don’t know what we do, well, you can just leave

You stay, you stay awake
You lay, you lay for me

You know I can’t dance, you know I can’t dance
You know I can’t dance, but you want me to
You know I can’t dance, you know I can’t dance
You know I can’t dance but you like what I do
You know I can’t dance, you know I can’t dance
You know I can’t dance, but you want me to
You know I can’t dance, you know I can’t dance
You know I can’t dance but I’ll dance for you

Just in, just in, just in, just in, just in,
Just in, just in, just in, just in, just in, just in case
