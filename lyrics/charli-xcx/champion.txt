Gave you my love and my affection all of the time
Thought you were the one
Thought you were the one, but you had to lie
Up in my house, straight to my place
Looking right through my eyes
Thought you were the one
Thought you were the one, but you had to lie, so


I'ma walk away, like a champion
Hold my head up high, like I'm on that throne
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'ma walk away, like a champion
I'm much better off, now I'm on my own
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah

I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah

Four in the morning
Got a groupie calling your phone
Thought I was the one
Thought I was the one, but I'm not alone
Gave you forgiveness
Gave you one thousand second chances
Thought I was the one
Thought I was the one, now I'm going home

I'ma walk away, like a champion
Hold my head up high, like I'm on that throne
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'ma walk away, like a champion
I'm much better off, now I'm on my own
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah

I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah

You were everything, everything to me
I do, anything, anything to be right there
Kissing and touching your body
Laying side by side
My house, watching, watching a movie
You be texting with one of your groupies
Gave you nothing nothing you've ever seen
But you let the love die, so

I'ma walk away, like a champion
Hold my head up high, like I'm on that throne
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
I'ma walk away, like a champion
I'm much better off, now I'm on my own
Made a mess of me in front of everyone
I'm done
I'd rather be, rather be lonely, yeah, lonely, yeah
