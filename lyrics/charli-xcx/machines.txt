I sit up in my room at night
Hold on to my pillow tight
My dreams will be uninvited by something I don’t know


I hear these words in my mind
I don’t know who put them there, but they sure ain’t mine
Who’s inside everyone’s brain?
Cause recently everybody’s been acting all the same
But now I know

Who writes the songs?
The machines do
Who rights the wrongs?
The machines do
Who cuts the bonds?
The machines do

How did they get inside my head?
Making me feel so cold and dead
Your thoughts being captured as well
I’m locked in a trance, I’m under the spell
A feel that has moved over me
They’re squeezing me tight,
There’s never gonna let me breathe
They take my heart and they rip it up
Change it for a broken watch, and now my time is running out
But now I know

Who writes the songs?
The machines do
Who rights the wrongs?
The machines do
Who cuts the bonds?
The machines do

I can feel the tic-tock when I turn my head
I can feel the tic-tock when I lie in bed
I can feel the tic-tock dancing in my brain
I can feel the tic-tock running through my brain
Oh when the tic-tock stops, yeah my body rocks
I close my eyes, I get electric shocks
I feel the metal there in my skin
They’re gonna win

I am, I am, I am
I am a machine
I am, I am, I am
I am a machine

You’re one of me, I’m one of them
Say goodbye to the world, we’re never gonna be the same again
But now I know

Who writes the songs?
The machines do
Who rights the wrongs?
The machines do
Who cuts the bonds?
The machines do
Who rights the wrongs?
The machines do
Who cuts the bonds?
The machines do
Who rights the wrongs?
The machines do
Who cuts the bonds?
The machines do
