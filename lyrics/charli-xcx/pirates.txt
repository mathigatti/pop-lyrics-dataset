I wish I was a pirate
I’d sail the Seven Seas
And when I’d go out sailing
Won’t you come along with me?
Oh, it’ll be grand, grand
We’d sit on the beach
Holding hands in the sand, sand


I wish I was a pirate
With a hat and an eyepatch
And when we’d go out sailing
Yeah, you know we’ll never be captured
By the bad boys
We’d sit on the deck, drinking rum
With the bad boys

Well, Melancholy was my name
And Captain was yours
We’d sail the Seven Seas
And then, we will pull up out of the shores
We’d eat Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream
Play songs on the guitar
We’d take artistic photographs
But we’d never get that far, no

I wish I was a pirate
I’d sail the Seven Seas
And when I’d go out sailing
Won’t you come along with me?
Oh, it’ll be grand, grand
We’d sit on the beach
Holding hands in the sand, sand
