(Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me)
(Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me)


I'll bring the rain
I'll bring the thunder
Best bring your game
Cause you going under

I'll bring the rain
I'll bring the thunder
Best bring your game
Cause you going under

I'll bring the rain
I'll bring the thunder
Best bring your game
Cause you going under

I'll bring the rain
I'll bring the thunder
Best bring your game
Cause you going under

It was a war between the exes
Now it's a war between the sexes
Before I start getting sentimental
I'm gonna have to say my vexes

I wanna shoot you in the fucking face
Get all this shit up out of my place
But I've gotta keep the furniture
Because I want to make it my space

I hope you know you give me nightmares
I see your face in the dark
I hear you whisper in my ear
You know that this is unfair
I'm gonna get you back, boy
I hope you hear this message clear

Don't call me on the telephone
Don't you dare leave a fucking message when you hear the (tone)
And if you do I'll go psycho
But I know you kinda like that

(Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me)
(Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me)
(Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me)
(Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me)

I'll bring the rain
I'll bring the thunder
Best bring your game
Cause you going under

I'll bring the rain
I'll bring the thunder
Best bring your game
Cause you going under

I'll bring the rain
I'll bring the thunder
Best bring your game
Cause you going under

I'll bring the rain
I'll bring the thunder
Best bring your game
Cause you going under

(Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me)
(Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me)
(Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me)
(Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me)
(Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me)
