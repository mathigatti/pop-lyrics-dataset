Runnin’ through the jungle like a lion
Tearin’ straight through the sky
I never really found what I was lookin’ for
Until you and I, oh


You were the lightnin’, but I am the storm
We’re caught in the rain, your heart got torn
Beautiful earthquake, it’s hard to ignore
Do you love me more and more?

I know that I’m hard to love
I’m gettin’ better, I’m gettin’ better
But the ride is worth the rush
When we’re together, when we’re together
And it hurts to know I hurt you so
And took this wrong and turn it back around
You think you’re fine, I know you lie
I’ll make this right
We’ll turn this back around, I’ll try
Yeah, I’ll try

Matches to the map
I kept it burnin’, now the smoke’s in my eyes
I never meant to hurt you
Fix the hourglass, I’m tryna rewind, oh, oh
I’m a volcano and you are the cold
Under the ocean, blue and gold
Pickin’ my roses, your blood on the thorn
Makes you love me more and more

I know that I’m hard to love
I’m gettin’ better, I’m gettin’ better
But the ride is worth the rush
When we’re together, when we’re together
And it hurts to know I hurt you so
And took this wrong and turn it back around
You think you’re fine, I know you lie
I’ll make this right
We’ll turn this back around, I’ll try
Yeah, I’ll try
I’ll try
Yeah, I’ll try
I’ll try

I might speak before I think
I might jump straight through the fire
And you might think I’m crazy
But I’m crazy for you
When I look in your eyes
I know it’s my fault that you don’t trust me
But you’ve got to trust me, baby
And I swear to you, I’ll try
Try, try, try
I’ll try
Try, try, try
I’ll try
Try, try, try
I’ll try
I’ll try, try, try

I know that I’m hard to love
I’m gettin’ better, I’m gettin’ better
But the ride is worth the rush
When we’re together, when we’re together
And it hurts to know I hurt you so
And took this wrong and turn it back around
You think you’re fine, I know you lie
I’ll make this right
We’ll turn this back around, I’ll try
Yeah, I’ll try
I’ll try
Yeah, I’ll try
I’ll try
