I've never felt a love like this before
You touch my hand and I am seeing stars
And I'm so scared you'll leave me all alone, no
'Cause you're the only one that ever feels like home
Oh oh


We collide, like the lightning in the clouds
We collide, like the raindrops falling to the ground
If you cross your eyes, I'll be there, be there, be there, baby
'Cause when we collide, you save me, ah ooh

I feel your body breathing next to me
It's like a tidal wave, it's crashing down on me
I want to understand the words you say
'Cause you're the only one that will take me
You can take me back there now

We collide, like the lightning in the clouds
We collide, like the raindrops falling to the ground
If you cross your eyes, I'll be there, be there, be there, baby
'Cause when we collide, you save me, ah ooh
We collide, like the lightning in the clouds
We collide, like the raindrops falling to the ground
If you cross your eyes, I'll be there, be there, be there, baby
'Cause when we collide, you save me, ah ooh

We will collide, our hearts alive
Love never dies, love never dies
We will collide, our hearts alive
Love never dies, love never dies
We will collide, our hearts alive
Love never dies, love never dies
We will collide, our hearts alive
Love never dies, love never dies
We will collide
