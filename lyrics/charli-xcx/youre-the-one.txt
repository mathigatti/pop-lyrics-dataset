Dancing in the darkness
Pink and lilac
Keep the silence


Crystals on the skyline
Cut the midnight
Ultraviolet

You’re the one that can make me stay
You’re the only one who makes me feel this way
You’re the one that’s been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You’re the one that can turn the page
You’re the one that came along and unlocked the cage
Now I’m dancing in the dark

Flying through the black night
You’re the angel in the moonlight
Running through the thunder
Undercover, silver lover

You’re the one that can make me stay
You’re the only one who makes me feel this way
You’re the one that’s been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You’re the one that can turn the page
You’re the one that came along and unlocked the cage
Now I’m dancing in the dark

You’re the one that can make me stay
You’re the only one who makes me feel this way
You’re the one that’s been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You’re the one that can turn the page
You’re the one that came along and unlocked the cage
Now I’m dancing in the dark

You’re the one that can make me stay
You’re the only one who makes me feel this way
You’re the one that’s been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You’re the one that can turn the page
You’re the one that came along and unlocked the cage
Now I’m dancing in the dark

Yeah I’m dancing in the darkness
Three years before I was feeling so heartless
But your burn shined through
Now I’m drinking love potion when I lay next to you
It’s a criminal feeling
Happiness cries when the tears are dreaming
My body is screaming
I’m staying right here
No, I’ll never be leaving
