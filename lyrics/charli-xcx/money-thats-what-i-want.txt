The best things in life are free
But you can give then to the birds and bees
I want money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want


Your love give me such a thrill
But your love don't pay my bills
I want money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

Money don't get everything, it's true
But what it don't get, I can't use
I want that money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

I want money
Lots of money
Whole lot of money
Give me money
I want that money.
