I was just a little kid, thought you’d teach me how to live
Put my trust in you, but all I got was rules
Don’t get to tell me what to do anymore
Don’t get to tell me how to live anymore


I don’t need it keep my head out of the clouds
Don’t need it keep my feet back on the ground
I’m never buying what you’re selling
To me it’s only make believe

I don’t need a map to find my way back home
Don’t need a book to teach me how to love
Don’t tell me that you know the ending
To me it’s only make believe
