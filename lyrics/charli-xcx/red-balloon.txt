Ah-ooh! If you got troubles let'em go
Let'em soar, so high, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
Ah-ooh! Don't let your worries get to you
Let'em float on by, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon


Monday morning shoot up like a rocket
Yeah the sun is shining keep it in my pocket
Got this golden feeling
Never gonna stop it, just goes on and on
Keep on clapping, join the celebration
Turn the music louder, on my favourite station
Wanna spread my magic all across the nation
Do it all day long

Today I opened my eyes and now I'm so happy and free
I've got my friends by my side
And that's all that matters to me
So come on get up and join in
Cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long

Today I opened my eyes and now I'm so happy and free

Ah-ooh! If you got troubles let'em go
Let'em soar, so high, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
Ah-ooh! Don't let your worries get to you
Let'em float on by high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
So turn it up now! (ah-ooh!)

Bees are buzzing, birds are buzzing dancing
And the trees are humming, birds are singing songs
Don't you see it's lovely?
Life is beautiful and it goes on and on
