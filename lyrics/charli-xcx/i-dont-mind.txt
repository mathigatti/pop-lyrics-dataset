Drop by, anytime
Come fill my head with new lies
I'm here, I'm on the line
You touched my heart, I'm satisfied


These people in bright cities
That we hang with will never face me
Even though they're so much prettier
They never wanna talk to me, please
Treat me kind
I'm by your side
One second with your hands on me
Is enough to make me wanna die

I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind (I don't mind if you make me cry)
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind (I don't mind if you make me cry, I don't mind if you're a waste of time)

I don't mind if you make me cry (I don't mind)
I don't mind if you make me cry, I don't mind if you're a waste of time
I don't mind if you make me cry (I don't mind)
I don't mind if you make me cry, I don't mind if you're a waste of time

Drop by, anytime
