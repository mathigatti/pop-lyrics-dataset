I like-I like-I like, I like
I like-I like-I like, I like-I like, I like
I like-I like-I like


Like your mind, like your smile
Like your eyes, I could die
Aeroplane, you answer by
Singin' songs by jeremih
Party time, hop inside
We're so high, rollercoaster ride
Diamond bright
Kiss me right, yeah
That's so nice (yeah)

I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you

So, oh-oh
Don't you hold me back
'Cause I know, when I known, I don't wanna be alone
Don't you want me back?
'Cause I know when I know I wanna go, oh

I'm not shy, make you sigh
Slip and slide up my thighs
Juicy just like clementines
Sorry if I make you cry
Party time, hop inside
We're so high, rollercoaster ride
Gemini, switching sides
Yeah, that's so nice

I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you

So, oh-oh
Don't you hold me back
'Cause I know, when I known, I don't wanna be alone
Don't you want me back?
'Cause I know when I know I wanna go, oh

I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
Everything about you
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Everything about you
(Everything about you)
Everything about you, baby
(Everything about you)
Everything
