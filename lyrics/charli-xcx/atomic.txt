Ha ha ha ha
Light trips
Sweat drips
Come party in my basement
Man, I'm gonna get you wasted
Just enough for you to taste it


Cash this, get rich
Fill it 'till ya famous
Party in my basement
Just enough for you to taste it

Atomic
Come on people let me through
Atomic
Making ways across the room
Atomic
I got nothing left to lose
Atomic
I'm dropping bombs on you

Night shift, killed it
You won't need no replacement
I'm gonna make a statement
Cause I wanna watch you chase it

Cash flow, down low
Money just like chocolate
I'm gonna make you famous
Come party in my basement

Atomic
Come on people let me through
Atomic
Making ways across the room
Atomic
I got nothing left to lose
Atomic
I'm dropping bombs on you

Can I get you supersized?
Can't you see it in my eyes?
You know I want it that I'm flashing out my downer side
Can I get you supersized?
Can't you see it in my eyes?
You know I want it bad I'm flashing out my dollar signs

Come party in my basement
Come party in my basement
Atomic
Come party in my basement

Atomic
Come on people let me through
Atomic
Making ways across the room
Atomic
I got nothing left to lose
Atomic
I'm dropping bombs on you
