I'm a real live wire
But I don't play games
If they waste my time
I'ma cut them out the frame
When it comes to you
It's like you hold the key
You got the strongest girl acting like she's weak


Come through when you're lonely
I was so stoned out on my street
I know you only want my skin
But still I let you in
You should come through in the daylight
Let me show you how to do right
Promise I'll give you everything
But you've got to let me in

Hit me with your heartbeat
Hit me with your heartbeat
Come on baby put it on me
Gotta give me all or nothing
Hit me with your heartbeat
Hit me with your heartbeat
If you wanna get my something
Gotta give me all or nothing

Making up your mind
It should be easy
Feel you by my side
Then you feel so far away
I just want your love
I would treat you royal
Let me play your queen
And you play king today

Come through when you're lonely
I was so stoned out on my street
I know you only want my skin
But still I let you in
You should come through in the daylight
Let me show you how to do right
Promise I'll give you everything
But you've got to let me in

Hit me with your heartbeat
Hit me with your heartbeat
Come on baby put it on me
Gotta give me all or nothing
Hit me with your heartbeat
Hit me with your heartbeat
If you wanna get my something
Gotta give me all or nothing

I know that we could be forever
But I can't wait, it's now or never
Hit me with your heartbeat, hit me with your heartbeat
(Oh whoa, oh)
(Oh whoa, ah)

Hit me with your heartbeat
Hit me with your heartbeat
Come on baby put it on me
Gotta give me all or nothing (nothing)
Hit me with your heartbeat
Hit me with your heartbeat
If you wanna get my something
Gotta give me all or nothing

Oh, whoa oh, oh whoa ah
Oh, whoa ah
Oh, whoa oh, oh whoa ah
Oh, whoa ah
Hit me with your heartbeat
Hit me with your heartbeat
