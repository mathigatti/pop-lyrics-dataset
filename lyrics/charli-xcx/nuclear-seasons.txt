When you go, please don't leave your love in the Sun
My heart would melt away
In the night with your twisted tongue
When you drop the bomb, I'm blown away


'Cause I refuse to hide in a page of this story
I come out the box, I won't say I'm sorry

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this storm
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

No facing this on my own
'Cause you tasted the blast and it shook your bones
I'm a warrior all alone
In the field of lies, I won't go home

'Cause I'm gonna burn my skin in the blaze of glory
I come out your hands, I won't say I'm sorry

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this storm
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

We survived nuclear seasons
We survived nuclear seasons

I can feel it, I can feel the fear
I can feel it, inside of us all
Inside of us all

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this storm
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
