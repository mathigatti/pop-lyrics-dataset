Life is like a fairground ride
In love and blinded by the lights
Carousel keeps spinning 'round
Faster and faster
But I don't ever want to stop
Don't want to get my bubble popped
I'm losing all reality
I don't care


But now I'm standing on my own
And I'm in someone else's clothes
The darkness is a gaping hole
Keeps going under
Thought this was a good idea
Thought that I could have no fears
My body is in overload
Let me go

Felt like flying
Now I'm crying
But oh, what the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell, what the hell?
Woah-a-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I wish that I had a time machine
Or I could turn up all of the tv screens
I would keep running and running away
Further and further every day
I know I'm on my own
My friends keep trying to call my phone
I told them that I'd never change
I was wrong

Felt like flying
Now I'm crying
But oh, what the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell, what the hell?
Woah-a-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Somebody get me back into reality
Somebody pull me back under
I kinda like it up here in the galaxy
Hiding, I will not be found, found
Tears of crystal fall down from my face
Losing my mind, losing my mind
You got my heart
I'm gone

Felt like flying
Now I'm crying
But oh, what the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell, what the hell?
Woah-a-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

What the hell, what the hell?
What the hell?
What the hell, what the hell?
What the hell, hell?
