Offline, offline
Woho-woohoo, woohoo
Imma take you offline, offline
Woho-woohoo


All I need is loving just like crystalline
Blue and burning
Take me to the other side
You're my cocaine, but I'm never satisfied
I'm so different, and forever on your mind

I'ma take you offline, offline
Woho-woohoo, woho-woohoo
(I'ma take you offline)
I'ma take you offline, offline
Woho-woohoo, woho-woohoo (I'ma take you offline)

Think you got me
Think I'm hanging from your chain
Wild like horses
I'm a touch that can't be tamed
On your deathbed
You'll be screaming out my name
I won't suffer I'll just let you lie in pain

I'ma take you offline, offline
Woho-woohoo, woho-woohoo
I'ma take you offline, offline
Woho-woohoo, woho-woohoo
I'ma take you off- I'ma take you offline, offline
Woho-woohoo, woho-woohoo
I'ma take you offline, offline
Woho-woohoo, woho-woohoo I'ma take you offline

Think I'm so predictable
Watchin' the way that I roll
No one can do what I do Superman, invincible
Ay-ah, ay-ah I don't got nothin' to prove
Bible, the bible, the truth
Fuck it, I know you know
Fuck it, I know you know ay-ah, ay-ah
