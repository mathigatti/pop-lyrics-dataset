You see, a thing about her, she's just a bit too young
I think, personally
I don't really think she's ready
For this kind of commitment yet
But whatever, you know what I mean?
It's your life, isn't it?
Bitch


When you first walked in the room
I had this feeling
You were gonna build me up
And then slowly tear me down
But then I looked behind the framework
And all of the glitz and gleams in your eyes

'Cause your just a bad, bad girl
With no brains inside your head
You keep giving it all this
Talking like you know it
But you don't know shit
'Cause people cringe
When you tell them a crazy fact
The way the words pour out
Don't make you sound all that

'Cause lucy, no one wants you here
Yeah, lucy, no one wants you here
No they don't, no
Yeah, lucy, no one wants you here
'Cause lucy, no one wants you here
Yeah, lucy, no one wants you here
No they don't, no
Yeah, lucy, no one wants you here

The way your were slagging me all
Before you even met me
With your preppy ex-boyfriend
That just wasn't too wise
The way I caught you whispering
And looking me up and down
Subtlety is clearly not your game

'Cause you're a mixed up girl
With no real friends in life
You get mouthy in a second but pipe down
It don't work on me
'Cause people laugh when you get mad
Telling people how to run their lives
Is really quite sad, yeah

'Cause lucy, no one wants you here
Yeah, lucy, no one wants you here, no they don't, no
Yeah, lucy, no one wants you here
'Cause lucy, no one wants you here
Yeah, lucy, no one wants you here, no they don't, no
Yeah, lucy, no one wants you here

I'll do what I want, get out of my way
Don't just stand there, say what you want to say
Get out of my face, 'cause you've got it wrong
Just move along now on your own
Don't get on my nerves, I got my contacts
Don? T try and control me 'cause you'll get knocked back
Back into your place, right where you belong
Lucy, take a good listen to this song, yeah

Lucy, no one wants you here
Lucy, no one wants you here
No they don't want you
Lucy, no one wants you here
Lucy, no one wants you here
Lucy, no one wants you here
Lucy, no one wants you here
No they don't want you
Lucy, no one wants you here
Lucy, no one wants you here
