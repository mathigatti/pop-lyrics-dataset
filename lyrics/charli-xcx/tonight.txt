You stand on
The edge, you're never getting better
Never getting better
So close that you're shaking
Skin is getting wetter
Skin is getting wetter


'Cause I know you thought you'd be fine
It's just one more time
But you've crossed the line, my love
As you start to try to lie still
The dark moods took you
To swallow the pill, my love

'Cause It's like you're on fire
Tonight, you start to cry
It's in the eyes
As your heart starts to burn
Tonight, I see you fly
You're out of time

You gotta start moving slower
But you keep on moving on, and on, and on
And your body's moving over
I can see you float up into the Sun
As you start dropping lower
I see your bones are sinking down, and down
And then you find
The other side

You start to go under
Tell me, can you hear me?
Tell me, can you hear me?
Your lips are so freezing
I can hear you breathing
I can hear you breathing

But you said you were walking through dreams
And watching us scream
You float out of reach, my love
And now the sky starts to turn black
You're under attack
We can't pull you back, my love

'Cause It's like you're on fire
Tonight, you start to cry
It's in the eyes
As your heart starts to burn
Tonight, I see you fly
You're out of time

You gotta start moving slower
But you keep on moving on, and on, and on
As your body's falling over
I can see you floating off into the Sun
As you start dropping lower
I see your bones are sinking down and down
And then you find
The other side

'Cause it's like you're on fire
Tonight, you start to cry
It's in the eyes
As your heart starts to burn
Tonight, and then you find
Your other side
