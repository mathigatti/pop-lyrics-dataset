I was driving on the Autobahn
Having thoughts of the morning


You was chained by
You was chained by
You was chained by
You was chained by lie
You was chained up
You was chained up
You was chained up
An eternal war

When I'm gone let the radio play
I'm gone, but I wanna be there
Fresh hope, and I really don't care
When we fuck we leave the lights on
I'm watching your video play
I know from the minute you stare
To come and my radios blare
That when I'm home you can believe me

I'll be there for you
All we've done, our love be true
Time, it slips away
And there's no other way to say
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you

You were waiting for someone to call
Paralyzed by the wanting

You was chained by
You was chained by
You was chained by
You was chained by lie
You was chained up
You was chained up
You was chained up
An eternal war

I'll be there for you
All we've done, our love be true
Time, it slips away
And there's no other way to say
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you

I'll be there for you
All we've done, our love be true
Time, it slips away
And there's no other way to say
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
