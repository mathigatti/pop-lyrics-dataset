Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again
Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again


Take me out to Chinatown
Come on, let's run these streets in the rain
I want a sugar push, got your candy hooked
I need your bullets back in my brain

I can be your girl
If you need to go
I just wanna blow
Swing me around, pull me into the flames

Bloodshot eyes, I think I'm on my way
I'm so high
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again

Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again
Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again

Lost in lanterns in the sky
Hundreds of sparkles caught in my brain
Oh man, you move so blue, but you look real cool
Oh, don't you know I'm ready to break?

I can be your girl
If you need to go
I just wanna blow
Swing me around, pull me into the flames

Bloodshot eyes, I think I'm on my way
I'm so high
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again

Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again
Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again

Bloodshot eyes, I think I'm on my way
I'm so high, we're cruising into space
Bloodshot eyes, I think I'm on my way
I'm so high
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again

Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again
Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again
