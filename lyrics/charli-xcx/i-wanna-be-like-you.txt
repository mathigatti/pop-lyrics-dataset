I just wanna be cool
Wanna hang around drinking tequila by the swimming pool
Kissing boys, acting a fool
Then roll out with the girls in the car down to Malibu
Man I just wanna be cool
Wanna fit in with your friends at the party where they’re acting rude
Standing around looking real blue
Skipping class, kicking ass, bad grades when I get to school


You’re a mystery
And I just can’t get enough
Yes it’s plain to say I’m addicted to your drug
I love everything you do
Tell me, do you love me too?
Try to hide the lie now I get to tell the truth
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you

Man I just wanna be touched
Wanna listen to your band while you screw me down really rough
Staying up late hide from the Sun
You’re a magazine teen dream I just wanna get some
Man I just wanna be touched
Wanna look as good as you when I’m tripping out and feeling drunk
Breaking hearts, falling through love
O-M-G look at me, thirsty, won’t you fill me up?

You’re a mystery
And I just can’t get enough
Yes it’s plain to say I’m addicted to your drug
I love everything you do
Tell me, do you love me too?
Try to hide the lie now I get to tell the truth
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you

Watching from the sidelines
Holding your hand, looking boy
When you stand you’re so gold
And everyone knows
I’m feeling so rejected
You’ll always be so much better than me
You’re ice cold
You’re out of control

It’s true
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you

Man I just wanna be cool
Wanna dress up like a girl, plastic, see-through
Denim jeans, matching tattoos
Can you please hit me up, can I be part of your crew
Man I just wanna be cool
On my own, friends so late, rather be sat with you
Try my best to impress, always seem to fall through
What the fuck, I look like I’m not what you’re into

You’re a mystery
And I just can’t get enough
Yes it’s plain to say I’m addicted to your drug
I love everything you do
Tell me, do you love me too?
Try to hide the lie now I get to tell the truth
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you
I wanna be like you
