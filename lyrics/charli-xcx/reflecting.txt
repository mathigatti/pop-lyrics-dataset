You're my light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
You're my light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one


We both know but we don't talk about it
Lock it up in our hearts
We wrapped disguises 'round it
This is our secret
On the tip of our tongues
Like a gunshot, can't just kill this
No, no, no, ah
We tryna hide how we feel about it
But in the night you could dream
On repeat in my head
This is our secret
Around in circles we go
Now I'm letting you know I need it
Hello, hello

All this time, I can't believe
You've been here all along reflecting back at me
Eyes were blind but now I see
You've been here all along reflecting back at me

You're my light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
You're my light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one

And when we touch spectrums ultraviolet
Or once it's [?], spectrum blues
I see colours shining
We're feeling perfect
Lucky chance, gonna lose
Now we both know it was worth it
Hello, hello

All this time, I can't believe
You've been here all along reflecting back at me
Eyes were blind but now I see
You've been here all along reflecting back at me

You're my light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
You're my light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one

All this time we've been wasting
Caught up, now we're melting
Gold rush forced into my brain
And now we're reflecting
And I know, and I know, I know, know, know
That we're not letting go, you're locked in my memory
Ey, ey, ey, ey, yeah
All this time we've been wasting
Caught up, now we're melting
Gold rush forced into my brain
And now we're reflecting
And I know, and I know, I know, know, know
We've been blind all along but now we see perfectly
Ey, ey, ey, ey, yeah

All this time, I can't believe
You've been here all along reflecting back at me
Eyes were blind but now I see
You've been here all along reflecting back at me

You're my light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
You're my light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
You're my light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
You're my light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
