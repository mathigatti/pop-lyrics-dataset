We the best and we the baddest
Like you are 21 Savage
I'm the Harry in the Classic, yeah yeah
But we had to go and crash it


Used to think 'bout you 24/7
But then it all stopped
And we promised no fighting
Stay friends, keep it heaven, pure love

Why are you hurting me?
We used to be 100
Now we're enemies
I hate you but I love you
And it's plain to see
We'll dance around in circles
Used to be 100, 100
Used to be

Why are you hurting me?
We used to be 100
Now we're enemies
I hate you but I love you
And it's plain to see
We'll dance around in circles
Used to be 100, 100
Used to be 100

Gotta fight away the feelings
4 A. M., we with the demons
Guess it's all part of the healing, yeah yeah, but
If I kiss you, I'mma mean it

Used to think 'bout you 24/7
But then it all stopped
And we promised no fighting
Stay friends, keep it heaven, pure love

Why are you hurting me?
We used to be 100
Now we're enemies
I hate you but I love you
And it's plain to see
We'll dance around in circles
Used to be 100, 100
Used to be

Why are you hurting me?
We used to be 100
Now we're enemies
I hate you but I love you
And it's plain to see
We'll dance around in circles
Used to be 100, 100
Used to be 100

100, 100
Used to be 100
100, 100
Used to be 100
100, 100
Used to be 100
100, 100
Used to be-

Why are you hurting me?
We used to be 100
Now we're enemies
I hate you but I love you
And it's plain to see
We'll dance around in circles
Used to be 100, 100
Used to be

Why are you hurting me?
We used to be 100
Now we're enemies
I hate you but I love you
And it's plain to see
We'll dance around in circles
Used to be 100, 100
Used to be 100
