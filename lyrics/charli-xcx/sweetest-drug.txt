Put it on the line
Tell you how I'm feeling
Always on my mind
Even when I'm dreaming


Heart is beating faster
Walking on the ceiling
Keep on moving closer, closer
Give it to me, uh, yeah

One hit baby and I'm yours
Ha ha, ha ha
So sick make me lose control
Wooh-uh-oh-wooh
I'm hooked now I want some more
Ha ha, ha ha
Too much, gonna overdose
Wooh-uh-oh-wooh

'Cause your love taking me high
I wanna be your girl
Taste like lemonade slice pooring into my world
Got to jump on the ride
My rollercoaster
I can't give up
This wait is dread
Oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no

When you call my phone (when you call my phone)
I was gonna answer (I was gonna answer)
I want you in my zone (I want you in my zone)
I want you in the shower (I want you in the shower)
Every single second (every single second)
Every single hour (every single hour)
Keep me coming over and over (yeah)
Give it to me, uh, yeah

One hit baby and I'm yours
Ha ha, ha ha
So sick make me lose control
Wooh-uh-oh-wooh
I'm hooked now I want some more
Ha ha, ha ha
Too much, gonna overdose
Wooh-uh-oh-wooh

'Cause your love taking me high
I wanna be your girl
Taste like lemonade slice pooring into my world
Got to jump on the ride
My rollercoaster
I can't give up
This wait is dread
Oh no no no no no no (no, no)
(You're the sweetest the drug, you're the sweetest the drug, like)
Oh no no no no no no (no, no)
(You're the sweetest the drug, you're the sweetest the drug, like)
Oh no no no no no no (no, no)
(You're the sweetest the drug, you're the sweetest the drug, like)
Oh no no no no no no (no, no)
(You're the sweetest the drug, you're the sweetest the drug, like)
