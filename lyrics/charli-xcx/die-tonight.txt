Oh, I could die tonight
Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight


Let's get it started
Poolside at the party
Rolling Stones on my phone
Hanging in your bedroom, feeling like we're rock 'n' roll
End of the summer
Up and down with lovers
Laying under stars that shine
Hold up our palms now, don't you know that it's our time?

Oh, I could die tonight
Cause I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying til the sun comes up
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight

Back at the hotel
Ringing off the doorbells
Now we're feeling so alive
Climb to the top floor, jumpin' like we're 'bout to fly
No one's leaving
'Bout to blow the ceiling
When we turn it up to ten
Wake up in the morning, gonna do it all again

Oh, I could die tonight
Cause I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying til the sun comes up
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight

Oh, I could die tonight
Cause I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying til the sun comes up
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
(Die tonight)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
(Die tonight)
