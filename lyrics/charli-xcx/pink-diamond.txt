I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard

I just wanna go real hard
Lip gloss on and I'm lookin' like a star
Got a tiny bag, but I got a big heart
On the video chat, cute skirt and a bra
I'm feeling so fine, kinda feelin' like a slut
Gonna give you good views, watch me with the uck
I'm really so rare, I'm sent from above
Wish you could come 'round, pick me up in your car, yeah

I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard (real hard)
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard

I just wanna go real hard for days (days)
I just wanna feel in different ways (ways)
Every single night kinda feels the same
I'm a pink diamond, I need space
I'm online and I'm feeling so glamorous (ah)
Watch me shine for the boys and the cameras (hey)
In real life, could the club even handle us? (Uh)
In real life, could the club even handle us?

I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard (real hard)
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard, yeah

Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard

Pink diamond in the dark
