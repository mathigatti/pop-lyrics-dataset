Okay, okay
I'm gonna be
Okay, okay
Already said
What I wanna say
I never needed you anyway


I used to think that you would be the only one
The only one that turned me on when lights go out
I used to think that you would be the only one
But now I know I'm better better off without you

I don't need your love
I don't
I don't need your love
'Cause I'm feeling, feeling, feeling like a million bucks
I don't need your love
I don't
I don't need your love

'Cause I'm feeling, feeling like a million bucks
Love can be such a bitch
Without you I'm so rich
I don't need your love
I don't
I don't need your love
'Cause I'm feeling, feeling, feeling like a million bucks

Alright, alright
Can't wait to go
Out at night
With someone new
By my side
Somebody who knows
What I like

I used to think that you would be the only one
The only one that turned me on when lights go out
I used to think that you would be the only one
But now I know I'm better better off without you

I don't need your love
I don't
I don't need your love
'Cause I'm feeling, feeling, feeling like a million bucks
I don't need your love
I don't
I don't need your love

'Cause I'm feeling, feeling like a million bucks
Love can be such a bitch
Without you I'm so rich
I don't need your love
I don't
I don't need your love
'Cause I'm feeling, feeling, feeling like a million bucks

I'm stacking it up
You see me
I'm killing it
Hundreds on hundreds
No, you're never getting this
I'm stacking it up
You see me
I'm killing it (oh no)
Hundreds on hundreds, on hundreds
No

I don't need your love
I don't
I don't need your love
'Cause I'm feeling, feeling, feeling like a million bucks
I don't need your love
I don't
I don't need your love

'Cause I'm feeling, feeling like a million bucks
Love can be such a bitch
Without you I'm so rich
I don't need your love
I don't
I don't need your love
'Cause I'm feeling, feeling, feeling like a million bucks
