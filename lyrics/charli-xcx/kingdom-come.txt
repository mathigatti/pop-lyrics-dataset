I, I wanna wake up in the morning Sun
Open my eyes, my life is just begun
I, I'll be ready when my kingdom come
I'm letting go of all the things I've done


I, I wanna wake up in the morning Sun
Open my eyes, my life is just begun
I, I'll be ready when my kingdom come
I'm letting go of all the things I've done

As long as we're together
We gon' do this thing forever
It's true, with you
As long as we're together
We gon' do this thing forever
It's true, with you

Swinging like a tree
Baby you and me, me, me
It's a fantasy
Stuck inside a dream, dream, dream
Pack up all my things, you are all I need, need, need
Just you
I always believe you will never leave, leave, leave
Baby we're a team
You are stuck with me, me, me
Hand inside my jeans, like we're in the sheet, sheets
Just you

I, I wanna wake up in the morning Sun
Open my eyes, my life is just begun
I, I'll be ready when my kingdom come
I'm letting go of all the things I've done

I, I wanna wake up in the morning Sun
Open my eyes, my life is just begun
I, I'll be ready when my kingdom come
I'm letting go of all the things I've done

Now some believe in Jesus
But I believe in us
It's true, with you
Now some believe in Jesus
But I believe in us
It's true, with you

Swinging like a tree
Baby you and me, me, me
It's a fantasy
Stuck inside a dream, dream, dream
Pack up all my things, you are all I need, need, need
Just you
I always believe you will never leave, leave, leave
Baby we're a team
You are stuck with me, me, me
Hand inside my jeans, like we're in the sheet, sheets
Just you
