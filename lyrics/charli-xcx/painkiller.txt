Daze got you locked up in a coma
Some days, got you switchin' your persona
Work hard, they should give you a diploma
Work hard, let me, let me


All night, I can do it like you wanna
All night, baby I'll be the conductor
Lay back, if you want, I'll put you under
Lay back, let me, let me

Let me be your painkiller
Let me be your painkiller, killer
(Let me be your) painkiller
Let me be your painkiller, killer

So good, yeah I know that you addicted
So good, like you're bad, gettin' convicted
You're high, zero gravity, you're trippin'
You're mine, let me, let me

No one does it better than what I do
No one else can even get a preview
You're high, got you looking at the best view
You're mine, let me, let me

(Let me be your) painkiller
Let me be your painkiller, killer
Let me be your painkiller
Let me be your painkiller, killer
