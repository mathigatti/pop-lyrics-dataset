Ohh
Over it, had to kiss the stars goodbye
He was low and I was high
Popping valiums on valentines


If he just gave you
When you want trampoline
If you be in the penthouse your mezzanine (woah-ohh)
Then you just gotta tell him catch my level 
You gotta look him in the eye
Middle finger to the sky and say

I was countin' my big stacks
But you were tryna hold me back
-Pedal to the metal I come back with
Over it, maybe you just want my time
