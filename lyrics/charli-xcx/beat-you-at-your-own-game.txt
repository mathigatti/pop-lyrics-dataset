Rolling the dice
My lucky number 'bout to show up
Never think twice
You are the target, 'bout to blow up
I’m on my knees
Think you got me, baby
Revenge is sweet
Come and taste this, uh oh


Baby sit down, let me get your chair
Play your cards right, you’ll win my heart
Thought I knew you, but you’re not so fair
Heard you once, [?] drinking me no more

Tell me that you love me, tell me that you hate me
I don’t care what you have to say
Tell me that you love me, tell me that you hate me
I can beat you at your own game
Beat you, beat you, beat you at your own game
Beat you, beat you, beat you at your own game
Beat you, beat you, beat you at your own game
I can beat you at your own game

Breaking the rules
I’m like an angel with a shotgun
Keeping my cool
I got you hooked, yeah it’s a home run
You're on your knees
Now I got you baby
Revenge is sweet
Come and taste this, oh, oh

Baby sit down, let me get your chair
Play your cards right, you’ll win my heart
Thought I knew you, but you’re not so fair
Heard you once, [?] drinking me no more

Tell me that you love me, tell me that you hate me
I don’t care what you have to say
Tell me that you love me, tell me that you hate me
I can beat you at your own game
Beat you, beat you, beat you at your own game
Beat you, beat you, beat you at your own game
Beat you, beat you, beat you at your own game
I can beat you at your own game

Now I'm gonna make you bow, bow
Please just shut your mouth, mouth
Knock it back, swallowed it right down, down
Hand me over that crown

Baby sit down, let me get your chair
Play your cards right, you’ll win my heart
Thought I knew you, but you’re not so fair
Heard you once, [?] drinking me no [?]

Tell me that you love me, tell me that you hate me
I don’t care what you have to say
Tell me that you love me, tell me that you hate me
I can beat you at your own game
Beat you, beat you, beat you at your own game
Beat you, beat you, beat you at your own game
Beat you, beat you, beat you at your own game
I can beat you at your own game

I can beat you at your own game
I can beat you at your own game
