[Charli XCX]
Built a world
All in my mind
All on my own
Will I survive? Oh
Century of tears
Sadness was my only smile 
Thought I'd fall apart
But you're gone and I'm doing fine (I'm screaming out)


We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
And I'll finally cross you out
We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
And I'll finally cross you out

[Sky Ferreira]
Mowed me down
One piece at a time
I see his eyes were shut
How was he mesmerized? (no!)
Century of tears
Sadness was another denial
Thought it fell apart
But now you've got him thrown behind (I'm screaming out)

[Charli XCX]
We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
And I'll finally cross you out

We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
And I'll finally cross you out

[Charli XCX &amp; Sky Ferreira]
I've become someone better
I've become someone better
Now I look in the mirror
And I learn I'm so better
I've become someone better
I've become someone better
Now I look in the mirror
Feels so good to forget ya

[Charli XCX]
We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
And I'll finally cross you out

We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
And I'll finally cross you out

We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
We are not around when you're not around
And I'll finally cross you out
