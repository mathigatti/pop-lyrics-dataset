You think I fly, but I like to crash and burn
I guess I'll just never learn
I'll never learn how to keep my cool
I try not to lose my head, but I just go black to red
I'm back to red now


I'm trembling, I-I-I'm trembling
I'm not listening, I-I-I'm trembling

Watched my hands curl into fists
Your name just went on my list
I won't say I'm sorry
I won't say I'm sorry
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah-woah

Don't help me out if you think I'm struggling
'Cause I know you're wondering, you're wondering why
I bleed so blue 'cause I put my heart on ice
More bitter with every bite, with every bite
(You)

I'm trembling (you, you), I'm trembling
I, not listening (you, you), I'm trembling

Watched my hands curl into fists
Your name just went on my list
I won't say I'm sorry
I won't say I'm sorry
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah-woah

I'm explosive, just like a bomb in the boot of your car
I'm acid, I'm corrosive
Let me rot away, rot away
I can't stop this
Just like a bike with the brakes turned off
You know, I keep on rolling
Let me ride away, ride away

Watched my hands curl into fists
Your name just went on my list
I won't say I'm sorry
I won't say I'm sorry
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah-woah
Watched my hands curl into fists
Your name just went on my list
I won't say I'm sorry
I won't say I'm sorry
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah-woah
