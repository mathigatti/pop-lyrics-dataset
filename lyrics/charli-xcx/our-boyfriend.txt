Did he tell you you're the only one?
Did you introduce him to your mum?
I bet Boys of Summer is your favourite song (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, me too
Did you lap up all the clich√©d lies?
A book of poems on The Northern Line (oh)
Did you wonder where he went some nights? (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, me too


I know it's out of the blue
But I've got something to tell you

My boyfriend is your boyfriend
At the same time, at the same time
He fooled me and he fooled you
With the same lies, at the same time
Let's make a pact that we never go back
He don't deserve me or you
'Cause my boyfriend is your boyfriend too

It's kind of funny when you think of it
There must have been some times we almost met, I know
Jumpin' in and out of the same bed (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, me too
Same sleazy weekend in a slick hotel
Locked our love on the Paris bridge as well
Said he loved me from the day we met (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, you too

I know it's hard to believe
I've been thinking the same thing

My boyfriend is your boyfriend
At the same time, at the same time
He fooled me and he fooled you
With the same lies, at the same time
Let's make a pact that we never go back
He don't deserve me or you
'Cause my boyfriend is your boyfriend too

(Shared the love we made)
Oh
(Made the same mistakes)
I know how you feel
(I feel just the same as)
Same as
(You) You
I feel so stupid that I couldn't see
I never thought that this would happen to me

My boyfriend is your boyfriend
At the same time, at the same time
He fooled me and he fooled you
With the same lies, at the same time
Let's make a pact that we never go back
He don't deserve me or you
'Cause my boyfriend is your boyfriend too
