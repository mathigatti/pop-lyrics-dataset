I know I messed up
And I was wrong
I thought it over and over for so long
I know you hate me
But can’t you see
I made some changes


I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Oh, baby, it’s true
I wanna be with you
(You)

I wanna be real
I wanna be more
I know I must love
And this time I’m sure, ooh
I wanna be with you

Everything I did
Makes no sense
Always listen to the voices in my head
I know it’s long gone
But let me try
I need you near me

I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Oh, baby, it’s true
I wanna be with you
(You)

I wanna be real
I wanna be more
I know I must love
And this time I’m sure, ooh
I wanna be with you

I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you

I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Oh, baby, it’s true
I wanna be with
I wanna be with
I wanna be with you

I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Oh, baby, it’s true
I wanna be with
I wanna be with
I wanna be with you

(I wanna be with you)
