Wake up one morning and your hair's all over the shop
What happened last night?
Well, the only person who knows is the person lying next to you
Get out of my bed, and you scream at your reflection
Same old, same old, it's just a difficult day, it's going ahead again


But oh, boy, why don't you get some variation
Oh, boy, just have a retaliation
Oh, boy, just get some motivation
'Cause your friends are all out getting drunk
Whilst you're sitting at home having no fun

Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Why don't we go for a ride?
Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Backcomb your hair
Tie up your shoes
We're gonna go to town
Come on, take my camera, you got nothing to lose

Scream and shout, all your friends do it too
Come on, what you waiting for?
I told you fool, you got nothing to lose

Oh, boy, you're seeming so much better
Since I posted you on your rent less a day
Oh, boy, you know all the girls are jealous of you
And they're polishing their poms with
The ra-ra skirts and the polka-dots
Just to try to impress you

Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Why don't we go for a ride?
Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Oh now, you're getting too good for me
Oh now, you're getting too good for me
Oh now, you're getting too good for me

See, you know my lineup and my backstage passes
But then you say
'Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Why don't we go for a ride?
Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Oh'
