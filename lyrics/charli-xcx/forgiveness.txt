I can change, I can change
I will try every day
I do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?
Fucked this up in front of everyone


I can change, I can change
I will try every day
I do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?

I'm so cold
I'm the bad bitch, yo
Heart got froze
Don't trust those bros
Feel my love up high
And protect the price
Love inside my eyes
Don't trust those guys

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
I do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?
Fucked this up in front of everyone

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
I do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?
Fucked this up in front of everyone

I can change, I can change
I will try every day
I do my best, are you impressed?
Or are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with forgiveness?
Are you not down with what I've done?

Sorry that my body like ice
Super hot supply, never gonna faze me
Sorry that my ice is so low
Queen bitch pro, vision so hazy
You keep on trying to break me down
But my will stays high
It's protection likes crazy
Sorry that I love you so
I tried to change but it's so hard

And it's so hard, baby
