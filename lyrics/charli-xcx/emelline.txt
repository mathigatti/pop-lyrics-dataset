Emelline? Emelline, haha
Emelline


Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)

Get tipsy, tricksy, Dixie
Burning colors in your brain
Emelline just ruled the world, and it won't be the same
Unknot your lips, embrace the trips
And tend after your tails
Or tie me to the kitchen chair if all else fails
Acoustic treats, sadistic beats
Get your shoes, move your feet
Emelline, you're running out of time to impress
Take off your dress and let them look at the scars
From when you met the stars in the backseat of your car

Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)

I know you lie, Emelline, with your lips
Standing like a dollar glass around your neck
Just cover it up
Put on your spectacles and be a good girl like mommy said
Don't let the pills affect your head
Keep your eyes wide and secretly smile
And everybody will try to connect with you and adapt to you
They'll want to dance with you
They'll have to crawl across the room just to get to you, wow!

Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)

Emelline
Emelline, Emelline
Emelline, Emelline (woo!)
You've got your Emelline
I've got an Emelline
You've got your Emelline
I want you, Emelline

Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)

Emelline, haha uh
