First things first, I'm the realest
Drop this and let the whole world feel it
And I'm still in the murda bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm givin' lessons in physics
You should want a bad bitch like this
Drop it low and pick it up just like this


Cup of ace, cup of goose, cup of cris
High heels, somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist
Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spillin', you should taste that

I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From L.A. to tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold
Remember my name, 'bout to blow

I said baby, I do this, I thought that, you knew this
Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, they speak it, depart it
Swagger on super, I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline!
And swear I meant that there so much
that they give that line a rewind

So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be that I-g-g-y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw

I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From L.A. to tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold
Remember my name, 'bout to blow

Trash the hotel
Let's get drunk on the mini bar
Make the phone call
Feels so good getting what I want
Keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah Iâ€™m deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch

Still stunting, how you love that
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at that I bet you wishing you could clutch that
Just the way you like it, huh?
You're so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?
Never turn down money, slayin' these hoes
Gold trigger on the gun like

I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From L.A. to tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold
Remember my name, 'bout to blow

Who that? Who that? I-g-g-y
That do that, do that? I-g-g-y
Who that? Who that? I-g-g-y
(Blow)
