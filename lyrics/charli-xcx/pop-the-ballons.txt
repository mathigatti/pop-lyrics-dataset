Where you at?
Call your phone
Sitting here, all alone
Hand around a champagne glass (Oh well!)
Guess I'm gonna get real trashed
People here turn me off
Picky boys, shut up
Tick-tock, ticking like I'm a time bomb
Houston, now we got a problem


Oh, whoa, wh-oa-oa
My head, it goes 'round, 'round, 'round
I'm about to wild out, out, out

I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Bitch with a bad attitude (So what?)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Fuck everyone in the room (Fuck you!)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
It's not a party, it's not a party without you

Na, na na, nana na na
Na, na na, nana na na
Yeah, yeah, yeah, na na na
It's not a party, it's not a party without you

Tryin' hard to keep my cool
Hurry up, fuck are you?
Don't you remember last weekend?
Turn up until 6 AM

Oh, whoa, wh-oa-oa
My head, it goes 'round, 'round, 'round
I'm about to wild out, out, out
Oh, whoa, wh-oa-oa
A trigger, pull it like pow, pow, pow
It's about to go down, down, down

I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Bitch with a bad attitude (So what?)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Fuck everyone in the room (Fuck you!)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
It's not a party, it's not a party without you

Na, na na, nana na na
Na, na na, nana na na
Yeah, yeah, yeah, na na na
Yeah, yeah, yeah, na na na
Na, na na, nana na na
Na, na na, nana na na
Yeah, yeah, yeah, na na na
It's not a party, it's not a party without-

Liquor in my bloodstream
Now I'm gettin' so deep
Sinkin' in the swimming pool
My body's bruised and I'm a fool for you
Forget about it
I'ma work it out here
Wait a second, fuck that
I'm a brat, I'ma take this party back
Blow you up, dynamite
Hol' up, we go all night

I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Bitch with a bad attitude (So what?)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Fuck everyone in the room (Fuck you!)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
It's not a party, it's not a party without-
I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Bitch with a bad attitude (So what?)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
I wanna pop the balloons (Pop!)
Fuck everyone in the room (Fuck you!)
Oh woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
It's not a party, it's not a party without you

Na, na na, nana na na
Na, na na, nana na na
Yeah, yeah, yeah, na na na
Yeah, yeah, yeah, na na na
Na, na na, nana na na
Na, na na, nana na na
Yeah, yeah, yeah, na na na
It's not a party, it's not a party without you
