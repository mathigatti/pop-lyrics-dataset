All alone on the city high
In New York and death of night
We come swimm and we're about to jump
All alone in the famous town


We always knew we never would survive
Protect all us are higher in the night
We on the way, on the way out
We on the way, on the way out (on the way out, way out)

No oxygen left in our hearts
Goin' down and we felt the pain
But we lookin' cool sinking in the chain
We feel the same as we fall apart

I was in the blue and the lights behind us
Shot us in the back but keep on ridin'
I don't wanna go where the lights is blinding

We always knew we'll never will survive (survive)
Protect all us were higher in the night
We on the way, on the way out
We on the way, on the way out (on the way out, way out)

We always knew we never would survive (survive)
Protect all us are higher in the night
We on the way, on the way out
We on the way, on the way out (on the way out, way out)

All alone on the city high
In New York and death of night
