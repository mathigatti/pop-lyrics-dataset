I got no time for regrets
That's what I say to my friends
I tell them I'm okay, don't know what I'm hiding
I promise I got my head straight, I swear
Think I'm going under, running from the thunder
Don't wanna blow my cover, no way


So I'll throw back bottles, bottles, bottles
When I'm feeling low
Wanna drown away my sorrows, sorrows, sorrows
Wanna lose my mind
Don't think about tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

Gonna close my eyes and float away
Cause nothing feels better than a sweet escape
So I'll throw back bottles, bottles, bottles
When I'm feeling low

Wanna drown away my sorrows, sorrows, sorrows
Wanna lose my mind
Don't think about tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Gonna close my eyes and float away
Cause nothing feels better than a sweet escape

I'm hanging right on the edge
(Right on the edge, I'm right on the hedge)
I got to stop playing pretend
(Playing pretend you got to stop, got to stop)
Think I need a doctor, or maybe just a lover
Someone who can comfort my brain
I always try to fight it but I can't deny it
I guess I'm gonna [?] on the pain

So I'll throw back bottles, bottles, bottles
When I'm feeling low
Wanna drown away my sorrows, sorrows, sorrows
Wanna lose my mind
Don't think about tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

Gonna close my eyes and float away
Cause nothing feels better than a sweet escape

So I'll throw back bottles, bottles, bottles
When I'm feeling low
Wanna drown away my sorrows, sorrows, sorrows
Wanna lose my mind
Don't think about tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Gonna close my eyes and float away
Cause nothing feels better than a sweet escape

Oh na na na oh
Oh na na na hey
Oh na na na oh
Let's do it all again, let's do it all again

Oh na na na oh
Oh na na na oh
Oh na na na oh
Let's do it all again, let's do it all again
I got no time for regrets

Cause I'll throw back bottles, bottles, bottles
When I'm feeling low
Wanna drown away my sorrows, sorrows, sorrows
Wanna lose my mind
Don't think about tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Gonna close my eyes and float away
Cause nothing feels better than a sweet escape

Oh na na na oh
Oh na na na hey
Oh na na na oh
Bottles, bottles, bottles
Let's do it all again, let's do it all again

Oh na na na oh
Oh na na na hey
Oh na na na oh
Bottles, bottles, bottles
Let's do it all again, let's do it all again
