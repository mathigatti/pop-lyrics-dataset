(Come on, make it rain)
(Come on, make it pour)


I’m a zephyr in a silent city
Get you high, I’m tastin’ really pretty
I’m a catch, you’re the one that I want
Sip this drink and lose your inhibition
Lookin’ good, I’m like an exhibition
I break the ice, I’ma give you it all

Tell me what you like
Why you actin’ so shy?
You can take your time

Come on over and spend it
Come on over and spend it, spend it
Come on over and spend it
Come on over and spend it, spend it

Come on over and spend it
(Come on, make it rain)
Come on over and spend it, spend it
(Come on, make it pour)
Come on over and spend it
(Shower me in love)
Come on over and spend it, spend it
(Like a waterfall)

I make you float, you’re on another level
I breathe you in, you are my heavy metal
I let you come, but I won’t let you go
Swimmin’ deep, we’re drownin’ in the ocean
This is real, this is our devotion
I let you rise, but I won’t let you fall

Tell me what you like
Why you actin’ so shy?
You can take your time

Come on over and spend it
Come on over and spend it, spend it
Come on over and spend it
Come on over and spend it, spend it

Come on over and spend it
(Come on, make it rain)
Come on over and spend it, spend it
(Come on, make it pour)
Come on over and spend it
(Shower me in love)
Come on over and spend it, spend it
(Like a waterfall)

Just lay me body down (Like a waterfall)
Lay my body down, down and let it float
Lay my body down (Like a waterfall)
Just lay me body down (Like a waterfall)
Lay my body down, down and let it float
Lay my body down (Like a waterfall)

Come on over and spend it
(Come on, make it rain)
Come on over and spend it, spend it
(Come on, make it pour)
Come on over and spend it
(Shower me in love)
Come on over and spend it, spend it
(Like a waterfall)

Come on over and spend it
(Come on, make it rain)
Come on over and spend it, spend it
(Come on, make it pour)
Come on over and spend it
(Shower me in love)
Come on over and spend it, spend it
(Like a waterfall)

(Come on, make it rain)
(Come on, make it pour)
Come on, make it pour
(Shower me in love)
(Like a waterfall)
Like a waterfall

(Come on, make it rain)
Come on, make it rain
(Come on, make it pour)
Make it pour
(Shower me in love)
Shower me in love
(Like a waterfall)
