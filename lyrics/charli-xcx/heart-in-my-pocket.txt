You don't ever use your swimming pool
'Cause you're drowning in green bills
I don't care about the things you do
I just wanna love for real


Once underneath is the key
Quit your masquerading
If you wanna get it right
Show me the person behind all the money making
If you want me for life

Keep your dollar signs
Don't need expensive things
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket, tonight, ooh
Please don't waste my time (my time)
Don't buy me diamond rings
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket, tonight, ooh

Give me your heart in my pocket
Give me your heart, heart
Give me your heart in my pocket
Give me your heart, heart

See you dripping in designer clothes
But now I wanna see some skin
So much ice up on your wrist, you froze
Open up and let me in

Once underneath is the key
Quit your masquerading
If you wanna get it right
Show me the person behind all the money making
If you want me for life

Keep your dollar signs
Don't need expensive things
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket, tonight, ooh
Please don't waste my time (my time)
Don't buy me diamond rings
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket, tonight, ooh

Don't need Bentleys, chauffeur, sightseeing
New York vacay, five star lux dream
Just need your love, your kiss, your touch
You are my drug, let's go deep you make me pop, ooh

Keep your dollar signs
Don't need expensive things
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket, tonight, ooh
Please don't waste my time (my time)
Don't buy me diamond rings
Just give me your heart in my pocket
Heart in my pocket, tonight, ooh

Give me your heart in my pocket
Give me your heart, heart
Give me your heart in my pocket
Give me your heart, heart
