I love you
It's obvious but people can change
We got bruised
We left things undecided and now we're two people
Standing in the city rain
We're brand new
We turn our backs and walk away


Even though we're through
I'm always here for you
I know you feel it too
I'm telling you the truth

Some nights, I go back there
Right back where we used to love
Think I messed up somewhere
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know why I keep running
Don't know why I keep running

So far
I'm on the other side of the globe
With new friends
With someone else asleep in the sheets
But I got you‚ yeah
Locked up in a part of my brain
Forever
(Yeah)
I can't forget my memories
Oh no

Even though we're through
I'm always here for you
I know you feel it too
I'm telling you the truth

Some nights‚ I go back there
Right back where we used to love
Think I messed up somewhere
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know why I keep running
Don't know why I keep running

Sometimes‚ I miss you when I'm all alone
And even though we both moved on
Sometimes I play your favourite song
I play it on and on and I
I miss you when I'm all alone
And even though we both moved on
Sometimes I play your favourite song
I play it on and on and on

Don't know what I keep running from
(All I know, all I know)
Don't know what I keep running from
(All I know, all I know)
Don't know why I keep running
(I miss you‚ I miss you, I miss you)
Don't know what I keep running from
(I miss you, I miss you‚ I miss you)
Don't know why I keep running
(I miss you, I miss you, I miss you)
Don't know why I keep running
