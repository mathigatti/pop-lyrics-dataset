Visions in the past
Too real, it's right from the start
Tearing up your heart
You and I, we really went dark


Voices tell me hold on
So I kiss him, pullin' me close, so close
Grippin' to you so hard
So I kiss him, pullin' me close, so close, but

I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all so bright
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all the time
I see you
Visions comin' every night
You can call me so crazy, following that light
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, and it looks so right
I see you

Can't you try to feel?
Never seen the future so real
But maybe I'm just fantasizing
Finally think I'm realizing

All these voices tell me hold on
So I kiss him, pullin' me close, so close
Grippin' to you so hard
So I kiss him, pullin' me close, so close, but

I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all so bright
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all the time
Visions comin' every night
You can call me so crazy, following that light
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind

I got pictures in my mind
I got pictures in my mind
I got pictures in my mind
