Hello

I'm so bored (woo)
Wake up late, eat some cereal
Try my best to be physical
Lose myself in a TV show
Staring out to oblivion
All my friends are invisible
Twenty-four seven, miss 'em all
I might cry like a waterfall
I feel afraid when I feel alone, yeah, uh
Have sex, me and my romeo
He says I'm irresistible
I'm gassed up like I'm texaco
I ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride it
Sometimes, I feel okay, some days, I'm so frightened


I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
I sleep, wanna wake up brand new
I sleep, wanna wake up with you (you)
I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
Finally, when it's over
We might be even closer, uh, uh

Uh, uh, uh, uh
These days exhausting
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Go online shopping
I'm so uninspired, I just wanna breathe
Flowers and the trees, dirt all on my knees
Got some hands to hold on to
I get existential and so strange
I hear no sounds when I'm shouting
I just wanna go to parties
Up high, wanna feel the heat from all the bodies

I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
I sleep, wanna wake up brand new
I sleep, wanna wake up with you (you)
I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
Finally, when it's over
We might be even closer, uh, uh

We might, we might, we might, we might, we might
We might, we might, we might, we might, we might
We might, we might, we might, we might, we might
Yeah

I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
I sleep, wanna wake up brand new
I sleep, wanna wake up with you (you)
I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
Finally, when it's over
We might be even closer, uh, uh
