Electric lights
Blow my mind
But I feel alright


And never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die

You catch my eye
If, you wanna fly
I'm so alive

Never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Go into the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Go into the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

I'm such a star
Queen boulevard
Blaze through the dark

And never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Go into the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up

And never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Go into the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
