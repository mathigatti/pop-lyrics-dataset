I always get it wrong
I leave the ones I love
There’s something in my brain
That pushes you away
I wish I could rewind
And live a moment twice
I threw it all away
But I still feel the same


Don’t leave me now, don’t leave me now
I need you to stay
I’m fallin’ down, I’m fallin’ down
I’m broken and bent
Don’t leave me now, don’t leave me now
I promise I’ll change, I’ll do anything
Don’t throw me away

People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
Photographs turn old and dusty
Roses rot, but memories never fade
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

I think about your heart
And how I broke it up
I always will regret
The secrets that I kept

Don’t leave me now, don’t leave me now
I need you to stay
I’m fallin’ down, I’m fallin’ down
I’m broken and bent
Don’t leave me now, don’t leave me now
I promise I’ll change, I’ll do anything
Don’t throw me away

People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
Photographs turn old and dusty
Roses rot, but memories never fade
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh
Ahh-ahh-ohh-ohh
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

I think about your heart
And how I broke it up
I always will regret
The secrets that I kept
I'm sorry that I lied
I never tried to fight
Don't get no second chance
I really wish I'd say
