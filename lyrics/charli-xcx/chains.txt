You got a blue heart
You got magic hands
You blow me candy kisses
We've got secret plans
I'm in a black box
But I can see the light
I'm on the other side of this paradise


We could run away
We could run away
Take me out this place
We could break the chains
We could run away
We could run away
Help me, please escape
We could break the chains

I got a lot of love, but I'm scared it's gonna go to waste
Locked inside an empty room
How can I get through to you?
Lying on the floor I'm just a body in an open grave
I just wanna scream your name
I am gonna rise again

We could run away
We could run away
Take me out this place
We could break the chains
We could run away
We could run away
Help me, please escape
We could break the chains

I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna have a taste
I am gonna break the chains, chains, oh, oh, oh-oh
I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna have a taste
I am gonna break the chains, chains, oh, oh, oh-oh

We could run away
We could run away
Take me out this place
We could break the chains
We could run away
We could run away
Help me, please escape
We could break the chains

I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna have a taste
I am gonna break the chains, chains, oh, oh, oh-oh
I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna have a taste
I am gonna break the chains, chains, oh, oh, oh-oh
