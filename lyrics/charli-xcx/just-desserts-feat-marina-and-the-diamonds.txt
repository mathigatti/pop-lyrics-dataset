Oh the heartbreak's hard
When you don't have a plastic heart
You sucked me in through the cinnamon stars
Cause you tasted so bitter, but the bitter was sweet
I'm the lifelong princess and i'm yours to eat


I gave you too much
I gave you too much to touch
Mister heartcore I am through the velvet glove
You were a lullaby and you had me blind
But now I laugh because you're the one being left behind
I see you cry

Now that the shoe's on the other foot
Now that the shoe's on the other foot
You suddenly decided to knock on wood
Waking everybody in the neighbourhood
Telling everybody that I'm no good
Karma came around like I knew it would
Like I knew it would
And it feels so good, when the shoe is put
On the other foot

Yeah baby, I know that it hurts
When you're about to get your just desserts

Oh heartbreak's hard
Harder than glittering cars
Harder than living life fast
Harder than crashing and burning
Hoped that you learned your lesson
(I know that you learnt your lesson)

They always said to us you're a mess of a girl
Ever since you stepped your toes into my perfect world
You flipped me upside down but I see clear from here
That you're a mess of a boy
You'll cry these tears for years
Look in the mirror baby

Now that the shoe's on the other foot
Now that the shoe's on the other foot
You suddenly decided to knock on wood
Waking everybody in the neighbourhood
Telling everybody that I'm no good
Karma came around like I knew it would
Like I knew it would
And it feels so good, when the shoe is put
On the other foot

Yeah baby, I know that it hurts
When you're about to get your just desserts

I'm that you've crashed and burned
Guys like you may never learn, never learn
Baby revenge is sweet
When I'm playing you on repeat

Now that the shoe's on the other foot
You suddenly decided to knock on wood
Waking everybody in the neighbourhood
Telling everybody that I'm no good
Karma came around like I knew it would
Like I knew it would
And it feels so good, when the shoe is put
On the other foot

Now that the shoeâ€™s on the other foot
Karma came back
Like you knew it would
Like you knew it would
