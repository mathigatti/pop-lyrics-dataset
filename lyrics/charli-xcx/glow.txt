We came a long, long way through the wind and rain
I nearly sank my heart in the empty glass
Spent my time alone, but you're at the phone
And when I fall apart, I'll swim with the sharks


You'll always be right there
And I will always love you
You changed my vision when you said to me

You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness

In the box of doom, in a hotel room
You're across the sea, but you're near to me
You know you gave me hope, now I stay afloat
I used to sleep to scream and now I sleep to dream of you

You'll always be right there
And I will always love you
You changed my vision when you said to me

You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness
