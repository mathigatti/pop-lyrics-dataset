Signals low
It's alright
I'll be your
Satellite
Back and forth
Day and night
Bouncy ball
Is what we're like


Flying to the sun
Crashing to the sea
Like an aeroplane
Or a submarine
We won't let go
We won't let go

Don't you know we go up, we go down
Touch the ceiling, touch the ground
You and I, keep on going
Through the motions, like we're floating
Uh-oh, up and down
Uh-oh-uh, up and down
Uh-oh, up and down
Uh-oh-uh, up and down
Uh-oh-uh, up and down

Me and you
You and me
Changing my
Chemistry
Every time
You look at me
I'm feeling
Your gravity

Flying to the sun
Crashing to the sea
Like an aeroplane
Or a submarine
We won't let go
We won't let go

Don't you know we go up, we go down
Touch the ceiling, touch the ground
You and I, keep on going
Through the motions, like we're floating
Uh-oh, up and down
Uh-oh-uh, up and down
Uh-oh, up and down
Uh-oh-uh, up and down

Uh-oh, up, up, up
Down, down, down, d-d-down
Down, down, down, d-d-down
Uh-oh, up, up, up
Uh-oh-uh, up and down
