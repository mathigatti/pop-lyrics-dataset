Endless days and endless night
Lost in space, won't see the light
Hold me close, all she says
On the way to the back


With you, with you
Lost in space with you
With you, with you
Lost in space with you

Stars don't move they just stand still
Recycled atoms that are filled
Half the Moon is dark and still
Space room, climate control

With you, with you
Lost in space with you
With you, with you
Lost in space with you

You are like a rocketship, you’re gonna make the earth quake
This is the movies, no outtakes
Oh, oh, don’t make my heart break
Oh, oh, lost in space
I am like a satellite, you got me spinning right ‘round
We're on a spaceship with no one else around
Oh, oh, this ain’t a mistake
Oh, oh, lost in space

We lie alone
Sinking through stars, fall into your arms
(I’m lost in space, I’m lost)
We stayed so bright
Just us in the night, you hold my heart tight
(I’m lost in space, I’m lost)
