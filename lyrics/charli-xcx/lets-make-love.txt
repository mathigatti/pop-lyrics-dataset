Get kicked to the back of the cinema
Just wanted a taste
Lips rubbing skin and it's filled with stars
Heart melting away
One second, a rush and it falls through
I waited on back in my bedroom
Can't stop all these feelings inside my brain
They won't go away


Girls thinking 'bout boys in the night time
Boys wishing that girls were by their sides
All watchin' and waitin’ for the sign
Let's make love, let's make love
Boys watch all the girls while they're sleeping
Girls thinking 'bout boys while they're dreaming
Oh baby, we've all got that feeling
Let's make love, let's make love

Can't wait for the weekend to come around
This party will rule
Blue t-shirt and jeans, feeling kinda drunk
See, my country's cool
Electric the minute that we touch
Mum's calling but I don't give a fuck
Don't call me, my credit is really low
Now I gotta roll

Girls thinking 'bout boys in the night time
Boys wishing that girls were by their sides
All watchin' and waitin’ for the sign
Let's make love, let's make love
Boys watch all the girls while they're sleeping
Girls thinking 'bout boys while they're dreaming
Oh baby, we've all got that feeling
Let's make love, let's make love

Girls thinking 'bout boys in the night time
Boys wishing that girls were by their sides
All watchin' and waitin’ for the sign
Let's make love, let's make love
Boys watch all the girls while they're sleeping
Girls thinking 'bout boys while they're dreaming
Oh baby, we've all got that feeling
Let's make love, let's make love
