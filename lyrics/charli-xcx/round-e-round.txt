Boy, you got me freaking out
You got me spinning round tonight
Round, and round, and round, round
Boy, it's like a rodeo
We're on a rollercoaster ride
Round, and round, and round, round


Blew up like dynamite
Second you caught my eye
You've been playing
On my mind, on my mind twenty four seven for you
Said goodbye, said goodbye
But I'm still thinkin' 'bout you

Sitting here and checkin' my phone
My friends all think I'm crazy
Wondering, anticipating, do you feel the same?
If we both stop playing it cool this shit could be amazing
Let's get out of here, and we could make it real

Boy, you got me freaking out
You got me spinning round tonight
Round, and round, and round, round
Boy, it's like a rodeo
We're on a rollercoaster ride
Round, and round, and round, round

You got me round, and round, and round, round, oh
You got me round, and round, and round, oh, oh
(Round, and round, and round)
(Round, and round, and round)
(Round, and round, and round)
(Round, and round, and round, ooh-ooh)

You were so beautiful
Standing there on your own
Got that connection
Butterflies, butterflies, I got these feelings for you
If I die, if I die, I'll still be dreamin' of you

Hangin' here with you on my arm
I got the sweetest candy
Confident and serious
I know you feel the same, oh
Don't need to be playing it cool
'Cause this shit is amazing
Sign your name right here
Baby, let's seal the deal

Boy, you got me freaking out
You got me spinning round tonight
Round, and round, and round, round (and round)
Boy, it's like a rodeo
We're on a rollercoaster ride
Round, and round, and round, round

You got me round, and round
And round, round, oh
You got me round, and round
And round, and round, oh

(Yeah, yeah)
You got me round, and round
And round, round, oh
(Round, and round, and round) (round, and round, and round)
(Round, and round, and round)
(Round, and round, and round) (round, and round, and round)
(Round, and round, and round) (round, and round, and round)
(Round, and round, and round) you got me (round, and round, and round)
(Round, and round, and round) (round, and round, and round)

Boy, you got me freaking out
You got me spinning round tonight
Round, and round, and round, round
Boy, it's like a rodeo
We're on a rollercoaster ride
Round, and round, and round, round

You got me round, and round
And round, round, oh
You got me round, and round
And round, and round, oh

(Yeah, yeah)
You got me round, and round
And round, round, oh
(Round, and round, and round) (round, and round, and round)
(Round, and round, and round)
