Blew a kiss with a shotgun
Then I swallowed your pill straight down, down, down
Yeah, the love's coming undone
But we can't let it die we drown, drown, drown


This is the final time
Got to give up 'cause it's over
This is so over
Look out it's a car crash
Yeah I'm gonna take off over and out

We're making a mess here together
We drilled a hole in the roof
Because of a misunderstanding
Never been further from you
We're bringing out horses and lasers
We act like we're sniffing glue
So sick of the stranger within me
Sick of the stranger in you

We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess

Burn a hole in the paper
But we can't let a fire start to spread
'Cause we're out of our bodies
Might as well start sleeping with the dead

This is the final time
Got to give up 'cause it's over
This is so over
Put your hand on your mouth boy
'Cause I'm blocking out all those words you said

We're making a mess here together
We drilled a hole in the roof
Because of a misunderstanding
Never been further from you
We're bringing out horses and lasers
We act like we're sniffing glue
So sick of the stranger within me
Sick of the stranger in you

We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess

Let's make a mess here together
Let's drill a hole in the roof
I'm loving this misunderstanding
Never been further from you
Let's bring out the horses and lasers
Let's act like we're sniffing glue
So sick of the stranger within me
Sick of the stranger in you

We're making a mess here together
We drilled a hole in the roof
Because of a misunderstanding
Never been further from you
We're bringing out horses and lasers
We act like we're sniffing glue
So sick of the stranger within me
Sick of the stranger in you

We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
We're making a mess
