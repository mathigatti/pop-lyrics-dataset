It was twenty five
Plus nine at night
And I was really bored
So I sat down with my guitar
But I needed some new chords
I spoke to my good friend, called chas
He was an indie boy


Skinny jeans, and vintage shoes
And hair all over the shop
And he said
"Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go googoo eyes

And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody
That you can sing along too, an indie tune
That will make the girls swoon
A rave a boy can dance to

I said it sounds okay
Said "of course it does, you're a magician on guitar"
I said, "thank you love, I'm not that great
And I wouldn't go that far"
I've got this friend called paul and his brain ain't small
He played the violin

But now he's a rocker, a leather jacket shocker
I wish I could play like him
He said
"Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go googoo eyes
And give them inspiration, honey

You need a sweet and simple melody
That you can sing along too, an indie tune
That will make the girls swoon
When a rave, a boy asks for a dance"
For a dance, for a dance

And he said
"Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go googoo eyes
And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody
That you can sing along too, an indie tune
That will make the girls swoon
A rave a boy can dance too"
