I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge. I watched, I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge


I don't care
I love it
I don't care

I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge. I watched, I let it burn
I threw your sh*t into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge

I don't care
I love it
I don't care

You're on a different road, I'm in the milky way
You want me down on earth, but I am up in space
You're so damn hard to please, we gotta kill this switch
You're from the 70's, but I'm a 90's b*tch

I love it!
I love it!
