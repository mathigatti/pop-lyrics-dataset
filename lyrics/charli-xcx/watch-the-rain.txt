Let it pour, let it fall down like your dreams
Let it go, let it flow away into the gutter
Let it wash all the colour away from yourself
Let it take away the pain


I remember when you asked me do I ever watch the rain
And I remember I was watching it t then but I just didn’t want to say
And now when you look out your window it’ll never be the same
‘Cuz when it falls down from now on you’ll always think of my name, yeah
I’ll be in your brain

And if you get a leak in your roof just think of it like my problems falling through
And if you get a hole in your ceiling think of how I’ll be feeling, cold and all alone
Like a drifting leaf, falling from the autumn trees again (and again and again and again) and again
Oh oh oh

Watch it drop from the sky like a child running away
Watch it roll off the page like a tear from my face
Hear the pitter patter on the pavement like me knocking on your door
As it brushes the floor

I remember when you asked me do I ever watch the rain
And I remember I was watching it t then but I just didn’t want to say
And now when you look out your window it’ll never be the same
‘Cuz when it falls down from now on you’ll always think of my name, yeah
I’ll be in your brain

And if you get a leak in your roof just think of it like my problems falling through
And if you get a hole in your ceiling think of how I’ll be feeling, cold and all alone
Like a drifting leaf, falling from the autumn trees, yeah, again (and again and again and again) and again
Oh oh oh

And I know you’re working me out slowly but surely, slowly but surely
And I know you’ll never tell about my other side
And that’s why we all watch the rain to wash away the secrets and the lies
‘Cuz I know everyone watches the rain sometimes.

Watch it fall down as you watch me fall for you
‘Cuz you knew it was about you but you didn’t have the guts to say
That you knew it was all for you
