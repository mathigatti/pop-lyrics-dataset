Who, me?

I got dressed up
Stepped in the club
I’m kind of new to all this stuff
Don’t kiss and tell
Trapped in my shell
But maybe you’re under my spell


Dancin’ on tabletops
Champagne bottles go pop
Runnin’ away from cops
Oh no, oh no, oh no
That doesn’t sound like me
Yes, I can guarantee
‘Cause I’ve probably gone to bed by then anyways
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)

(Whoops)
She looks a lot like me
Bust it in the club like a crazy B
I’m like oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
She looks a lot like you
Face like an angel with an attitude
I’m like oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff

Text all my friends around these ends
Been saving all these rolled up tens
The next weekend, got cash to spend
Call up my girls, do it again

Dancin’ on tabletops
Champagne bottles go pop
Runnin’ away from cops
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Don’t think that’s what I did
‘Cause I can’t remember it
You see, I’ve got such a bad memory
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)

(Whoops)
She looks a lot like me
Bust it in the club like a crazy B
I’m like oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
“She looks a lot like you”
“Face like an angel with an attitude”
I’m like oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff

(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh)
(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh)
(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff

My mother always said
That good girls stay at home
So when it strikes twelve I’m in my bed
I’m lyin’ all alone
What, me? Who, me?
Nah, I don’t do this type of stuff

(Whoops)
She looks a lot like me
Bust it in the club like a crazy B
I’m like oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Who, me?
