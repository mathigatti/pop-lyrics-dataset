Baby boy, I wanna love you all the way
I'll be like a teddy bear, hold on to me
Boy, you make me tremble when you say my name
Cause I love, I love you, I love you all the way


You and me got matching signs
Scorpio and gemini
Sex and drugs, tell me what you like
Baby, we can do it every day and night
Always know how to touch me right

So touch-touch-touch me right, touch me right
So don't let me go
Always gonna stand that ground for you
Even when you're tryin' to play it cool
And I'm always gonna be your boo, it's true

Here right now, just me and you
Here right now, just me and you
So don't let me go
I need you to know

Baby boy, I wanna love you all the way
I'll be like a teddy bear, hold on to me
Boy, you make me tremble when you say my name
Baby boy, just promise me you'll always stay

Baby boy, I wanna love you all the way
I'll be like a teddy bear, hold on to me
Boy, you make me tremble when you say my name
Baby boy, just promise me you'll always stay

(Baby)

Call me up any time of day
I got you burning up like pompeii
I'mma come and meet you in the pouring rain
We can do it each and every single way
Loving every word you say to me, say-say to me
So-so-so, need you to know
All day long beneath the sheets
I can be the lesson, teach you everything
Early in the morning I'll be such a freak

Here right now, just you and me
Here right now, just you and me
So don't let me go
I need you to know

Baby boy, I wanna love you all the way
I'll be like a teddy bear, hold on to me
Boy, you make me tremble when you say my name
Baby boy, just promise me you'll always stay

Baby boy, I wanna love you all the way
I'll be like a teddy bear, hold on to me
Boy, you make me tremble when you say my name
Baby boy, just promise me you'll always stay

Get your skin so close to me
Time ticks down like dynamite
Get your heartbeat on my chest
Baby now, baby now, baby
Baby, baby now

Baby boy, I wanna love you all the way
I'll be like a teddy bear, let's celebrate
Boy, you make me tremble when you say my name
Baby boy, just promise me you'll always stay

Baby boy, I wanna love you all the way
