Boom, boom, boom, clap

You're picture perfect blue
Sunbathing under moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate


First kiss just like a drug
Under your influence
You sent me over, you're the magic in my veins
This must be love

Boom, clap
The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom, clap
You make me feel good
Come on to me
Come on to me now

Boom, clap
The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom, clap
You make me feel good
Come on to me
Come on to me now

No silver or no gold
Could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world

Just tell me what to do
I'll fall right into you
We're going under, cast the spell, just say the word
I feel your love

Boom, clap
The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom, clap
You make me feel good
Come on to me
Come on to me now

Boom, clap
The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom, clap
You make me feel good
Come on to me
Come on to me now

You are the light and I will follow
You let me lose my shadow
You are the sun, the glowing halo
And you keep burning me up with your love, oh

Boom, clap
The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom, clap
You make me feel good
Come on to me
Come on to me now

Boom, clap
The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom, clap
You make me feel good
Come on to me
Come on to me now

Boom, clap
The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom, clap
You make me feel good
Come on to me
Come on to me now

Boom, clap
The sound in my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom, clap
You make me feel good
Come on to me
Come on to me now
