You choke my throat
With words of wonder
You make it hard to breathe
Your love so cold
Just like an arrow
Pierced through my skin I bleed


I knew you were no angel
But God, what did I do?
Woahuhhoh

Do you remember what I said
That first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone
But now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

Taking all my light and blocking out my vision
Bad little girl you have trapped in the prison
On my hands on my knees pulled on the chains
Licking up the blood, yeah, I made this descision

You took my light
Trapped in the prison
You threw away the key
You are the curse
I am the captive
Walking on hands and knees
Never learn... Never learn...
Never learn...

I knew you were no angel
But god you're just electric blue
Woahuhohh

Do you remember what I said
That first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone
But now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

Stay away, stay away...

I climbed a wall
To touch your shadow
I hear you call for me
But you're not there
You're just an echo
Why did you fall for me?

Do you remember what I said
That first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone
But now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?
