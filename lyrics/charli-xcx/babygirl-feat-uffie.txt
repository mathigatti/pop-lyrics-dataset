If you feeling real sad just look on your wall
I'm your pin-up princess, yeah, you know who to call
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I've got a million dollar smile, I can live in your dreams
With my angel wings and Fiorucci jeans
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh


Close your eyes and lay back (mhm)
Think about us, think about love, the second we touch
Yeah, let your mind just relax
We could play rough, make your blood rush, velveteen brush

I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl

Gloss on my lips, pop
Sun in my eyes
Goes the other liquor from inside
Wanna take a little sip with you
Wanna spend a little bit with you
Open the top, pop, drink in my glass
Here come the cop cops, better drink fast
Wanna take a little sip with you
Wanna spend a little bit with you

Just close your eyes and lay back
Think about us, think about love, the second we fuck
Yeah, let your mind just relax
We could play rough, make your blood rush, velveteen brush

I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl

I'm hanging all alone
Let me live inside your world (hmm)
More than a fantasy
Let me be your baby girl (hmm)

I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl

I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl

Baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
Baby girl, your baby girl (haha, sassy babes)
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
Baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
