They say: Keep your friends close'
But you're closer, I love when you're here
I'm so far away sometimes, I'm distant, yeah
You might help me, intimacy, I'll admit, I'm scared
Maybe, maybe you can reach me, yeah


Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
I'm the only one who knows the way you're really feelin'
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could pull me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

Suddenly, you're in my bedroom under my sheets every night
Suddenly, I lose my fear, it feels good, yeah
I feel guilty, I feel nervous, I feel certain now
Maybe, maybe you can reach me, yeah

Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
You're the only one who knows the way I'm really feelin'
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could pull me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

Oh, yeah
Yeah, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

So cold at the surface
I'm scared of nothin'
Underneath, I'm nervous
Can you reach me?
So cold at the surface
Told you I'm scared of nothin'
Underneath, I'm nervous, yeah
Can you reach me?

I think a tough journey to be on
Whilst you're around a lot of people
I feel like I'm learning, but I, I doubt myself
And I don't really, really understand it yet
It hurts here, it hurts here

Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
I'm the only one who knows the way you're really feelin'
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could pull me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

Can you reach me?
Maybe you're my enemy
Can you reach me?
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah
Can you reach me?
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah
Can you reach me?
