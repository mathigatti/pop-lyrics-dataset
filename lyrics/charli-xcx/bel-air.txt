I saw you in the mirror
You been stuck my mind since Saturday
Can't get you off my radar
You're lost inside my heart, I can't escape
I'm falling for you, I'm running from you
If I could lock you up and have my way
I'd drive you up to Bel Air
Let's escape, come here next to me, oh


If you were mine
We'd take a holiday away from here
But you don't care
I never crossed your mind
Time passes by
Alone in paradise
You'll always be a fantasy
I never crossed your mind

My heart is getting hazy
I wish you'd whisper words into my ears
I know I sound so crazy
I want to keep you close to kiss my chest
I'm callin' for ya, I dial your number
But you never pick up when it's my name
So I drive up to Bel Air
And drown inside the pool out on the deck

If you were mine
We'd take a holiday away from here
But you don't care
I never crossed your mind
Time passes by
Alone in paradise
You'll always be a fantasy
I never crossed your mind
