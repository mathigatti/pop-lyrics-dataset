Lost right at night laying next to you sleeping
I’m wide awake in your bed
Head on your chest, staring up at the ceiling
Feels like I’m playing pretend
The silence felt violent, been real for the first time
We used to talk until dawn
Head on your chest and I’m feeling you breathing, ya
But it’s like the oxygen's gone
We’re out of time


It’s 3:05, I’m parked outside
Wondering if I should leave this place behind
No, I can’t decide
Every second longer, it gets harder
I know it’s over and it’s making me nervous
You know I never meant to hurt you on purpose
But it’s time, and I’m staring outside
Trying to find the words to make you feel alright
But I can’t decide
Every second longer, it gets harder
I know it’s over and it’s making me nervous
You know I never meant to hurt you on purpose

This is the part where we both try to fix it
Sex for the weekend instead
Instead of us coming to terms with our feelings, ya, ya
Some good things were made to forget, ya it’s true
We’re out of time

It’s 3:05, I’m parked outside
Wondering if I should leave this place behind
No, I can’t decide
Every second longer, it gets harder
I know it’s over and it’s making me nervous
You know I never meant to hurt you on purpose

But it’s time, and I’m staring outside
Trying to find the words to make you feel alright
But I can’t decide
Every second longer, it gets harder
I know it’s over and it’s making me nervous
You know I never meant to hurt you on purpose
Hurt you on purpose
Hurt you on purpose
