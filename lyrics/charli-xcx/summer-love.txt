You're more than a picture
You're one in a million stars
The silence is silver
You wander around my heart


And I can't get away
Breathing you into the depths of my lungs
You keep me coming back for more mistakes
Open me up until I come undone
You keep me running

Taking me back to summer love
Taking me back to all of these stories
Taking us back to where we're from
Taking us back for darkness and glory
Oh you're more than just a heartbeat
Oh you're more than just a banging drum
You're locked inside of my dreams
So please, won't you take me home

We're stuck in the moment
And we'll never let this go
I want you to save me
So I'll never be alone

And you can't get away
Breathing me into the depths of your lungs
I'll keep you coming back for more mistakes
Open it up until you come undone
And we'll keep me running

Taking me back to summer love
Taking me back to all of these stories
Taking us back to where we're from
Taking us back for darkness and glory
Oh you're more than just a heartbeat
Oh you're more than just a banging drum
You're locked inside of my dreams
So please, won't you take me home
