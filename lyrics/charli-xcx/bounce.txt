You're the only one that I will ever need (yeah)
When I'm with you, it feels like a fantasy (uh-huh)
You never bring me down, down, down (no, you never)
'Cause we just wanna bounce, bounce, bounce (ah-ooh)
We can heat it up to one hundred degrees (so hot)
When you kiss me I melt just like plasticine (mwah, mwah)
You never bring me down, down, down (no, you never)
'Cause we just wanna, dance

Dance, dance, dance
