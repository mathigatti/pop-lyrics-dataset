Under your spell
Lock in me in your love like a prison cell
Don't know you well
Got to keep it secret, no kiss and tell


In my head, in my head
I fight it 'cause I know we're misbehaving, we're danger
Risky 'cause there's something 'bout your lovin'
There's something 'bout your lovin'

I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know I'm yours

You call my phone
Fake it, like you're someone I never knew
Our friends, they keep it close
Whispers make our house fall down like dominos

In my head, in my head
I fight it, but this misbehavior, it's danger
And it's special 'cause there's something 'bout your lovin'
But still, I won't say nothin'

I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know I'm yours
