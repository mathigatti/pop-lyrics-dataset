Ride away from Hollow Way
I said, "Mum, this isn't a holiday"
Listen up, I ain't coming back
Til I can fill the shack up with all gold plaques


Soon come home run
Knock it out the park with a baseball bat
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK, you know

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way-ay-ay
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)

Now I live in Hollywood
I can't stop, even though I know I should
It feels so good, oh, yeah, oh, oh
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK, you know

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way-ay-ay
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way-ay-ay
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)

Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)
Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)
Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)
Living the dream like a London queen

Oi, oi, oi!
Oi, oi!
Oi, oi, oi!
Oi, oi!

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way-ay-ay
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way-ay-ay
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)

Living the dream like a London queen
Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)
Living the dream like a London queen
Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)
