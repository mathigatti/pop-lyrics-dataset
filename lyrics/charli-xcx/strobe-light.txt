Stings like a snake bite
What you want, what you got
I don't need it
Just like a sharp knife
Cuts me through, makes me bruise
I don't feel it


Lovin' your suicide, and I don't got the time
No, you will not change my mind
You will not change my mind
Lovin' your suicide, and I don't got the time
No, you will not change my mind
You will not change my mind

I'm not gonna be one of those girls
Who falls under spells every single day
Oh, I'm not gonna be one of those girls
Who falls, no way, no way

Love like a strobe light
Run from the trouble
Runnin' from the trouble now
Love like a strobe light
To me [?]
Oh, whoah, oh, oh, oh

I will not be like this
But now I am in such a crisis
You blind me
You turn it on and I'm like
Whoah, oh, oh, oh

Now that your poison
Is sinking through, sinking down
I can't help it
My mind is frozen
Get me out, work it, I want you melted

Lovin' your suicide, 'cause now I've got the time
Oh, you always change my mind
You always change my mind
Lovin' your suicide, 'cause now I've got the time
Oh, you always change my mind
You always change my mind

I'm just one of those girls, those girls
That fall under spells every single day
Oh, I love to be like all of those girls
Who fall, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Love like a strobe light
Run from the trouble
Runnin' from the trouble now
Love like a strobe light
To me [?]
Oh, whoah, oh, oh, oh

I will not be like this
But now I am in such a crisis
You blind me
You turn it on and I'm like
Whoah, oh, oh, oh

Whoah, oh, oh, oh
You're just like a star, and you're shining so bright
Dancing through my bloodstream, your strobe light
Spin my heart round like a disco ball
Satellite lovin', now I want it all

Love like a strobe light
Run from the trouble
Runnin' from the trouble now
Love like a strobe light
To me [?]
Oh, whoah, oh, oh, oh

I will not be like this
But now I am in such a crisis
You blind me
You turn it on and I'm like
Whoah, oh, oh, oh

You hit me like a strobe light in the dark
I said, you hit me like a strobe light in my heart
Oh, yeah, you hit me like a strobe light in the dark
Oh, yeah, you hit me like a strobe light in my heart
