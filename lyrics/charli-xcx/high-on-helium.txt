Helium, whoa-oh-oh-oh

I wanna crawl up and get what I want
Got crystals on all my guns
Makin' it snow in the party with friends who I love
I wanna stay up and stare through the Sun
Blue pills in the bottle gun
We're on a level, feeling so right that it's so wrong


We're gonna stay in the starlight for days
This is my song, baby, dance when it plays
Turn it up louder, yeah, turn it up louder
Yeah, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
Love

Wish I could stay in this moment forever
High on helium tonight
We'll take a hit and we take off together
High on helium tonight
Open up, feel the rubber to your lips
Take a deep breath, inhale, have a good trip
Wish I could stay in this moment forever
High on helium tonight

I wanna see silver sparks in my eyes
Feel like I can almost fly
Just take my hand, follow me, no need to ask me why
I wanna spin and let's dance 'til we die
Laughing 'til we start to cry
Dance in this feeling with everbody by my side

We're gonna stay in the starlight for days
This is my song, baby, dance when it plays
Turn it up louder, yeah, turn it up louder
Yeah, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
Love

Wish I could stay in this moment forever
High on helium tonight
We'll take a hit and we take off together
High on helium tonight
Open up, feel the rubber to your lips
Take a deep breath, inhale, have a good trip
Wish I could stay in this moment forever
High on helium tonight

Wish I could stay like this forever
All night long, all night long
Wish I could stay like this forever
All night long, all night long
Helium, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Helium, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Wish I could stay in this moment forever
High on helium tonight

Wish I could stay in this moment forever
High on helium tonight
We'll take a hit and we take off together
High on helium tonight
Open up, feel the rubber to your lips
Take a deep breath, inhale, have a good trip
Wish I could stay in this moment forever
High on helium tonight

Wish I could stay in this moment forever
High on helium tonight
