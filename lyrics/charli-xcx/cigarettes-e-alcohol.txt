Like cigarettes &amp; alcohol
Baby you're my downfall
Dressed up in a pretty blue shirt
Damn, you're really gonna hurt me
Hate it when you don't call
Warning signals all along
Flowers dying deep in the dirt
Damn, you're really gonna hurt


Oh, fell really hard for you
You're breaking my heart in two
But I knew all along
And I still played along
Oh, fell really hard for you
You're so damn predictable
I knew all along, oh

Only you can make me feel like I'm the prettiest in the room
But then you make me feel invisible
I'm better when I'm
Hanging at the party with your friends
They think I'm cool
But you show up and make me feel so small
I'm better when you're gone

I'm better, better
I'm better when you're gone
So much better, better
I'm better when you're gone
I'm better, better
I'm better when you're gone
So much better, better
I'm better when you're gone

Left my clothes at your house
You can go and throw 'em out
Laying in a pretty blue shirt
Only makes me think about
Selective memories, I'll forget all the bad ones
Like I'm seventeen, I'll believe you're a good one
The reality is your love is my poison, I
I still can't believe that

Oh, fell super hard for you
You broke my heart in two
But I knew all along, oh

Only you can make me feel like I'm the prettiest in the room
But then you make me feel invisible
I'm better when I'm
Hanging at the party with your friends
They think I'm cool
But you show up and make me feel so small
I'm better when you're gone

I'm better, better
I'm better when you're gone
So much better, better
I'm better when you're gone
I'm better, better
I'm better when you're gone
So much better, better
I'm better when you're gone

Only you can make me feel like I'm the prettiest in the room
But then you make me feel invisible
I'm better when I'm
Hanging at the party with your friends
They think I'm cool
But you show up and make me feel so small
I'm better when you're gone
