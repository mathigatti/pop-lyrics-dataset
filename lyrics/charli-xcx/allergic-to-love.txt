Maybe I should just sue you
'Cause you got a rush on my heart
I can't whisper sweet words to you
We gotta make love ten feet apart


Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
You gotta go now please 'cause you making me sneeze
Allergic to love
Ah-ah-achoo

Oh-ewie-ewie-ewie-ewie-ah-choo
Gooey-goo and never stop
Can you pretty please hand me a tissue?
I'm coming down with a fever hard

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
Oh baby I can't lose with the stuff I choose
Allergic to love
Ah-ah-achoo

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-achoo
You gotta go now please 'cause you making me sneeze
Allergic to love
Ah-ah-achoo
