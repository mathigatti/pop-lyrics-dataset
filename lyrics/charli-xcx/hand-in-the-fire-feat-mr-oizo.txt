Hand in the fire, through the wire
You're the one
If you don't know, now you know
If you don't know, now you know
Hand in the fire, through the wire
You're the one
If you don't know, now you know
If you don't know, now you know


So tell me what you're gonna do
I've been thinkin' about you
Wake up in the morning
Wake up in the morning
You're on my mind
Every night and every day
I've been walkin' through the flames
Givin' you a warning
Givin' you a warning
You're on my mind

Wanna get me, wanna get me
Wanna get me naughty
Pick it up now, pick it up now
Come and get me started
Wanna touch it, wanna touch it
Caress me down there
Pick it up now, pick it up now
Come and get me started

Hand in the fire, through the wire
You're the one
If you don't know, now you know
If you don't know, now you know
Hand in the fire, through the wire
You're the one
If you don't know, now you know
If you don't know, now you know

Tell me what you're gonna do
I've been thinkin' about you
Wake up in the morning
Wake up in the morning
You're on my mind
Every night and every day
I've been walkin' through the flames
Givin' you a warning
Givin' you a warning
You're on my mind

Wanna get me, wanna get me
Wanna get me naughty
Pick it up now, pick it up now
Come and get me started
Wanna touch it, wanna touch it
Caress me down there
Pick it up now, pick it up now
Come and get me started

Hand in the fire, through the wire
You're the one
If you don't know, now you know
If you don't know, now you know
Hand in the fire, through the wire
You're the one
If you don't know, now you know
If you don't know, now you know

You're the light on the glass
You're the spectrum, the colours are shining like gold
So colour me crystal blue like the water
And now I'm ready to float
Let's run away, run away, run away
Yeah I know there's a place we can go
All the ways, all the ways, all the ways
No rush, you can burn down slow
