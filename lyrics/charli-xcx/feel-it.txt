It's only been a couple weeks but I want way more than your body
You got the keys, replicate it
4 AM secrets to morning
Are we there at the junction?
Run the lie, I'm about to be honest
Gon' let you in, under my skin
And get to know more than my body


I won't say no words but I'ma make you feel it
Just a little pressure I'ma make you feel it
All the things I'ma make my body say
Speak to you in a deeper kind of way
I won't say no words but I'ma make you feel it

I don’t wanna jump the gun
Hit and run, stay till the Sun rise
This connection, the crazy kind
Both afraid to speak with our minds
Say it through sex, biting all of my emotions
If I had a big house, I would always leave it open for you
Walk on in, under my skin
And get to know more than my body

I won't say no words but I'ma make you feel it
Just a little pressure I'ma make you feel it
All the things I'ma make my body say
Speak to you in a deeper kind of way
I won't say no words but I'ma make you feel it

I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma give it, give it all to you, aah
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma make you feel it
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma give it, give it all to you, aah
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma make you feel it

I won't say no words but I'ma make you feel it
Just a little pressure I'ma make you feel it
All the things I'ma make my body say
Speak to you in a deeper kind of way
I won't say no words but I'ma make you feel it

I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma give it, give it all to you, aah
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma make you feel it
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma give it, give it all to you, aah
I’ma give it, give it all to ya
I’ma make you feel it
