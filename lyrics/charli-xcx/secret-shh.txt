You good girls shouldn't party
We do what we supposed to do
Speak but never shout it
Get home, be in bed by two


But I don't wan' follow that, that no more
I see myself all over you for sure
You got me breaking all the rules
Let go, let go

If I share my secret, secret, ah ah
Promise you'll keep it, keep it down
If I share my secret, ah ah
No one gets to know 'bout you
No one gets to know 'bout, shh
Shh
Shh
Shh
Shh

Please don't tell nobody
I'm ready to climb the walls
I know that you want it
I'm ready to give it all

I feel like an animal, on all fours
I see myself all over you for sure
You got me breaking all the rules
Let go, let go

If I share my secret, secret, ah ah
Promise you'll keep it, keep it down
If I share my secret, ah ah
No one gets to know 'bout you
No one gets to know 'bout, shh
Shh
Shh
Shh
Shh

Under the glimmering lights, my secrets out
Now I got nothing to hide, come tear me down
Shimmering all through the night, I'm tempted by you
It's all true, oh
Na na na no one gets to know 'bout you
Na na na no one gets to know 'bout
Know 'bout you, you, you, you
No one gets to know 'bout you
Na na na no one gets to know 'bout shh
Shh

If I share my secret, secret, ah ah
Promise you'll keep it, keep it down
If I share my secret, ah ah
No one gets to know 'bout you
No one gets to know 'bout, shh
