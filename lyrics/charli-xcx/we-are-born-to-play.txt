I wanna burn like fire tonight
I feel my heartbeat jumping twice
I'm floating up like red balloons
And I could stay right here for life
This place moves me right


Days and nights
I'm captured by the feeling
Love the ride
And now I'm really living life
Alive, a super kind of feeling
Jump on board the ride tonight

Oh-eh-eh-eh
We are born to play
Oh-eh-eh-eh
Baby, we are born to play
(Here we go!)

Days and nights
I'm captured by the feeling
Love the ride
And now I'm really living life
Alive a super kind of feeling
Jump on board the ride tonight
Baby we are born to play
