I’ve been drinking liquor
I’ve been drinking liquor before I called you on the phone
I think that you should kick her out, kick her out the house
So you and I can be alone


You will be amazed, I can flip your brain
Make you feel what you’ve been missin’
Know it’s really wrong, but what if it’s love?
I just gotta ask you again

Cause lately, lately
I’ve been drinking baby, baby
Yeah, I’ve been sipping all day
Yeah, I’ve been sipping all day

I’ve been drinking liquor
I’ve been drinking liquor before I called you on the phone
I think that you should kick her out, kick her out the house
So you and I can be alone
Wish you’d answer my call, get in my bed
Come to my house, fuck with my head
I’ve been drinkin’, yeah
I’ve been drinking liquor
I’ve been drinking liquor before I called you on the phone

Cause lately, lately
I’ve been drinking baby, baby
Yeah, I’ve been sipping all day
Yeah, I’ve been sipping all day

And maybe, maybe, I was thinking you could save me
Yeah, I’ve been sipping all day, thinking you would call me

I’ve been drinking liquor
I’ve been drinking liquor before I called you on the phone
Think that you should kick her out, kick her out the house
So you and I can be alone
Wish you’d answer my call, get in my bed
Come to my house, fuck with my head
I’ve been drinkin’, yeah
I’ve been drinking liquor
I’ve been drinking liquor before I called you on the phone
