Don't know how to keep on going
When our car is on the road, we're slowing down
But we got to keep on driving
We're the young kids and we've got to get around


You always got to move on, move on
When the people say we're so wrong, so wrong
They don't know that we're dressed in talent
And they don't know that we're on, on, on it now

We're on on, on on
We're on on
We're on on
We're on on on it now
We're on on, on on
We're on on
I'm on on
And the kids are saying

You can kiss my beauty
'Cause you know you're never gonna shut us down
You can kiss my beauty
'Cause you know that kids will always be around
You can kiss my beauty now
You can kiss my beauty now

We don't know how to stop this feeling
We're so electric, we've got static in our bones
Don't know if we're only dreaming
We're ultraviolet and we're dancing on our own

We're never gonna slow down again
'Cause I don't want this feeling to end
Now they know we're dressed in talent
And they know that we are on, on, on it now

We're on on, on on
We're on on
We're on on
We're on on on it now
We're on on, on on
We're on on
I'm on on
And the kids are saying

You can kiss my beauty
'Cause you know you're never gonna shut us down
You can kiss my beauty
'Cause you know that kids will always be around
You can kiss my beauty now
You can kiss my beauty now

Kiss
My beauty
Kiss
My beauty
You think you know us but you don't
You think you know us but you don't
You think you know us but you don't
'Cause we're a rocket and we're blasting off the ground

We're on on, on on
We're on on
I'm on on
I'm on on on it now
We're on on, on on
We're on on
I'm on on
And the kids are saying

We're on on on on
You can kiss my beauty now
We're on on on it now
You can kiss my beauty now
And the kids are saying
