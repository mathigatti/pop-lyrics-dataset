This night is young
Feels like I've been here forever
I want to stop, ooh


Drinking too much
My head is been hell forever
I gotta give up
Oh

Got girlfriends
Boyfriends
Best dress on
Coca√Øne
Ice cubes
Platinum blondes
Empty glasses
Black Patron
But somehow I don't feel at home

This city's alive
The lights are so bright
But inside my mind
Down in the darkness

My friends are all good
I'm here a fallout
I'm walking alone through the darkness

I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
In the
In the darkness

Smoke fades quickly
Yeah I'm sick and tired of all the sadness
When I try to get down

Cars pass through me
But a mess inside all the madness
Now I can't hear a sound
Oh

Got on the guest list with plus one
Six a. M., I see the Sun
Heart is heavy
Weights are turned
I hope my limousine will come

This city's alive
The lights are so bright
But inside my mind
Down in the darkness

My friends are all good
I'm here a fallout
I'm walking alone through the darkness

I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
In the darkness

I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
In the
In the darkness

I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
In the darkness

I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
I am walking alone in the
In the
In the darkness
