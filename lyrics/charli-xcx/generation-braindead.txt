You like late, late nights
Champagne life
Plastic friends hangin' at your party
Camera flash like the paparazzi
Posted up, watch the lights get started
Fake love kills, bright green bills
Throw 'em up, make it rain, so boring
Tryna tell me the same old story
Sick and tired of the same old story


Living your life in a picture
Photoshop, put it online
Chandeliers swing in the kitchen
But you're out telling a lie

You're generation braindead
And you think you're ridin' high, high
Generation braindead, yeah, you're living but you're not alive
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-woah
Generation braindead, yeah, you're living but you're not alive

Generation braindead, yeah, you're living but you're not alive

You like perfect boys, perfect girls
Fake it till you make it in the perfect world
Now tip the axis and do a twirl
Now, rip your dress up and dance on the table
Still, the glass cracks
Like the mirror on your bathroom wall
Imagine if you lost it all, yeah
Did you think about the rise and fall?
Are you in it till the curtain call? Ah

You're generation braindead
And you think you're ridin' high, high
Generation braindead, yeah, you're living but you're not alive

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-woah
