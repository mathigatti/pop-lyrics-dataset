After the after the party
We're gonna keep it going
We're gonna rip it up
The neighbours might complain


I think it's almost 4am
But baby I'm still feeling just fine
Ice all up in a plastic cup
And I'ma keep on sipping all night, yeah
I might a kissed a thousand lips
But maybe that's just all in my mind
Some people never understand
The way we live but we're living life

Uh huh, hey, uh huh
Monday to Sunday, it's never too late
So everyone say
We don't wanna stop!

'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, the neighbours might complain
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna stay 'til mornin'
Then when the time is up, we'll do it all again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're all in love
We're all in love

I'm hangin' on my best friend's couch
And my clothes are all on the floor
I got glitter in my underwear like it was Studio 54, yeah
I can't remember why I love it
But I need it baby, clap, bring on the encore
Let's pour another drink, the glasses go clink
Yeah, we're always up for one more

Uh huh, hey, uh huh
Monday to Sunday, it's never too late
So everyone say
We don't wanna stop!

'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, the neighbors might complain
'Cause after the afterparty, afterparty
We're gonna stay 'til mornin', stay 'til mornin'
Then when the time is up, we'll do it again, oh yeah

The party just ended but I'm not done with you
My folks are out of town, we got a crib with a view
Come over, bring a couple friends, I keep mine with me
Shout out to Whitney, she was so wicked
The party was so crazy, the party was so crazy
Tomorrow I'll be lazy but I'll spend it with you baby

Monday to Sunday doing it our way
RiRi on replay, cheers to the weekday
We're all in, we're all in love, yeah
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
And we do it like ice cream for dinner
Bucket of liqueur, we're getting sicker
Don't need Ibiza
We're all in, we're all in love, yeah
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
And we do it like
Monday to Sunday doing it our way
RiRi on replay, cheers to the weekday
We're all in, we're all in love, yeah
