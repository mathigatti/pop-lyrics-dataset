Every night I stay up 'til 3 AM and fantasize
Are you mine or are you playing round pretending that I'm blind?
I've got an awful habit
I chase the wild once it's so problematic
I guess it's in my blood
I keep second guessing, I need the pain to survive
Feels so good when you're bad to me


You're on my mind and I can't shake it
Tried every time, and I can't shake it
Two hearts collide, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

Lost in your eyes, and I can't shake it
It's suicide, and I can't shake it
But I'm alive, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

It's pretty bad
Yes I'm kinda crazy, I'm a heart attack
It's a fact, all the others think that I'm a maniac
You know that I'm addicted
To all your poison arrows and your kisses
I guess it's in my blood
I keep second guessing, I need the pain to survive
Feels so good when you're bad to me

You're on my mind and I can't shake it
Tried every time, and I can't shake it
Two hearts collide, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

Lost in your eyes, and I can't shake it
It's suicide, and I can't shake it
But I'm alive, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

I've been hurt before
Baby, it's the truth
Your love is a sign
It makes my heart beat
Boom-boom-beh
It's like a boom-boom-beh
It's like a boom-boom-beh
I'm coming back tonight
Boom-boom-beh
It's like a boom-boom-beh
It's like a boom-boom-beh
Can't shake you off of my mind

You're on my mind and I can't shake it
Tried every time, and I can't shake it
Two hearts collide, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

Lost in your eyes, and I can't shake it
It's suicide, and I can't shake it
But I'm alive, and I can't shake it
I can't stop can't get enough

And I can't shake it
And I can't shake it
And I can't shake it
And I can't shake it
