I'm never growing up, stay forever young
Me and all my friends will run the world
Runnin' from the gun, diamonds in our lungs
Sirens flashing purple when we drive
Guess it's in our blood, burning rubber up
We could go for miles and miles and miles
Never gonna stop, keep it super hot
2 hundred on a highway
They see us, they go


Wow yeah, wow yeah yeah
Wow yeah, wow
You know that we're so
Wow yeah, wow yeah yeah
Wow yeah, wow
You know that we're so
Wow yeah, wow yeah yeah
Wow yeah, wow
You know that we're so
Wow yeah, wow yeah yeah
Wow yeah, wow
They see us, they go
