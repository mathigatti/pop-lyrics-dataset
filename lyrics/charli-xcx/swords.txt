You gave me back your key
You did, you did, you did
I gave you back your love
I did, I did, I did


Now on the morning I'm putting on my black dress
I hate you now but you used to be my bestest friend
Now on the morning I'm putting on my black dress
My black dress

I'll take mine and you'll take yours
Hellfire and slammimg doors
Love is dead and that's for sure
So we, we keep dancing with the swords
It didn't have to end this way

But two stopping hearts feeling too much the same
So I'll take mine and you'll take yours
And we'll, we keep dancing with the swords
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
We keep dancing with the swords

Don't ever call my phone
Cause I'm not listening
And when you feel alone
Don't think of me again

I know how it goes
'Cause we've seen it all a thousand times
This ain't the movies, yeah
We wait past the point of goodbye
Know how it goes
'Cause we've seen it all a thousand times
A thousand times

I'll take mine and you'll take yours
Hellfire and slammimg doors
Love is dead and that's for sure
So we, we keep dancing with the swords

It didn't have to end this way
But two stopping hearts feeling too much the same
So I'll take mine and you'll take yours
And we'll, we keep dancing with the swords

It didn't have to end this way (ha!)
It didn't have to end this way (ha!)
It didn't have to end this way (ha!)
But we, we keep dancing with the swords

I'll take mine and you'll take yours
Hellfire and slammimg doors
Love is dead and that's for sure
So we, we keep dancing with the swords

It didn't have to end this way
But two stopping hearts feeling too much the same
So I'll take mine and you'll take yours
And we'll, we keep dancing with the swords

It didn't have to end this way (ha!)
It didn't have to end this way (ha!)
It didn't have to end this way (ha!)
But we, we keep dancing with the swords
