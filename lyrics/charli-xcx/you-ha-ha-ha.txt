Yeah we got a situation
Lock down and I'm trapped in the basement
I'm a victim of replacement
Cause you're acting so leather trying to put across your statement
Oh, oh


Cause I know, you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You, you lied
Ha ha ha ha, I was right
All along
Good job, good job
You fucked it up

Cause we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blueprint
But we threw it in the flames and now we're never gonna trace it, oh

Cause we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blueprint
But we threw it in the flames and now we're never gonna trace it, oh

Cause I know, you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You, you lied
Ha ha ha ha, I was right
Ha ha ha ha
All along
Good job, good job
You fucked it up

Now you're walking on your own
Rain falls down, I'm not answering my phone
I got to phase you out my zone
Hope you realize now that I am never coming home
You were meant to be alone

You, you lied
Ha ha ha ha, I was right
Ha ha ha ha
All along
Good job, good job
You fucked it up
Ha ha ha ha

It's the front
Good job, good job
You fucked it up
Ha ha ha
