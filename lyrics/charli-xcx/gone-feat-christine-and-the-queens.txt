I have to go, I'm so sorry
But it feels so cold in here
I am just now realizing, they don't care
I try real hard, but I'm caught up by my insecurities
Pour me one more, watch the ice melt in my fist


I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they're making me feel lately
They're making me weird baby, lately
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they're making me loathe
They're making me loathe

Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love?

I will lay down (lay down)
But they're staring, their eyes like two shining stones
I see myself (myself) and I look scared and confused
Wait, did they just talk?
Why is it loud? (is it loud?)
Do they wish to run to me? (me)
Am I a smoke? Am I the sun? Who decides? (oo-ooh)

I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they're making me feel lately
They're making me weird baby, lately
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they're making me loathe
They're making me loathe

Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby

Why do we keep when the water runs?
Ne me cherche pas, je ne suis plus là, baby
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Ne me cherche pas, je ne suis plus là, baby

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why do we?
Keep, keep, k-keep water runs
Keep, k-keep, k-keep, k-peep the water (I)
Keep, k-keep, k-peep
Keep, keep
Keep
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Keep
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby
