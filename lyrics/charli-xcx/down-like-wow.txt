(Why you comin’ down like whoa?)

Beat misplacin’, I’m gone
Drinkin’ liquor, fucked up
Try to call you, dial tone
(Why you comin’ down like whoa?)
When you fuck me, ice cold
Why you actin’ loco
I’m addicted to you
(Why you comin’ down like whoa?)


Ooh
Drivin’ through a lonely, lonely night
Thinkin’ ‘bout you
Wish that you were here to hold me tight
Wanna get out, eh, eh
I can’t seem to get you off my mind
Don’t wanna be alone, alone tonight
Don’t wanna be alone, alone tonight

I don’t know how, I don’t know why
But I keep goin’ and goin’ away
Out of your life, I don’t know why
But I keep goin’ and goin’ away
I don’t know how, I don’t know why
But I keep goin’ and goin’ away
Out of your life, I don’t know why
(Why you comin’ down like whoa?)

(Why you comin’ down like whoa?)
(Why you comin’ down like whoa?)
(Why you comin’ down like, down like)
(Why you comin’ down like whoa?)

Put it on me, don’t front
If you want it, stun gun
Gotta love me, for life
(Why you comin’ down like whoa?)
I’m addicted, pop pills
You’re an up for, my thrill
Don’t you know that, love kills
(Why you comin’ down like whoa?)

Ooh
Drivin’ through a lonely, lonely night
Thinkin’ ‘bout you
Wish that you were here to hold me tight
Wanna get out, eh, eh
I can’t seem to get you off my mind
Don’t wanna be alone, alone tonight
Don’t wanna be alone, alone tonight

I don’t know how, I don’t know why
But I keep goin’ and goin’ away
Out of your life, I don’t know why
But I keep goin’ and goin’ away
I don’t know how, I don’t know why
But I keep goin’ and goin’ away
Out of your life, I don’t know why
(Why you comin’ down like whoa?)

Uh, why you coming down like whoa?
Uh, if you want it round like whoa
Uh, why you coming down like whoa?
Put you underground like whoa
Uh, why you coming down like whoa?
Uh, if you want it round like whoa
Uh, why you coming down like whoa?
Why you coming down like whoa?

I don’t know how, I don’t know why
But I keep goin’ and goin’ away
Out of your life, I don’t know why
But I keep goin’ and goin’ away
I don’t know how, I don’t know why
But I keep goin’ and goin’ away
I just keep goin’ and goin’ away
I just keep goin’ and goin’ away
