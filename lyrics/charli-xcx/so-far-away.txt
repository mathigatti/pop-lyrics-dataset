Give me the poison
I love the poison
Hooked on the poison


I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head again
So I run (so long ago and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I'll drink the poison

Get out my head, get out my bed
I don't believe those three words that you said
Pocket of lies, crystal blue eyes
Hit the ground hard when I dropped from your skies
You're coming up when I'm going down
Never in sync so we just sink and drown
Press restart and reboot my heart
But I'm not a robot so I fell apart
Before the moment we met we were chatting on the Internet
Getting kinda close through the posts that we were looking at
I was pretty confident, you were pretty into that
I linked you to my music just to see if you'd be into it
So fuck the prologue, read the Internet blogs
"Gonna love this star and it came from the clubs."
I wasn't looking for a fuck, I was looking for a bad boy
Bad boy, motherfucker, destroy

I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head again
So I run (so long ago and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head again
So I run (so long ago and so far away)

I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I'll drink the poison
I want the poison, I need the poison
Give me the poison
I love the poison
Hooked on the poison

(So far away
So long ago and so far away
So far away
So long ago and so far away)

Now I know for sure that we've got to end this
You don't get no last kiss
'Cause you're so damn crazy
And I'm so damn helpless
So don't text my number
And don't call my mother
I can't see your face now
'Cause this is over

I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head again
So I run (so long ago and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I'll drink the poison
(So far away
So long ago and so far away)
