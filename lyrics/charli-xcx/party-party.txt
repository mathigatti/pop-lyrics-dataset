Liquour on your mouth like you bleedin'
24/7 party people no sleepin'
Party party all day no, no peakin'
Cuz we got the feelin', we got the feelin', we got the feelin', yeah
Rent a hotel room with the kingsize
All my bestfriends go hard, no lie
Drive a Rolls-Royce comin' out
Do it everyday, do it, do it for life

Fuck a penthouse, we through the ceiling
On the rooftop feeling like I'm dreamin'
Party, party all day no, no leavin'
Cuz we got the feelin', we got the feelin', we got the feelin', yeah

Everybody way, way, way up now
Kawasaki zoom, zoom and it's over
Do it everyday do it, do it, no lie
