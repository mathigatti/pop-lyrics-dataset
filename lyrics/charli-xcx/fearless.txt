I'm fucking fearless
I'll throw some acid in your face
I'm fucking fearless
So just get out of this place


I'm fucking fearless
I'll throw some acid in your face
I'm fucking fearless
So just get out of this place

Started in year nine, began my life of crime
Brought ganja into school, want me take off on a fool
And when I pull out my knife, make sure I make you tight
Your back's against the wall and you're shaking like a fly
Standing their alone like a motherfucking pussy, yo
Bear down blood, your expression was
Flashing like a light-bulb, ping-ping-ping!
Face covered in mold, smacked down apple
The story unfolds, yeah, fearless

I'm fucking fearless
I'll throw some acid in your face
I'm fucking fearless
So just get out of this place

I'm fucking fearless
I'll throw some acid in your face
I'm fucking fearless
So just get out of this place

What you trying to say, love?
What you trying to do?
Better watch your back cause I'm coming for you
Boo-hoo, yeah, you're gonna cry, hope you die
Get some pie in your eyes, why-why my oh my
Uh, fearless, I don't know
That's the way it is man
(I'm a gangster)

I'm fucking fearless
I'll throw some acid in your face
I'm fucking fearless
So just get out of this place

I'm fucking fearless
I'll throw some acid in your face
I'm fucking fearless
So just get out of this place

What happened that night, you wanna tell me?
Ah, mate, I was just taking it in
And he's standing there
And everybody was like,
Ah, mate! Ah, hit him, hit him!
Ah, yeah, stab him!
So, you know, I'm standing there
I'm a gangsta, I'm not proud of it, but I'm fearless
I stabbed him, I stabbed him, I had to do it
He's alright, though!
But you, you know what I am
I'm fearless

I'm fucking fearless
I'm fucking fearless
I'm fucking fearless
