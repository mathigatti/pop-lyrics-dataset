I see you watching out of your eye
You're not gonna win, but you might as well try
You break me down
You're not like other guys, oh no


So jump on in, if you're ready to crash
So drive me fast 'cause this will not last
But if you cut me
Then you turn the magic on tonight

Got my x-ray specs and I'm watching you
I can see you making your every move
Give me your heart on a rope, like a yo-yo-yo
Got my x-ray specs and I'm watching you

You have got me under your spell
And I want to get to know you well
So tell me what you like
And what to do to you

'Cause I'd like to be like a super freak
You can put me in positions that will make you weak
So just wash your eyes
And shut your mouth, don't speak to me

Got my x-ray specs and I'm watching you
I can see you making your every move
Give me your heart on a rope like a yo-yo-yo
Got my x-ray specs and I'm watching you

Like money on a bank account
Can't stay in, you can check me out
Get down on that leather couch
Spin that bottle, c'mon let's make out
Loving all the things that you do to me
Like it when you go down, let's get freaky
My hand wherever you want me
Double double dare yeah let's get crazy

X-ray specs, watching you
X-ray specs, watching you

Got my x-ray specs and I'm watching you
I can see you making your every move
Give me your heart on a rope like a yo-yo-yo
Got my x-ray specs and I'm watching you

X-ray specs, watching you
X-ray specs, watching you
X-ray specs, watching you
X-ray specs, watching you
