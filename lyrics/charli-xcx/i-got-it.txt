[Brooke Candy]
Big tits, double D's
No silicone and no saline
Jealous of me
Envious hoes in the all-green
Hater disease
Bitches, so sick of 'em Dramamine
Bad Brooke Candy
If you ain't mad, well you 'bout to be

[Charli XCX]
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it

[Charli XCX &amp; Brooke Candy]
Ten step, ten keys
Swimming pools going real deep
L.A., A.G. (A.G.!)
Studio with the real beats
So raw, sushi
Crash your daddy's Lamborghini
Charli, baby
Pull up, pull up to the party

[Charli XCX &amp; Brooke Candy]
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it

(Miss cupcakKe is on this track
Have you heard her? Have you seen her?)

[cupcakKe]
Got a couple of bitches that want my attention
They acting real vicious but I'm not offended
They lurking like witnesses, money I'm getting
Could drop an ice tray and I still won't be slipping
Got another check coming in
Got a couple checks I ain't spent
Got fat pockets, need a gym
I made it possible, like Kim
Today I got great times
Square it out like FaceTime
Yellow tape around the body
But not measuring waistlines (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!)
Zero fucks, the amount (what?)
Zero bucks in your account (you broke!)
So many offers on the table (what?)
A bitch gotta eat on the couch

[Charli XCX &amp; Pabllo Vittar]
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it

(Pabllo Vittar) I got it, I got it, I got it, yeah

[Pabllo Vittar]
Controlo qualquer um com a minha bruxaria
Minha bunda é mais forte que feitiçaria
Encanta, magia, atiça, vicia
Consigo o que eu quero se rebolo assim
Não existe ninguém aqui igual a mim, não, não

Todos querem, sim (todos querem, sim)
Me chamam de queen (me chamam de queen)
Todos querem, sim (todos querem, sim, eu sei)
Me chamam de queen
Todos querem, sim
Me chamam de queen
Todos querem, sim
Me chamam de queen
(Todos querem, sim)
