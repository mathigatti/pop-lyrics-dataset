As the rain drops down in this cotton town
We eat candyfloss by the sea
And the more it pours, the more I'm yours
Oh, please, steal the way with me
But there's another girl and she turns your world
You joke she's not a patch on me
And when I watch your eyes, I'm catchin' butterflies
Oh, I wish that you could see me


Wooh, you were the one I have been lookin' for
Wooh, you were the one I never found before

Playin' in the dirt
In your favorite shirt
You plant a kiss upon my lips
And I just stopped and stared
You run your hands through my hair
Electric currents to my fingertips

Wooh, you were the one I have been lookin' for
Wooh, you were the one I never found before

But when Sully Tane heard about my name
She came around and knocked upon my door
When she came around, she stepped my flowers down
Don't want me hanging 'round with you no more
So I moved away to another place
No more candy by the sea

Wooh, you were the one I have been searchin' for
Wooh, you were the one I never found before
