Sometimes I get jealous, sometimes I get reckless
Sometimes I get bitter, fuck up, make it better
Maybe you heard stories, maybe they're all true
And if we make it farther, I'll show it all to you


When I feel alone, I feel ashamed
I wanna know if you would stay with me
When I lose control, I go insane
And I know you can get like that, too
Would you still love me? I would still love you

Would you?
Would you love me if I lost my cool?
In the deep, or the dark days too
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?
Would you love me in my worn out shoes?
If you knew, it could all fall through
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?

Even if you were broke and you couldn't pay rent and you're feeling depressed
Wouldn't love you less, I'd still love you
Even if you were living on nothing but hope from the heart in your chest
I will still be there
(Would you?)

I'm nervous, you see behind the curtain
Crash your car on purpose, just to push you further
Maybe you heard stories, and now you know they're true
But there's another side to me, I'll show it all to you

I lose control, I go insane
And I know you can get like that, too
Would you still love me? I would still love you

Would you?
Would you love me if I lost my cool?
In the deep, or the dark days too
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?
Would you love me in my worn out shoes?
If you knew, it could all fall through
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?

Even if you were broke and you couldn't pay rent and you're feeling depressed
Wouldn't love you less, I'd still love you
Even if you were living on nothing but hope from the heart in your chest
I will still be there
(Would you?)

Would you?
Would you?
If you found someone shiny and brand new
Would you still love me? I would still love you

Would you?
Would you love me if I lost my cool?
In the deep, or the dark days too
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?
Would you love me in my worn out shoes?
If you knew, it could all fall through
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?

Would you?
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?
Would you?
Would you still love me? I would still love you
Would you?
