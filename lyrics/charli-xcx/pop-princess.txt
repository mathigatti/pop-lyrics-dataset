I am a pop princess
Pop princess, p-p-pop princess
I am a pop princess
Pop princess, p-p-pop princess
I am a pop princess
Pop princess, p-p-pop princess
I am a pop princess
Pop-d'pop-d'pop-pop


I am a pop princess
Hip-hop, pop-rock
Skip on the double
It's all about the disco, daddy
Disco, disco, Disney, daddy
Yes, I got my hair extensions
Don't need no singing lessons
Autotune me up, baby
And let's get ravy

You can sing my song
If you wanna sing along, then put your hands in the air
'Cause if you wanna be seen, come and be seen with me
'Cause I'm a pop star
Yeah, I'm a pop star, ooh
Oh, I'm a pop star, ooh

I am a pop princess
Pop princess, p-p-pop princess
I am a pop princess
Watch me sing my song
I am a pop princess
Pop princess, p-p-pop princess
I am a pop princess
Watch me sing my song

Oh, no, you burst my bubble
Now I'm in trouble, trouble
Oh, no, you burst my bubble
Now I'm in trouble, trouble
I am a bad girl, but I got my goodies
Flavoured up in Tutti Frutti
Watch me shake, sh-sh-shake-sh
Shake it in your face
You like that?
There's more where it came from
Come to my live show, then we get the game on
Set me up like a party popper
Woo, woo, woo, I'm a show stopper

I am a show
I am a show
I am a [?] show stopper

I am a pop princess
Pop princess, p-p-pop princess
I am a pop princess
Watch me sing my song
I am a pop princess
Pop princess, p-p-pop princess
I am a pop princess
Watch me sing my song

I am a pop princess
I am a pop princess
Woo, woo, woo
I am a show
I am a show
Blah, pop princess
