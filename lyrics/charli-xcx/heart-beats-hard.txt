Words you said echo through the dark through my ears
Haunted I'm loosing my place
Toxic blood runs through my veins
I start to fade


This heart beats harder everyday, harder everyday, harder everyday
I still see through
To you it's never hard to walk away, purple clouded pain
Harder everyday to see through
Obsessed, I'm meant to build my fences just to break them down
