If these four walls could talk
Then they would tell you to stop
Because you're crushing my bones
And I am breaking your heart
If these four walls could talk


Then they would tell you to stop
Because you're crushing my bones
I'm breaking your heart
Romance is rotting my skin
And we are falling apart

Now what would you say
If I went away
And stole your starlight
Would that be alright?

Now how would it be
If a symphony
Played our favorite song
And got the notes wrong?

Is this the part where the violins kick in?
Is this the part where the drama begins?
Woohoohoohoow

If these voices were real
Then they would tell you to leave
And if these mirrors could speak
They'd tell you to scream
But your body's a mess
Your eyes roll back in a dream

Now what would you say
If I went away
And stole your starlight
Would that be alright?
Now how would it be
If a symphony
Played our favorite song
And got the notes wrong?

Is this the part where the violins kick in?
Is this the part where the drama begins?
This is the part where your toys burn up
And all of my colours fall to the Sun

Is this the part-
Is this the part-
Is this the part-
Is this-, is this-, is this
Is this the part-
Is this the part-
Is this the part-
Is this-, is this-, is this-
Is this the part-
Is this the part-
Is this the part-
Is this-, is this-, is this-

Is this the part where the violins kick in?
Is this the part where the drama begins?
This is the part where your toys burn up
And all of my colours fall to the Sun

Is this the part where the violins kick in?
Is this the part where the drama begins?
This is the part where your toys burn up
And all of my colours fall to the Sun
