I can feel the neon on my skin
Pink and purple colours sinking in
We got electric yellow lightning bolts
They're running through my veins in Tokyo
I think your lips taste just like lemonade
We're spinning through a video arcade
You are the number one, the perfect prize
I see my heartbeat drowning in your eyes


So bright, drink sake in Shinjuku
Think I really like you
Now's the time

Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan

And now the cherry blossom starts to bloom
We lost the keycards to our hotel room
No, I don't need a fancy restaurant
Yeah, I just need your body in my arms
And even though we've got a million lights
You're still the rarest diamond in the sky
You are the fortune, you're a lucky charm
I see our future written in the stars

So bright, drink sake in Shinjuku
Think I really like you
Now's the time

Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan
Let's fall in love in Japan

Lost in streets our heartbeats will collide
Lost in streets our heartbeats will collide
Lost in streets our heartbeats will collide
Lost in streets our heartbeats will collide
Lost in streets our heartbeats will collide
Lost in streets our heartbeats will collide
Lost in streets our heartbeats will collide
Lost in streets our heartbeats will collide
