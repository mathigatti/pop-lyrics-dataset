Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
Baby, you so lu-lu-lu-lucky
You get away with it all, oh
Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
And even though you g-g-g-got me
You still want it all


So, can I ask you a question?
Do you ever feel guilt for what you've done?
Call you, you got no reception
You're breaking up
Tell you I believe you, but I don't

Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
Baby, you so lu-lu-lu-lucky
You get away with it all
Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
And even though you g-g-g-got me
You still want it all

So, can I ask you a question?
Do you ever feel guilt for what you've done?
Call you, you got no reception
You're breaking up
Tell you I believe you, but I don't

Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
But did you ever l-l-l-love me?
You're just way too numb (numb)
Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
No you never l-l-l-loved me
And I am all alone

All alone
All alone
All alone
