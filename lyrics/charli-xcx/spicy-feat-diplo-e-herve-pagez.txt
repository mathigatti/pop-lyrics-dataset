If you want my future, forget my past
If you wanna get with me, better make it fast
Now don't go wasting my precious time
Get your act together, we could be just fine


What do you think about that, now you know how I feel?
Say you can handle my love, are you for real?
I won't be hasty, I'll give you a try
If you really bug me, then I'll say goodbye

If you want my future, forget my past
If you wanna get with me, better make it fast
Now don't go wasting my precious time
Get your act together, we could be just fine

What do you think about that, now you know how I feel?
Say you can handle my love, are you for real?
I won't be hasty, I'll give you a try
If you really bug me, then I'll say goodbye
