[Charli XCX]
I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up
I go to parties with strangers so I can figure it out
Run through a city at midnight to feel like a star
I want it all, even if it's fake


[Charli XCX]
Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all (told you it all)
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know (I'll never know)
I know I'm wrong, what a mistake
Don't ever change (don't ever change)
I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up

[Charli XCX]
In the backseat
Your song, so loud
Drivin' so fast
I'm better off alone

[Charli XCX]
All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone

[Carly Rae Jepsen]
I'm wide awake, lyin' next to him and feel it all
I got a thirst for distraction that I can't take back
My fingers run through his hair
I'm grippin' at regrets
I put my mouth on his lips to taste

[Carly Rae Jepsen]
Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all (told you it all)
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know (I'll never know)
All that went wrong, what a mistake
I'll never change (I'll never change)
I can't escape all the voices and so I turn it up

[Carly Rae Jepsen]
In the backseat
Your song, so loud
Drivin' so fast
I'm better off alone

[Charli XCX &amp; Carly Rae Jepsen]
All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone

[Carly Rae Jepsen]
Wake lyin' next
I'm wide awake lyin' next
I'm wide awake lyin' next
I'm wide awake lyin' next
Take back, I gotta take back
I gotta take back, I gotta take back, I gotta
(In the)
My fingers run through his hair
My fingers run through his hair
(You're so)
My fingers run through his hair
My fingers run through his hair
(Drivin') in the (in the)
I gotta take back
All alone, all alone, all alone

[Charli XCX &amp; Carly Rae Jepsen]
All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone

[Charli XCX]
It's Charli, baby
It's Charli, baby
