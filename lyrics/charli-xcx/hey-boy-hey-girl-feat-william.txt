Hey lady, what's your name?
Let me take your picture, baby, cause I like your frame (okay)
Hey boy (what's up?), let's play this game (alright)
But I like it crazy, baby (so do I); my life's insane (shit)
Hell yeah, that's the shit that I like
Crazy girls, going wild, that's my type, yeah
Oh shit, here we go, let's ride (let's ride)
Rollercoaster, up and down, all night


Romance (to the beat)
Romance (to the beat)
Romance (to the beat)
Romance (ahh!)

I got what you want
Baby, what you waitin' for?
I got what you like
Baby, what you waitin' for?
Me and you, we think alike
Blowing up like dynamite
What you, what you, what you waitin' for?
What you, what you, what you waitin' for?

Hey lady, what you do?
Let me buy you a drink baby, how bout' two?
Hey boy, you seem kinda cool
Since you got a table, can I hang with you?
I got liquor, I got bubbles, what you need?
CÃ®roc, take a shot, it's on me
Let's get drunk, turn up, being free
In the club, every day, melody

Romance (to the beat)
Romance (to the beat)
Romance (to the beat)
Romance (woo!)

I got what you want
Baby, what you waitin' for?
I got what you like
Baby, what you waitin' for?
Me and you, we think alike
Blowing up like dynamite
What you, what you, what you waitin' for?
What you, what you, what you waitin' for?

This is the part where
We're dancing, lose our minds
On the floor, just groovin'
To music, so alive
