You got wires, going in
You got wires, coming out of your skin
You got tears, making tracks
I got tears that are scared of the facts


Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflecting in your eyes

You got wires, going in
You got wires, coming out of your skin
There's dried blood on your wrist
Your dried blood on my fingertips

Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflecting in your eyes
First night of your life, curled up on your own
Looking at you now, you would never know

I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
Alright

Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflecting in your eyes
Down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
First night of your life, curled up on your own
Looking at you now, you would never know
