You’re beautiful with golden hair and black eyes
But you’re alone, you’re in the cold
So you hide


Young hearts, run free
Let our inhibitions be swinging through the vine trees
Young hearts, run free
You can drive me crazy, baby, baby

You’re beautiful with golden hair
But you’re alone, you’re in the cold
Young hearts run free
Young hearts run free

Into the jungle
Oh, this could be our starting out, a wild night
And as the wind goes through your hair, you’ll find
Young hearts run free
Young hearts run free
Into the jungle
Into the jungle
