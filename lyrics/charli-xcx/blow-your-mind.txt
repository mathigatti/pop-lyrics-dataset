People never get it right
Think I'm sweet like a lullaby
But nothing's ever black or white
Yeah, there's more to me than the eye can see
Now, I'm done with being shy
Put my reputation on the line
Slaying like a samurai
I'm like TNT, strike a match on me


Uh, uh, uhhh
I be good, I be bad
Be the best that you had
Uh, uh, uhhh
Get you up, get you down
Yeah, you think you know me now, uhh (hey!)

I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)
I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)

Torture, this came naturally
I got that magical remedy
Knew I'd have you fallin' to your knees
Looked into my eyes, got you mesmerized
Forbidden fruit is drippin' sweet
Poisonin' the heart of me
I can make your dreams reality
I'll get your body hot, make you feel alive

Uh, uh, uhhh
I be good, I be bad
Be the best that you had
Uh, uh, uhhh
Get you up, get you down
Yeah, you think you know me now, uhh (hey!)

I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)
I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)

Uh, uh, uhhh
Uh, uh, uhhh
Uh, uh, uhhh
Uh, uh, uhhh

(Hey!) I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)
I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
Boy, it will blow your mind
Uh, uh, uhhh, baby
I can give you everything if you want it (hey!)

(Hey!) I'll show you my darker side (uh-huh!)
