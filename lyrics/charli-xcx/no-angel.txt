Always been a little bit fast and wild
My mama always said I was a problem child
I'm just livin' life until the day I die
It's all I know
That's how I roll


I party, get naughty
Always tellin' myself I'll never do this again
I'm sorry that you caught me
Fuckin' in the hotel, it didn't mean anything

Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn

The second that you saw me, you were mesmerized
Bet you probably thought I was your ride or die
Don't wanna burst your bubble, but I cheat and lie
It's the truth, I'm bad news

I party, get naughty
Always tellin' myself, I'll never do this again
I'm sorry that you caught me
Fuckin' in the hotel, it didn't mean anything

Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh

Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh-oh)
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh-oh)
I'm no angel, but I can learn

Ooh, feels so good, feels so good, feels so good
Maybe you're just too good for me
But you're in too deep, yeah
Ooh, I get stressed out, it's too much, the pressure is on
And I can't quite breathe
If I go there, pull me right back, yeah

I party, get naughty
Always tellin' myself I'll never do this again
I'm sorry that you caught me fuckin' in the hotel
It didn't really mean anything

Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh

Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh-oh)
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh-oh)
I'm no angel, but I can learn
