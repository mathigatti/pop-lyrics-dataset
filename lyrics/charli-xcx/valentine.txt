I had to sit back, listen to poetry all day
And i tried to escape but they won't let run away
So i tried to hide but they wouldn't let me hide
So i tried to find you but i couldn't find you anywhere


And i was sitting next to you in the biology lecture
And i pretended i didn't understand just to capture your attention
And then i smiled, and then you smiled, and then i smiled,
And it was all worth my while.
All worth my while

But later on by the sofa, i wanted to kiss you, i wanted to kiss you
But i couldn't get that close, no i couldn't get that close
And when you opened your eyes, it was like
You didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And i wanted to run away yeah, and i wanted to run away yeah

Cos i was told that you liked me, i was told that you liked me yeah
But obviously not
I was told that you liked me, i was told that you liked me yeah
But obviously not

And i once told someone, they should write some golden(?) poetry
Cause it would get them far in the music industry
It'd do them good i guess that's what i'm doing now
I'm doing good yeah, i knew i'd have to do it sometime

And i hope i get to see you on february the 14th,
Cos then i might be able to try this whole thing again some other time
Oh you can be my valentine, oh it's the time,
Will you be my valentine, valentine

But later on by the sofa, i wanted to kiss you, i wanted to kiss you
But i couldn't get that close, no i couldn't get that close

And when you opened your eyes, it was like you
Didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And i wanted to run away yeah, i wanted to run away yeah

Cos i was told that you loved me, i was told that you liked me yeah
But obviously not
Yeah i was told that you loved me, i was told that you loved me yeah
But obviously not

Oh i'm starting to worry, that i'm sounding like the fray
Cause i hate the way they talk about sadness and life decay
But they must talk some sense, if they knew how to save a life
But i never talk sense no i haven't done this right
Well i'm starting to worry, that i'm sounding like the fray
Cause i hate the way they talk about sadness and life decay
But they must talk some sense, if they knew how to save a life
But i never talk sense no i haven't done this right

Last year on the sofa, i wanted to kiss you, i wanted to kiss you
But i couldn't get that close, no i couldn't get that close
And when you opened your eyes, it was like you
Didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And i wanted to run away yeah, i wanted to run away

I was told that you loved me, i was told that you liked me yeah
But obviously not
Yeah i was told that you loved me, i was told that you liked me yeah
But obviously not no
No no no
Obviously not
Yeah
