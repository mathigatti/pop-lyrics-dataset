What's been goin' on this week
Well, people started dealin' speed
And kids my age start smokin' weed
Just so that they can get some sleep
'Cause parents, they get really mad
When their children start to turn all bad
And start hanging out with the wrong group of lads
Who smoke dodgy slips and pick fights with the chavs


But they forget
You can't rewind, no
You can't turn back time
'Cause there's always gonna be a better grassy side
But no one's gonna get there
So, just let them live their lives

Take a look inside the bag
It's enough to make you want to gag
'Cause you find out your daughter's a filthy slag
Some naked pictures and a box of sucky fags
'Cause parents, they get really mean
And they start to get all threatening
Saying they'll pack you out onto the street
If you come in late, smelling of green

But they forget
You can't rewind, no
You can't turn back time
'Cause there's always gonna be a better grassy side
But no one's gonna get there
So, just let them live their lives

What's been goin' on today
Well, susie didn't have a say
So she got her things and ran away
Never showed her face again
And johnny failed every exam
Screwed up his parents' whole life plan
They got no job, can't be no money
He's a lazy ass, not a helpin' hand

'Cause parents, they get really mad
When their children start to turn all bad
And start hanging out with the wrong group of lads
Who smoke dodgy slips and pick fights with the chavs
'Cause parents, they get really mean
And they start to get all threatening
Saying they'll pack you out onto the street
If you come in late, smelling of green

But they forget
You can't rewind, no
You can't turn back time
'Cause there's always gonna be a better grassy side
But no one's gonna get there
So, just let them live their lives

Go on, let them live it
They're gonna just live their lives
Let her take another drug 'cause
They're gonna just live their lives
