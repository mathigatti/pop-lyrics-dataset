Purple and scarred
Is the color that will be on my heart
When you are done and dusting with me
I fall apart
When I watch you touch yourself on my skin
I know you're tired of sticking to me


Deep in black roses
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses
I've got a diamond desire
Gonna step into the blue fire
Touching your lips with my skin
I'm on another level
I can't let go

So tell the gun to sin
Like an angel with the dirty wings
Tainted by tastes of the soul
This is another level
I need to love
Deep in black roses
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses
Black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses

You're turning me off
I won't praise a man to fuck but you keep turning' me on
You're turning me on you're turning me off

Black roses
Cold, dark dust
Cold, dark dust
Cold, dark dust
Black roses
Black roses

Deep in black roses
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses
Black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses
Black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses
Black roses
Black roses
