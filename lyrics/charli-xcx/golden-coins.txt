My grills are so neat, drip icy cold
Got offshore bank accounts and diamond blue palm trees
My platinum troubles are drowning in pink champagne
Escape into the sky in my own private jet
That's what I dream of in my head


Gold coins everywhere
Dollars up in the air
It's a billionaire's love affair
Gold coins out the window
Money pours like the rain falls
And I'm spending like I don't care

Richlist and Bentley's, that's how I roll
These rock stars buy me posted up with rubies rare
I stack it so high
Build a pretty green castle wall
I'll hide inside my fortress milking in my bed
That's what I dream of in my head

Gold coins everywhere
Dollars up in the air
It's a billionaire's love affair
Gold coins out the window
Money pours like the rain falls
And I'm spending like I don't care

Gold coins everywhere
Dollars up in the air
It's a billionaire's love affair

Gold coins everywhere
Dollars up in the air
It's a billionaire's love affair
Gold coins out the window
Money pours like the rain falls
And I'm spending like I don't care
