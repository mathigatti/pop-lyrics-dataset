Finishing eight or nine, tell me what's the perfect time
Told you I'd be waiting, hiding from the rainfall


Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom

Tell me what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased
On my last strength against all that you believed

Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Please, as our faces know

Young as I want to know, I will never let you go
Trade in a baseball, never as our faces know

Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom

Uh-oh

Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom

Finishing eight or nine, tell me what's the perfect time
(Finishing eight or nine, tell me what's the perfect time)
Told you I'd be waiting, hiding from the rainfall
(Told you I'd be waiting, hiding from the rainfall)
Tell me what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased
(Tell me what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased)
On my last strength against all that you believed
(On my last strength against all that you believed)
I said I'm on my last strength against all that you believed
(I said I'm on my last strength against all that you believed)
You know I'm on my last strength against all that you believe
