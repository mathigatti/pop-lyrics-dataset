Don't say you love me, 'cause I can't say it back
Don't say you're sorry, 'cause you've done nothing bad
Swallow my feelings, but I won't swallow my pride
You know I've got a suit of armor on, you'll never see me cry


I hate the silence, that's why the music's always loud
So many problems, I try to drown em out
One thousand bottles, collecting souvenirs
You know it's so hard to admit it, but the only good inside of me is

You
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch, woah

Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting your feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

You're so forgiving (ah-ah), my friends think you're the best
From the beginning (ah-ah), your friends said it wouldn't last
But this connection (ah-ah), it's something they don't see
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the best damn part of me was always

You
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch, woah

Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting your feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love, oh, your love, yeah
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love, oh, your love

Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking (when your heart is breaking, yeah)
You keep on taking me back (oh)
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting your feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve you
