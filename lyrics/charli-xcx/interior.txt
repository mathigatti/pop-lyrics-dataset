Sure you know what you are after
Open up every scar
I’ve been known to strike like disaster
They say I hit hard


Think anyone, anyone but you
Anyone, anyone but
Think anyone, anyone but you
Should've known what you were after

When you fell in love
Interior design
Off (my heart) I fell in love
Interior design
Off (my heart) I fell in love
Interior design
Off (my heart) I fell in love
Interior design
Off my heart

Now I've got you where I want you
But never say you were no want
I'll make you wish you were never born
The harder you fight, the harder you fall

Think anyone, anyone but you
Anyone, anyone but
Think anyone, anyone but you
Should've known what you were after

When you fell in love
Interior design
Off (my heart) I fell in love
Interior design
Off (my heart) I fell in love
Interior design
Off (my heart) I fell in love
Interior design
Off my heart

Thought I was placed at store I was naked
It’s just like another pie wrapped in the plastic
Got got love but you’re never gonna have it
Fell so hard, like alice in the rabbit
Locked down, can’t move
Now you don’t know what to do
Took a bite of the apple, went straight to core
Fell in love with my interior

Think anyone, anyone but you
Anyone, anyone but
Think anyone, anyone but you
Should've known what you were after

When you fell in love
Interior design
Off (my heart) I fell in love
Interior design
Off (my heart) I fell in love
Interior design
Off (my heart) I fell in love
Interior design

When you fell in love
Fell in love
Fell in love
Fell in love
