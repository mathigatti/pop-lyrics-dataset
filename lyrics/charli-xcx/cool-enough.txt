You got a mansion, and a really nice car
Diamonds for breakfast and you're living like a superstar
You're on the guest list, with your VIP friends
Keep checking your phone, for the number of the girl you met
You got your contacts, and you think you're hooked up


You're friends with DJs, and you're on stage when you're in the club
But you can’t buy me with your labels and bills
Won't stop you trying, I was going in for the kill

Toys and boys playing games with no names
Can't you see, it's just so basic
I still gotta know

Do you think you're cool enough?
(To hang around with me)
Do you think you're cool enough?
(To taste this candy)
You might be putting on a good show
And you're talking like you're a pro
But you're not cool enough
To be my baby

I hurt your feelings, now the cat's got your tongue (Question, q-)
Now you're still being, chewed up like bubblegum
Do my words sting you like the smoke in your eyes?
You keep on trying, tryna get me, no big surprise

Toys and boys playing games with no names
Can't you see, it's just so basic
I still gotta know

Do you think you're cool enough?
(To hang around with me)
Do you think you're cool enough?
(To taste this candy)
You might be putting on a good show
And you're talking like you're a pro
But you're not cool enough
To be my baby

Do you think you're cool enough?
(To hang around with me)
Do you think you're cool enough?
(To taste this candy)
You might be putting on a good show
And you're talking like you're a pro
But you're not cool enough
To be my baby

Do you think you're cool enough?
(To hang around with me)
Do you think you're cool enough?

You might be putting on a good show
And you're talking like you're a pro
But you're not cool enough

But you're not cool enough
To be my baby

Woah, ooh-woah-ooh-woah (Oh!)
Woah, ooh-woah-ooh-woah (Hey!)
Woah, ooh-woah-ooh-woah (Oh!)
(Taste this candy-dy-dy)
