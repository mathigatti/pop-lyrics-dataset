We shine when the lights go out
I wanna kiss you in the nightclub
Lips brush right across your mouth
My heart is beating and it won't stop


You, you got me feeling a second away
You make me feel like I wanna scream out
Ooh, we got this moment, don't let it slip away
So tell me, now I gotta find out

Do you want to roll with me?
Do you want to roll with me? (Say yeah!)
Do you want to roll with me?
Do you want to roll with me? (Do ya? Do ya?)

Your touch got me off the ground
It's like we're living in a daydream
Skylines spinning 'round and 'round
And then you tell me that you love me

You, you got me feeling a second away
You make me feel like I wanna scream out
Ooh, we got this moment, don't let it slip away
So tell me, now I gotta find out

Do you want to roll with me?
Do you want to roll with me? (Say yeah!)
Do you want to roll with me?
