Friday night at the club, got my gloves on
Swishy-swish, gold locks, ponytail, stun gun
Long nails with the gloss on, dressed up like a champion
Whip it, whip it good
Dude, don't touch me 'cause I'm on one, yeah
Feeling super fly, heavyweight, don't cross the line
Yes, I'm kinda drunk, but I just came to have a good time
That guy in the corner keeps on looking at my behind
Ugh, what you looking at, you better run, run for your life


I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war

(Hua!) like I do karate
(Hya!) like I do judo
(Fua!) like I do kickboxing
Total t.k.o

Wait a second, think he wants to step into the ring
Staring at my chest, boy, put your eyes where I can see them
Hands off, don't touch, I'm not your property, I'm leavin'
Pester me again, I'm gonna have to kick your teeth in
Oh, now he's laughing with his friends, they think it's funny
"She's acting like a virgin, bet she never sucks dick"
Hey, let me tell you something
Your mummy taught you nothin'
Don't need 20 rounds to beat you
Baby, I'm not bluffin'

I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war
I wanna start a war

(Hua!) like I do karate
(Hya!) like I do judo
(Fua!) like I do kickboxing
Total t.k.o
(Hua!) like I do karate
