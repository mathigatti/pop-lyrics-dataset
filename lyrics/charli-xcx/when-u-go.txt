Oh, na, na

When I was tall enough
I was already on my way
But I can't go


'Cause you were like
Tell me like
And I wasted all my weight
Don't let go

When you go
I can take it, take it, no
When you're up and down
When you're up and down

Don't go
I can't take anymore when you're
When you're up and down
When you're up and down, I know

'Cause I go the wrong the wrong way
Imma the wrong the wrong way
And you're all along along the way
I don't know, I don't know

So when you go
Don't come around
Don't tear me down tonight
I'mma get it on and on

All in one night
I was only by your side
Yeah yeah uh

Just off one light
I was only by you
But I didn't, no no

'Cause I don't wanna go, I go away
I just wanna make you make you stay
'Cause I'd rather
Go up and down
Go up and down, babe

I don't wanna go, I go away
I just wanna make you make you stay
'Cause I wanna
Go up and down
No way, no way

So when you go
I can take it, take it no
When you're up and down
When you're up and down

Don't go
I can't take it no more when you're
When you're up and down
When you're up and down, I know

'Cause I go the wrong the wrong way
Imma go the wrong the wrong way
And you're all along along the way
I don't know
I don't know

So when you go
Don't come around
Don't tear me down tonight
I'mma get it on and on
