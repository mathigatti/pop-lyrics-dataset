Baby what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You’re starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don’t want to see your face
I’m starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart


Brooke candy!
We were on some bonnie and clyde shit
Kept the blunts rolled, always let you take the first hit
When the feds caught us, I said I would take the rap
‘Cause I know it ain’t easy living life in the trap

I was the queen B and you were like my Jay-z
Only one who held me down when I was fucking crazy
Ivanka and trump, yeah, we coulda ran the world
You were my chris brown, I was your only girl

Let you put your feet up while I was cooking you breakfast
Thought I found my ride or die, but now I just regret shit
Log into your email ‘cause I knew that shit was wrong
Pulling up a private photo of a bitch showing her thong

And I look a little closer, it’s my home-girl lisa
Time to terminate shit, hasta la vista
Married to the mob so I put a hit on it
Handed you my word, then you took a shit on it
That’s fucked up

Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You’re starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don’t want to see your face
I’m starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart

No I’ma fuck your shit up
Set fire to your pick up
And drive it super sonic
Crash and burn it with my sister
No I don’t need a mister
Cancel the babysitter
I’m never going down that road
It’s easy to resist ya

You broke my heart
And I’m never gonna forget this
You broke my heart
And now I’m coming back to get ya don’t you know

Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You’re starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don’t want to see your face
I’m starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart

Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You’re starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don’t want to see your face
I’m starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart
