Tonight, we're in paradise
Soaring through the sky
Seeing pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
We're in paradise
Soaring through the sky
Seeing pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right


Sparks burning in my heart
You got me through the dark
I look at you, you feel it too
Hands, touching palm-to-palm
Connection feeling strong
We're wild and free, and I believe

Tonight, we're in paradise
Soaring through the sky
Seeing pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
We're in paradise
Soaring through the sky
Seeing pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

Yeah, we can make it right
Yeah, we can make it right
Yeah, we can make it right

Home, I found it in your eyes
You give me butterflies
And when we touch, I feel the rush
Sweet, just like a cherry drop
So please don't let it stop
In love with you, we're stuck like glue

Tonight, we're in paradise
Soaring through the sky
Seeing pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
We're in paradise
Soaring through the sky
Seeing pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

Running away and setting on skylight
Rebels and pineapples in my dreams
Dance while we're young on top of the mountain
(Yeah, we can make it right)
Kissing your lips and feeling electric
Fantasy glow in purple and green
Dance while we're young on top of the mountain
(Yeah, we can make it right)
