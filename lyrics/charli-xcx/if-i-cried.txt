Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh


Hello, hello, call me cold, call me icy
I been buildin' up a wall to protect my heart
I got numbers to reveal what's inside me
I'm lookin' at you, I'm tellin' the truth
'Cause I wanna show you sides that you ain't seen
But I'm scared in case you run when I fall apart
Think I'm ready to reveal what inside me
I'm lookin' at you, now tell me the truth, yeah

So if I cried would you do anything to keep me safe?
Would you stand by or would my honesty make you go break?
Yeah, if I cried would you know all the things to do
Would you, would you-ou?
So if I cried would you do anything to feel my pain?
Would you stand by or would you hide and slowly fade away
Yeah, if I cried would you know all the things to do
Would you, would you-ou?

Would you understand how I feel?
Would you give me patience? Be real
Make me smile, keep the water so still (So still, so still)
Oh, would you make sure I was alright?
Would you wrap your arms all around body, so tight?
I need these things to feel okay with you
Now tell me the truth
