You shoot like a star
You're coming my way
You're coming my way
A rose through the dark
I don't feel the pain
I don't feel the pain


Sometimes I think about you
Maybe we could do it
I heard you say you've got that
You need to prove it
I'm bored of all these dudes
I think I need some new shit
Give me that new shit

Tonight
I want a piece so dumb and young and stupid
Let's get a baby like a fire tonight
Boy get my t-shirt where we're light and fluid
Let's strike a match
Let's burn it up

Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burnin'
Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burnin'
Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burnin'
Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burning up

You're smoking me up
Let's dance in the flames
Let's dance in the flames
And after tonight
We won't be the same
We won't be the same

Sometimes I think about you
Maybe we could do it
I heard you say you've got that
You need to prove it
I'm bored of all these dudes
I think I need some new shit
Give me that new shit

Tonight
I want a piece so dumb and young and stupid
Let's get a baby like a fire tonight
Boy get my t-shirt where we're light and fluid
Let's strike a match
Let's burn it up

Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burnin'
Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burnin'
Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burnin'
Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burning up

I'm burning
I'm burning
I'm burning u-u-up
I'm burning
I'm burning
I'm burning u-u-up
U-u-up

Tonight
I want a piece so dumb and young and stupid
Let's get a baby like a fire tonight
Boy get my t-shirt where we're light and fluid
Let's strike a match
Let's burn it up

Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burnin'
Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burnin'
Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burnin'
Oohoohoohoohoo yeah
I'm burning up
