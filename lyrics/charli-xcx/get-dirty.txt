All you wanna do is stay and fuck me
All I wanna do is stay at the party
All I wanna do is move my body (body)
All you wanna do is watch the TV
All I wanna do is get down and freaky
All I wanna do is move my body (body)


'Cause I'm so tired of the things you do
I wish you'd shut up, get down
Get loose and get dirty

Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty

All you wanna do is watch your clock tick
All I wanna do is play loud music
All I wanna do is get intoxicated (baby)
All you wanna do is sit on the sof√°
All I wanna do ride the rollercoaster
Seven nights a week, let's do it over and over again

'Cause I'm so tired of the things you do
I wish you'd shut up, get down
Get loose and get dirty

Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty

You know I've tried so hard to get clean
The party scent is clinging to my skin
I guess there's nothing else left for me
I'm gonna have to stay so dirty

Get loose and get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty
