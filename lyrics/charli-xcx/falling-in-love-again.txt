Yeah, we're going to Brit's Valentine's party next weekend

Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again


I have been known to mess around in the past
This time, I promise I'm real
But I look out my eyes and see some pretty faces
And I'm not sure what to feel

You got this cute little face and a cute little accent
Want to put you in my pocket, cause you're such an attraction
Lost inside a toy store, and I'm getting distracted
So please help me out, don't think I'm being dramatic
I can see this handsome teddy that I'd knock over there
With the big brown eyes and the curly hair
I want to go and check him out, but I know it's not fair
I need to get out of the room, need to clear my head, oh!

Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again

Now, please don't think that I am having second thoughts
You know that we are meant to be
But when I look around and see these other faces
It's so appealing to me

'Cause I remember last year, sitting there on the sofa
Got my heart broken when I moved a little closer
And a year later, yeah, we're still together
'Cause I patched up the scratches and my heart got better
Now I'm looking around and I feel a bit strange
I can hear these other teddies always calling my name
They say they'd buy me lots of presents, and they'd push all my buttons
But I can't tell them all this trouble's gonna burst my bubble, uh-oh!

Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again

I wish I could be like a Barbie doll
She's got one man meant for her
She doesn't have to choose, she's not gonna lose
Ken's the only one for her
I wish I could be like a Barbie doll
She's got one man meant for her
She doesn't have to choose, she's not gonna lose
Ken's the only one for her

I wish I could be like a Barbie doll
She's got one man meant for her
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again)
She doesn't have to choose, she's not gonna lose
Ken's the only one for her
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again)
I wish I could be like a Barbie doll
She's got one man meant for her
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again)
She doesn't have to choose, she's not gonna lose
Ken's the only one for her
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
