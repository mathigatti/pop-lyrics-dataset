Now if I had to be honest with ya
I thought you did fancy me just a little bit
It was like one of 'em twisted love tales
The endings didn't quite fit but
You were different
A rock and roll troll with your hair greased up, all in leather
And I was a perky girl, polka-dots, hair in curls
Close friends all quite clever


It didn't really happen to start with
I have to say, I thought that maybe
I was wrong and you'd like to go, you know, on holiday
Or that you liked me
But then I thought
'Hey, what does she have to offer that I don't?'
Three rolls-royces and a cruise boat
But you picked the tramp over the queen

And you know
I actually liked you
You made me laugh lots
Made me giggle when I sipped my drink
Made me put more effort into my lyrics
It didn't really happen to start with
I have to say, I thought that you were
Still obsessed by the model stunners
Like lily coll and that brazilian chick
Whoa, oh, oh

What do you say when you think it's time
To walk away, turn around, wave goodbye?
Or come and politely kiss me on the cheek, by my side?
Now that it's over, will you take my picture off your wall
Fill it with the holiday girl and lily coll
Or will you just leave me there to hang on peacefully?
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
