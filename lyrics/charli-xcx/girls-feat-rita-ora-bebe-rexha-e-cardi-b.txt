Her name is Laura, we learned a lotta
How to do it, like we do it, like we wanna
We just know, we just know

I'm fifty-fifty and I'm never gonna hide it
You should know, eh

All summer, we've been in the booth

Just rolling J's, kush loving
And last night, yeah, we got with a dude

Sometimes I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
