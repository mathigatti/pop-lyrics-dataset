You know I need the windows rolled down
Hundred miles, tires screech
Burnin' rubber, limousine off the chain
I go for 24 hour, neon pink, bring the heat
'Bout to swerve-a-swerve right through your lane


It's like we're on the same wave
It's like we're on the same wave, now
We 'bout to go Miami
It's like we're on the same wave, no, no, no

I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride (shh)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride (shh)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride (right now), drugs in the ride (right now)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride (right now), drugs in the ride (right now)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride (I wanna)

Foot on the gas
Squeezinâ€™ on it like juice
Pedal pusher, sippin' on lemonade
Kaleidoscope, traffic light
All I see is red and blues
Guess we got a couple friends on the way

It's like we're on the same wave
It's like we're on the same wave, now
We 'bout to go Miami
It's like we're on the same wave, no, no, no

I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride (right now), drugs in the ride (right now)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride (I wanna, yeah)
