I always think about you when I'm high
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
You call me up and then I'm satisfied
I touch myself and then I'm not alone no more
I always think about you when I'm high
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
You call me up and then I'm satisfied
Do somethin' special to me

Wanna take your picture, you're so delicious
Gimme icy vision, the head so clever
Can you keep me with ya?
Gotta touch your treasure, icy like November
The vicious kingdom
Wanna take your picture, you're so delicious
Like the architecture, I won't forget you
Got me in the bathroom, got me in the mirror
Puttin' on the pressure
(E-e-X-C-X)

Oh
There's no wifi in forest
I found a better connection (connect)
No mirrors nearby, but I see a better reflection
I was fucked by the nature, we didn't use protection
Made a lot of trees, they are now in a book section
No cameras, no lights, but a lot of action (flash)
Yeah, Summer turnin' Winter, c'mon little mama Jackson
Slow like water, no Beats by Dre, but beats by your father

I always think about you when I'm high, yeah, yeah
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah, yeah
You call me up then I'm satisfied, yeah, yeah
Touch myself then I'm not alone, yeah
I always think about you when I'm high, high, high, high
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
You call me up and I'm satis-satisfied, yeah, ye-

Boom clap, the sound of my heart
Алё?

Tell it to me, do it straightforward
Run it up and then we fast forward
Tint the windows on the Range Rover
Drive it in like you're the best chauffeur
Switch it up, bipolar
Colorado, how you take over
Got an angel, got me real closer
Running it just like a halo, yeah
Never let me go, never let me go, no
Want a little more, when it rains, it pours, yeah
I'ma care for you, run it up and then we fast forward
Leave a message here, record on, yeah
Yeah

I always think about you when I'm high (When I'm high)
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah (Tele-tele)
You call me up and then I'm satisfied
I touch myself and then I'm not alone no more (No more)
I always think about you when I'm high (When I'm high)
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
You call me up and then I'm satisfied
Сука, почему ты мне не звонишь? Почему ты мне не звонишь, а?
I touch myself and then I'm not alone no more

I always think about you when I'm high (When I'm high)
