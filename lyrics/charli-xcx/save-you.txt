I feel numb, in the night
Would you fight for my life?
Am I there in the dark of your mind?


If you leave, I will stay
I will cry, I'd break
Love is blue, I'm the one untrue
For you

I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you
I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you, to save you

A touch so sweet, it's alright
As we float into the light
I am here in the black, I'm behind

Feeling bold, feeling brave
Lucky chance we take
If you fall (if you fall), I will still
I'll kill for you

I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you
I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you, to save you

I see your heart
Your bones are shaking
I see your heart
I'm here to save you

I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you
I see your heart start to break
Your blood your bones start to shake
I took your line and earthquake away
To save you, to save you
