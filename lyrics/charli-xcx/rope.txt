I'm slipping from the rope
Got to let go
A million miles to fall down
I'm swimming through the smoke
I'm high on rope
A million miles to fall


Come and beat me u-u-up
Wanna feel your ru-u-ush
Running through my blo-o-ood
Say you want me, say you want me
Know you will
I'm slipping from the rope
Got to let go
So catch me when I fall down

I'm slipping from the rope
Got to let go
A million miles to fall down
I'm swimming through the smoke
I'm high on rope
A million miles to fall

Come and beat me u-u-up
Wanna feel your ru-u-ush
Running through my blo-o-ood
Say you want me, say you want me
Know you will
I'm slipping from for the rope
Got to let go
So catch me when I fall down

I'm slipping from the rope
Got to let go
A million miles to fall down
I'm swimming through the smoke
I'm high on rope
A million miles to fall

Come and beat me u-u-up
Wanna feel your ru-u-ush
Running through my blo-o-ood
Say you want me, say you want me
Know you will
I'm slipping from the rope
Got to let go
So catch me when I fall down
