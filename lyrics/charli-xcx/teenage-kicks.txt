Give a fuck about love, baby I'm a runaway
There's never gonna be us, doesn't mean you shouldn't stay


'Cause I take you there, and you take me there
Yeah, we should be there together
Give a fuck about love, baby I'm a runaway
I just wanna, I wanna escape
Getting drunk on cheap champagne
Take a chance, make a little mistake or two
I just want a forever spring break
In my underwear, dance in the rain
Take a chance, make a million mistakes with you

'Cause we only got one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
'Cause we only got one life, one life
We don't gotta fall in
These teenage kicks are gold
For you, I'd trade it all for one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
Fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in

Roll it all the way down, leaning out the limousine
Yeah, we're blossoming now, show you things you never seen

'Cause I take you there, and you take me there
Yeah, we should be there together
Give a fuck about love, baby we got all we need
I just wanna, I wanna escape
Getting drunk on cheap champagne
Take a chance, make a little mistake or two
I just want a forever spring break
In my underwear, dance in the rain
Take a chance, make a million mistakes with you

'Cause we only got one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
'Cause we only got one life, one life
We don't gotta fall in
These teenage kicks are gold
For you, I'd trade it all for one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
Fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in

I'm in love with this feeling, got me high as the ceiling
And I'm not coming down, down
I'm not coming down
I'm in love with this feeling, got me high as the ceiling 
And I'm not coming down, down
I'm not coming down
Yeah, we all the way up
All the way up

'Cause we only got one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
'Cause we only got one life, one life
We don't gotta fall in
These teenage kicks are gold
For you, I'd trade it all for one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
Fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love
