There's too many omens that I didn't heed
They help me to the wire and pulled at the teeth


They tell me
They know me
And they hold me
But they can never control me

Life
No one can steal my life, my reverie
The tides have done the worst they can to me
For now I bide my time, while my eyes are filled with bloody oceans and I'll
Strike the moment no one notice me

I've known to be ferocious towards my enemy
Though gentle in the heart I'll beat what I've seen
The thunder will keep rolling
Buy I'll stay all the way to the closing
