You make me feel like I could sparkle through the night
You are beautiful like lightning, when you kiss me I'm electrified
You are like magic, you're my angel in the sky
You're my baby, never leave me catching all the tears I cry
Oh you're the glow in my heartbeat
You're the spark in an empty room
You're the song on the repeat
You're the star when you're in fool bloom
And I hope that you know, imma always be right by your side
Cristals just don't satisfy


Hey did you know that: I'll always be in love with you
I can't fake it, my heart's taking

Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone we're finding
Give me your heart
Give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds

Our love's burning down cities
Your love the fire within me
Give me your hand
We are shining
Our love cuts like diamonds

I feel your power, we could take over the world
You're the apple of my eye, I know that I'm your only supergirl
Don't need no rubies, don't need admirals or pearls
We are perfect just the way we are

Hey, did you know that: I'll always be in love with you
I can't fake it, my heart's taking

Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone we're finding
Give me your heart
Give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds

Our love's burning down cities
Your love the fire within me
Give me your hand
We are shining
And our love cuts like diamonds

Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone we're finding
Give me your heart
Give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds

Our love's burning down cities
Your love the fire within me
Give me your hand
We are shining
And our love cuts like diamonds

Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone we're finding
Give me your heart
Give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds

Our love's burning down cities
Your love the fire within me
Give me your hand
We are shining
And our love cuts like diamonds
