Jack Wills, clipped hair, penciled eyes
You get attention
Tight shirt, straight teeth, pinned-up smile
All of them mention
Highlit nice, tip-top, beautiful, the cat's pajamas
Suntan, golden brown
Where you been, to the Bahamas?

Oh, but you can't see it, babe
Oh, you just see through it all
Oh, the girls turn green when they see you
Cause all of the boys start to call

You've got your blue eyes, pink lips, UGG boots
And lots of passionate acoustic iPod soft sounds
Music, fashion, cloned style, neck scarves
Clingy friends all around you
You're the icon, shine out, watch what you do

Oh, but you can't feel it, babe
The effect you have on all of them
Oh, everyone stops and stares
And then the boys begin to call

Cause they want you

And they love you, love you

Francheskaar
They love you, yeah, yeah, they love you
