Close myself off in new ways
Building walls, he might say I can't turn back
I've been reelin' for twelve days (twelve)
When I start to see if it gets real bad


Hurt me, know you won't hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close and then, I'll be gone
Sorry, never say sorry
All my silence resonates
Think you worked me out, but you're wrong
Dirty, I can talk dirty
I can make you feel so sick
Switch your faith and leave you so low
Hurt me, know you'll never hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close and then I'll be gone

I don't trust myself at all
Why should you trust me?
I don't trust myself alone
Why should you love me?

I'm not tryna be rude
I'm just feelin' confused
My emotions get blue
Had to push 'em all through
Know you hope that I'll prove
Everything will stay cool
But I can't promise that's true
'Cause my emotions so blue

Hurt me, know you won't hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close and then, I'll be gone
Sorry, never say sorry
All my silence resonates
Think you worked me out, but you're wrong
Dirty, I can talk dirty
I can make you feel so sick
Switch your faith and leave you so low
Hurt me, know you'll never hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close and then I'll be gone

I don't trust myself at all
Why should you trust me?
I don't trust myself alone
Why should you love me?

Do-do-do-do you love me?
So do you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
Why should you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
So do you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
Why should you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
So do you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
Why should you love me?
