White sheets, you and me used to lay close
Blue summer, sittin' high in the window
Phone calls every night, had a new glow
My clique running through my mind like a rainbow
We were so in love, so we let go
Took it in our lungs, then we all choked
Long drive, so divine when the Sun showed
My clique running through my mind like a rainbow

I miss them every night
I miss them by my side
Catch my tears when I cry
My clique on me for life
Driving 'round at dawn, look at you, lip bite
Something in my chest, feel the tension breaks
Want to stand still, won't forget this time
I miss them, I miss them, I miss them

White sheets, you and me used to lay close
Blue summer, sittin' high in the window
Phone calls every night, had a new glow
My clique running through my mind like a rainbow
We were so in love, so we let go
Took it in our lungs, then we all choked
Long drive, so divine when the Sun showed
My clique running through my mind like a rainbow (yeah)

I miss them
I miss them, I miss them, I miss them
I miss them
I miss them, I miss them, I miss them
I miss them every night
I miss them
I miss them, I miss them, I miss them
I miss them (I miss them, I miss them)
I miss them every night

Clique, clique, clique, yeah (yeah)
