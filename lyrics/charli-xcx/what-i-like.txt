You call me up at 6
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt's on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

You used to come around, you'd be knocking on my front door
Playing board games, horror films with the super gore
Thought that you were cute from the start, yeah, I'm pretty sure
You were like the medicine, the medicine I wanted more
All along I wanted someone to vibe with
Found the guy I want the rest of my life with
Ha, we on some husband and wife shit
I don't really care, 'cause I know that I like it

And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart's been broken
We'll be sitting on your bedroom floor, still smoking

Well, now I've got a plan
I hope you're gonna be my man
I can see us cushy in a house right by the ocean sand
And when I wanna cry
I hope you're gonna hold my hand
And when this shit goes down
I hope you're gonna make a stand

This shit is super wild
This shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangsta
I think I'm into you
