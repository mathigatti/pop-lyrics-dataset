Let me begin where it began
When I first met you
You had me blind with all your charms
And your french perfume
And when we kissed your spit
It always tasted like roses and wine


A few months on
And everything started to fall through
Like when we took that trip
The rain poored through your sunroof
Now when we kiss your spit is poisoned
I still don't mind

Hurt me bad but I still come back
I can't break away
All these bruises turn me blue but
I still like the pain

Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you
All the trouble that you gave me
I must be coo coo crazy

Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you
Left me hanging on a maybe
I must be coo coo crazy

Now lets fast forward to today
All you do is ignore me
Never want to pick the phone up
When you see me callin'
Why is that?
What did I do?
I gave you all my secrets
Even though you told me lies
I promised that I keep them

You laughed at me
At all my clothes
You said that I looked stupid
But I can't help the way I feel
Been attacked by cupid
There's an arrow in my heart
I'm about to fall apart
I wish that we could hit rewind
Why can't we go back to the start?

Hurt me bad but I still come back
I can't break away
All these bruises turn me blue but
I still like the pain

Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you
All the trouble that you gave me
I must be coo coo crazy

Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you
Left me hanging on a maybe
I must be coo coo crazy

Baby I'm crazy
I hope that you know
Baby I'm crazy
I can't let you go
Oh, baby I'm crazy
I hope that you know ow ow

Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you
All the trouble that you gave me
I must be coo coo crazy

Baby, I gotta be a little bit crazy
To fall back in love with you
Left me hanging on a maybe
I must be coo coo crazy
