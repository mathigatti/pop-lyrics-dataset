Lavender Lamborghini, roll up in a blue bikini
Bitches on the beaches, lookin' super cute and freaky
All my friends are princesses, we keep it whipped and creamy
Ice cubes on our tongues because we like to keep it freezy
Lavender Lamborghini, get out on the right side
Chauffeur stayed at home because my girl wanted to ride
Lookin' luxe and tastin' plush, I'm feelin' so alive
Want to take it to the highway, come on, let's go for a drive

All my life, I've been waiting for a good time, a good time
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waiting for a good time, a good time
So let me ride, let me ride
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waiting for a good time
So let's ride

Vroom vroom
Bitches know they can't catch me
Vroom vroom
Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
Vroom vroom
Those slugs know they can't catch me
Vroom vroom
Beep beep, so let's ride
Vroom vroom
Bitches know they can't catch me
Vroom vroom
Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
Vroom vroom
Those slugs know they can't catch me
Vroom vroom
Beep beep, so let's ride

Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride

Bubblegum-pink Ferrari, yeah, I'm so bossy
Sneak in like Alonso just to crash your party
People are goin' loco when I'm pullin' up to your party
Don't think about consequences, cause they're never gonna stop me, what?

All my life, I've been waiting for a good time, a good time
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waiting for a good time, a good time
So let me ride, let me ride
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waiting for a good time
So let's ride

Vroom vroom
Bitches know they can't catch me
Vroom vroom
Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
Vroom vroom
Those slugs know they can't catch me
Vroom vroom
Beep beep, so let's ride
Vroom vroom
Bitches know they can't catch me
Vroom vroom
Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
Vroom vroom
Those slugs know they can't catch me
Vroom vroom
Beep beep, so let's ride

Boom, boom, boom
Hear me coming through the radio
Watch me go zoom, zoom, zoom
Try to catch me but you're too slow
Boom, boom, boom
Hear me coming through the radio
Watch me go zoom, zoom, zoom
Try to catch me but you're too slow
