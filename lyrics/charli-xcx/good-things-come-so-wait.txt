Watching me wine, get you waiting on me
Love is the reason we're playing these games
Oh, you know
Keep falling harder the higher we climb
Still got you hooked after all of this time
Oh, you know


So come to me, come to me, boy
I'll give you, I'll give you everything
All these things you can enjoy
Wait your turn, I'll give you everything
Good things will come to those who wait, so wait
You better learn to be with me, so wait

Know what you want from the look in your eyes
Love is the reason we never think twice
Oh, you know
Keep falling harder the higher you climb
Still got you hooked after all of this time
Oh, you know

So come to me, come to me, boy
I'll give you, I'll give you everything
All these things you can enjoy
Wait your turn, I'll give you everything
Good things will come to those who wait, so wait
You better learn to be with me, so wait
