Rollercoaster ride in the fast lane
Got the roof down
Kiss me hard in the rain
You got the candy colored eyes
Pink and gold chain
Million dollar babe
Whip it out, like I'm propane

[Charli XCX]
You're on my mind
I'm feeling kinda nervous, but I like it
Take my t-shirt off and do it right
You're on my mind
The feeling, like an astronaut
Watchin' the world all alone, just you and I
(Beautiful)

Trippin' on it, like propane
