Excuse me there, molly,
I couldn't help but notice your hair
It's fantastic today.
I set an alarm on my power rangers wrist watch
So would remember I had to be there
When you were leaving math class
Here's what I've been meaning to ask, you


Hey molly,
Can we go to the dance
If you don't want to then I'll understand
But if you like me
Won't you come take my hand
And if you'll love me
Then I'll never play halo again
