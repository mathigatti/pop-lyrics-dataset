[Tove Lo]
Glitter in my sheets
Dancing on no sleep
I don't learn, wanna burn, wanna turn all the way up, yeah
I don't learn, wanna burn in the dirt 'til I'm out of luck, yeah


[Tove Lo]
Pills and potions and terrible things
Heart on the floor when the telephone rings
All of the lies I just wanna believe
Drop all my morals, I just wanna sin

[Alma]
I’m out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head, out of my head

[Tove Lo]
Need you, need you, need you out
Need you, need you, need you out

[Charli XCX]
Partyin' with my tears
Swayin' with my fears
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let em dry, get me high, I'll get by if I'm getting love
Let em dry, get me high, I get by with a little love
Now give me

[Tove Lo &amp; Charli XCX]
Pills and potions and terrible things
Heart on the floor when the telephone rings
All of the lies I just wanna believe
Drop all my morals, I just wanna sin

[Alma]
I’m out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head, out of my head
I’m out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head, out of my head

[Tove Lo, Alma, &amp; Charli XCX]
