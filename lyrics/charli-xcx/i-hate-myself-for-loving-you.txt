I thought that we could be alone
I thought that I could handle you, babe
At night, I'm flicking through your phone
Never used to acting this crazy


Baby, I would die for a sip of your poison
Baby, I would drown just to be in your ocean
Do you know I'd give it all to you?

I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I still hold on, after all
That we've been through

I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
But I can't let go
No, I can't let go, can't help myself
'Cause I lose my mind
When I picture you with someone else

Hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you

Lock me up and set me free
You hurt me, then you act like you're my saviour
But every time you're holding me
I stay because I love a little danger

Baby, I would die for a sip of your poison
Baby, I would drown just to be in your ocean
Do you know I'd give it all to you?

I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I still hold on, after all
That we've been through

I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
But I can't let go
No, I can't let go, can't help myself
'Cause I lose my mind
When I picture you with someone else

Hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
I hate myself
Hate myself for loving you
