I could sit here all day
Bruising my skin and watching the waves
I could sit here all day in your sunshine eyes
I could stay here this way
Guiding your hand as we lie in the shade
I could stay here in your inner sea home


Let's run from the kingdom
Let's take all the treasure
Let's hide in this magic forever and ever

'Cause you set me free
You set me free
And I know that it's wrong, but it's innocent fun
And you set me free
You set me free
Just you, and all the other boys too

You make me scream on the outside, make me reveal all my colors to you
You make me want to untie all my soul strings
You make me live in the lie, box up the truth, push it to the side
You make me smile as I sink deeper into your ocean

Let's dance with the dolphins
Let's lie in the flowers
Let's swing from this starlight for hours and hours

'Cause you set me free
You set me free
And I know that it's wrong, but it's innocent fun
And you set me free
You set me free
Just you, and all the other boys too

I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, just waiting
I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, waiting
I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, just waiting for you, yeah
I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, waiting
