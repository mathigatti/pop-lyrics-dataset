Do you feel alright?
Do you need me by your side?
We go out all night
Makes the pain hurt a little less
Do it one more time
'Cause it feels so justified
We go out all night
See you fall, pick you up again


If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too
You got me so overprotective, it's true
Feel like I would jump off buildings for you
It's okay, I'll watch you cry all night
I promise I won't let you go

I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
(Never let you go)

Lie awake till dawn
Face to face and palm to palm
Do you feel okay?
All your problems are far away (So far away)
Lying till it's true
It's alright, I'm trusting you
Do you feel okay?
Take a breath, make you feel safe

If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too
You got me so overprotective, it's true
Feel like I would jump off buildings for you
It's okay, I'll watch you cry all night
I promise I won't let you go

I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never you let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go

Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
