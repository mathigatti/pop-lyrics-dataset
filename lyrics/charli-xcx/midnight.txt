You're under my attack
There's no turning back
Look into my eyes
And love me through the midnight


Anything that you want
I can be everything that you're gonna need
This can be easy
Let me drink all your blood
All the love that will keep you down on your knees
This can be easy

I reflect in the mirror
Shimmer
(As my glitter falls on your skin)
Hold your heart in my fingers
Linger
(I'll defile your soul within)

You're under my attack
There's no turning back
Look into my eyes
And love me through the midnight
Don't stop until we're through
Say I love you
Hold my body tight
And love me through the midnight

It's not gonna hurt at all
If you please let me take over all control
Can you just trust me?
I'll carry your broken bones
Never going, never leave you out in the cold
I know that you love me

I would give you my last breath
Helpless
(Won't you stay with me in this place?)

You're under my attack
There's no turning back
Look into my eyes
And love me through the midnight
Don't stop until we're through
Say I love you
Hold my body tight
And love me through the midnight

It's beautiful our hearts glow pink and so bright
Our bodies dance like burning wings on fire
We're taped up by the one that we desire
It's alright
It's alright

Don't stop until we're through
Say I love you
Hold my body tight
And love me through the midnight

You're under my attack
There's no turning back
Look into my eyes
And love me through the midnight
Don't stop until we're through
Say I love you
Hold my body tight
And love me through the midnight

Say I love you
Say I love you
Say I love you
Say I love you
