Slipping through tunnels in the sand
I hold your heartbeat in my hand
You are getting away again
Again, again, again, again


I lose my grip and start to drown
Still see your feet from underground
You are getting away again
Again, again, again, again

It feels like I'm in a glass box
Invisible game is under
Keep on confessing your lover
Some other girl you would rather
I feel like a ghost in a white room
Your eyes keep staring me straight through

Don't break my heart

This is when I lose my balance
This is when I lose all control
This is when I find a challenge
A challenge I can call my own
It's hard to find a battle
When all my weapons are so far
Out of reach and balance
And I forget who you are
I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
Deeper and deeper
Deeper and deeper
Deeper and deeper
Deeper and deeper
Deeper and deeper
