Heart beats, first steps
Caught me getting undressed
Soft as skin, you're melting in
Rose perfume on the sunset
I spy, I spy, daddy's merry-go ride
Gold rush, cheeks blush
Fourteen, young touch
Gold rush, cheeks blush
Perfect headfuck
Falling, bad luck
Perfect headfuck


I'm a dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
I'm a dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
I'm a dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
I'm a dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream

Pink shades feel deep
Secrets in my diary
Candles burn the words I wrote, fill up the air that you breathe
Love shrines, bad lies
Can't you speak your own mind
Cherries, ice pops
Want you that much
Cherries, ice pops
Swallow teardrops
Struggle, silence
Want you that much

I'm a dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
I'm a dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
I'm a dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
I'm a dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
