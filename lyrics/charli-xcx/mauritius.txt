It was a quarter to ten at night
And she was feeling alright
Just been out shopping all day
'Cause it was the school holidays
And she got back home, sat alone
Flicked on the computer and talked to her friends
And this boy came online
He said he'd missed her
He said he liked her
Even though they were best friends
And had been for such a long time


So she started to ask some questions
Just some random little things
Cos she felt that if they were going to click
She'd need to know the details

He said, "my favorite color is light blue
I like irish ice cream
Whiskey's pretty yummy and I like worn-in jeans
I'd put kissing over hugging and laughing over tears
I like pizza and mauritius
But I ain't been there in years. "

Well, what a lovely, lovely boy
He seemed bright enough, he had a life
And a good personality
But not much going on in the bedroom
If you know what I mean
But I guess it kind of adds to his appeal
This is the guy who said he liked her
And that she reminded him of something he could see
But couldn't quite reach

So she wrote all this down in a book
That she could look at any day
And it would always remind her of his smile
And his funny colored hair

She said, "I like lots of different colours
And cookie dough ice cream
Bailey's is the best even though it's quite fattening
I'd put kissing over hugging and laughing over tears
I like pizza and I don't think I've been to mauritius. "

Is it good there, is it good there, does it have lots of sun?
Is it good there, would it be really, really fun?
He said, "I think it would be fun if we went there sometime. "
He said, "let's go. "
She said, "where? "
To mauritius
