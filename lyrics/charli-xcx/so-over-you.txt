I'm so over you
Tell me baby are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me baby will you ever regret me?


I'm just a little girl on the tv screen
Stuck inside a silver cage
Body tangled up in chains
I'm looking for the light in the misery
All those others scream in pain
Everyday I feel the same

My tears, they cry
Like I wanna fall into love
But roses still bloom
Since you left me blue
You've got to stand
Tryna mess around with my heart
It's true, I'm through
Playing with you

I'm so over you
Tell me baby are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me baby will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me baby are you over me?
I'm so over you
Promise me that you'll never forget me

Trying to fly away, trying to spread my wings
Soaring like a golden bird
Blockin' out the things I heard
Nine or seven girls on your cameraphone
Secrets kinda suck to burn
I wisha got them from you first

My tears, they cry
Like I wanna fall into love
But roses still bloom
Since you left me blue
You've got to stand
Tryna mess around with my heart
It's true, I'm through
Playing with you

I'm so over you
Tell me baby are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me baby will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me baby are you over me?
I'm so over you
Promise me that you'll never forget me

Saw you at the party
With everybody
You look so lonely
When you're on your own

I know we both remember
Hanging together
We were so happy
Now you're all alone

I'm so over you
Tell me baby are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me baby will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me baby are you over me?
I'm so over you
Promise me that you'll never forget me

Saw you at the party
With everybody
You look so lonely
When you're on your own
