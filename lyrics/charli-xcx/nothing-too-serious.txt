I got a pretty face, I got a messy heart
I got a stun gun, I'm standing in the dark
I'm such an angel, I'm so seethrough
Transparent body and a voice you wanna speak to
I'm gonna reel you in, yeah it's my favourite part
Swimming in the water, yeah you're playing with the big sharks
Fall in love, then you know I'll make your mind bleed
Crying in the corner, yeah you'll wish you never met me


What you see is not what you get, oh no
What you see is not what you get, oh no

I'm not dull, see me in the light
You can try out my poison if you like
If you wanna catch me I'll be in the sky
Don't fall in love or I'll say goodbye
This ain't no love
Nothing too serious
Ain't no love
Noth-noth-noth, nothing too serious

I got a messy face, I got a broken heart
You got a stun gun, you shot me in the dark
You're such a devil, I couldn't see you
Transparent words and a mind that I'm too into
You're gonna reel me in, yeah it's your favourite part
Swimming in the water, yeah I'm drowning with the big sharks
Fall in love, then you're gonna make my soul bleed
Crying in the corner, yeah I'll wish this never started

What you see is not what you get, oh no
What you see is not what you get, oh no

I'm not dull, see me in the light
You can try out my poison if you like
If you wanna catch me I'll be in the sky
Don't fall in love or I'll say goodbye
This ain't no love
Nothing too serious
Ain't no love
Noth-noth-noth, nothing too serious

What you see is not what you get, oh no
What you see is not what you get, oh no

I'm not dull, see me in the light
You can try out my poison if you like
If you wanna catch me I'll be in the sky
Don't fall in love or I'll say goodbye
This ain't no love
Nothing too serious
Ain't no love
Noth-noth-noth, nothing too serious

I'm not dull, see me in the light
You can try out my poison if you like
If you wanna catch me I'll be in the sky
Don't fall in love or I'll say goodbye
This ain't no love
Nothing too serious
Ain't no love
Noth-noth-noth, nothing too serious
