Hey
I know I'm stuck on your brain
You don't have to explain
Seconds count down
So make your move now
Make your move now


Hey
Please don't stop, please don't wait
I know that I feel the same
Get your guns out
And make your move now
Make your move now

Kiss me, get in the moment
Don't speak, it's not important
Shut up
Before you blow it
This is the moment
This is the moment

Blood rush
Reach up on my hand
Let's go, don't ever look back
Trust me
Get in the moment
This is the moment
This is the moment

Candy things, sh-shiny things
This is the moment
Candy things, sh-shiny things
This is the moment
Candy things, sh-shiny things
This is the moment
Candy things, sh-shiny things
This is the moment

Hey
Don't go wasting away
When the world sees a day
Strike like lightning
Just take control now
Take control now

Hey
I know your kingdom awaits
This is real
This is fate
It's a chance
You should take control now
Take control now

Kiss me, get in the moment
Don't speak, it's not important
Shut up
Before you blow it
This is the moment
This is the moment

Blood rush
Reach up on my hand
Let's go, don't ever look back
Trust me
Get in the moment
This is the moment
This is the moment

Candy things, sh-shiny things
This is the moment
Candy things, sh-shiny things
This is the moment
Candy things, sh-shiny things
This is the moment
Candy things, sh-shiny things
This is the moment

You
Feels like I think about you
Oh baby, I just want you
And now I'm really true
And live without you

You
Feels like I think about you
Oh baby, I just want you
And now I'm really true
And live about it

Kiss me, get in the moment
Don't speak, it's not important
Shut up
Before you blow it
This is the moment
This is the moment

Blood rush
Reach up on my hand
Let's go, don't ever look back
Trust me
Get in the moment
This is the moment
This is the moment
