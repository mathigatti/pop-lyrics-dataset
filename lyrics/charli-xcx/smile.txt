Our love is chemistry, symmetrically defines you
A cut to fit me perfectly, your fingers tracing all the lines
My blood is blue because I've searched so long for you
And now that you are by my side, all of my dreams have come true


We are the perfect match, our DNA entwined
You are the darkest of the angels from the blackest of the skies
To you I must be glass, I let you see through
I would smash into a thousand pieces if I lost you

Your heart, my heart, will beat in line
And your bones and my bones will always shine
So don't go, please stay
I'll catch your diamond tears that fall from stars right into space
Your love and my love will stay crystallized

C-R-Y-S-T-A-L love
Burning like a summer and we're lighting up the darkness
C-R-Y-S-T-A-L love
You're my number one and I won't ever get enough of this

C-R-Y-S-T-A-L love
Burning like a summer and we're lighting up the darkness
C-R-Y-S-T-A-L love
You're my number one and I won't ever get enough of this

Your heart, my heart, will beat in line
And your bones and my bones will always shine
So don't go, please stay
I'll catch your diamond tears and that fall from stars right into space
Your love and my love will stay crystallized

Your heart, my heart, will beat in line
And your bones and my bones will always shine
So don't go, please stay
