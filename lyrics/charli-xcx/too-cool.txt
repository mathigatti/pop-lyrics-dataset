First you see my face in your magazine
You wanna rip it out, you wanna dream my dream
You wanna wear my clothes, you wanna feel my touch
You wanna take a ride, yeah, I'm a fashion slut


Because you can feel the heat when you touch the page
You wanna take a bite, you wanna play my games
But I don't play the game, the games that you play

Because I'm a lioness, you wanna hear my roar
But you took your shit before you go and score
You're not on my wavelength, although you'd like to be
I wish you'd go away, I wish that you could see
That you're not my type, you'll never get it right
You're not idealistic, you're just too uptight
You think your head's a mess but it's all pretend
Yeah, it's all pretend, yeah, it's all!

You think you're too cool but you're not
You think you're right but you're so wrong
You're pixilated, you're [?]
I found you in the black taxi
Watching your life on the TV screen
I know that's who you want to be, but you can't
Because that is me

You tried to steal my life, you took the lock and key
But after all that pain I know just who you've been
So stop your back-chat, screaming like a rich brat
Take off that gold and give me my reflection back

Because I can hear your voice imitating mine
And I can see your shoes, that they're across the line
Yeah, Imma wipe that smile right off your face
I don't want your tears because you're not [?]

You think you're too cool but you're not
You think you're right but you're so wrong
You're pixilated, you [?]
I found you in the black taxi
Watching your life on the TV screen
I know that's who you want to be, but you can't
Because that is me

You're a gameplayer, a fame-chaser
But that's what everyone is these days
Strumming acoustic guitar in the haze
Expressing yourself in different ways
But be careful, you'll get caught

You think you're too cool but you're not
You think you're right but you'Â¢re so wrong
You're pixilated, you're [?]
I found you in the black taxi
Watching your life on the TV screen
I know that's who you want to be, but you can't
Because that's me
