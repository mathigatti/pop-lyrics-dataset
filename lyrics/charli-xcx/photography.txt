Let's take a picture
Let's take a picture of your mind
Let's take a picture
And let's see what we can find


We'll make you scream out loud
With our boxes of imagination
We'll make you bleed right now
As you stare at your transparent reflection

We'll make you mad
(With a flash and a click, and you're all mine, yeah, you're all mine)
We’ll make you mad
(With the lights in your eyes, yeah, you're all mine, yeah, you're all mine)
We'll make you mad
(With a flash and a click, and you're all mine, yeah, you're all mine)
We’ll make you mad
(With the lights in your eyes, yeah, you're all mine, yeah, you're all mine)

Photography
(This is what you want now)
Photography
(Just smile at the camera)
Photography
(This is what you asked for)
Photography
(You know we'd never lie)

Oh, let's reload
We need to take more of your memories
Quick, let's reload
Because we don't want you to escape

We will control you right now
With our undiscovered subliminal messaging
We will dispose of you when we want
Once we've stolen your integrity

You're going mad
(With a flash and a click, and you're all mine, yeah, you're all mine)
You're going mad
(With the lights in your eyes, yeah, you're all mine, yeah, you're all mine)
You're going mad
(With a flash and a click, and you're all mine, yeah, you're all mine)
You're going mad
(With the lights in your eyes, yeah, you're all mine, yeah, you're all mine)
