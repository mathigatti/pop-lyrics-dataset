Turn up, turn up
(Laughs)


He's gonna shoot me when he hears the news
I'm such a rebel, I just wanna break the rules
Right when he told me, when he told me not to do it
Fell off the wagon again

All out, all out
We keep on drinking 'til we crawl out, crawl out
And get some sleep, when we are passed out, passed out
Wish I could do this every day for the rest of my life

Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again
You see, I promised him that I would be in by 10
Don't let my daddy know I kissed someone I just met
I wanna take it off
My clothes are sticky and wet

Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again

Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again

He's gonna shoot me when he hears the news
I'm such a rebel, I just wanna break the rules
Right when he told me, when he told me not to do it
Fell off the wagon again

All out, all out
We keep on drinking 'til we crawl out, crawl out
And get some sleep, when we are passed out, passed out
Wish I could do this every day for the rest of my life

Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again
You see, I promised him that I would be in by 10
Don't let my daddy know I kissed someone I just met
I wanna take it off
My clothes are sticky and wet

Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again

Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again
