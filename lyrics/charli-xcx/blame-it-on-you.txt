I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Every lie you tell comes true (true)
But I still wanna be with you (you)
I blame it on you, yeah
You, I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Every lie you tell comes true (true)
But I still wanna be with you (you)

We met in the springtime
So cool, you were all nice
Bright star burnin’ so bright
You’re my type, you’re all I want
Oh, your eyes cut deep like a sharp knife
Open my legs with the pressure and make me feel alright
Uh-huh, so good, but I know you’re bad for me
You got control, and you love the game
But open my legs with the pressure and do it all again, yeah

Pull up in a new thing, wrists all fresh like oh my god
I’ll stick like a group, I know exactly what I want
Bad boy make a bad girl good, you’re driving me so wild
You’re driving me so wild, yeah, yeah

I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Every lie you tell comes true (true)
But I still wanna be with you (you)
I blame it on you, yeah
You, I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Every lie you tell comes true (true)
But I still wanna be with you (you)
I blame it on you, yeah

I get drunk on the white wine
Call you like a hotline
You’re stuck up in my mind
Not alright, what’s goin’ on?
Don’t usually do this
With you, I’m an addict
But open my legs with the pressure and candy first kisses
Uh-huh, so good, but I know you’re bad for me
You got control, and you love the game
But open my legs with the pressure and do it all again, yeah

Pull up in a new thing, feel so cool up in your ride
Take drugs, what a waste, be racin’, love it when you drive
Bad boy make a bad girl, now that’s got my head so high
I’m feelin’ fuckin’ high, yeah, yeah
