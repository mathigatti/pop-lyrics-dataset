I look at you, you look at me
You know what is on my mind
Sugary sweet, bon app√©tit
I can't wait to make you mine
Je t'aime, Je t'aime
You're heaven sent
Feels like red roses and wine
Whoever said romance is dead?


Because I've been all 'round the world
Baby, nothing can compare
To when you touch me
You know you take me there
This ain't no vacay
It's forever and a day
Baby, you take me there

When we go to Paris
You make me go ooh-la-la
I know you like a challenge
So baby boy, here's my heart
I wanna go and go for hours
So take me up the Eiffel tower
When we go to Paris
You make me go ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la
Ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la
Ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la

Taking our time seeing the sights
Got me screaming out your name
Feeling alive, a magical ride
Champagne bubbles in my brain
J'adore, J'adore, oui, mon amour
I know that you feel the same
Feeling couture, baby, I'm yours

Because I've been all 'round the world
Baby, nothing can compare
To when you touch me
You know you take me there
This ain't no vacay
It's forever and a day
Baby, you take me there

When we go to Paris
You make me go ooh-la-la
I know you like a challenge
So baby boy, here's my heart
I wanna go and go for hours
So take me up the Eiffel tower
When we go to Paris
You make me go ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la
Ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la
Ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la

Ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la
Ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la
