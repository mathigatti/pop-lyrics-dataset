I'm standing close to you
We got the city breaking down
Stuck in an avalanche
We got the whole world spinning


Young, I want it free
Got everything we need
A thousand shooting stars
And many mysteries
And you know we got more to show
The planets are aligned
We got something divine
So open up the sky
You know this is our time
Oh now you know

We wanna live right now
Jumping off the edge
Don't ever slow us down for nothing
We wanna live right now
Jumping off the edge
We're gonna live our lives for something more

Hey let's explode, explo-o-o-ode!
Cause we got that dynamite inside our bones
Come on let's explode, explo-o-o-ode!
Now we got that 1, 2, 3, come on let's go, let's go!
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I love this energy
We're burning up like fire
Like electricity
We're hanging from the wire

Young, I want it free
Got everything we need
A thousand shooting stars
And many mysteries
And you know we got more to show
The planets are aligned
We got something divine
So open up the sky
You know this is our time
Oh now you know

We wanna live right now
Jumping off the edge
Don't ever slow us down for nothing
We wanna live right now
Jumping off the edge
We're gonna live our lives for something more
Hey let's explo-o-o-ode, explode!
Cause we got that dynamite inside our bones
Come on let's explo-o-o-ode, explode!
Now we got that 1, 2, 3, come on let's go, let's go!
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

We wanna live right now
We wanna live right now

Hey let's explo-o-o-ode, explode!
Cause we got that dynamite inside our bones
Come on let's explo-o-o-ode, explode!
Now we got that 1, 2, 3, come on let's go, let's go!
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
