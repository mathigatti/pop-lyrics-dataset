Don’t you know that you’re the one I want
Can’t you understand the way I feel
I feel electric rushes in my blood
Come on, explain for all the world to see
That you and me, we could be so picture perfect
You’re the only one I want


I’ve been
Dreamin’ of it
Ridin’ in your car
Into the sunset

I can’t get you out of my head
I just want you here in my bed
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
Baby, I will never regret
Those three, little words that I said
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
Ahh, ooh
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh

You look at me like I’m one of your friends
We always say goodnight as soon as the party’s over
Wish it didn’t have to end (ever)
I’m really sorry, but I told the truth
Was it too much for you to handle
Wish that I could hide it, but I can’t pretend (no more)

I’ve been
Dreamin’ of it
Ridin’ in your car
Into the sunset

I can’t get you out of my head
I just want you here in my bed
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
Baby, I will never regret
Those three, little words that I said
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
Ahh, ooh
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh

I’m lying in my bed
And I can’t get you off my mind
Can you hear me?
I’ve just got to tell you

I can’t get you out of my head
I just want you here in my bed
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, uh
Baby, I will never regret
Those three, little words that I said
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me

Oh-oh-whoa, oh-whoa
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
Oh-oh-whoa, oh-whoa
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh

I can’t get you out of my head
I just want you here in my bed
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, ahh
(Oh-oh-whoa, oh-whoa)
Baby, I will never regret
Those three, little words that I said
‘Cause I really need you near me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me, aah
