Standing in the crossfire
Standing in the way off all your pain, your pain
Caught up in the crossfire
Now I'm jumping out over the edge, the edge


You wanna to me?
You wanna [?]
And if we're gonna do it
All I did was love it [?]
[?]
You let me down everytime
Now it's over and I'll never know

Standing in the crossfire
Standing in the way off all your pain, your pain
Caught up in the crossfire
Now I'm jumping out over the edge, the edge

No more, no more, no more, no more
Now you're standing in the crossfire
No more, no more, no more, no more
Now you're standing in the crossfire

You wanna to me?
You wanna [?]
And if we're gonna do it
All I did was love it [?]
[?]
You let me down everytime
Now it's over and I'll never know

Standing in the crossfire
Standing in the way off all your pain, your pain
Caught up in the crossfire
Now I'm jumping out over the edge, the edge
