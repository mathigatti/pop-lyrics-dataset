Got some demons, some problems
I keep trying to solve 'em
With some liquor, lies and chemicals
I'm just tryna be honest, yeah
I break every promise
To anyone who gets too close


I'mma house on fire
'Til the day I die
So you should let me burn
Let me burn, woo-oah

I'm just gonna break-break-break
Break your heart-heart-heart
Smash it up-up like it's glass
I'm just gonna take-take-take
All your love-love-love
Use it up, won't give it back
Baby I was born vicious
No I can't help myself
I'm just gonna break-break-break
Break your heart-heart-heart
Smash it up-up like it's glass

I'm just gonna
Uh, uh, uh
I'm just gonna
Uh, uh, uh
I'm just gonna

I guess the reason I'm like this
Is cause I suffered in silence
I've been torn apart and damaged good
My emotions are fragile
I act so tough but meanwhile
I can't trust you
But I wish I could

I'mma house on fire
'Til the day I die
So you should let me burn
Let me burn, woah

I'm just gonna break-break-break
Break your heart-heart-heart
Smash it up-up like it's glass
I'm just gonna take-take-take
All your love-love-love
Use it up, won't give it back
Baby I was born vicious
No I can't help myself
I'm just gonna break-break-break
Break your heart-heart-heart
Smash it up-up like it's glass

I'm just gonna
Uh, uh, uh
I'm just gonna
Uh, uh, uh
I'm just gonna
