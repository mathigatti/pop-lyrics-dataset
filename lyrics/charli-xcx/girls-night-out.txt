Whoa ah ah ah oh

Goin' out on the weekend
Gettin' dressed with my girls
Put on my favorite lip gloss
Cherry, glossy, a swirl
Perfume, pleasure, and platforms
Live in that kind of world
We're gonna live it up tonight


So if you're out with your girls
And if you feel on top of the world
Whoa ah ah ah oh
Out with your girls
I can't wait to live it up tonight

It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
I can't wait to live it up tonight
It's a girls' night out
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys
It's a girls' night out

When we're out at the Weekend
R.I.P to the club
'Cause we walk in and kill it
DJ, hey, turn it up
Sing along like we wrote it
Screamin' out all the words
We're gonna live it up tonight

So if you're out with your girls
And if you feel on top of the world
Whoa ah ah ah oh
Out with your girls
I can't wait to live it up tonight

It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
I can't wait to live it up tonight
It's a girls' night out
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys

It's a girls' night out, it's a girls' night out
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys

It's a girls' night out, it's a girls' night out
