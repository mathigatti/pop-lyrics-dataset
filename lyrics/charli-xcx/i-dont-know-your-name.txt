So lost and so alone, can't take it no more
You watch me lose control, don't sit on the floor


Wanna feel the pound of a heartbeat?
Do you wanna feel a rush when I go insane?
I wanna be unwrapped like a candy cane
The only ones you love, no time for pain
You wanna be a bad little secret
Do you wanna feel the blood running through your vein?
I wanna be the girl inside yo brain
But only for a night, wanna play the game

I love through your eyes
They flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high
Through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

Your touch electrifies my body and soul
You're such a sweet escape, now I can't let go

I wanna lose myself in the passion
Do you wanna be my boy? Wanna run away?
I wanna stick with you on a kiss and chase
I can see me chilling at your place
Only meant to be a distraction
Now the only thing I see seems to be your face
I wanna be the girl that keeps you safe
I only meant tonight but it must be fate

I love through your eyes
They flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high
Through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

I don't even know your name
I don't even know your name

I will not just fall in love for you, no flying
I can't fight this feeling, oh, feeling so lovesick
I really can't believe this
But it's so damn true
So much magic in between us
Now I'm all for you

I love through your eyes
They flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high
Through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

I don't even know your name
I don't even know your name
