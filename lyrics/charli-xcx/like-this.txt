You say you want me, when I'm down on the floor
And when I'm ugly, you're always wanting me more
Yeah in my bed when, I let it trip and it stop, we fall hand in hand


Yeah I know you love my legs even when they're not shaved
And I know you keep me in the same t-shirt for days
You're always by my side when I'm feeling deranged
You'll always be my man

I like feeling like this
So give it to me like that
I like feeling like this
So give it to me like that
I like it like it like this
So give it to me like that
I like it like it like this
And I just want more and more

So you'll be there when I'm old and I'm grey
Without my make up, painted all of my face
And when I'm so sad, come on let's do a race
We're losing hand in hand

Yeah you know I love your hair in the morning time
You got your eyes screwed up from the brights of my light
I'm always by your side when you're scared in the night
You'll always be my man

I like feeling like this
So give it to me like that
I like feeling like this
So give it to me like that
I like it like it like this
So give it to me like that
I like it like it like this
And I just want more and more
