[Caroline Polachek]
See through my eyes
Right down to where I fall apart
Wish me luck, wish me luck
Drive through the night
Head on your shoulder, but I miss you so much
So, so much


[Charli XCX]
Say your name so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
Tried to hide the lies when we touch
But in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

[Caroline Polachek &amp; Charli XCX]
Used to be 5 star, yeah
Golden, golden
When I had nothing, you gave me silhouette dreams and
We made them real, somethin' I feel
I killed our life, I'm crazy
Throwin' all the china all around the kitchen
I kicked the letter under your plane
Door shut tight, that ain't love, no
That ain't love

[Caroline Polachek]
Say your name so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
Tried to hide the lies when we touch
But in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

[Charli XCX &amp; Caroline Polachek]
Tears are rollin' down my face, holdin' on until we break
Now we're in a different place
(Now we're in a different place, tears are rollin' down my face)
I can feel my body ache, tears are rollin' down my face
Now you gotta go, go, go, go
Tears are rollin' down my face, holdin' on until we break
Now we're in a different place
(Now we're in a different place, tears are rollin' down my face)
I can feel my body ache, tears are rollin' down my face
Now you gotta go, go, go, go

[Charli XCX &amp; Caroline Polachek]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tears are rollin' down my face
(Now we're in a different place)

[Caroline Polachek]
Say your name so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
Tried to hide the lies when we touch
But in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

[Caroline Polachek &amp; Charli XCX]
Say your name
Fade out
Down my face
Go, go
Tried to hide the lies when we touch
But in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
