It's all black
Your kingdom's turned me black
I'm playfull and I'm sad
I'm lost but I can't soar
I'm lost but not alone


It's all light
The dark, it burns my eyes
My bones they used to glow
But now, I'm throwing stones
I'm losing but too gold

Shadows on my back
I'm moving slow
They twist behind like
The quiet leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these forces will take flight

Falling hard, falling high
To your arms
Shadows in my head
Don't need no light, they stay through the night

Without you
My lips are turning blue
The water pulls me down
I'm trapped under your sun
This sight is oh so light

I'm locked up
Your kingdom's like a drug
The chains are made of glass
I'm breaking through the glade
I've never said enough

Shadows on my back
I'm moving slow
They twist behind like
The quiet leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these forces will take flight

Falling hard, falling high
To your arms
Shadows in my head
Don't need no light, they stay through the night

To every rose with bloody thorns
It lift you up, then let you fall
Two rivers flowing under factory holes
The kingdom's come, it's waiting still
Just space between, we'll never feel
I tried, but I could not change your mind

I danced around
And I lost you now
I breathed you out
I kept you out

But if I could, I'd turn back around
