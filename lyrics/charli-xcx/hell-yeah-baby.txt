Ay, ha!

Pull up, pull up
Bass in the trunk
Valet gon' pick up, pick up
Hop out the benz, freaking weekend
Dressed to the nines looking like tens


Quick snap a pic, then go
Walk through the club past the velvet rope
Got a manicured man on my manicure hand
Oh damn it's my song on the stereo
And it goes like

Na na na na na
I'm drunk and I'm on a roll
Na na na na na
He said: Girl can I take you home?
And I was like
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, let's go

Pull up, pull up
Don't give a fuck
My girls gon' switch up, switch up
Here in the crowd, wearing the crown
Me and my man gon' get down, get down

Walk to the bathroom stall
Wanna push him hard up against that wall
Might be spilling my glass, but I got that class
So I'm gonna make him wait if he wants it all
And it goes like

Na na na na na
I'm drunk and I'm on a roll
Na na na na na
He said: Girl can I take you home?
And I was like
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, let's go

[Ryn weaver]
Oh boys they try to shout
They hoot and holla when they can
They see me out
Too bad I'm leaving with my
My man, man
But if you ain't got one
Take a stand, stand
Single ladies in the club
It's your jam jam
But if you got a ring on then wave your hand, hand
Like a boss, like a boss, like a boss
Like a boss, boss, boss, boss, bossy, boss

Na na na na na
I'm drunk and I'm on a roll
Na na na na na
He said: Girl can I take you home?
And I was like
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, let's go
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, hell yeah baby
Ha ha, let's go
(Hell yeah baby, hell yeah baby
Hell yeah baby, let's go)
