Drivin' 'round in Hollywood, I can only think 'bout you
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my body, it's you
Did I lose it all? Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now or are they far gone?
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all cause I'm thinking 'bout you


Fucked up, I just wanna break glass
Phone calls, I just wanna talk back
Yeah, big attitude, just like a big stack
Braindead for days, am I gonna relax? Yeah

I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna smile, no, no
Got a couple problems
I don't wanna compromise, no, no (yeah)

I'm drivin' 'round in Hollywood
I can only think 'bout you, you (think 'bout, think 'bout)
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my brain, like you
Did I lose it all? Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now or are they far gone?
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all cause I'm thinking 'bout you

Don't stop, I just wanna go fast
No sleep, I don't wanna relax
10 planes in five days, I been 'round the world and back again
Man I feel insane, I'm numb, can't stop the pain no

I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna smile, no, no
Got a couple problems
I don't wanna compromise, no, no

Drivin' 'round in Hollywood, I can only think 'bout you
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my body, it's you
Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now? Are they all far gone? (Yeah)
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all cause I'm thinking 'bout you
