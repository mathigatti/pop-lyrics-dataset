Yeah, I got the time, yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
Spend on loving you, spend on loving you


I got the time to be your friend
If I get to hang with you every day
Sitting on the ground, drinking champagne
Flying round the world, private plane
You're like the best kind of Novocain
Super ease, take the pain away
Nice kinda numb, yeah, it a-okay
Back of the car, I will stay smoking

Stay hot like fire
You are my one desire
But you will never tire
Because you always keep on taking me higher
Super sweet, like a French bon-bon
Super story, how you gon-gon
You got my heart dressed up like a debutante
You're the apple of my eye and the only one

Yeah, I got the time, yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
Spend on loving you, spend on loving you

Yeah, I got the time, yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
Spend on loving you, spend on loving you

I like it when you kiss the back of my neck
I like it that you show me super respect
You're not the kind of guy I think I'll regret
You're not the kind of guy I'm gonna forget
Sparkle in your heart always glows in the dark
Brings in the star when we walk through the park
Hand in my hand, toes in the sand
Super ultra love for my man

Yeah, I got the time, yeah, I got the time
Yeah, I got the time to spend on loving, spend on loving you
Spend on loving you, spend on loving you
