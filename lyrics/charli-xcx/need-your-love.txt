I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up, so come and get me


Boy, you really messed around
Put me six feet underground
Always kick me when I'm down
But I'm still driving through your town

Tried to fake it, I can't take it
Boy you trapped my heart
I can't shake it, 'bout to break into a hundred million parts

I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up, so come and get me

I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up, so come and get me

Wish that you could wear my crown
And feel the weight I'm feeling now
But I can't help but say your name
It's lightening when you're in my veins

Tried to fake it, I can't take it
Boy you trapped my heart
I can't shake it, 'bout to break into a hundred million parts

I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up, so come and get me

I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up, so come and get me

Boy, you really broke my heart
Took my love and tore it up
But I'm coming back for you
Coming clean out of the blue
All the things you did to me
I forgive them quietly
But I will never forget
And still I end up in your bed

(I need your love)
I don't want it
(I need it even when it hurts me)
You really hurt me, baby
(I won't give up)
Now, I'm giving up
(I won't give up, so come and get me)
Don't you come and get me, baby

(I need your love)
I don't want it
(I need it even when it hurts me)
You really hurt me, baby
(I won't give up)
Now, I'm giving up
(I won't give up, so come and get me)
Don't you come and get me, baby
