I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump in the rave
Go forever and ever and


Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speedin' on the highway
Flame burning, tire screams
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever and

Drop, body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speedin' on the highway
Vroom vroomin', might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius
Windows down and just vibe
Bump, bump in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Roll wit' your friends, out till 7 AM
Come on, meet me on the highway
Smoke blowing, let's race
Turn the volume up on the speakers
Got that look on your face
Bump, bump in the rave
Go forever and ever and

I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speedin' on the highway
Flame burning, tire screams
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever and

Drop, body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speedin' on the highway
Vroom vroomin', might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius
Windows down and just vibe
Bump, bump in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Roll wit' your friends, out till 7 AM
Come on, meet me on the highway
Smoke blowing, let's race
Turn the volume up on the speakers
Got that look on your face
Bump, bump in the rave
Go forever and ever and

I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back (X-X-XCX, Charli)
I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump in the rave (it's Charli, baby)
Go forever and ever and (it's Charli)

Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speedin' on the highway
Flame burning, tire screams (it's Charli)
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out (it's Charli)
Go forever and ever and
