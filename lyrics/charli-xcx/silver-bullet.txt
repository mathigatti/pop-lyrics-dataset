You put the knife through my chest in a heartbeat
In a heartbeat, in a heartbeat
Shoot your gun through my brain, yeah, it's blasting
Everlasting, everlasting


You're the voice that's in my ears
Intoxicated by my tears
Cut me up with golden shears
It's a massacre, my dear
Now I'm lying in the road
Parasite inside my soul
Got me hanging from your rope
Yeah, I'm your puppet now

Now I think I've had enough, enough
Yeah, now I think I've had enough

I gave you love, with a silver bullet
You killed my heart, put a hole right through it all
I feel your hands, they electrify me
Your killing touch better satisfy me
I gave you love, with a silver bullet
You killed my heart, put a hole right through it all
I feel your hands, they electrify me
I hate this love, but I need it

Getting high from the dose of your poison
Of your poison, baby, you're my poison
Homicide in my bed, slow motion
Slow motion, baby, in slow motion

You're sadistic and you're cold
Got me under your control
Like the cigarettes I smoke
You suffocate me till I choke
Now I'm bleeding in the road
Parasite inside my soul
Got me dancing from your rope
Yeah, I'm your puppet now

Now I think I've had enough, enough
Yeah, now I think I've had enough

I gave you love, with a silver bullet
You killed my heart, put a hole right through it all
I feel your hands, they electrify me
Your killing touch better satisfy me
I gave you love, with a silver bullet
You killed my heart, put a hole right through it all
I feel your hands, they electrify me
I hate this love, but I need it
