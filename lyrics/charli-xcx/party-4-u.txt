1000 pink balloons
DJ with your favorite tunes
Birthday cake in August
But you were born 19th of June
Champagne pourin' in your mouth
Called your friends from out of town
Got the party bag with the purple pills
And I'm waiting for you by the window, yeah
Called your digits, but the phone kept ringin'
Wish I knew what you were thinking, na-na-na
1000 pink balloons
Dancin' on to your favorite tunes
Hope you walk in the party
'Cause I threw the party just for you like what

I only threw this party for you
Only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I was hopin' you would come through
I was hopin' you would come through, it's true, it's true
Only threw this party for you
I only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I'm about to party on you
Watch me, watch me party on you, yeah

You could watch me pull up on your body
Like it's summer, take my clothes off
In the water, splash around and get you blessed like holy water
I don't know what you were waiting for
You know that I've been waiting for you
I only threw this party for you
If you saw my tears, would you touch me?
Kiss me on the mouth, say you love me?
Leave a message, tell me you're sorry?
Hit me right back, hit me right back
Why you treating me like someone that you never loved?

I only threw this party for you
Only threw this party for you, for you, for you

Come to my party
Come to my party 
All I'm thinking, all I know is 
That I hope you knock on my door 
Nervous energy
My heart rate rises higher, higher up 
I wish you'd get here, kiss my face
Instead, you're somewhere far away
My nervous energy will stay
I hope you realize one day, uh
Come to my party
Come to my party

Party on you, party on you, party on
