Hey baby, you're accelerating
Got me switching up the gears
You're deadly, get in the Mercedes
Wanna take you outta here


Oh, turn the key and let's roll
I don't wanna go back and forth, no back and forth
No back and forth, no no
Oh, I can do what I want
Get your body going back and forth, go back and forth
Go back and forth, you know

It's my party, we can leave if you want to
Leave if you want to, leave if you want to
It's my party, we can creep if you want to
Creep if you want to, creep if you want to
Come on, let's go to the second estate
Hit the code and then open the gate
You and I, we could go and escape
Outta here, outta here, outta here
It's my party, we can leave if you want to
Leave if you want to, leave if you want to

Hey baby, think you look so pretty
With your body in my sheets
I'm patient, for you, I'll keep waiting
Treat you like you are my queen

It's my party, we can leave if you want to
Leave if you want to, leave if you want to
It's my party, we can creep if you want to
Creep if you want to, creep if you want to
Come on, let's go to the second estate
Hit the code and then open the gate
You and I, we could go and escape
Outta here, outta here, outta here
It's my party, we can leave if you want to
Leave if you want to, leave if you want to
