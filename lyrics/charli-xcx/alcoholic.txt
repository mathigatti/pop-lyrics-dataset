All I never know is stood before
How beautiful your fire burns
And I'm not really into the whole love song thing
But I'll try it out just for you


This is my last chance
This is my last chance
And I ain't taking any risks this time, no, no
This is your last chance
This is your last chance
To prove, to prove you'll be fine on your own

Now that I've warned you
Oh, what you gonna do?
You put the broken bottle up against
Your lips and take a drink
Breathe in, breathe out
But we don't care anymore, no, no, no

This is your last chance
This is your last chance
And you ain't taking any
Risks this time, no, no, no

This is our last chance
This is our last chance
To show them, to show them
We'll survive on our own
On our own, on our own
On our own, on our own
On our own
