I was busy thinking 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreaming 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinning, thinking 'bout boys


I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone
But I'm looking down and my girls
Are blowing my phone up
Them twenty questions, they're asking me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby

But I was busy thinking 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreaming 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinning, thinking 'bout boys

And every city I got one with different ringtones
Flying from LA all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are calling me asking me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse
But I can't even lie, you got me

I was busy thinking 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreaming 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinning, thinking 'bout boys

Don't be mad, don't be mad at me
Darling, I can't stop it, even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me
Missed what you were saying, I was miles away, yeah
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me
Not like I had a choice

I was busy thinking 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreaming 'bout boys, boys, boys

I was busy thinking 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreaming 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinning, thinking 'bout boys
