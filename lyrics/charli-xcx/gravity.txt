I'm just sitting here in my treetop
I'm just swing, swing, swinging away
Feel so magical, feel so loved
Will you catch me on my way down?
I drank your cherry cola
I let you win me over
You're nicer when you're sober
Please just tell me


What makes the world go 'round?
What makes the world go 'round?
What makes the world go 'round?

Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?

You chewed my heart and spat it out
Now you're run, run, running away
You didn't pick me off the floor
Will you catch me on my way down?
My pretty mouth is open
My words they keep on flowing
I'm nicer when I'm sober
I'm so sorry

What makes the world go 'round
What makes the world go 'round
What makes the world go 'round?

Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?

Is it gravity?
Or is it L O V E?
This is gravity
Not L O V E

I've been sitting here in my treetop
For a long time now, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here in my treetop
I'm not coming down, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here in my treetop
For a long time now, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here, I've been sitting here, I've been sitting here

Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it gravity?
Is it gravity?
