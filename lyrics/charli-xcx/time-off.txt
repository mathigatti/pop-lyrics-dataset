I can see right through your rib cage
You're like a ghost, you fade away


'Cause you've been watching too much television
And you've been taking too many prescriptions
Yeah, I can see right through your rib cage

Your bones don't glow like they used to glow
Like they used to do
Your bones don't glow like they used to glow
Like they used to do-oh-oh, woo-oo

I think you need to take some time off and just chill on your own
I think you should stop hanging 'til 6, instead you should go home
I think you need to let go of the substance you choose to abuse
'Cause I'm not gonna save you
