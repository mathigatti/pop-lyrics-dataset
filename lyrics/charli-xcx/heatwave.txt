It's gonna be a heatwave
The sun is shining through the clouds
I put my love into your mouth
And I feel so high I can't come down
A heatwave
I feel your magic on my skin
You dance around me in the wind
Open your heart and let me in


I wanna dance in the sunlight, get me on my knees
I'm gonna kiss your body in the summer breeze
You got a killer smile and I love your steeze
Come and kiss my body, I'm begging please

You are a super special, take me home
Our love is extra special, tastes like gold
This is another lover, oh my god
I know you need it ‘cause you’re screaming

It's gonna be a heatwave
The sun is shining through the clouds
I put my love into your mouth
And I feel so high I can't come down
A heatwave
I feel your magic on my skin
You dance around me in the wind
Open your heart and let me in

I wanna dance in the sunlight, get me on my knees
I'm gonna kiss your body in the summer breeze
You got a killer smile and I love your steeze
Come and kiss my body, I'm begging please

You know I like it when we're playing in the summer breeze
I know you like to tease me, you've always got me on my knees.
I'm falling for you more and more every time I stare into your buttercup eyes.
I'm in love
