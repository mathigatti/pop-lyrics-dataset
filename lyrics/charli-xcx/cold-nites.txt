Cold nights and harder days
Better lie down and lay away
Have a hard face in foreign places
Tired of seeing love, tired of waiting


Ooh, but I keep on doing it
Ain't gonna stop until we’re through with this

Hope you know I miss you, know that I want to kiss you
You said that I was the bestest bitch that ever stuck with you
After all the shit we’ve been through, how come you cannot see through?
We’re stuck on automatic, never there when I really need you
This shit for real, this shit is danger
You come around my house and you act like a motherfucking total stranger
Anytime that I see you, baby
Anytime that I see you, lately
Hoping I’m safe for a while

Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we’re through with this

Now what would I change to get you into my arms again?
You said that [my life] made you in love with a different man
If I had time and [???]
Could I still take you as my love?
Tell me what I gotta do, tell me what I gotta do better

Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we’re through with this

I can’t see from how hard [I’ll be in where I’ll stay]
I pray for myself again
