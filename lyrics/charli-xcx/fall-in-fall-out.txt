You got it, you get it, you got it, I know it, da-di


I wanna see your stronger side
Push up on me so damn high
Do it, yeah
To the ceiling to the floor, rock it to the sky
You know I
Love it when you do it twice
Kissing me like dynamite
We be like
To the ceiling to the floor, rock it to the sky

Fall in, fall in, fall out, fall out, falling in love
Yeah, oh

I got it right, and you're all mine
You got it, you get it, you got it, I know it, da-di

I wanna see your stronger side
Push up on me so damn high
Do it, yeah
To the ceiling to the floor, rock it to the sky
You know I
Love it when you do it twice
Kissing me like dynamite
We be like
To the ceiling to the floor, rock it to the sky

Fall in, fall in, fall out, fall out, falling in love
