(Maybe my)
Eh-eh-XCX
(Maybe my, uhh)


Maybe my only light
Don’t you recognize
You’re the only one I want, uhh
Cold like ice, petrified, uhh
Lovin’ what you’re doin’ to me
(Doin' to me)

White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lyin’ in your bed and movin’ slow
Takin’ off our clothes
Givin’ you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close, lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

You’ll be mine every night
I’m tryin’ to effortize
You’re the only one I want, uhh
Hold me tight, yeah, mobile light, uhh
Lovin’ what you’re doin’ to me

White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lyin’ in your bed and movin’ slow
Takin’ off our clothes
Givin’ you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close, lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

We’re gonna melt down
Gonna disappear into the sun, into the sun
Gonna burn down together like fire
We can’t get enough
(No, no, no, no)
We’re tied like white roses
You know we’re never comin’ undone, comin’ undone
‘Cause I wanna stay forever
I know that you’re the only one, only one

White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lyin’ in your bed and movin’ slow
Takin’ off our clothes
Givin’ you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close, lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

(Ooh, aah, yeah)
Come on, pull me close, lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it
Come on, pull me close, lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it
