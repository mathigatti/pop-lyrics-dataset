[Big Freedia]
Work it, oh, it's a migraine
Make them pupils dilate
Wanna watch it gyrate, ass is on a tirade
Make you pop a Tylenol, split your head and call it off
Got you drinking water when you should be drinking alcohol
Faster than a Adderall, make you shake your Audemars
Shake it, shake it, shake it make it spray like an aerosol
Shake it like a dog
I don't shake like that
Shake it like a salt shaker
I don't shake like that
Shake it like a dog
I don't shake like that
Shake it like a salt shaker
I don't shake like that
I don't shake like anything, I shake it like myself
All this pussy on a pedestal, I put it on a shelf
I-I-I don't shake like anything, I shake it like myself
'Cause ain't no pussy shakin' like when Freedia lose her belt (Come on)
Ooh, ah, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Ooh, ah, shake it, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ah, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, baby, baby

[Charli XCX]
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
Miss CupcakKe on this track in three, two, one, do it

[CupcakKe]
I shake it like Jamaican
No birthday, but I'm cakin'
I shake it like I'm tryna get the oil off of the bacon
If I need wakin', I'ma alarm that shakin'
This ass 'bout to move like I need the house vacant
It move, move, move, and you know it won't stop
It shake it like I'm pulled over by a white cop
It shakin' like a virgin, 'bout to give up the box
Told 'em this ass a miracle, like my name Watts
I be purgin' shit, never nervous, bitch
I get on top of that dick, shake it like turbulence
You haven't heard from 'em since, I'm a different expense
And now this pussy need Staples like I'm fuckin' on Vince
Told 'em paddle, paddle, paddle 'cause this pussy in Seattle
I'ma fight my own battles, shake it harder than a rattle
He give anythin' to tackle, wanna bite it like a apple
When this pussy so juicy, wanna come and smell this Snapple, ayy

[Brooke Candy]
Brooke muthafuckin' Candy, Charli XCX
Miss CupcakKe on this muthafuckin' track, oh
Tell me what you want, tell me what you want, daddy
Little bit of sugar, little bit of Brooke Candy
Cocaine-colored sheets where my ass bounce
About to turn your mansion to the pussy palace
And shake it on ya like my ass on the Richter scale
My pussy crucify your body, it's the holy grail
My pussy lean, I got you sippin' from the two cup
I'm 'bout to shake my ass like I'm in a strip club
Hey, my ass is Magic City
Double D's, all-natural big titties
Shake it like a box, fresh vibrator
Ass first class just like Concorde
Damn, my ass so insane
Put me in a straightjacket, still you ain't safe
You can't handle all the jelly, put it on a plate
I'm 'bout to shake the speakers just like Beyoncé

[Charli XCX &amp; Pabllo Vittar]
Shake it, I shake it, I shake it
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it
(Oh darling, you say you don't know me)
I shake it, I-I shake it, I shake it
(Please, haha)
Pabllo Vittar

[Pabllo Vittar]
Pra começar direito eu soletro pra você
Rainha se escreve com dois L e dois T
Como estagiário no trabalho, eu tô sem tempo
Se tenho um problema eu resolvo com talento
Dedinho na boca, sou uma tentação
A pista pega fogo derretendo o paredão
Já mostrei que eu sou queen, falo sério pra vocês
A coroa é pesada, mas eu me acostumei
I shake it, I shake it, o meu popozão
I shake it, achei que aguentasse a pressão
Do MA, cheguei em LA
É a Pabllo e a Charli mais uma vez

[Charli XCX &amp; Pabllo Vittar]
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it all on you (XCX)
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh (Mais uma vez, haha)
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh (I love you, Charli, baby)
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake
