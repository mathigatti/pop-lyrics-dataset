Floating in and out of these clouds
I'm starry and high
Bleached into a light
Please stop, I'd rather that you didn't touch
My porcelain skin, 'cus it's paper thin


Heart is crying out but I'm too cool to let you know
If I was not afraid I'd ask you can you light it up

My mind so slow (can you light it up?)
I need your glow (can you light it up?)
Feeling stupid, lost and so confused
Help me out please tell me what to do
My mind so slow (can you light it up?)

They use me till I turn blue
My body's a mess, there's dirt on my dress
Well I thought that you already knew
My life is a sin, I just want to fit in

Heart is crying out but I'm too cool to let you know
If I was not afraid I'd ask you can you light it up

My mind so slow (can you light it up?)
I need your glow (can you light it up?)
Feeling stupid, lost and so confused
Help me out please tell me what to do
My mind so slow (can you light it up?)

I'm empty and I'm so alone
I have fallen from the sky, I've got a broken soul
The only thing I have is you
So come on baby can you help me
Will you pull me through?

I've been sinking in the darkness and I wanna stop
So tell me b-b-b-b-baby can you light it up

(Can you light it up?)
(Can you light it up?)
Feeling stupid, lost and so confused
Help me out please tell me what to do
My mind so slow (can you light it up?)
My mind so slow (can you light it up?)
I need your glow (can you light it up?)
Feeling stupid, lost and so confused
Help me out please tell me what to do
My mind so slow (can you light it up?)
