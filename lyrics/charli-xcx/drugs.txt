Baby, you the love of my life
Sellin’ all the drugs that I like
Baby, you got it
You know I want it
Baby, you the love of my life
Sellin’ all the drugs that I like
Baby, you got it
You know I want it

Callin’ out for your love
Baby, I’m callin’ out, I can’t do without you
Put ecstasy on my tongue and that’s all I’m tastin’ now
You’re luxurious, I’m stuck
Champagne, cigarettes, convertibles
It’s ‘bout to pop off
Biting on a rose, you make me come
I’m way up, rooftop
You hurt me when you stop
I just can’t get enough, dealer

Baby, you the love of my life
Sellin’ all the drugs that I like
Baby, you got it
You know I want it
You sellin’ all the drugs that I like
Baby, you the love of my life
Baby, you got it
You know I want it

I was never good at dealin’ with no countdown
So feel free to come ‘round when you wanna come ‘round
You’re my favorite drug, just take me to your underworld
And put me on your tongue, hallucinate until you’re toast, girl
Tsu-tsunami, you can’t stop me now, I’m peakin’ too
Off the key, key, and hypnotic, I’m not through with you
When you come it feels like diamonds rainin’ down on me
When I’m with you, heaven on earth is not a fantasy
Roll the windows down, my wrists are ice, you got me so cold
Biting on a flower, blood like water down from my nose
It hurts, but I can’t stop, I just can’t get enough
(I can’t get enough)

Baby, you the love of my life
Sellin’ all the drugs that I like
(Sellin’ all the drugs that I like)
Baby, you got it
You know I want it (Yeah)
Baby, you the love of my life
(The love of my life)
Sellin’ all the drugs that I like
(Sellin’ all the drugs that I like)
Baby, you got it
You know I want it

Dealer, dealer, dealer, ooh
Dealer, dealer, dealer
Baby, you the love of my life
Sellin’ all the drugs that I like, yeah

Love of my life, love of my life
Love, love, love, love
Drugs that I like
Love of my life, love of my life
Love, love, love, love
Drugs that I like
Love of my life, love of my life
Love, love, love, love
Drugs that I like
Love of my life, love of my life
Love, love, love, love
Drugs that I like

Eh-eh-XCX
