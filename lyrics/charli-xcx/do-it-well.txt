Don't you know what you do when you do it well?
Don't you know what you do when you do it well, yeah?


You make me move my feet like a stereotype
I got my hands in the air and my eyes open wide
You make my mind move fast but my brain move slow
Yeah, I'm vicious and delicious but they just can't let me go

You got me under your spell but I know I can break it
Cause I'll take it and control it and then I'll just X-ray it
But I've got your world in my telephone book
And I'll admit you get me going when you do it that good

Don't you know what you do when you do it well, yeah?

You got me thinking like a number, not like an individual
I'm like all them other girls with my back against the wall
Got me sipping Smirnoff and taking off my shoes
You got me playing these games but I'm never gonna lose

Cause your logic's all fucked-up like your heads
But I'll enjoy, destroy it, then I'll put this thing to bed
But I got to admit you got me going pretty good
I'm like a puppet and I'm dancing like you knew that I would

Don't you know what you do when you do it well?
Don't you know what you do when you do it well, yeah?
Don't you know what you do when you do it well?
Don't you know what you do when you do it well, yeah?

You make the stars in the sky seem trippy
You make the skanky girls at the bar seem pretty
You make all the clockwork tick like magic
You make me wanna see you get down and get graphic
