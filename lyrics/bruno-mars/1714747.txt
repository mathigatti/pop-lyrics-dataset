Oh, I was perfect
For the circus
If she did me a do it
Love makes you estupid
I gave it up,
But I guess it was not enough
Cause she never seemed satisfied


Oh oh oh...

I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is?  Oh oh oh
She wanted someone that's perfect
Well okay
But can you tell me who is?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

She set  at the bar
Just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it
But I steel can't don't reach in
She watch me try
At least a thousand times
If she loved me, she'd stop me
But no
Oh oh oh...

I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is? Oh oh oh
She wanted someone that's perfect
Well okay
But can you tell me who is?

I saw something worth my future
So wrong, so wrong
In my mind I was all it took
But I guess I was wrong
Oh oh oh

I know I'm not perfect
But at  the end of the day
Who is?
Oh oh oh
She wants someone that's perfect
Well okay
But can you tell me who is?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
