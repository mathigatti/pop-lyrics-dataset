Sometimes I wonder what heaven feels like
I hope it feels like tonight
Hope it feels like tonight!
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like
I hope it feels like tonight
Hope it feels like tonight!


With that look upon your face
Baby I know what you're thinking about, oh!
You've got your lips along my body
And I'm not gonna stop you know, oh!
You wanna take me to a place
Where I can't control my face somehow, oh!
You know I'm down

So boy, you gonna let me down, oh!
Oh, you got your love dripping all over me
The only thing I can say is: uhuu!
I don't wanna wait
Just my days
It's yours, come get it, get it!

Sometimes I wonder what heaven feels like
I hope it feels like tonight
Hope it feels like tonight!
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like
I hope it feels like tonight
Hope it feels like tonight!

The way you're getting in
I can tell you're not playing, no more!
I'm am angel in disguise
With the devil as surprise for you, oh!

There is no breaking, no stopping
Just go, go, go!
We sing and don't take it personal!
It feels like heaven when

Got me screaming on the morning, oh, oh!
You've got your love tripping all over me
The only thing I can say is uhuuu
I don't wanna wait
Just open up my
It's yours, come get it, get it uhuuu

Sometimes I wonder what heaven feels like
I hope it feels like tonight
Hope it feels like tonight!
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like
I hope it feels like tonight
Hope it feels like tonight!
