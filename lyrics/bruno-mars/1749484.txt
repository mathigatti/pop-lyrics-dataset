Don't it feel good, baby
Don't it feel good, baby
'Cause it's so brand new, baby
'Cause it's so brand new, baby


Don't it feel good, baby
Don't it feel good, baby
'Cause it's so brand new, baby
'Cause it's so brand new, baby

And now here we are (here we are)
In this big old empty room
Staring at each other
Who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute
and now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way
Oohh, uuhh

Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous
'Cause I got you all night,
Don't you worry about a thing, no, no, no, no

Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

Clothes are not required
For what we got playing
Ooh, girl, your my desire
Your wish is my command
Treat you like a princess
Ooh, girl, you're so delicious
Like ice cream on a sunny day
Gonna eat you before you melt away

Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl no need to be nervous, no, no, no, no, ooh
'Cause I got you all night (I got you)
Don't you worry about a thing, no, no, no, no

Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

Don't it feel good, baby
Don't it feel good, baby
'Cause it's so brand new, baby
'Cause it's so brand new, baby

Don't it feel good, baby
Don't it feel good, baby
'Cause it's so brand new, baby
'Cause it's so brand new, baby
Oohh

Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
