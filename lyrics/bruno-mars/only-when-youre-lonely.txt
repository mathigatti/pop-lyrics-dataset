Here I am again
Doing things I saId that I wouldn't do
It's 3 am and I'm rushing out the door to see you
(see you, see you, see you)
Waiting (waiting) all day (all day)
But now you wanna call me
Why do (why do)
You do this to me all the time


After all the things you put me through
Ooh still I come right back
But now I know the truth
I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely (lonely)
If I say I'm gonna leave
That's the only time you want me (want me)
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

Had me fooled from the start
And I quickly gave my heart
Cos I love you, love you, love you
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl
With no one to touch you (touch you, touch you)
Now I'm stronger don't need you any longer
So get off your knees
Your words don't mean anything

After all the things you put me through
Ooh still I come right back
But now I know the truth
I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely (lonely)
If I say I'm gonna leave
That's the only time you want me (want me)
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see
You only want me when you're lonely

Oh nothing's ever changing
Decisions you can't make it
You just think of yourself
And never me at all
If you're with your friend
You just leave me alone
But I won't allow it anymore
So it's stuck on me to move on

Cos I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely (lonely)
If I say I'm gonna leave
That's the only time you want me (want me)
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely (lonely)
If I say I'm gonna leave
That's the only time you want me (want me)
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
