Oh, oh, oh I, I was a city boy
Riding to danger’s where I’d always run
A boy who had his fun
I wouldn't have done
All the things that I've done
If I knew one day you'd come


Now baby, Now baby, Now baby, Now baby
Oh, oh, oh, I, I know it breaks your heart
To picture the only one you wanna love
In someone else's arms
But I wouldn't have done
All the things that I've done
If I knew one day you would come

Now baby, Now baby, Now baby, Now baby
Oh, baby, please
Lets leave the past behind us, behind us
So that we can go where love will find us
Yeah, will find us

I know most girls would leave me
But I know that you believe me

Baby, I, I wish we were seventeen
So I could give you all the innocence
That you give to me
No, I wouldn't have done
All the things that I've done
If I knew one day you would come
If I knew one day you would come
