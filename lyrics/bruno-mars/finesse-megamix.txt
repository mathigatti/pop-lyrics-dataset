You know, you know, we know, we on that

[Nicki Minaj]
I just came up in it a little bit self centered
But did I kill a Queen
Alexander McQueen’s got a wrist on glow
The bottles is on po’
Got that shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yay ayou!
What the fuck I look like bitch I run this town
I ain’t coming out for less than a 100 thou
Man, the last time I checked I was bubbling out
Got to turn down shows, out in Dublin now
Wait wait hold on, maybe they didn’t get that there
Like 11 hundred horses when I switch that gear
Swerve on them sorta like I missed that deer
Then I press that little button on the sit back chair
Bitch I do it cause I get it
I got billion dollar credit
If you got a million dollars you could put it up in bet it
I just be like hello hello but I never could salute them
Young money I do it for the youth dem!


[Cardi B]
Drop top Porsche (Porsche), Rollie' on my wrist (wrist)
Diamonds up and down my chain (aha)
Cardi B, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin'
Bossed up and I changed the game (you see me?)
It's my big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook (shook)
My big, fat ass got all them boys hooked (hooked)
I went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands (ha)
Bruno sang to me, while I do my money dance like ayy
Flexin' on the gram like ayy
Hit the Lil' Jon, okay (okay), okay (okay)
Oh yeah, we drippin' in finesse and getting paid, ow

[Bruno Mars]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Left Eye]
So baby tell me what's up
Can we ascend to higher heights
And when the path gets rough
We can give into brighter nights breathe with peace
Expound by leaps, and soul to reap, our souls to keep
The passion's deep, and filled with heat
Living this life on the hustle, I barely get enough time
You know me from the platinum, how I stack them and shine
You see a lot of contenders, they try to end up in my world
A reputation known as the untouchable girl
I'm moving on now, trying to make a change in my ways
Be the best that I can be to last me all of my days
Now we can blaze pathways or just take our time
Better holla if ya hear me cause Left Eye gon' shine
My eyes don't lie, see how they glisten when you pass me by
You and I don't need permission to be unified
Surely I done seen and heard of many places
Then I travelled around the world, seen many faces
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true
And show me that nobody else can do it better than you
So if you're serious, I'm curious to see what you got
But love is furious cause I believe in blowing up spots

[Lil' Kim]
Ayo shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal
I'll be undressed in the bra all see through
Why you count your jewels thinkin' I'ma cheat you?
The only one thing I wanna do is freak you
Keep your stone sets, I got my own baguettes
And I'll be doin' things that you won't regret
Lil Kim, the Queen Bee, so you best take heed
Shall I proceed? (Yes indeed!)
I'ma throw shade if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade
Who me? Not you, oh yes, who's he?
I even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
But don't blush, just keep this on the hush

[Bruno Mars &amp; Cardi B]
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us? (ayy)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (yeah)
Girl, we got it goin' on
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Girl, we got it goin'
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
You know it, you know it

[Foxy Brown]
Papa just keep me laced up
In Ellen Tracy, uh
Cesare Paciotti, uh
Issac Mizrahi
Fuck around with Dolce
Gabanna, sippin' pure 'Zay with the Ill Na Na
Nigga you fuck around
I’ll have your loyalties and your joints
Nigga your royalties and your points
So what the deal is?
But Foxy Brown met Case, now we laced
Bonnie met Clyde now I'm up in Jamaica breakin' all your paper

[Missy Elliott]
Missy be puttin' it down, I'm the hottest 'round
I told y'all motherfuckers, y'all can't stop me now
Listen to me now, I'm lastin' twenty rounds
And if you want me (nigga) then come on, get me now
Is you with me now? Then biggie, biggie bounce
I know you dig the way I sw-sw-switch my style
Holla
People sing around
Now people gather 'round, now people jump around

[Bruno Mars &amp; Cardi B]
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us? (ayy)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (yeah)
Girl, we got it goin' on
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Girl, we got it goin
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
You know it, you know it

[Lauryn Hill]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem

[Bruno Mars]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Queen Latifah]
Thank you as I come back into the beat
Give a shoutout to my brother L.A.N.C.E
Up in heaven, resting, chilling, watching over me
You know you're too good to be forgotten
Papa wasn't there but there was Lance in the house
And so, to me and Mommy, you the man of the house
Always flip the script back to the old days
I used to rock it on the high school stage
I used to drink 40s
Back then I didn't blaze
Switched to the pipe with the peace these days
Just go on to let you know I flow on
I'm wicked out my gluteus, so ho on and ho on (hoo-ooo)
That's what we about to do (hoo-ooo)
Take you on a mission with the Flavor U
Uh, me no deal with no dibby dibby flip flop
I get mad when it comes to playing hip hop

[Bruno Mars &amp; Cardi B]
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us? (ayy)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (yeah)
Girl, we got it goin' on
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Girl, we got it goin
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
You know it, you know it
