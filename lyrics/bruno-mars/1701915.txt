i'm traveling without her somewhere far away
i keep thinking about her but i know i can't stay
she haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere
she doesn't leave me alone
i can't escape her or erase her
when i know she's not coming home


i can't understand where i went wrong
i can't understand where her love has gone
i don't know where i belong
my world is over
when life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(her world goes on)
when life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(my world is gone)

am i crazy or just human
is this what heartbreak is
what should i be doing
it feels like i got seconds to live
she haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere
she doesn't leave me alone
i can't escape her or erase her
when i know she's not coming home

i can't understand where i went wrong
i can't understand where her love has gone
i don't know where i belong
my world is over
when life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(her world goes on)
when life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(my world is gone)

my world is over while her world goes on
(.. i don't know where i belong
my world is over)
when life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(her world goes on)
when life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on
(my world is gone)
