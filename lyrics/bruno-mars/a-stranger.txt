You use to tell me that you love me
And that's what you would say
You use to buy me flowers
Even not on valentines day
You would surprise me with a dinner
Even though you just ate
But what happened, baby, what happened


We're been going through some changes
(Through some changes)
Like we in different places
(Different places)
And now you think that you
Can just do what you do
Without any consequences
(Consequences)

It's not what you say, but what you don't say
It's not what you do, but what you don't do
It's not where we go, but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger
And I don't recognize you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before

You use to look me in my eyes, but now you just look away
If I call to make some time, you say you just can't stay
Well if you leave me at home alone, for just one more night
I promise it's gonna be the last time

We're been going through some changes
(Through some changes)
Like we in different places
(Different places)
And now you think that you
Can just do what you do
Without any consequences
(Consequences)

It's not what you say, but what you don't say
It's not what you do, but what you don't do
It's not where we go, but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger
And I don't recognize you no more
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before

What you want me to do (do)
I'm not gonna chase after you (you)
Tell me how can I get (get)
Back the man I once met (met)

It's not what you say, but what you don't say (you don't say)
It's not what you do, but what you don't do (you don't do)
It's not where we go, but where we don't go (we don't go)
It's like I don't even know you anymore
(I don't know you no more) You're just a stranger, a stranger
And I don't recognize you no more (don't know you no more)
You're just a stranger (don't know you no more)
A stranger (don't know you no more, more no no no)
