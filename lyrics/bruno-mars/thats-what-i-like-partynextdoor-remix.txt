That thing go raw
That thing go raw
That's what you like I know, I know
Afterparties in the Hills, while you poppin' whoa
That's how it goes
Well let's hit Miami, Biscayne
Might let you change your name for the night
Why, why, why?
So you can act a fool for the night
Oh that's right
Girl I know the tricks
Girl I know the tricks, ooh
But that be the shit I like


Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Tell me why your panties still on
Girl when Ginuwine's playing in the background
I would never make a promise that I can't keep
I'm tryna tell it to you gently
We 'gone do more than kick it, like Jet Li
Bet you 'gone cum before I do don't stress me
Asking if it's you (is it you?), is it's me (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

You say you want a good time
Well here I am, baby, here I am, baby
Talk to me, tell me what's on your mind
If you want it, girl, come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me, baby, tell me, tell me, baby, what you tryna do?

Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
