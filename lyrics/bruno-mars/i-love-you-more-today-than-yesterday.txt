I love you more today than yesterday bruno mars
I don't remember what day it was,
And i didn't notice what's time it was
All i know is that i fell in love with you
And if all my dreams come true
I'll be spending time with you.


Oh, i love you more today than yesterday,
But not as much as tomorrow.
I love you more today than yesterday,
But only not as much as tomorrow.

Oh yeah!
