Damn
It's getting hard to breathe
I'm trying to make her see
That she don't really knows
That I'm trying to find a way
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
So I
I don't wanna be
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Sick away from me
I'm standing shaking ground
And I'm been thinking that I'm gonna lose it


'Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost

Are you talking to me?
I'm already lost

I wish that I could see
What it's making you
Feel this should be
My love is like gunshot
All it takes is a shot for me to blow it all away
I don't wanna feel like I'm just wasting time

It's gonna be with you and no one else
Until you notice me
I need to know right now
'Cause I've been think it that I'm gonna lose it

'Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost

Give me a chance to
But girl you make me nervous
By now you should have noticed me
And what will it take it
To a heavenly
You're driving me insane!

I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
Shes got me
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my weight
But I think she deal I'm already lost

I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
Shes got me
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my weight
But I think she deal I'm already lost

I'm already lost
I'm already lost
Ohhhh, uhhh, ohhh
