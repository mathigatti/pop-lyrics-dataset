We are young, we run free
Stay up late, we don't sleep
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright


Tonight you won't be by your self-self
Just leave your problems on the shelf-shelf
You won't wanna be nowhere else-else
So let's go, so let's go (we got the club like)

Get drunk, toast it up, we don't give a fuck

We are young, we run free
Stay up late, we don't sleep
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright

Throw our hands in the air
Pretty girls everywhere
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright

Our middle fingers in the air-air
So come and join us if you dare-dare
Yeah let's go, yeah let's go (we got the club like)
