It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby?
I think I wanna marry you


Well, I know this little chapel
On the boulevard
We can go
No one will know
Oh, come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed?
Got a pocket full of cash
We can blow
Shots of patron
And it's on, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready like I'm ready

'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby?
I think I wanna marry you

I'll go get a ring
Let the choir bells sing like: Oooh
So what you wanna do?
Let's just run, girl
And if we wake up
And you wanna break up that's cool
No, I wont blame you
It was fun, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready like I'm ready
'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby?
I think I wanna marry you

Just say: I do
Tell me right now, baby
Tell me right now, baby, baby
Just say: I do
Tell me right now, baby
Tell me right now, baby, baby
Oh

It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby?
I think I wanna marry you
