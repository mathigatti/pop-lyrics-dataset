Ooh, I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now


Look what you’re doing, look what you done
But in this jungle you can't run
'Cause what I got for you
I promise it’s a killer, you'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

Ooh, yeah

You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You're just smiling tell me, ‘daddy it's yours’
‘Cause you know how I like it you’s a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops,
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT we don't stop
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming, "Give it to me, baby
Give it to me, motherfucker"

Oh, look what you’re doing, look what you done
But in this jungle you can't run
‘Cause what I got for you
I promise it’s a killer, you'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

Ooh, yeah

You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
You'll never be the same baby once I'm done with you

Oh, you with me, baby, making love like gorillas
You and me, baby, we'll be fuckin' like gorillas
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
