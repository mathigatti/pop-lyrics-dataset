[Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now
All I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters


[Eminem]
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck or get struck like lighting fighters
Keep fighting
Put your lighters up
Point 'em' skyward uh!
Had a dream I was king
I woke up
Still king
This rap games nipple is mine
For the milking
Till' nobody else even fuckin feels me
Till' it kill me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in the music
There is
Or there ever will be
Disagree? Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing, to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave ups using
No more excuses
Excuse me if my head's too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick
But you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around
Crock-of-shit
Who you dicks try to kid?
Flipped dick, you did opposite
You stayed the same
'Cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell'em shove it
Cause it wasn't that
Long ago
When Marshall sat
Luster lacked, lustered
'Cause he couldn't cut
Mustered
Muster up
Nothing
Brain fuzzy
'Cause he's buzzin'
Woke up from that buzz, now you wonder
Why he does it? How he does it
Wasn't cause he had
Buzzards circle round his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass buzzards
Fuck it
Guess it doesn't matter now does it?
What difference it make?
Whats it take?
To get it through you thick skulls, that this ain't
Some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was as dark as I was
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blades to a haters rib cage
And let it be known that from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks
Cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em bic's raise
'Cause I came with five nine
But I feel like I'm six eight

[Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now
All I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Royce Da 5'9"]
By the time you hear this I probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to goin
And buying four or five of the homies, to iron man Audi
My daddy told me, slow down boy you're going to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop to beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr. Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is
Or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears
My daddy got bad back
So it's only right that I write
Till he can march right in to that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his careers Lebron's jersey in twenty years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
Its bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up
Must come down
You goin down
On somethin you don't wanna see
Like a hairy box
Every hour
Happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just a cat's meow, ow
Classic cow
Always down for the catch weight
Like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself
Parks itself
And auto-tunes
Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches
On a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams
Starin' at a bee-hive
And how real is that?
I remember signing my first deal
Now I'm the second best
I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass
Without the MTV awards gag

[Bruno Mars]
You and I
I know what it's like
To be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight
We're alright
So hold up your lights
Let it shine
'Cause

This one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now
All I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
