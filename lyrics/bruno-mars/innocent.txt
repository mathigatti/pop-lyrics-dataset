Ohh, ohh

Don't say its over
Cuz your girls in your ear all the time
It's paranoia
They've been playing tricks on your mind
Do they control ya
Girl you know me better then I
Oh let me show ya
Oh let me show ya, aahh


No I would never do that to you,
Just look in my eyes you know I wont lie,ohh
And I would do all I can to prove
Girl I will prove it

If I'm guilty I would pay
For the crime you said I made
But I swear it wasnt me,
No I didnt do it.
If I'm guilty I would pay,
Girl I know I made mistakes,
But before you sentence me
no, I didn't do it

I'm pleading innocent, innocent,
You know I wouldn't do that to you,
Girl i'm pleading innocent, innocent,
I'm innocent.

They say I'm creepy,
Well they never got to know I'm in tears
Why you believe them
Thought you would come to my defense.
Now you deceived me,
When I thought we were on the same side
I see you weepin'
Baby just dry your eyes, ohh

No I would never do that to you,
Girl look in my eyes you know I wont lie, ohh
And I would do all I can to prove
Girl I will prove it

If I'm guilty I would Pay
For the crime you said I made
But I swear it wasnt me,
No I didnt do it.
If I'm guilty I would Pay,
Girl I know I made Mistakes,
But before you sentence me
No, I didn't do it

I'm pleading innocent, innocent,
You know I wouldn't do that to you,
Girl I'm pleading innocent, innocent,
I'm innocent.
