With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going

Lighting up that smoke of mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mamma smile that's a blessing

Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we
Talking to each other again

You've been my only friend (My only friend)
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
