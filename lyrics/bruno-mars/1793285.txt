you know what they say
do as to others as they would do to you
look at you now
i got you running (running)


ohh ohh oh oh
ohh ohh oh oh

i bet you thought that you could just get away with it
tip toed in my life, break everything inside and not stay to fix it
but how foolish of you to think i was a fool
and played me like you did everyone else
i caught you cheating so you don't have an alibi
don't try to prove otherwise cos evidence don't lie
i got phone bills, i got emails
case closed i got all the proof
how does it feel to know it's all coming back to you (you)

i'm sorry but you're guilty as charged
for breaking in and stealing my heart
you thought that you could just get away
but you picked the wrong girl to play
and look who's getchu on the run now (the run now)
you ain't got no where to hide
baby i getchu on the run now (the run now)
you won't get away this time
baby i getchu on the run

you looking over your shoulder cos you know they're coming for you
every girl that you f*cked over is gonna expose the truth
that you're a lying, cheat
something like a heart thief
that takes advantage and takes every girl for granted
but it's clear to me that you don't care and won't ever change
don't care that all these broken hearts won't be the same
we know your secrets (we know your secrets),
we know your lies (we know your lies)
and now it's time for you to pay the price
how does it feel to know it's all coming back to you (you)

i'm sorry but you're guilty as charged
for breaking in and stealing my heart (my heart)
you thought that you could just get away
but you picked the wrong girl to play
and look who's getchu on the run now (the run now)
you ain't got no where to hide
baby i getchu on the run now (the run now)
you won't get away this time
baby i getchu on the run

no matter where you go i'm gonna hunt you down
you're all alone and nobody's gonna help you up
oh look at you (look at you)
such a fool (such a fool)
you did it to yourself and now you're running (running)

i'm sorry but you're guilty as charged
for breaking in and stealing my heart
you thought that you could just get away
but you picked the wrong girl to play
and look who's getchu on the run now (the run now)
you ain't got no where to hide
baby i getchu on the run now (the run now)
you won't get away this time
baby i getchu on the run

i'm sorry but you're guilty as charged
for breaking in and stealing my heart
(breaking in and stealing my heart)
you thought that you could just get away
but you picked the wrong girl to play
and look who's getchu on the run now (the run now)
you ain't got no where to hide
baby i getchu on the run now (the run now)
you won't get away this time
baby i getchu on the run

baby baby baby baby
