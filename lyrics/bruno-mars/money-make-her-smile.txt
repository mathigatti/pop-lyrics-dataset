Are you getting back, coming to the stage is a girl who's new in town
She goes by the name where your stacks at
This pretty little thing I swear wont let you down
Watch it drop it like
Hey


It's not complicated, so this wont take a while
You see music make her dance, and money money money make her smile
Money money money make her smile
Money money money make her smile

She's a super freak
You wouldnt know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls
No she dont go where preachers preach
She only go to the church when dollars foam
Watch it drop it like
Hey

It's not complicated, so this wont take a while
You see music make her dance, and money money money make her smile
Money money money make her smile
Money money money make her smile

Watch her

It's not complicated, so this wont take a while
You see music make her dance, and money money money make her smile
Money money money make her smile
Money money money make her smile
