Oooohhhh ooohhhh

I used to go out of my mind tryna
Redefine the real meaning of love
I lost my dignity, forgot about me
I was so lost in us
I had to take on,
Because you had me stuck in the middle of nowhere
And my faith it would shake,
I know you're trying your best to take me


[Chorus]
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way for far too long
Dream maker now it's taking your place
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait til you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long

You used to be the man of my dreams
Only now it seems you were just a nightmare
But this little light of mine told me open my eyes
There's more than darkness out there
I'm not gonna run from ya,
Imma walk from ya,
I'm not afraid of ya, I've escaped from ya
And my faith is in place
In the night I no longer see your face!

[Chorus]
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way for far too long
Dream maker now it's taking your place
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait til you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long

Ooohhhhhhhhhh
From ashes to ashes and dust to us
Ooohhhh
I'm not gonna run from ya, imma walk from ya,
I'm not afraid of ya, I've escaped from ya
I'm not gonna run from ya, imma walk from ya,
I'm not afraid of ya, I've escaped from ya
(Yeahhh)

[Chorus]
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way for far too long
Dream maker now it's taking your place
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait til you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
Can't wait til you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
Can't wait til you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
Can't wait til you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
