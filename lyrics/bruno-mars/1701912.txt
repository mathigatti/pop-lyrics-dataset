It's been so long since you been gone,
and now we're here
The music's on,
we're feeling freaky (oh)
I want you in my bedroom,
you want me closer to you
What are we doing?
Let's get to it


I lay you down,
take off your clothes,
and kiss your lips
It feels so good, ooh you're saying more
I wanna be inside you
Ooh girl you got that fire
I can't wait no longer I just gotta take control

The lights in the club are turning you on
Now girl let's pretend we both are alone
We'll finish this up when we get home
The only thing I need from you girl

Is to press your body,
on my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
you control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just (press it, press it)

My favorite place is that space between your legs and yours hips
Ooh, got me licking my lips
Wanna get up on it
It's a special thing that we be doing
F'ina be bad boy
Girl I'm (?)doing(?)
It ain't no secret 'bout what it is
Come on girl serve me the dish

The lights in the club are turning you on
Now girl let's pretend we both are alone
We'll finish this up when we get home
The only thing I need from you girl

Is to press your body,
on my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
you control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just

Press your body,
on my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
you control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just press

Girl you're the only thing that I see
So don't you take your body from me
And there's no other place I'd rather be
Oh girl there's something about your body, body, body
Ooh the way you shakin' is so naughty, naughty, naughty
Right now we got our own little party, party, party
So good,
the way you press your body on me
All I need from you

Is to press your body,
on my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
you control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just

Press your body,
on my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
you control the tempo
Look over your shoulder

Girl there's something about your body, body, body
Oh the way you shakin' is so naughty, naughty, naughty
Right now we got our own little party, party, party
So good,
the way you press your body on me
All I need from you
is to press it
