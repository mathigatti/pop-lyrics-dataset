This hit, that ice cold
Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
This one, for them hood girls
Them good girls
Straight masterpieces
Stylin', while in
Livin’ it up in the city
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
Got kiss myself, I’m so pretty


I’m too hot (hot damn)
Call the police and a fireman
I’m too hot (hot damn)
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
I’m too hot (hot damn)
Say my name, you know who I am
I’m too hot (hot damn)
And my band 'bout that money
Break it down

Girls, hit your hallelujah
Girls, hit your hallelujah
Girls, hit your hallelujah
'Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
'Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
'Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don’t believe me, just watch (come on)

Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

Stop
Wait a minute
Fill my cup, pour some liquor in it
Take a sip, sign a check
Julio! Get the stretch!
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon’ show out
Smoother than a fresh dry skippy

I’m too hot (hot damn)
Call the police and a fireman
I’m too hot (hot damn)
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
I’m too hot (hot damn)
Say my name, you know who I am
I’m too hot (hot damn)
And my band 'bout that money
Break it down

Girls, hit your hallelujah
Girls, hit your hallelujah
Girls, hit your hallelujah
'Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
'Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
'Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don’t believe me, just watch (come on)

Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Before we leave
Lemme tell y’all a lil’ something
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
I said Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up

Come on, dance
Jump on it
If you sexy, then flaunt it
If you freaky, then own it
Don’t brag about it, come show me
Come on, dance
Jump on it
If you sexy, then flaunt it
Well, it’s Saturday night and we in the spot

Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (come on)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (come on)

Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (come on)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?)
Uptown Funk you up
