Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night, oh, I
I swear the world better prepare


One, two, one, two, three

Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh!)
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh!)

Never had much faith in love or miracles
(Ooh!)
Never wanna put my heart on the line
(Ooh!)
But swimming in your world is something spiritual
(Ooh!)
I'm born again every time you spend the night
(Ooh!)

‘Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah
‘Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long

Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?

‘Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long

Give me all, give me all, give me all your attention, baby
I got to tell you a little something about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh, you're a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else

I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
Oh, girl, I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine

Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you

Ah yeah,
Well, look at here, look at here
Ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab

But little does she know
That I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night
It is her I'll be holding

I love you so
That's what you'll say (that's what you'll say)
You'll tell me
Baby, baby, please don't go away(don't go away)
But when I play, I never stay (I'll never stay)

To every girl that I meet, yeah
This is what I say

Run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, getaway, getaway, darling
'Cause everything you heard is true

Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway, baby

See I ain't try to hurt you, baby
No, no, I just wanna work you, baby, yup, yup
See I ain't try to hurt you, baby
No, no, I just wanna work you, baby

If you scared you better run
You better run, you better run

You better give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now

What I've got you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water

What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue

Realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the kaiser?

Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say hell yes

I'm a low brow, but I rock a little, know how?
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart, get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now

Bob Marley, poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley, walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me, can't you see I'm gonna cough it?

Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now

Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Baby give it away

Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she don't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, do I look okay
I say

When I see your face
There is not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are, hey

When I see your face
There is not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
