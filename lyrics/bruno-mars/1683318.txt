She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there


Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

Little miss perfect sitting at the train stop
Red nike high tops listening to hip-hop
While we were waiting started conversating
Before I got her name along came a train

(Ooh) next stop Brooklyn
(Ooh) now I'm lookin'

She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

On the street kickin rocks circling the same block
Green farm flatbush checking every corner shop
Tappin' people's shoulders askin if they know her
Everyday's the same back to the train

(Ooh) next stop Brooklyn
(Ooh) I'm still lookin'

She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wonder if we'll ever meet again
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wonder we we'll ever meet again
Yeah I wonder if we'll ever meet again
I hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn
