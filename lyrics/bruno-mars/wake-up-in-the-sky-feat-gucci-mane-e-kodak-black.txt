Fly, fly, fly
It's Gucci (it's Gucci)
Huh? Fly (woo)


I drink 'til I'm drunk (yeah), smoke til I'm high (yeah)
Castle on the hill (well damn), wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly (you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)
The ladies love the luxury (yeah), that's why they all fuck with me (woo)
Out here with the moves (yeesh) like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly (you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly

[Gucci Mane]
Huh, huh, huh
I stay fresh as hell, take a pic, I might as well, hell
Drop the top and take a selfie, my car drives itself
I got white girls blushin', homie, college girls rushin' on me (woo)
All my diamonds custom, so they clutchin' and they touchin' on me
Ooh, pick his vegetables
Ooh, think is edible
Ooh, it's incredible
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I smell like Bond Number 9, nine
Section full of foreign dimes
Bitch is starin' at me sayin': Wow
Unforgettable like Nat King Cole
Gucci berry wine, don't sneak and tell your ho (well damn)
A one man show, a human bank roll (whoa)
She lost in the sauce 'cause Gucci got the glow (huh)

[Bruno Mars &amp; Gucci Mane]

[Kodak Black]

Mine so fly, don't need no flight attendant
Big Cuban link, don't need no pendant
I ain't never had no pot to piss in, yeah
Now all my records trendin'
Oh my, I came from stealing bikes to flying on a G5
I don't know why I been smokin' this Cherry Pie so much
But this my life
I'm on Adderall, I be smellin' Hi-Tec when I piss
Like it's basketball, I drop 50-pointer on my wrist
It's Lil Kodak take a pic
I came home to drop the heat
All these diamonds got me sick, I'm actin' spoiled (woo)
Cutlass sittin' high, I feel like I can fly
So fresh to death it's crazy, I feel like I can die
I done finally got my wings
They make me wanna sing (glee)
