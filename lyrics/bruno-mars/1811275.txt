Ahh yes!

Well look at here, look at here
Ah what do we have?
Another pretty thing ready for me to crap
But little does she know
That I'm a wolf in sheepsclothing
'Cause at the end of the night
It is her I'll be holding


I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me
Baby, baby, please don't go away
But when I play, I never stay

To every girl that I meet here
This is what I say
Run run runaway, runaway baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get get getaway, getaway darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run run runaway, runaway baby

Uh, ahh yeah
Well let me think, let me think
Ah what should I do?
So many eager young bunny's
That I'd like to persue
Now even now they eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me
Baby, baby, please don't go away
But when I play, I never stay

To every girl that I meet
This is what I say
Run run runaway, runaway baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get get getaway, getaway darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause what knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run run runaway, runaway baby

See I ain't try to hurt you baby
No, no, no I just wanna work you baby
Yup yup
See I ain't try to hurt you baby
No, no, no I just wanna work you baby

If you scared you better run (You better run)
You better run (You better run)
You better run (You better run)
You better, you better, you better
Run run runaway, runaway baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get get getaway, getaway darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause what knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run run runaway, runaway baby!
