Keep crawling up touching ya, kissing ya, loving ya
The ice is melting down your back
Cause there's a flame between us
Girl with every single touch
It's like your body strikes a match

I'mma need to
Stop (stop)
Drop (drop)
And roll (roll)
Cause baby girl your heat's out of control

Feels like i'm on fire (fire) (ey ey ey)
My body's a 100 degrees
Every time you standing next to me
Feels like i'm on fire (fire) (ey ey ey)
Girl you make me so hot
I don't want it to stop (no)
Oh you got me burning up (oh-oh) burning up
(oh-oh) burning up (oh-oh) oh
So turn it up (oh-oh) turn it up (oh-oh) some more
Feels like i'm on fire (fire) (ey ey ey)
My temperature is higher
I'm sweating with desire
Feels like i'm on fire

The smoke detector's going off
The neighbour's gonna make the call
The fire trucks are on their way (oh their way, oh!)
Now we're both turning red
We've been up and down the bed
We don't care so we say

I'mma need to
Stop (stop)
Drop (drop)
And roll (roll)
Cause baby girl your heat's (your heat's)
out of (out of) control (control)

Feels like i'm on fire (fire) (ey ey ey)
My body's a 100 degrees (ohhhh)
Every time your standing next to me

Feels like i'm on fire (fire) (ey ey ey)
Girl you make me so hot (hot)

Oh you got me burning up (oh-oh) burning up
(oh-oh) burning up (oh-oh)
So turn it up (oh-oh) turn it up (oh-oh) some more (turn it up!)
Feels like i'm on fire (fire) (ey ey ey)
My temperature is higher
I'm sweating with desire
Feels like i'm on fire

Girl we got the house burning down (uh)
But ain't nobody gonna save us now (oooh)
And i don't care who's knocking on the door
I'mma give you more (more) more (more) more (more)

Feels like i'm on fire (fire) (ey ey ey)
