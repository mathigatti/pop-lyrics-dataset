If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore


There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor
Oh, so keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
And keep you from walkin' out the door

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away
Everyday it will rain, rain, rain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Oh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin': There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Oh, but little darlin', watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces, 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away
Everyday it will rain, rain, rain

Oh, don't you say (don't you say)
Goodbye (goodbye)
Don't you say (don't you say)
Goodbye (goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces, till I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
And just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away
Everyday it will rain, rain, rain
