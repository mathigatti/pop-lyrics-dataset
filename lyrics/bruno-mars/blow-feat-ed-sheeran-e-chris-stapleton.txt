I'm feelin' like a bullet jumpin' out a gun
I'm feelin' like a winner, I feel like the one
You're doing something to me, you're doing something strange
We'll jump back, talk to me woman
You make me wanna make a baby, baby, uh


A supernatural woman, a supernatural freak
Don't know what to do, got me feelin' weak
Oh, I wanna call you fever, baby, you could set a fire on me
Hot damn, poppin' like a pistol, mama
It got me down on my knees, baby, please

I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind

You're redder than the rocket, you little fashion queen
Everybody's watching, pretty little thing
Baby, tell me what's your fantasy
Come closer, let's talk about it
You want one night in my limousine
Whipped cream, and everything in between, yeah

I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you, yeah
Like golden, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind
I'm comin', baby

I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind
