How do I end up in the same old place?
Faced again with the same mistakes
So stop, thinkin' I know what is right
But life proves me wrong everytime


Takin' roads that lead me nowhere
How do I expect to get there?
But when will I learn to just put you first?

(Chorus)
I come to you now when I need you,
But why do I wait to come see you?
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you
Can I move on (Can I move on)

(Oh)

When I am weak
It's you that makes me strong
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I begin to close my eyes
And listen to my heart
With you, life is so easy
Why do I make it hard?

Oh, takin' roads that lead me nowhere
How do I expect to get there?
But when will I learn to just put you first?

(Hey!)
(Chorus)
I come to you now when I need you,
But why do I wait to come see you?
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you
Can I move on (Can I move on)

I can't out of my own way
Let you have your way
Cause I realize
I'm not good on my own
I'm there for you, I'll serve for you
I can't live without you. Noooo

(Chorus)
I come to you now when I need you,
But why do I wait to come see you?
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong, I was wrong,
I was wrong
With only you, only you, with only you
Can I move on, can I move on,
Can I move on
