Now Hollywood wants to make you think they know what love is.
But I'm a tell you what true love is.
Love is not what you see in the movies.
Its not the ecstasy, its not what you see in that scene
you know what I mean? I'm telling you right now, true love is sacrifice.
Always thinking my mind it's waiting for you if you crossing the
This love is true, now are we alive
And I know that you gone, so gone
The signs I got, this feeling
Cause what I found, this is deeper than life
I know that I get lost in this feeling
I can see all in me, all in me, all in me


x 2
I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love

Therefore, a thought in my heart, could that be searching for you
An universe for 2, so please ride through
Now I'm away and you see that it's fate, it's fate
The signs I got, this feeling
Cause what I found, this is deeper than life
I know that I get lost in this feeling
I can see all in me, all in me, all in me

x 2
I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love.
