It's no way there can be someone as sexy as you,
(Girl you know I'm right about it)
Maybe you're saying things to keep me from you,
(When you tell me that your friends are all sexy too.)

There's something special about the look in your face,
(Never have I seen a smile like your's before.)
If you're not really in to get in with me,
(Then I got a question for you.)

Will You,
Take Me,
To the Planet,
You're From?

You gotta be from somewhere out of this world.
(Cause they don't make them quite as bad as you on this planet babe.)
Your eyes, make me feel.
(Like I can fly far away with you tonight.)

Take me for a ride I wish that you will.
(So you can tell me more about you)
Or maybe show me something else just as beautiful.
(But you know that ain't happening)

Will You,
Take Me,
To the Planet,
You're From?

(Hey)
Can't imagine being in a place where everybody's as fine as you.
Couldn't live with out it, baby there's no doubt about it.

Will You,
Take Me,
To the Planet,
You're From?
