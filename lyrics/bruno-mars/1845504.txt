Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live
Oh take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open


Gave you all i had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all i ever ask
Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah yeah)
You know i'd do anything for ya (yeah yeah)
Oh whoa oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes i would die for you baby
But you won't do the same
No no no no

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me till i'm numb
Tell the devil i said hey when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman that's just what you are
Yeah you smile in my face then rip the breaks out my car

Gave you all i had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all i ever ask
Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah yeah)
You know i'd do anything for ya (yeah yeah)
Oh whoa oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes i would die for you baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
Ooh you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you love me, you're a liar
Cause you never ever, ever did

But darling i'd still catch a grenade for ya (yeah yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah yeah)
You know i'd do anything for ya (yeah yeah)
Oh whoa oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes i would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No no no no no
