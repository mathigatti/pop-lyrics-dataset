That Girl That Girl


Everytime I Came Around
She Made Her Body Go Down
Her Physical Was So Crazy
She Could Make A Blind Man See
Ooh

Before Then We Got Seperated
She Was Gone Before I Could Say Shit
And I aint Looking For No Replacement
Noo-Whoa Whoa Whoa
If I Gotta Almost Search The Whole Club
Trying To Get To Her Before Shes SoberS Up
Let Me See You Throw Your hands Up
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa

Where Did She go
Where Did She go
Where'd She go
Where'd She go

Ive Been Looking For Her All Night
Where Did She go
Where Did She go
Where'd She go
Ive Been Looking For Her All Night

Im Looking For The Girl
Im Looking For The Girl
Im Looking For The Girl
That Girl That Girl

I Mustve Seen Her Beauty At The Bar
Under The Strobe Lights
Looking Like A Star
(Looking Like A Star Girl)
But Everyone Started Rushing Me
Looking Through The Crowd
Shawty Left The Scene Oh!

Before Then We Got Seperated
She Was Gone Before I Could Say Shit
And I aint Looking For No Replacement
Noo-Whoa Whoa Whoa
If I Gotta Almost Search The Whole Club
Trying To Get To Her Before Shes SoberS Up
Let Me See You Throw Your hands Up
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa

Where Did She go
Where Did She go
Where'd She go
