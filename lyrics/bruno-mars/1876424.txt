We've been hanging out all night
Everythings been so nice
Wish i didn't have to go
Feeling sexy in the bentley
Touching me so gently
But i gotta get home

So many things to tell ya
Little since i held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So heres my proposition
Oh boy just listen
Before we just go down this road

Take me the long way home
Ain't trying to leave you now
Ain't no rush so can you slow it down
Take me the long way home
I know that we pulling up
Circle around the block
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we there
Touch me while we there
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we there
Touch me while we there
Just take me the long way home

I wish i could stay all night
But i can't tonight
Cause i gotta be up at 6 (am in the mourning)
Boy you made my heart melt
When you undid my seatbelt
Told me to come give you a kiss

So many things to tell ya
So long since i held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So heres my proposition
Oh boy just listen
Before we just go down this road

Take me the long way home
Ain't trying to leave you now
Ain't no rush so can you slow it down
Take me the long way home
I know that we pulling up
Circle around the block
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we there
Touch me while we there
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we there
Touch me while we there
Just take me the long way home

Something about ya wants me to drive all night all night all night long
I can't wait to see you the next time we on

Take me the long way home
Ain't trying to leave you now
Ain't no rush so can you slow it down
Take me the long way home
I know that we pulling up
Circle around the block
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we there
Touch me while we there
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we there
Touch me while we there
Just take me the long way home

Just take me the long way home
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Kiss me while we there
Touch me while we there
Just take me the long way home
Oooh oh oh oh
Kiss me while we there
Touch me while we there
Just take me the long way home
