Hun! Now greetings to the world (all of this)
Voice and one choir bruno mars alongside junior gong too zilla!, na mean!


Standing at this liquor store,
Whikey coming through my pores,
Feeling like I ran this whole block
Lot of ticket, cheap beer,
That's why you can catch me here
Trying to scratch my way up to the top

Because my job's got me going no where
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be ok tomorrow

Me and my guitar tonight
Singing to the city lights
Trying to live with more than what I got
Because 68 cents just
Ain't gon' pay the rent so,
I'll be out until they call the cops

(Damian's part)
Here comes Junior Gong
I'm flying high like a superman
And thinking that I ran the whole block
I don't know if it is just because
Pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I wouldn't stand up to the cops
And stand up to the big guys, because
All of them are saps
All the talk them a talk and them fly make no drop
Enough ghetto youth cannot escape the trap.
