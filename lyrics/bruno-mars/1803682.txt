[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Maybe if I jump or spread my wings
I know I've been wrong about these things
I don't care if noone else believes
I think that if you believe it then maybe we'll make it
Tonight
Oh tonight
If you believe in me like I believe in you
Tonight
Tonight
Because impossible is possible tonight


[Verse 1: Johnny Angel]
Some 'bout the day
Some 'bout the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
With' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
Low like Kesha when she on the mic
Move on to another cause she wasn't treated right
I could relate to that boy Drizzy
How did I wind up right here with you
? you can achieve if you do believe
Gotta chase your dreams true reality
No fantasy enjoy it while you have it
Relax and take it in
I tell as your friend your friend to the end

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Johnny Angel]
Some 'bout the day
Some 'bout the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
With' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
We could get together like it's New Years Eve
Met a lotta girls but cute what I need
I live life fast...
Tryna hang on passenger...
I need a companion on this campaign
Felt so much pain when the rain goes away believe in sunny days
One life to live gotta be epic or be... you can be my bella

[Chorus]
