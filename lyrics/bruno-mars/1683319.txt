If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
I'll be the light to guide you
Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need


You can count on me like one, two, three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like four, three, two
You'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are suppose to do
Oh, yeah

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, uh, uh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, uh, uh)
(Yeah, yeah)

If you tossing and you turning and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Everyday I will remind you
Oh
Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need

You can count on me like one, two, three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like four, three, two
You'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are suppose to do
Oh, yeah

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, uh, uh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, uh, uh)
(Yeah, yeah)

You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
I'll never let go, never say good bye

You know you can count on me like one, two, three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like four, three, two
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are suppose to do
Oh, yeah

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, uh, uh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, uh, uh)

You can count on me
'Cause I can count on you
