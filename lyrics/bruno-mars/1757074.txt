Now, Hollywood wants to make you think they know what love is
But I'm a tell you what true love is
Love is not what you see in the movies
It's not the ecstasy, it's not what you see in that scene
You know what I mean?
I'm telling you right now, true love is sacrifice


Love is thinking about others before you think about yourself
Love is selfless, not selfish
Love is God and God is love
Love is when you lay down your life for another
Whether for your brother, your mother, your father or your sister
It's even laying down your life for your enemies
That's unthinkable, but think about that
Love is true
Think

I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love

Love is patient, love is kind
It does not envy, it does not boast
It is not proud
Love is not rude, it is not self-seeking
It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of
Wrongs
You see love does not delight in evil, but rejoices
with the truth
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, it always perseveres
Love never fails
Love is everlasting
It's eternal, it goes on and on, it goes beyond time
Love is the only thing that will last when you die
But ask the question why?
Do you have love?

I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love

There is no greater love than this
Than he who lays down his life for his friends
Now are you willing to lay down your life for your
friends?
You're probably willing to lay down your life for your mother, your father, or your best friends
But are you willing to lay down your life for even
those that hate you?

I'm going to tell you who did that
The definition of love is Jesus Christ
He is love
The nails in his hands, the thorns in his brow
Hanging on a cross for your sin, my sins
That is love he died for you and me while we still
hated him
That is love
God is true love, and if you don't know this love
Now is the time to know, perfect love

I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love

I'll put you in front of me
So everybody can see
My love, this is my love
I know that I'll be alright
As long as you are my guide
My love, this is my love
