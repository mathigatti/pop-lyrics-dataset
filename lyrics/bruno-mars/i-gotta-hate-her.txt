She took costumes and carries
And tight her with a?
Dont know she was squatter
Want me to make a tune
She said she like my pictures
And I can be her view
Her? Just got a dictum
And I will make it spoon


Its been two weeks I miss her
She wont return my calls
It doesnt take you like I read and?
Ooh no ive gotta do it

And we sure getting moving on

You know I gotta hate her, hate her, hate her
And hate her and get her on my brain, my brain
And I just wanna take her and take her
And shut her on my veins

Thats why I wanna hate her
And hate her and hate her
And get her on my brain
My brain, my brain
And I just wanna take her and take her
And shut her on my veins
The actions of a feeling
Lets start by hate her
Yeah

Thats why I gotta hate her
