Ooh!
Hoo!
Woo, woo!


You think that you're so fly
'Cause you caught my eye
When we first started dancing on the floor

Yes you can buy me a drink
But don't you start to think
Automatically you're taking me home

Oooh
You know you're fine like I'm fine
And you shine like I shine

And all this sexy flirting
Oou, you know it's working

But even though you're cute
Please don't get it confused
'Cause I'm miss idependent
If you don't miss pretending

I'm not the one
If you don't want yourself to turn
I'm not the one
If you don't want that good good every night
I'm not the one
'Cause I'm the type to treat you right

So boy don't waste your time
If you're looking for this tonight

I'm not the one
