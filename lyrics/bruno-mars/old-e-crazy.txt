Will you still call me baby
When I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy,
Will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same?
Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty when my hair's grey?
Will you still call me baby
When I'm old and crazy?


Will you still hold my hand
When my clothes are out of style?
My teeth all ran away and I don't ever save smile

Will you still call me baby
When I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy,
Will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same?
Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty when my hair's grey?
Will you still call me baby
When I'm old and crazy?

Will you still wanna dance
Even if my hips are weak?
My ears don't hear so well
And I can't find the beat

Will you still call me baby
When I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy,
Will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same?
Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty when my hair's grey?
Will you still call me baby?
Will you still call me baby?
Will you still call me baby
When I'm old and crazy?
