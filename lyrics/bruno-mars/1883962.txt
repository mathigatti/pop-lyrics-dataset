Feel your heart beating fast
Hold me close make it last
We knew this day would come
So take a breath leave me and
Was so scared of you leaving
Wish we could both just run


Wish we could run it off
But we can't stop time
Seems the clock is running too fast
And now i'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask

You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh

Our phone calls will have to do
Write you letters just to prove
You're the only thing on my mind
I'm goingâ€¦
Just hold on I promise you
Soon you'll be here by my side
But we can't stop time
Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now i'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask

You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh
