So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free


Uh, Uh huh
So what I keep 'em rolled up
Saggin' my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my n-ggas
Keep it player for this hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on
and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with you b-tch smokin' grade A

Yeah, uh you know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I'm on the chase
Chevy, it's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keep slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front four blunts, like "Khalifa put the weed in a J"

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh, and now I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in here's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin everywhere we going and now you know one when I step right up
Get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin you're down
Find out how to turn things around, nothing's looking up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up, and round up and do my thing
Now I'm chillin, fresh out of class filling
Like I'm on my own and I can probably own a building
Got..., no job, no children
Had the science project
Me and Mac kill it
THC MAC DEV HD3
Hi, it's me
This is us, we gon' fuss
We gon' fight, we gon' roll
Live our life

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
