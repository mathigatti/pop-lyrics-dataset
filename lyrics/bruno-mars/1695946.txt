She wakes up in the morning.. (morning)
Jumps in the shower.. (shower)
ooooh... ooooh...
Then rubs on her lotion.. (lotion)
While she's wrapped in her towel.. (towel)
ooooh... ooooh...
And no music on
But she dance with perfection... (perfection)
ooooh... ooooh...
I swear the bathrooms a club
The way she's showing love to her reflection.. (reflection)
ooooh... ooooh...


Every morning I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep
But I don't miss a show

My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror.. dance
Ooooh she's so cute.. cute.. cute
Dancing in the nude.. nude.. nude
Oooh. My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror

It's late in the evening.. evening
We got dinner reservations.. (reservations)
ooooh... ooooh...
She's taking her time
But I don't mind waiting
Nooo Noooo
I don't get impatient
Cause when she gets naked
Oh the temptation.. Oh the temptation
You make me wanna cancel all of our plans
Keep you right where you stand
Just wanna see you dance ooh

Every morning I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep
But I don't miss a show

My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror.. dance
Ooooh she's so cute.. cute.. cute
Dancing in the nude.. nude.. nude
Oooh. My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror

Ohhhhh
She's singing to herself like Da-da-da-da-da-da
Ohhhhh
She's singing to herself like Da-da-da-da-da-da

My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror.. dance
Ooooh she's so cute.. cute.. cute
Dancing in the nude.. nude.. nude
Oooh. My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
