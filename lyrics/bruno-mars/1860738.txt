Yeah, ha, Hey Darlin, Yeah...

Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles, c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night
Feeling like... You won't come thru
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you


Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round

I'm goin' in circles, c-circles, for you!

I give you everything, but, it's not enough
You started being easy but lately you've made it rough (for us)
You say you need me but then turn me away
Got me, oh so confused, should I leave or should I stay?

(Baby tell me what you want) A little more time
(Baby tell me what you need) Baby all your love
(How far you tryna go?) All the way
(Girl I just don't know) Make up your mind

Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles, c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night
Feeling like... You won't come thru
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you

Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round we go

I'm goin' in circles, c-circles, for you!
