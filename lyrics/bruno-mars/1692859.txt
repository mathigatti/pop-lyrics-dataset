Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby


I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking: Maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go (we should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go (go), go (go), go

Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)

They might say hi (hi), and I might say hey (hey)
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say (why?)
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you), yeah

Hands down, there will never be another one (nope)
I've been around, and I've never seen another one (never)
Because your style, I 'aint really got nothin' on (nothing)
And you wild when you 'aint got nothin' on (haha)
Baby, you the whole package
Plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real, while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stopâ€“ now think about it

I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show (steal the show)
And just like that girl, you got me froze (you got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew, well, now you know (know), know (know), know

Beautiful girls all over the world (all the world)
I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted (why?)
They got nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)

They might say hi (hi), and I might say hey (hey)
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say (why?)
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you), yeah

Everywhere I go, I'm always hearing your name
And no matter where I'm at, girl, you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane, or a car, or a train
No other girl's on my brain, and you the one to blame

Beautiful girls all over the world (all the world)
I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted (why?)
They got nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)

They might say hi (hi), and I might say hey (hello)
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say (why?)
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)
Nothing on you, baby
(N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you), yeah

Yeah
And that's just how we do it
And I'ma just let this ride
B.o.B
And Bruno Mars
