If I told you I was perfect I'd be lying
If there's somethin I'm not doing, girl I'm trying
I know I'm no angel
But I'm not so bad


If you see me at the party conversating
That does not mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I'm no angel
But I'm not so bad

You should know there's beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you baby
They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby

I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to new orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know

Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (yeah)
Nothing on you, baby (n-n-n-nothing on you, baby, n-nothing on you)
