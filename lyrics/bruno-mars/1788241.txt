1, 2, 3 ooohh
He drives a motorcycle, tattoo's everywhere
He got a long rap sheet, that's right my baby ain't scared
And when he talks that talk, he can back it up, ooh
And when he comes there to it, can nobody come between our love


I know some girls like good boys,
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go

Ohh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'm a take you home even though
You're my mamas worst nightmare

He drinks his Jack with no Cola, cause he likes to feel the burn
His middle finger to the law, no this boy will never learn
Everything wrong about him yeah,it turns me on
We live the good life, sleep all day and party all night long

I know some girls like good boys,
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go

Ohh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'm a take you home even though
You're my mamas worst nightmare

Say what you want, but this boy gives me everything
He'll never hurt me ?
Mamma don't you be scared, your baby girl is grown
And now I've fallen in love

Ohh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'm a take you home even though
You're my mamas worst nightmare
