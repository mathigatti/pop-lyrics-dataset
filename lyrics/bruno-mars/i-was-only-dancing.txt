You know I'd never try to break your heart, no (x5)
It's unfair, I was just standing there
Oh well there's no need for us to fall apart oh (x5)


She grabbed my hand, I'd thought you'd understand Ooh
But in your pretty eyes, I saw your heart dropped
But No !

It's not what it looks like,
I promise you I was only dancing
I was only dancing
Ooh No need to get jealous Girl keep your cool
I was only dancing I was only dancing
