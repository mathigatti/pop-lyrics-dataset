First rule, never let them change you
Rule two, do you to the fullest and never be ashamed to
You're just good at what they can't do
And they hate that, they wanna paint you
If they color, put you on another
But what they don't accept, and what they don't see
The best thing is what you already be


Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they’re not shining
Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly with-out her trying
She’s so beautiful, and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her she won’t believe me
And it’s so, it’s so sad to think that she don’t see what I see
But every time she asks me: Do I look okay?

I say: When I see your face, there is not a thing that I would change
Cause you’re amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause, girl you’re amazing, just the way you are
Hey!

Her lips, her lips I could kiss them all day if she’d let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it’s so sexy
She’s so beautiful, and I tell her everyday
Oh, you know, you know, you know I’d never ask you to change
If perfects what you’re searching for then just stay the same
So don’t even bother asking if you look okay, you know I’ll say

When I see your face, there is not a thing that I would change
Cause you’re amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you’re amazing, just the way you are

Uh yeah, the definition of real is if you don't feel then you don't you feel it
Don't conceal it, don't be afraid
You look great only silicon will bill it
A botox to kill it, you just killin off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don't get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty when you look off in the mirrors

The way you are, the way you are
Girl you’re amazing, just the way you are
When I see your face there’s not a thing I would change
Cause youre amazing just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you’re amazing, just the way you are, yea
