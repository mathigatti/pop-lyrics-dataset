I gotta find my way out of this bill
you got me into,
My baby's sleepin  and the night is dead
It's like in dreamin that walls are closing in on me,
I just wanna know that you're okay


I wanna find out why,
you choose to stay,baby
you got me going crazy...

Ooo... my baby say i'll be oh... no... that she'd let me breathe
outside my words,
ooo......my baby say i'll be oh... no.. that she'd let me breathe
it like a creamy note...

Everyday's the same, your word, life,
when all you come and goes in me,
i keep seeing that,
your all brown hair and your white wedding gown,
baby im missing you...

I wanna find out why, you choose to stay oh..., oh ya...,
ooo... my baby say i'll be oh... no... that she'd let me breathe
outside my words,
ooo... my baby say i'll be oh... no... that she'd let me breathe
it like a creamy note

I can't stop this, all this dating mood, i got to my time...
I ooo... i can't get, i don't wanna get this way, see from his misery

I wanna find out why, you choose to stay, baby...,
you got me going crazy

I promise to love ya, hold ya, even whOoo...
