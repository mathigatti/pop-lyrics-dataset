Free free


I could be wrong but are you telling me that you're leaving (ooh),
And so then you've temporally lost your mind,
And now you're checking your phone and you've noticed
It's not ringing (waoh),
And the one that you wanted to call you pushed out your life,

Now you're telling me it's me that you're needing,
Funny you didn't say that when you where leaving oh,
You just walked out the door,

I gave you all the love that you wanted from me,
Now tell me are you really free,
Tell me are you really free,
Cause you wanted freedom

You said our love was a cell so I gave you the key to break out,
I would have done it before it saved us both some time,
But isn't it ironic don't you think,
You couldn't stay to long without me,
I know your gonna miss miss miss my kiss kiss kiss
So why'd you kiss this this away,

Now you're telling me it's me that you're needing,
Funny you didn't say that when you where leaving oh,
You just walked out the door,

I gave you all the love that you wanted from me,
Now tell me are you really free,
Tell me are you really free,
Cause you wanted freedom

Looks like it's not going your way,
Looks like you got just what you asked for babe,
You know you read what you saw,

Now you're in the land of a broken heart,
Girl I can escape out where you are,
Baby what's wrong,

I gave you all the love that you wanted from me,
Now tell me are you really free,
Tell me are you really free,
Cause you wanted freedom
