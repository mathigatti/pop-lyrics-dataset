All alone in my room
waiting for, for this phone to ring
she'll come home someday soon
i just know or am i imagining things
the voices in my head keep saying
(the voices in my head)
she's coming back to you


Is it strange that i talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
is it weird when i hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
what do i do (what do i do)
there's no more you (there's no more you)
and i tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)
is it strange i believe them again (oh oh oh)
voices in my head
the voices, the voices, the voices
voices in my head
the voices (oh), the voices, the voices

Someone's there at the door
this is her i just know (i just know)
i get dressed, i put on a smile
oh but i it's just the mail again (the mail again)
the playing in my mind (the playing in my mind)
saying she'll come back this time

Is it strange that i talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
is it weird when i hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
what do i do (what do i do)
there's no more you (there's no more you)
and i tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)
is it strange i believe them again (oh oh oh)
voices in my head
it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok
oh just gotta get through the day
it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok
oh i just gotta get through
the voices in my head (the voices in my head)
keep saying she's coming back to you

Is it strange that i talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
is it weird when i hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
what do i do (what do i do)
there's no more you (there's no more you)
and i tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)
is it strange i believe them again (oh oh oh)
voices in my head
oh, oh, oh (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
