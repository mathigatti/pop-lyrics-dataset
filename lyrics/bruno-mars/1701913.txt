I feel like dancing the night away.
Feels like just yesterday we danced for the first time, for the first time, remember our first time, time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta oooh.


Let's let the music keep our bodies awake.
Feels like im touching you right now for the first time, for the first time, remember our first time, time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta oooh.

I think i might explode, this tension is so cold.
And all this fighting between us is really getting old.
We need a magic touch, before it all blows up.
We've both had enough, we've both had enough.
So let's just get away, go to that special place.
Where we first met and on the floor my feet were swept away.
Baby it's worth a try, i beleive in you and i.
Only takes just one night..

Before we both give in..
Don't let it end..
Let's form the love again.

I feel like dancing the night away.
