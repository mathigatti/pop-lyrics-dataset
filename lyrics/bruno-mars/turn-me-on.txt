Good evening ladies, it's ya boy H
I came to introduce my man Bruno


No question girl your love
Has got me feeling up
You know I like it, hey
And when you start to pressing up
And nothings between us
I get excited, hah

Girl let me tell you something
You got my heart jumping
Girl my whole bodies pumping
Can't get enough of you baby
You felt so lonely sweating
We both anticipating
Girl there no use waiting
You got me singing

All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
You make me feel so right, so right, so right, so right
I get lost inside of you

Girl you control me like a switch
Oooh you know you turn me on, you know you turn me on
And I'm so helpless every time
You flick your switch, ooh you know you turn me on
And I can't get in nothing

Don't be alone, but intruiged by your charm
I see you up under my arm
What's my chances here on my odds
Wait my options you turn me on
This cloud that you put me on
No rain you weather my storms
You wear my heart as a charm
Get down were turning it on
Like that, your games, from pleasure, comes a little pain
Don't bite your lips to explain
Climax and I feel you rain
This wet girl, this sex girl
Nothing wrong with a little bit of sweat girl
Next time I see you as a threat girl
Im gonna switch right on to the next girl

All right, all right, all right, all right
I wanna stay, all night, all night, all night, all night
Oh you make me feel so right, so right, so right, so right
I get lost inside of you

Girl you control me like a switch
Oooh you know you turn me on, you know you turn me on
And I'm so helpless every time
You flick your switch, ooh you know you turn me on
And I can't get in nothing

Girl you control me like a switch
Oooh you know you turn me on, you know you turn me on
And I'm so helpless every time
You flick your switch. ooh you know you turn me on
And I can't get in nothing

All right, all right, all right, all right
All night, all night, all night, all night
So right, so right, so right, so right
I get lost inside of you

Don't be alone, but drink by your charm
I see you up under my arm
What's my chances here on my odds
Wait my options you turn me on
This cloud that you put me on
No rain you weather my storms
You wear my heart as a charm
Get down were turning it on
