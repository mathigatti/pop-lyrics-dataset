[Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the queen


Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire

[Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of everyday Christmas
Give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like: Here, lady, have this
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the Ho Ho
Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

[Bruno Mars &amp; (Travie McCoy)]
Oh, every time I close my eyes
(What you see? What you see, bro?)
I see my name in shining lights
(Aha, aha, and what else?)
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare (for what?)
For when I'm a billionaire
Ooh, ooh, oh, ooh
For when I'm a billionaire
Ooh, ooh, oh, ooh

[Travie McCoy]
I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twenties, tens and bens completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever is left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet and put it in the air and sing

[Bruno Mars &amp; (Travie McCoy)]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (so bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (buy every day, haha)
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (What up, Oprah? Ah ha!)

Oh every time I close my eyes
(What you see? What you see, bro?)
I see my name in shining lights
(Aha, aha, and what else?)
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Ooh, ooh, oh, ooh
For when I'm a billionaire
Ooh, ooh, oh, ooh

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
