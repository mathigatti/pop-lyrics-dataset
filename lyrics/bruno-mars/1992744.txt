When you wanna do something that's new
And it seems really, really hard to do
You feel like quitting, feel ya through
Well I have some advice for you


Don't give up
Keep on tryin'
You're gonna make it
I ain't lyin'
Don't give up, don't ever quit
Try and try and you can do it
Don't give up, yeah

If you want to catch a ball
But you're havin' no luck at all
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose
It hits your belly, your chin and toes
Well, try and try and try again
Keep on trying to the end
You put your hands out in the air
You'll catch the ball
Yes this I swear

Don't give up
Keep on going
You're on a boat
So keep on rowing
Don't give up, don't ever stop
Try and try and you'll come out on top
Don't give up

You got yourself rollerskates
You put them on and you feel great
You stand up, then you fall
Don't think you can skate at all
You get back up, then you trip
You skip and tip and slip, and flip
You try and try and try some more
Soon you're skating across the floor

Don't give up, keep on moving
You're gonna get there, just keep on grooving
Don't give up, don't pack it in
Try and try, and you'll win
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up, no no
Don't give up!
