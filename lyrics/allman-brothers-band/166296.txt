Can't take it with you.
Everybody knows.
Can't take it with you when you go.
Can't hide your love away.
Save it up for a rainy day.
Ya can't take it with you when you go.
And it hurts so bad when you finally have to show.
Chorus: 
Can't take it with you.
Everybody knows.
Can't take it with you when you go.
Can't hide your love away.
Save it up for a rainy day.
You can't take it with you when you go.
No, you can't take it with you when you go. Ooo.
No, you can't take it with you when you go, oh, no.
Play it high or low.
Break the bank in Monte Carlo.
You can play it just the way it falls.
Cut it like you want to.
But it just might come back and haunt you.
Lady Luck's your mama when she calls.
Chorus
Hot-wire a fast car
Just to take a ride.
You can run, but you sure cannot hide.
Oh, tell her a lie
And live with it 'til you die, but you
Can't take it with you when you go.
Chorus
