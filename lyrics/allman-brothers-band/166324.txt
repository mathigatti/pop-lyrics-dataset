Mama stood cryin' at the back door
Papa's lacin' on his leavin' shoes
Little Joe's blowin' on the horn outdoors
I've seen enough, I can't take no more
And I'm leavin'


Might go to Philadelphia, PA
Might wind up in Boston, I just can't say
Got my axe in one hand
Got my Greyhound ticket in the other hand
And I'm leavin'

I tell you I'm leavin'
Gonna play my blues
Yes I'm leavin'
Got nothing to lose
Well, I'm dying to get the hell out of here
Right Away

Mama stood cryin' at the back door
Papa's lacin' on his leavin' shoes
Little Joe's blowin' on the horn outdoors
I've seen enough, I can't take no more
And I'm leavin'

I said I'm leavin'
Gonna play my guitar
I'm leavin'
Don't care if I'm a big star
I'm leavin' this old ghetto
Right away, right away
