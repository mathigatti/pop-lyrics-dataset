Famous last words, I'll be right back in a little while,
I'll be home early, famous last words.
Here comes the dawn, got to be headin' home in a little while,
She'll be up singing along with the birds,
Still believing famous last words.
Chorus:
After all is said and done, 
You know that I would never do you no wrong,
I never lied, never even tried,
Even in famous last words.
She sits there waiting, anticipating his return,
There all alone, if only the phone would ring,
Telling her only one thing, famous last words.
Chorus
