Don't care how long you go,
I don't care how long you stay,
it's good kind treatment,
bring you home someday.
Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble,
poor me, anymore.
Now you keep on bettin',
that the dice won't pass.
Well I know, and I know,
whoa, oh you're livin' too fast.
Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble,
poor me, anymore.
Yeah, I'll tell everybody,
in my neighborhood.
You're a kind little woman,
but you don't do me no good.
But someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble,
poor me, anymore.
I know you're leaving,
if you call that's gone.
Oh without my lovin' yeah,
oh, you can't stay long.
Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble,
poor me, anymore.
Well good bye baby,
yeah well take my hand.
I don't want no woman no,
who can't have no man.
But someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble,
poor me, anymore. Trouble no more.
Oh yeah... yeah babe.
