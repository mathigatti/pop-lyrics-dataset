Just one more morning
I had to wake up with the blues
Pulled myself outta bed, yeah
Put on my walkin shoes,
Went up on the mountain,
To see what I could see,
The whole world was fallin,
Right down in front of me.


[chorus]
'cause I'm hung up on dreams I'll never see, yeah baby.
Ahh help me baby, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah.

Pull myself together, put on a new face,
Climb down off the hilltop, baby,
Get back in the race.

[chorus]

Pull myself together, put on a new face,
Climb down off the hilltop, baby,
Get back in the race.
