Owww.
I ain't seen my wife for two or three years,
I'm a happily married man.
A-since she left I been running wild,
Jumpin all the woman I can.
Gave me some trouble for a little while,
But, now I'm back to my old style.
I ain't seen my wife for two or three years,
I'm a happily married man.
Ah, yes I am.


And furthermore,
Ain't got no home, no children, no pets,
I'm a happily married man.
When I get tired, I just lay down,
I sleep wherever I am.
Now there's three lilly pedals growin from my sink,
And I don't have to worry bout em takin a drink.
I ain't seen my wife for two or three years,
I'm a happily married man.

Now my new old lady is out of sight,
I'm a happily married man.
She's lovin me everyday and a every night,
Just as much as she can.
Now, I don't have to worry bout sleepin pills,
And knives and guns or doctor bills.
Now, I ain't seen my wife for two or three years,
I'm a happily married man.
Happily married man.
Parting with you was such a sweet, sorrow.
Whoooo.
Owww.
