You're coming back into my life
After all this time apart
After my heart has been broken in two
Now you wanna turn around and go back through
All the hurt, all the pain
I'm not sure it could ever be the same


'Cause two rights can't make up for one wrong
I've spend so many nights alone
One kiss can't make it disappear
Even though you're here tonight
Baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone

I guess you think it's all a game
Someone gets hurt, someone gets blamed
You don't seem to realize
There's someone else
In my eyes

'Cause two rights can't make up for one wrong
I've spend so many nights alone
One kiss can't make it disappear
Even though you're here tonight
Baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone

You're the one who wanted to play the field
Now you can't find a love that's real
It's your game, but it's no fun
When you end up the lonely one

'Cause two rights can't make up for one wrong
I've spend so many nights alone
One kiss can't make it disappear
Even though you're here tonight
Baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone
