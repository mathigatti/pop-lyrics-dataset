I'm lying here for hours,
can't get my eyes to close.
Can't get one moments peace,
to save my dog-gone soul.
I've been doin' more than drinkin'
tryin' to ease my pain.
Everywhere I go,
somebody speaks your name.
Oh my friends keep on askin'
boy whats a wrong with you,
I say I'm worried,
worried down with the blues.


Try to be a good man,
work my fingers to the bone.
Oh and you return the favor,
by reckin' oh a happy home.
Why'd you play so many dirty tricks
I lost my faith in you,
and now you want me to take you back.
Whats a poor man supposed to do?

[chorus]
I am worried down with the blues,
Oh yes I am,
I am worried down with the blues oh yea
I feel like I was born to lose.
I used to walk with pride and my head held high
and now I'm starin' down at my shoes.
Yes I am worried,
worried down with the blues.

You made me turn my back,
on my very best friend.
and when my back was turned,
you were messin' around with him.
Still I'd give up everything,
just to have you by my side.
In the cold cold nights when I reach for you.
I'm holdin' to my foolish pride.

[chorus]
I am worried down with the blues,
Oh yes I am,
I am worried down with the blues oh yea
I feel like I was born to lose.
I used to walk with pride and my head held high
and now I'm starrin' down at my shoes.
Yes I am worried,
worried down with the blues.
