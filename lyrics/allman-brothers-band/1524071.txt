Well I've been around
For a pretty good while
I've been on the move
Since I was just a little baby child
Been with Ive been with out
Never been no doubt
When that good time feelin comes around


Well I've got my temper, just like you
A little fussin and fightin, well they aint nothing new
But for a little while tonight everything gonna be all right
When that good time feelin come around

Well I can't get enough of that wonderful stuff
Never felt so fine, hey now drivin me out of my mind
Somebody said it cant be done
were gonna mess around and have a little fun
When that good time feelin comes around

[Break]

Well I can't get enough of that wonderful stuff
Never felt so fine, hey now drivin me out of my mind
Someone said it cant be done
were gonna mess around and have a little fun
When that good time feelin come around
When that good time feelin come around
When that good time feelin come around
