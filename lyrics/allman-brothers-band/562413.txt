Moonlight shining through my window
Cold wind blowing at my door
While I lay here thinking
Down on this killing floor


Blues falling down around me
Coming just like rain
Oh, it makes me wonder
How I can stand so much pain

I'm not crying, I'm not crying
Even though it hurts me so
More than you'll ever know
I'm not crying

Long distance relation
That's so close to me
Who I think of so often
But rarely get to see

Never thought I'd fall 'till I fell down
Reaching up from the ground
Looking for a helping hand
That was nowhere to be found

I'm not crying, I'm not crying
Even though it hurts me so
More than you'll ever know
I'm not crying

I'm not crying, I'm not crying
Even though it hurts me so
More than you'll ever know
I'm not crying
Even though it hurts me so
More than you'll ever know
I'm not crying
It hurts me down in my soul
More than you'll ever know
But I'm not crying
