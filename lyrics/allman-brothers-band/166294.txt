Ain't nobody, gonna do my baby wrong.
Ain't nobody, gonna do my baby wrong.
Lord, I still love that woman
Even though I know she's gone, long gone.
Lord, I know she's out walkin',
Walkin' up and down the street.
Well I know my baby's out walkin'
Walkin' up and down the street.
Lord she's got a brand new story
For each and every man she meets.
Blind love, blind love,
It oughta be a crime,
For lovin' you the way I do.
My best friend knows all about it,
He don't have a thing to say.
Lord he knows all about it,
He just don't have a thing to say.
Oh, it hurts me so bad, to see you treat me this way.
Well I see my baby walkin',
Now I don't even raise my hand.
When I see my baby walkin', 
I don't even raise my hand,
Oh it hurts me in my heart,
To see you with another man.
Blind love, blind love,
It oughta be a crime,
For lovin' you the way I do.
Blind love, blind love,
It oughta be a crime,
For lovin' you the way I do.
Blind love, blind love,
It oughta be a crime,
For lovin' you the way I do.
