Seven turns on the highway,
Seven rivers to cross.
Sometimes, you feel like you could fly away,
Sometimes, you get lost.


And sometimes, in the darkened night,
You see the crossroad sign.
One way is the mornin light,
You got to make up your mind.

Somebody's callin your name.
Somebody's waiting for you.
Love is all that remains the same,
That's what it's all comin to.
Hey, yeah.

Runnin wild out on the road,
Just like a leaf on the wind.
How in the world could you ever know,
We'd ever meet again?

Seven turns on the highway,
Seven rivers to cross.
Sometimes, you feel like you could fly away,
Sometimes, you get lost.

Somebody's callin your name.
Somebody's waitin for you.
Love is all that remains the same,
That's what it's all comin to.

Somebody's callin your name.
Somebody's waitin for you.
Love is all that remains the same,
That's what it's all comin to.

Somebody's callin your name.
Somebody's waitin for you.
Somebody's callin your name.
That's what it's all coming to.
