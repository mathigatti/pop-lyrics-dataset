In the midst of all my darkness, baby
You came along to guide me
You took pity on a this lonely man
When you said you'd stand beside me
I'll never forget you for what you've done
I'll never turn my back on you for anyone
Cause i got so much love to give you
Baby, i got so such love to give you
There's more than enough
To last a whole life through
And it's all for you
My world was cold and empty
And my life so unfulfilling
When i needed someone to pick me up
Oh, you were so willing
Now to you it might seem a such little thing
But to me baby it seemed you'd changed my winter to spring
I've got so much love to give you
Baby, i got so such love to give you
There's more than enough
To last my whole life through
It's all for you
There's so few woman nowadays
Who understand the soul of a man
They're always on the take and they're
Never giving, never offering a helping hand
But baby, i can count on you
Whenever trouble calls
You see me through
You give me love in so many ways
Now i'm gonna love you for the rest of my days
Cause i got so much love to give you
Baby, i got so such love to give you
I got so such love to give you
I wanna give
I wanna give
I wanna give
I wanna give
I wanna give
I wanna give you, all of my love
All of my love
