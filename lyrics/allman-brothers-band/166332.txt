Got the blues like midnight.
Honey won't be long 'fore day.
Got the blues like midnight.
Honey won't be long 'fore day.
Wish that tornado would blow my blues away.
Lord, I can tell my bulldog
when I hear him bark
Lord, I can tell my baby
when I hear her in the dark.
Got the blues like midnight.
Honey won't be long 'fore day.
Got the blues like midnight.
Honey won't be long 'fore day.
Lord I wish a tornado would blow my blues away.
