I been run down, I been lied to
I don't know why I let that mean woman make me a fool
She took all my money, wrecked my new car
Now she's with one of my goodtime buddies
They're drinkin' in some crosstown bar


Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel
Like I been tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'

My friends tell me, that I've been such a fool
And I have to stand by and take it baby, all for lovin' you
Drown myself in sorrow, and I look at what you've done
But nothin' seems to change, the bad times stay the same
And I can't run

Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel
Like I been tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'

Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel
Like I been tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'
