When I look for the love in your eyes,
You turn away
And there's nothing as loud as the words
We never say
Look at us now, standing on the edge again
Look at us now, it's not too late to try again
I need some...


Evedence of love, to keep me going on
Please show me some
Evidence of love, and I'll be here
I still believe we can see it through,
There's just so much, that I can do
It dosen't make sense, without some evidence of love

There's a cold, cold look on your face,
Is it saying good-bye? 
'cause there's nothing as cold as the ashes,
When the fire has died
Talk to me now, tell me what you're missing
Talk to me now, I'll try and find your heart again
I need some...

Evedence of love, to keep me going on
Please show me some
Evidence of love, and I'll be here
I still believe we can see it through,
There's just so much, that I can do
It dosen't make sense, without some evidence of love

Stand and fight
Try to say what's on your mind, baby
So much is on the line
There's a chance we'll makit right

Look at us now, standing on the edge again
Look at us now, it's not too late to try again
I need some...

Evedence of love, to keep me going on
Please show me some
Evidence of love, and I'll be here
