I'v had my fun if I don't ever get well no more
I'v had my fun if I don't ever get well no more
I know my help is failing me now 
I know I'm goin' down slow


Won't somebody wright my mother and tell her the shape I'm in
I want somebody to wright my mother and tell her the shape I'm in
I want you tell her to pray for me 
Ask her to fortgive me for all my sinns

Mother please don't send me no doctor 
a doctor can't do me no good
I don't want you to send me no doctor now.. 
a doctor just can't do me no good
Back when I was a young boy oh.. 
I just didn't do the thing I should

Mmmm Mmmmmm
Mmmm Mmmmmm
