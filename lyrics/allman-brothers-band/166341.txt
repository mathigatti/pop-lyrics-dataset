Verse 1:
Shapes
Of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise


Verse 2:

Here
Within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will they seem the same

Chorus:
Come tomorrow
Will I be older
Come tomorrow
May be a soldier 
Come tomorrow
Will I be bolder
Than today?

Verse 3:

Now
The trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
Where time and tide have been

Verse 4:

Fallen
Into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

[repeat chorus]

Guitar solo:


Verse 5:

Soon
I hope that I will find
Loves deep within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind
