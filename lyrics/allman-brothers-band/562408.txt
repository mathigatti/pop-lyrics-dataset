I've heard it said before,
That you don't care no more,
You just pick up tracks,
And don't look back,
And walk right out that door.


I tell my friends it's easy,
She's never on my mind.....
My life is so much better 
Since that day I said good-bye

And I' tell myself I'm free 
But I'm only foolin' me
Cause no matter what I do...
I can't get over you

Well I tried to hide my pain, 
With a taste of fast lane,
But ain't no use... to shake you loose...
I still feel the same 
I thought I could forget you 
But that was just a lie,
I'm just not the same without you...
I don't even want to try....

And I' tell myself I'm free 
But I'm only foolin' me
Cause no matter what I do...
I can't get over you
I can't get over you

SOLO:

BRIDGE:
I don't know how it started
I don't know where I stand
I just want to be back in your arms once again

And I' tell myself I'm free 
But I'm only foolin' me
Cause no matter what I do...
I can't get over you
I can't get over you
I can't get over you
