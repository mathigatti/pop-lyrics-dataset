Transcribed by Sam Carle

Sit alone, waiting on the morning,
Woman leaving her whole life behind,
train rolling on, taking mama's baby home,
Noone knows what's going through her mind,


Just another love song I'm singing,
And you know people sing them all of the time,
Just another lonesome guitar ringing,
The only difference is this one is mine,

Freedom, Lord what a funny word,
We search for it just like some kind of fool,
Woman leaving home, man sit's there all alone,
Little child is paying all the dues

(Chorus)
