Had a sweet little girl,
Run out and took the baby boy, people aint that sad.
Oh, had a sweet little girl,
Left me, run out and took the baby boy, oh aint that sad.


Chorus:
Cant spend what you aint got,
Cant lose what you never had.
Cant spend what you aint got,
Cant lose what you never had.
Had some money in the bank,
Got busted, people aint that so sad.
Oh, I had some money in the bank,
Got busted, people, people aint that sad.

[Chorus]

Had a sweet little home,
Got drunk, burned it down, people aint that sad.
Oh, had a sweet little home,
Got drunk, burned it down, people aint that sad.

[Chorus]
