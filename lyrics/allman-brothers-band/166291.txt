Don't come around here no more, 
bringing me all of your bad rain. 
Can't you see I've got troubles of my own. 
I ain't got time to be messing with all of your bad rain, 
why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone? 
There was a time we had a good thing going on, 
you and I both know the reason why it all went wrong. 
Tried to stick by you, help you see it through, 
but you used me all up, now you're on your own. 
So, don't come around here no more, 
bringing me all of your bad rain. 
Can't you see I've got troubles of my own. 
I ain't got time to be messing with all of your bad rain, 
why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone? 
Well I tried and tried again, to be good to you, 
but you won't a hear a word and I don't know what it's coming to. 
Comes a time when you just have to turn and, walk away, 
there's nothing left to do, nothing left to say. 
So, don't come around here no more, 
bringing me all of your bad rain. 
Can't you see I've got troubles of my own. 
I ain't got time to be messing with all of your bad rain, 
why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone? 
I ain't someone to be preaching to nobody else, 
ain't going to try and pretend to be living that clean myself. 
Can't stand by and watch you throw your life away, 
But there's nothing left to do, nothing left to say. 
So, don't come around here no more, 
bringing me all of your bad rain. 
Can't you see I've got troubles of my own. 
I ain't got time to be messing with all of your bad rain, 
why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone? 
Why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone?
