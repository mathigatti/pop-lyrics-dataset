You know I hate to leave you babe
But I just can't waste my time....
Well you've got this jealous husband
And I'm far too young to die,
I must move on away from here
Just before the bullets fly



I've always been a gabler
Takin' chances all my life....
Always smashin' those love affairs
Just like shootin' dice,
I staged the game girl
That's what keeps me satisfied
And I can leave it in the nick of time
Just before the bullets fly


Solo


I lost my first bet 
When I was twenty-one
Found myself in New Orleans
On the wrong end of a gun....
The stakes keep getting higher......
But somehow i Survive,
By knowin' when the need became
Just before the bullets fly
I'm knowing when the need became
Just before the bullets fly
I'm knowing when the need became
Just before the bullets fly
