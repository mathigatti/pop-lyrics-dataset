Just an everyday evenin'
A few nights ago...
I saw this beautiful lady, 
That I scarcely know,
I don't know where she'd come from
I don't know where she's been...
But something in her big green eyes said to me..


Baby won't you come on in 
As the sun was rising
I couldn't let myself go...
But something she showed me
Put a hold on me so
I ain't had this feeling,

Since I don't know when
Falling in love was the last thing on my mind
...but it started all over again...
And I know, what happened to me long ime ago...
But I know, this feeling just thrills me so...


It's like the first time walking in the moonlight
The first time you ever touched a rose,
The first time in a long time, everything was alright
What happens now, nobody knows.. anythings goea!


The sun was rising
I couln't make myself go...
Something she showed me
Put a hold on me so
Well I ain't had this feeling

Since I don't know when
It's like the first time walking in the moonlight
The first time you ever thouched a rose
The first time in a long time, everything is alright
What happens now, nobody knows...

Anything goes

Anything goes
