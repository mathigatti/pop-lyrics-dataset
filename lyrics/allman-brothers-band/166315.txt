Free when I dance whit you
We move like the sea 
You you're all I want to know 
I Feel Free
I Feel Free
I Feel Free


I can walk down the street there's no one there
though the pavements are on hure crowd 
I can drive down the road my eyes don't see
tough my mind wants to cry out loud
Ah ah ah ah

solo
I Feel Free
I Feel Free
I Feel Free
I Feel Free


I can walk down the street there's no one there

though the pavements are on hure crowd 

I can drive down the road my eyes don't see

tough my mind wants to cry out loud

mind wants to cry out loud


Dance floor is like the sea

Ceiling is the sky

You're the sun and as you shine on me

I Feel Free

I Feel Free

I Feel Free

Oh uh uh oh
