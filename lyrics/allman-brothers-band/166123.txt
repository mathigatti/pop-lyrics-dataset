Last Sunday morning, the sunshine felt like rain
The week before, they all seemed the same
With the help of God and true friends, I've come to realize
I still have two strong legs, and even wings to fly


So I, ain't a-wastin time no more
Cause time goes by like hurricanes, and faster things

Well, Lord, Lord, Miss Sally, why all your cryin?
Been around here three long days, lookin like we're dyin
Go step yourself outside, and look up at the stars above
And go on downtown, baby, find somebody to love

Meanwhile, I ain't a-wastin time no more
Cause time goes by like pouring rain, and much faster things

You don't need no gypsy to tell you why
Ya can't let one precious day to slip by
Well, look inside yourself, and if you don't see what you want
Maybe sometimes then ya don't
But, leave your mind alone and just get high

Well, by and by, way after many years have gone
And all the war freaks die off, leavin us alone
We'll raise our children, in the peaceful way we can
It's up to you and me brother
To try and try again

So, hear us now, we ain't wastin time no more
Cause time rolls by like hurricanes
Runnin after the subway train
Don't forget the pourin rain
