Well I don't know, if I dreamed it.
I don't know, might be real.
Lord, it's so strange, how one will find another,
But I keep on searchin', cause I know you're out there,
And all I gotta do is open my eyes and see her - the mystery woman. 
Cause I'm confused, but only sometimes.
Patiently waiting, baby just for you.
But I'll be leavin', babe, I won't go under.
All I gotta do is open my eyes and see her - a mystery woman.


If I have to chase her, all around the country.
Well I'm bound to find her somewhere, and that's no lie.
Ain't it strange, how one will find another,
But I'll keep on searchin', cause I know you're out there,
All I gotta do is open my eyes and see her - a mystery woman.
All I gotta do, is open my eyes and see you - my mystery woman.
Hey, yeah - my mystery woman.
