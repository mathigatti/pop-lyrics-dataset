Pocket full of money
Got a big smile all on my face
Boy and I can charm the diamonds 
right off the back of a rattlesnake


But you've got me so confused
Cut me cold as ice 
I ain't used to losing 
Guess I'm playing with loaded dice

Well the first time that I saw you
Said you'd just dumped your old man
Then the next time you was dealin
Must have dealt me a losing hand
Woman I tried to win your love
Just can't pay the price 
Keep throwing in sevens
I keep on playing with loaded dice

Well I thought I was a hustler
But you sent me back to school
Keep playing some new game
Making up your own rules
Must be some kind of crazy
let you fool me twice
I don't know why
I keep playing with loaded dice 

Well, tonight I hit the jackpot
I was shining like a diamond ring
Lady luck was smiling
And the old snake charmer was doing his thing

You saw the tables turn 
man it sure felt nice
Now we see who's laughing
Now we see who's playing with the loaded dice 

Girl you ain't like nothing 
I've ever seen before
Keep throwing in aces
I keep coming back for more
Guess I should have listened
But you can't give a fool advice
Don't know why I keep playing with loaded dice.
