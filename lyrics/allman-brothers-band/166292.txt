* Sweet Little Angel
I got a sweet little angel, I love the way she spreads her wings,
I got a sweet little angel, I love the way she spreads her wings, now,
She spread her wings around, I get joy in everything.


Asked my baby for a nickel, she gave me a twenty dollar bill, now,
I asked my baby for a nickel, she gave me a twenty dollar bill, now,
Asked my baby for a drink of liquor, she gave me a whiskey still, ah.

* It's My Own Fault
It's my own fault baby, treat me the way you wanna do now,
It's my own fault baby, treat me the way you wanna do now,
Cause when you were lovin me little woman,

* How Blue Can You Get?
I been down-hearted baby, ever since the day that we met,
I been down-hearted baby, ever since the day that we met,
Our love is nothin but the blues, Lord, how blue can you get?

Alright,
I bought you a new Ford, you said I want a Cadillac.
Bought you a ten dollar dinner, you said thanks for the snack.
Let you live in my penthouse, Lord, you called it a shack.
Gave you seven children and now you wanna give em back.

Oh, I been down-hearted baby, ever since the day that we met darlin now,
Now our love is nothin but the blues.
Oh, how blue can you get?
