Our lives are hanging in a balance
Or they're dangling by a thread
A spark of life brought down from an angel
To raise the stranger from the dead
Once more were cheating on the
With all the gypsy in our souls
Cause I know theres a God up in heaven
Who must love rock and roll


Once again we sail home to sarasota
With the ocean awash the gunwale
But she still keeps her head above water
Guess were all gonna live to tell this tale

Here's to the boys in the band forever hangin on
Without you theres no reason to go
I'd be lying face down in some river
Waiting on an angel to take me back home

Once again we sail home to sarasota
With the ocean awash the gunwale
But she still keeps her head above water
Guess were all gonna live to tell this tale

Solo:

Once again we sail home to sarasota
With the ocean awash the gunwale
But she still keeps her head above water
Guess were all gonna live to tell this tale
