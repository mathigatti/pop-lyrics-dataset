Ones I was on my one and falling
Ones I was all alone and calling
For some one anyone to day
To help me just a little on my way
And then I took a look around
I saw all that love that surronded me
I know that it was all up to me and 
Cast Off All My Fears that bound me
Cast Off All My Fears that bound me


You find you can't go on deppending
Allways to help your in deep ending
Your reason for beeing whom you are
And asking for that lightest brightest star
I tought that all I had to do
Was beleaving the things that was true to me
And let it happen naturlie
And Cast Off All My Fears that bound me
Cast Off All My Fears that bound me

solo

I tought that all I had to do
Was beleaving the things that was true to me
And let it happen naturlie
And Cast Off All My Fears that bound me
Cast Off All My Fears that bound me
Cast Off All My Fears that bound me
