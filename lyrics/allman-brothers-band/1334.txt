Walk along the river, sweet lullaby, it just keeps on flowing
It don't worry 'bout where it's going, no, no
Don't fly, mister blue bird, I'm just walking down the road
Early morning sunshine tell me all I need to know


You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day.
Lord, you know it makes me high when you turn your love my way
Turn your love my way, yeah

Good old sunday morning, bells are ringing everywhere
Goin to Carolina, it won't be long and I'll be there
