I have not come, yeah, to testify
about our bad, bad misfortune and I ain't here a wond'rin' why.
But I'll live on and I'll be strong
'cause it just ain't my cross to bear.


I sat down and wrote you a long letter, it was just the other day.
Said, sure as the sunrise, baby, tomorrow I'll be up and on my way.
But I'll live on and I'll be strong
'cause it just ain't my cross to bear.

But in the end, baby, long towards the end of your road,
don't reach out for me, babe, 'cause I'm not gonna carry your load.
But I'll live on and I'll be strong
'cause it just ain't my cross to bear
