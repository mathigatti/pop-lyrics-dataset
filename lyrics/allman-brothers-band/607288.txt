There was a time that I belived in you and everything you
Told me I took for true
But that was then and this is now and things kepp changing


We are running when love is calling
It's just the fear, the fear of falling

We count our blessings as we count our friends
We count on love and it always ends
Much too soon as the world keeps on turnin

We are running when love is calling
It's just the fear, the fear of falling

But I'll keep trying for that chance to have it all
Might even get lucky and find someone to prove me wrong
And break on through all these foolish fears of mine darlin

We are running when love is calling
It's just the fear, the fear of falling
There just aint no such thing as falling
