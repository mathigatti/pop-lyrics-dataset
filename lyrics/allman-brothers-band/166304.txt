The barrel-house told me, my baby caught that train 'n gone
The barrel-house told me, my baby caught that train 'n gone
It was all my fault, I musta' did somebody wrong.
Everything that happens, you know I am to blame.
Everything that happens, you know I am to blame.
I'm gonna find myself a doctor, perhaps my luck will change.
Ah, my mamma she told me, these days will surely come.
I wouldn't listen to her, had to have my fun.
The barrel-house told me, my baby caught that train 'n gone.
But it's all my fault, I musta' done somebody wrong, oh yeah.
The barrel-house told me, my baby caught that train 'n gone
The barrel-house told me, my baby caught that train 'n gone
It was all my fault, I musta' did somebody wrong. Oh play the blues...
