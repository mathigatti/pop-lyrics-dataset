The dealer sits alone in the dark
Cigarette shines on his very last card
Everything he had... watched it come and go
On a gambler's roll


Cold wind blows a young girl's world apart
She bet it all she bet it all on the jack of hearts
Gained her freedom but lost her soul
On a gambler's roll On a gambler's roll

You know the gambler he rides... rides on a fools train 
Ah tradin' silver for gold
Oh but his luck will change... time takes it's toll
On a gambler's roll

The dealer knows... it's just about his last game
Not even she knows all the sorrow and pain
As the forty-five deals the fatal blow
On a gamblers roll...on a gamblers roll

You know the gambler he rides... rides on a fools train
Tradin' silver for gold
Ah but his luck will change... time takes it's toll
On a gambler's roll... on a gambler's roll
On a gambler's roll... on a gamblers roll
On a gamblers... gambler's roll
