A man lay dieing in the streets
A thousend people fell down on their knees
Any other day he would have been.....
Preaching
Reaching all the people there 
Oh Lord Lord


But Lord knows I can't change what I saw
I Say God Rest His Soul

The Memphis battelground was red
Cause blood came pouring from his head 
Women and children fallin' down.....
Crying
For the man they loved so well
Oh Lord Lord
But Lord knows I can't change what I saw
I Say God Rest His Soul

(I breake here)
Solo

But Lord knows I can't change what I saw
I Say God Rest His Soul

The morning sun will rise again
With all the passions growing thin 
What we gonna do when war is come.. and we'r 
dieing
Dieing for the cause I know

(yeah but)
But Lord knows I can't change what I saw
Say God Rest His Soul
