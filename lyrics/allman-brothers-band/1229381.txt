My guardian angel wears a hard hat,
silly boy with a microphone,
or I wouldn't be standin' here today.
Ever since I was a young boy,
I couldn't leave nothin alone.
Then trouble was standin' in my way.
Oh, now, anyway,
well we're in the middle.
On the wagon, under the wheel again.
All or nuthin,I never could do this a little, never could leave it alone.


In living, it could be the death of me,
it's gonna lead me to an early grave.
To die in the saddle must be my destiny, but to ride this rockin' horse,
it must've bit the reigns.
Good clean fun, it's just my imagination.
Down and dirty, I win the game.
It's a hard life, it's caused me some aggravation, but I never could leave it alone.
Oh now, baby, you've gotta ride that rockin' horse!

Talkin' about my guardian angel, she wears her hard hat, else I wouldn't be standin' here today.
Ever since I was a little young boy,
there's been trouble, standin' in my way.
Up, down, anywhere,
well, we're in the middle.
On the wagon, under the wheel again.
All or nuthin', I never could do this a little, but I never could leave it alone.
Oh, you gotta ride that rockin' horse!
