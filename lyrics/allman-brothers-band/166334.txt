Time and time again I've felt these wall's of plaster,
closing in,
And more than once I've felt that lonely lonely feeling,
Wondering why and where I've been,
Just about the time, I think I can't hold on,
You're always there to keep me hanging on and I say,


I never knew how much a man needed a woman
(No I never)
I never knew how much a boy needed a girl
(Needed a girl)
I never knew how much I needed you

Day after day I join the rat race,
Tryin' to make the most of it,
I keep on falling down down the ladder,
Still trying to stay on top of it,
Just when I was sure,
Nothing could get no better,
Oh I realize,
I still love you more than ever,

(Chorus)

Today I watch the sun set on the freeway,
strangled on the poison air,
But miles beyond, on the other end,
I know, you'll always be waiting there,
Girl you treat me,
with your kindest hand,
and in my heart, in my mind,
and I'm so glad

(Chorus)
