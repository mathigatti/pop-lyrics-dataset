What would I give, just for a few moments
What would I give , just to have you near
Tell me you will try, to slip away somehow
Oh, I need you darlin, I want to see you right now


Can you slip away, slip away, slipaway hey hey hey
Oh, I need you so

Now I know it's wrong, the things I ask you to do
But please belive me darlin, I don't mean to hurt you
But could you just slip away, without him knowin you're gone
Then we could meet somewhere, somewhere where were both not known

Can you slip away, slip away, slipaway hey hey hey
Oh, I need you so

Bridge:
Love, oh love, how sweet it is
The way you make me feel sometime
....darling, how sweet it is.
