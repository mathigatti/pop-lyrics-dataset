I couldn't stay around and finish high school, 
I had to hit the streets as soon as I could. 
Now I'm runnin', always runnin', 
as I turned out the way they said I would. 
Daddy told me all about chasing women, 
watched my momma lose her mind and all her hope. 
Now the only thing that's left of my pathetic life, 
is dangling at the end of a rope. 
What's done is done, 
had me way too much fun, 
now I'm runnin' from a man with a gun, 
looking back over my shoulder, but I won't get much older
What's done is done, 
Lord, what's done is done. 
Started hanging with the wrong kind of people, 
fooling with the wrong kind of folks. 
Made my living doing things, got me locked up in chains, 
as I went the way they said I'd go. 
Ahhh, what's done is done, 
had me way too much fun, 
now I'm runnin' from a man with a gun, 
looking back over my shoulder, but I won't get much older 
What's done is done, 
had me way to much fun, 
ohhh, runnin' from a man with a gun, 
looking back over my shoulder, but I won't get much older 
What's done is done, 
oh what's done is done 
hey, ya, done is done, 
ohh what's done is done
