Well I love you baby, but you won't give me the time of day
Well I love you baby, but you won't give me the time of day


Treat me so bad, but I love you anyway
Early in the morning sun begins to rise
Early in the morning sun begins to rise
Call out your name, wring my hands and cry

Got me runnin', don't know what to do
There won't be much of me when you get through
Down on the bottom, nothing left to lose
Lord I got 'em, mean woman blues

Well, I love you baby, but you don't even know my name
Well, I love you baby, but you don't even know my name

Don't care about me but love you just the same
Now, someday baby, take you by the hand
Yeah, someday baby, take you by the hand
You be my lovin' child and I'll be your lovin' man

Yeah, you got me runnin', don't know what to do
there won't be much of me when you get through
Down on the bottom, nothing left to lose
Lord I got 'em, mean woman blues

Got me runnin', don't know what to do
there won't be much of me when you get through
Down on the bottom, nothing left to lose
Lord I got 'em, mean woman blues
