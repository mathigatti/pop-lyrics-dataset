Oh, tell me bout the car I saw,
Parked outside your door,
Tell me what you left me waiting,
Two or three hours for.
Tell me why when the phone rings baby,
Youre up and across the floor,
Please dont keep me wonderin no longer.
I think about the bad times,
Lord I think about yours and mine,
You were lost in the silver spoon,
Thought I pulled you out in time.
And I hope that you got reasons,
For the way that youve been lyin,
Please dont keep me wonderin no longer.
I think Im gonna go now,
But you know that Ill be back.
Now you can think it over baby,
Tell me how youre gonna act.
Im gonna keep on holding on,
But I dont get no stronger,
Please dont keep me wonderin no longer.
