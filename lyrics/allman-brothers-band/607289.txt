Sometimes it seems like yesterday
Other times more than a million years
Oh little girl sweeter than an angel
When I think of her I laugh,
And drown in my own tears


You draw your first breath so close to me
Now weve been apart for years and years

She can wash the land away, tides turning everyday,
All I really came to say is
I still love you my sweet island

Maybe times will someday build a bridge for us
Somewhere father down the line; I know
But for you this;
To show you whos on my mind

She can wash the land away, tides turning everyday,
All I really came to say is
I still love you my sweet island

Whatever they may say about my silence
Remember I'm an island too
Were connected by more than an ocean
My blood runs in you

She can wash the land away, tides turning everyday,
All I really came to say is
I still love you my sweet island
