There is a long hard Road follows for behind me,
Its so cold I'm about to die,
Chasing a dream around the world
Its got me feeling down
Though it use to make me high


Looking for answers searching for the truth,
In an ocean of lies.
trying to find a reason to make the hole thing right,
will make you old before your time

When I was younger,
I thought I ruled the world ,
It was an oyster at my feet,
Dancing to my own drum,
fishing out the pearl
wish I would have been much more discreet

I've lived a lifetime,
acting out apart,
Its been a long uphill climb,
now all the things that use to mean so much to me
Has got me old before my time,

Chorus:
Wondering aimlessly,wondering down,
would it ever be much different now,
Remind me of the past,
I slip into a dream,
funny things ain`t never what they seem,

Solo

Living like children,
never doing what we are told ,
Would not hessitateto take to take a chance,
That Road behind me now was paved with fool's gold,
Its almost time for the victory dance,
No more feeling guilty,
for things I never did,
feeling nothing for my crime ,
Living like a gypsy ,
dreaming like a kid,
it makes me old before my time…

There is a long hard Road, it lies so far behind me…
