I don't want my heart to be broken
'Cause it's the only one I've got
So darling please be careful
You know I care a lot
Darling, please don't break my heart
I beg of you


I don't want no tears a fallin'
You know I hate to cry
But that's what's bound to happen
If you ever say goodbye
Darling, please don't say goodbye
I beg of you

Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true
Make me know you love me
The same way I love you, little girl

Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true
Make me know you love me
The same way I love you, little girl

You got me in your mercy
Now that I'm in love with you
So please don't take advantage
'Cause you know my love is true
My darling please love me too
I beg of you
Darling, please don't break my heart
I beg of you
Darling, please don't say goodbye
I beg of you
