Take one last look, before you leave,
Cause oh, somehow it means so much to me.
And if you'll ever need me, you know where I'll be.
So, please, call home if ya change your mind.
Oh, I don't mind.


I guess I saw it comin day by day.
But, oh, I could not stand the failure.
Before you leave, there's just one thing I must say,
Please, call home if ya change your mind.
Oh, I don't mind.

And I know, you're used to runnin.
Oh, you're lost baby, and I ain't funnin.
But, oh, when you call to me, well, I'll come runnin,
Straight to your side, again I'll confide in you.

So, go on, I won't say no more.
My heart ain't in it, but I'll hold the door.
But, just remember what I said before.
Please, call home if ya change your mind.
Please, call home if ya change your mind.
Oh yeah, call home if ya change your mind.
Call home if ya change your mind, oh.
Please, call home if ya change your mind.
Oh yeah, call home baby.
Mmm-hmmm...
