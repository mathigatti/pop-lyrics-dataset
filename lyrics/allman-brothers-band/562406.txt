Bougainvillea, sing your song 
For my lover, for my love 
I need 
Sweet Bougainvillea 
Let her wear your flowers in her hair 
You will always be 
Always be our love song 
She was so afraid 
To give her heart away 
Now before she even knows
I hold her close to me 
Sweet Bougainvillea 
Let her know, shes me
