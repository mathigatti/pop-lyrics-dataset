I know you since you've been born
Raising hell even as a child
Nothing's change since that day
You still are runnin' wild
How hell I'm gonna tell you
And closer barriers are passing by



Well you left this state and running
Is air too smooth these days
I think it's time to come down
You'll gonna have to mend your way
Put your head up in the clouds
Can not see throught the haze

Chorus

Step outside Take a look around
Do you see anyone who cares?
Passed your whole life stepping on your friends
Still your in nowhere

Search for a new direction
But the Past is all you'll find
You can count upon your mistake
Blame it on your criminal mind
When you lay down your snakes
Come up poisonned every time.
