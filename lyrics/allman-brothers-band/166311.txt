I went around to your house, 
found you laid up in the bed, 
by early afternoon you were so sloppy drunk, 
you couldn't even raise up your head. 
So get on with your life baby, 
please let me get on with mine. 
These days and your ways are so painful, 
you're just wasting all our precious time, ohhh. 
Since first I knew your name, 
I wasn't sure that you really cared. 
Spent most of your time with the other boys, 
and it's been all down hill from there. 
So get on with your life baby, 
please let me get on with mine. 
Each day brings a new confusion, 
another way to break this poor heart of mine. 
I can't begin to count the times that I've told ya, 
you better change all your wicked ways, 
but I'm real sure whatever the number, 
ah it's the same as the times you laughed in my face. 
Won't somebody please wake me from this bad dream, 
I remember my grandmama told me, 
things ain't always what they seem. 
So get on with your life baby, 
please let me get on with mine. 
Cause each day brings another confusion, 
it's about to break this poor heart of mine, 
Ohhhha, gonna lose my only mind, oh baby. 
Don't you break this poor heart of mine.
