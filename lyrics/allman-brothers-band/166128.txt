Well I am on the prowl, baby
Looking for someone to satisfy my needs
Some way, somehow
I'm gonna find someone to spend some time with me
I ain't looking, out forever, for some woman to treat a good man right
You look so good, you got me thinking
You might satisfy my soul tonight
Theres no harm done, I know you're the one
You don't got to worry, no hurry
The night's still young
I'm just looking for some good clean fun
I am looking for one woman
Ain't always tryin' to put me down
I don't want nobody
Who's always givin me that same old run around
I ain't leapin'
I'm just leanin'
Looking for that good kind thing
I can tell by the way you're acting
You know exactly what I mean
There's no harm done, I know you're the one
You don't got to worry, no hurry
The night's still young
I'm just looking for some good clean fun
I better slow down, I don't wanna move too soon
I'm so confused, I don't know what to do
Please don't think I am movin' in for the kill
But if you don't want to love me somebody else will
I better slow down, I don't wanna move to soon
I'm so confused, I don't know what to do
Please don't think I am moving out for the kill
If you don't want to love me somebody else will
There's no harm done, I know you're the one
You don't got to worry, no hurry
The night is still young
I'm just looking for some good clean fun
Some good clean fun, oh, baby
Just looking for some good clean fun
