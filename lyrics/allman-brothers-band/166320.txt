Stormy stormy rain
I'm as lonesome as a man can be
Oh, it's stormin', stormin' rain and
I'm as lonesome as a man can be.
Whoa, the way you've been treatin' me,
I realize it's not the same.


It's a down-right rotten,
Low down dirty shame
Lord it's a down right rotten
low down dirty shame
The way that you treated me
Lord I know I'm not to blame

Jelly jelly jelly
Jelly stays on my mind (Hal Leonard book says "Jelly stains on my mind")
Jelly jelly jelly
Jelly stays on my mind
Jelly roll killed my pappy,
And drove my mama stone blind.
