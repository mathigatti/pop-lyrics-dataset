I recall once upon a time,
Livin was so easy and I felt so fine.
But, my, my, my right before my very eyes,
Satan came with fire to burn me,
Wouldn't listen when they warned me.
A dagger in my back while she's calling me honey,
Wouldn't stand back, for neither love nor money.


Thirty minutes after my ship set sail,
She put up a sign and my house began to wail.
But, why, why, why I couldn't see it in my little girl's eyes?
She had such a way to fool me, Lord she had a way to fool me.
And I would ask the woman, "Can you find it in yourself to please stand back?
You ain't gonna rule me."

Just when all began to fade,
I reached out, threw the Ace of Spades.
I put her on a train to the Everglades.

Now that it's all over and gone,
Somehow I just don't feel so alone.
But, lie, lie, lie it seemed like such a waste of time.
She did not ever seem to know me,
But, now it's much too late to show me.
But, if I ever see that woman walkin down the street I'll just stand back,
And try to move away slowly.
Oh, yeah.
