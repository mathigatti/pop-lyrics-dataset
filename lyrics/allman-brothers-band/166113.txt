I've got to change my way of living
Cause trouble's all that I can see
I gotta change my way of living
Lord trouble's all that I can see


My life is in such a mess
There ain't no one to blame but me
My good girl tried to tell me
Wouldn't hear a thing she said

Lord my good girl tried to tell me
Wouldn't hear a lonesome thing she said
Now she's taken her things and left me
No place for me to lay my head

Blue, lord I'm blue
Raining down on me
I gotta change my way of living
Cause the blues is all I see
Blue, lord I'm blue
Raining down on me
I gotta change my way of living
Change my way
The blues is all I see

Now when your luck runs out
That's when your friends will run out too
Lord, when your luck runs out
Your fairweather friends will run out too

You're a very lucky man, lord
If there is just one who'll stand by you
Blue, lord I'm blue
The blues raining down on me
I gotta change my way of living
'Cause the blues is all I see
