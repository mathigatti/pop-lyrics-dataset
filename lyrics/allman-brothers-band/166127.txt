We've been through hell and high water,
Ready to go through it all again. 
As long as we've got a quarter between us all,
We're gonna have money to spend, oh.
Kicked down the doors in New Orleans,
We got busted at Grove Hill where nobody goes,
And Long Bob drove us to the Badlands,
You can bet your ass we're gonna make it down to tomorrow night's show.
Chorus:
We took time by the horns,
Cryin' out loud,
Stood there naked up there in front of the crowd,
Been a million miles,
On a lost highway,
They might name a street after us one of these days.


Oh, we've seen the good times, we've seen the bad.
Worse time we ever seen, is the best some folks ever had,
And the Stone mowed us down, with a cold-hearted quill,
But we ain't changed our ways, and I guess we never will.
Chorus
