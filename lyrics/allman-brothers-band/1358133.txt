I've heard it said before,
That you dont care no more,
You just pick up tracks,
And dont look back,
And walk right out that door.


I tell my friends its easy,
Shes never on my mind.....
My life is so much better
Since that day I said good-bye

And i tell myself Im free
But Im only foolin me
Cause no matter what I do...
I cant get over you

Well I tried to hide my pain,
With a taste of fast lane,
But aint no use... to shake you loose...
I still feel the same
I thought I could forget you
But that was just a lie,
Im just not the same without you...
I dont even want to try....

And i tell myself Im free
But Im only foolin me
Cause no matter what I do...
I cant get over you
I cant get over you

I dont know how it started
I dont know where I stand
I just want to be back in your arms once again

And i tell myself Im free
But Im only foolin me
Cause no matter what I do...
I cant get over you
I cant get over you
I cant get over you
