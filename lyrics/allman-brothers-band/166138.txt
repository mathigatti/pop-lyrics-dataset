Whatever happened to good time Sally
I don't see her 'round no more
She used to be all over me
It ain't like that no more
Sally had the best game there was in town 
Now the good girl just can't be found
Whatever happened to good time Sally
I don't see her 'round no more


The heat is on, everybody has gone underground
The heat is on, everybody hiding out just like Jesse James
My old home town
Lord, it don't seem the same

Well, I walked in this place, I was just lookin' for a game
Everybody here wanted to know my name
I said hush, hush up your mouth, I'll introduce my own self 
To this house
I was born in the back woods, I was raised up like a slave
Having me a good time now is all I crave
I spotted me a barroom queen, skin tight blue jeans
That same old midnight show
I took her to the side and I said I won't be satisfied
Until you tell me everything you know

Whatever happened to big time Buddy
I don't see him 'round no more
I heard tell that they got him in jail
But I don't know what they got him for
They caught him with an airplane
Talkin' 'bout some cocaine
Nobody knows for sure
Whatever happened to good time Buddy
I don't see hem 'round no more 

The heat is on, everybody has gone underground
The heat is on, everybody hiding out just like Jesse James
My old home town
Lord, it don't seem the same
