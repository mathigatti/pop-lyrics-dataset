No I'm no angel, No I'm no stranger to the street
I`ve got my label, So I won't crumble at your feet
And I know baby, So I've got scars upon my cheek
And I'm half crazy, Come on and love me baby


So you find me hard to handle, well I'm easier to hold
So you like my spurs that jingle and I never leave you cold
So I might steal your diamonds I'll bring you back some gold
I'm no angel

No I'm no angel, No I'm no stranger to the dark
Let me rock your cradle, Let me start a fire with your spark
Oh come on baby, Come and let me show you my tatoo
Let me drive you crazy, Come on and love me baby

So you don't give a darn about me, I never treat you bad
I won't ever lift a hand to hurt you &amp; I'll always leave you glad
So I might steal your diamonds I'll bring you back some gold
I'm no angel

LEAD

No I'm no angel, No I'm no stranger to the dark
Let me rock your cradle, Let me start a fire with your spark
Oh come on baby, Come and let me show you my tatoo
Let me drive you crazy, Come on and love me baby
