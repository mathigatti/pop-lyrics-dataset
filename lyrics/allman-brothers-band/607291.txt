Got on a bus in memphis,
Destination rome.
Georgia aint no paradise
But a place I just call home.
I sat next to a broken hearted bride
She was cryin, tryin so hard to hide
Her selfish sorrow.


I tried to get her talkin
She didnt have much to say
She asked me for a map to death row
But I didn't know the way
She had lost a million in the game
One look out the window at the pine trees and the rain
It wasnt her day.

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever seen
Multicolored lady
Angry red, passion blue, but mostly shades of green

Midnight came and brought more rain,
Nothing seemed to ease her pain.
The hours that we talked seemed like minutes all in vein.
I watched as her tears kept runnin wide
Bye and bye and bye, way back after a while
She started smilin.

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever known.
Multicolored lady
Come go with me, I'll take you to my home

Oh, by the way, I'm bound for rome.
