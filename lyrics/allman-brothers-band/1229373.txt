Across the river a good woman cried
All because a foolish man lied.
She gave up everything, everything that money could buy
But the man told so many lies, there's another man over there
That woman across the river, sweet woman across the river - she was mine


Word got around that he had jilted her
Men came running from near and far
Should've never been so foolish - guess I'll never
But the man that's got her now, he's a lucky so-and-so
That woman across the river, sweet woman across the river - she was mine.

I remember the other day, about a week ago
She said "I don't even want to talk to you 'cause I don't love you anymore."
That woman across the river, sweet woman across the river - she was mine.

Across the river a good woman cried
All because a foolish man lied
She gave up everything, tried to keep him satisfied
But the man told so many lies, there's another man over there
That woman across the river,
That woman across the river,
That woman across the river, sweet woman across the river - she was mine.
