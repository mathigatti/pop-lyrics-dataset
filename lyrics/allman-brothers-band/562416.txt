Not so long ago, just a few years back
We used to hang out down by the railroad track.
The guitars they played and the singers made rhyme
It was a good time for being free. 


Bouquet of flowers on her kitchen window sill
Listen to Bob Dylans new stuff he'd just done in Jacksonville
Lay down on the hillside and look up at the sky
We had it all you and 

And the lives we were living started to feel like yesterday
People started driftin and goin their separate ways
The wind started blowin and the sky began to cry
You and I we didnt make it, I wished we'd never said goodbye

Chorus: 
I hope I never see those eyes again
Eyes that used to be my best friend's
And we gave it all away for the diamonds in the dust
With a hungry voice still howlin in the wind
A heart of stone no longer lasts, her eyes no longer cry
I know I'll never see those tombstone eyes again. 
And I know I'll never see those tombstone eyes again 


(Not real sure about this next verse, but here's what it sounds like.)
No more religious message just a story to tell
I keep on track on Sunday, peace and love, heaven and hell.
I'm a mean beat street drifter, with the sun shining from a face
Ah but that was long ago, another time, another place.

Chorus
