You're the life of the party, everybody's host
Still you need somewhere you can hide
All your good time friends
And your farewell to has-beens
Lord knows, just along for the ride


You think you're a survivor
But boy, you better think twice
No one rides for nothin'
So, step up and pay the price

It's a high cost of low livin'
Ain't it high time? You turn yourself around
Yeah, the high cost of low livin'
It's bound to put you six feet in the ground

So many here who love ya
But still, you just can't tell
Real ones and those who drop your name

All the while behind your back
They lift the flesh right from your bones
You should know by now through all their game

They've been chasing each dream with whiskey
From here to Tokyo
Usin' up all your real friends
Places left to go

It's a high cost of low livin'
Ain't it high time? You turn yourself around
Yeah, the high cost of low livin'
It's bound to put you six feet in the ground

Don't look behind you
Ahh, don't look back
Don't turn to find reason in the past
Past is gone, gone at last

And it's high cost of low livin'
And it's high time you turn yourself around
Well, the high cost of low livin'
It's bound to put you six feet in the ground
