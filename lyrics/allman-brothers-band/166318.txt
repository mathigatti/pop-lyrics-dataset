ride on down the same street 
you've aeen a thousand times 
it overflows with neon lights 
on enormous signs
my god how you want to leave there 
well well


your head severly poundin
from the night before
oh but you just keep on goin' back
goin' back for more
'cause midnight's callin'
well well

(chours)
you want so bad to leave that wurlwind storm
but you cant find no place to grab on
and round and round you go again 
and it just ain't easy
and lord it just ain'easy

(repeat chours once)

lovely ladies all dressed in silk and lace
and while your there oh it 
seams like such a lovely place 
but when you leave there 
got your hat down on your face 
well well
oh when you leave there
got you hat down on your face
well well,
well well
