Lately I don't know where I went wrong, 
But the spell of that pretty young girl is far too strong, 
Between her fine perfume and angel face, 
My whole world became another place. 
The dark side of her intelligence was so strong, 
Soon there'll be no difference in right or wrong. 
Next thing I know I had a key that unlocked her door. 
I could not wait to hear the siren song, 
The beginning of the end of my happy home. 
Sailin', sailing 'cross the devil's sea, oooh, hooo, 
too blind in love, too blind to see. 
Heard them say the payback's double-fold, 
Just can't seem to remember who I bought and sold. 
I'll probably still be here when you come around next year, 
Trying to climb from this deep dark hole. 
I'll be damned if I just don't feel I'm growin' old. 
Sailing, sailing 'cross the devil's sea, ohhh, hooo, 
Too blind in love, too blind to see.
Cause she was eviler than evil, slippery like a fox, 
set me up with pain and woe and, I swear it won't seem to stop. 
If I could just remove her hook from deep from within my soul, 
Swear I'll leave and not come back, just let me out that door. 
Sailin', sailing 'cross the devil's sea, ohhh, hooo, 
Too blind in love, too blind to see.
