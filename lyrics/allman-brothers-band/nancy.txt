Oh-oh

Walking in the midnight rain
Thought i heard a southbound train
Call your name
Nancy


Walking in the rain all day
Guess there wasn't nobody goin' my way
They didn't stop at all
But i will get back to you if i have to crawl

Nancy i told you in my letter
Things didn't appear to be no better at all
And this ol' highway's a hell of a line
Nancy i just spent my last dime to make this call
Oh nancy
I'll get back to you if i have to crawl
Oh yeah

Oh yeah, mmmmm

I left my home for a job in the city
It's a crying shame
It's a pity
It ain't livin' at all
Nobody knows my name
They don't even give a thang about me t'all
Nancy
Baby i'm getting back to you if i have to crawl
Ohh

Nancy i told you in my letter
Things didn't appear to be no better at all
This ol' highway's a hell of a line
Nancy i just spent my last dime to make this call
Nancy
Baby i'll get back to you if i have to crawl
Oh yeah yeah oh oh
Oh nancy
Oh nancy
