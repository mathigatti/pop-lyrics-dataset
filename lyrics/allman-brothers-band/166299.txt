Some-where down on a back street
Way down deep in the back seat
Where I first learned how to moan your name,


I remember the night I met ya
Ooh Sweet Mama, I just can't forget ya
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout your crazy love

Crazy Love
Crazy Love
I love you Mama
But you're too bad to change

Crazy Love
Crazy Love
I love you Mama
Uh, uh

I'm laid up here lookin' at my shoes
Stuck here with these hotel blues
I wish you'd only just call me on the phone

Ain't no doubt and I don't mean maybe
Whoo! I just can't forget about you baby
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout your crazy love

Crazy Love
Crazy Love
I love you Mama
But you're too bad to change
