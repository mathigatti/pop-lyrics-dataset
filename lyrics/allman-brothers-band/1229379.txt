Fatal beauty, the chokin' kind
Dangerous feeling in this heart of mine
How can you love me
And treat me so unkind
You got me floppin' like a fish in a pan
Ain't no way to treat your man


Chorus:
Maydell
Baby won't you please love me
Maydell, you sure put the squeeze on me
I don't know why I love you,
You put me through hell
I can't break your spell, Maydell

Fire spreads quick through the neighborhood
Talk is cheap when the story's good
Nobody said you did, but everybody said that you would
You got me feelin' like a dog, chasin' his tail
I'll never catch you - you play the game too well

Chorus

Every time I try to walk away,
Just walk away
You bat them eyes, beg me to stay,
Honey won't you stay
Ruby red lips, callin' my name
Forget about the sorrow and the shame
Maydell

Every time I try to walk away,
Just walk away
You bat them eyes, beg me to stay,
Honey won't you stay
Ruby red lips, callin' my name
Forget about the sorrow and the shame
Maydell

Chorus
