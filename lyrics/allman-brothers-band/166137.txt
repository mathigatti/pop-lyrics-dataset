Well here you come again
Claiming to be my long lost friend
I can tell you're wearing thin
You're trying to play those same old evil tricks again


No, no nobody
Not even you, babe
No, no nobody
Is gonna do the things you used to do

A wise man tried to warn me
But I would not hear a word
Just can't say that I feel badly
About all the bridges I have burned

No, no nobody
Not even you, babe
No, no nobody
Is gonna do the things you used to do

If you knew someone like I know you
You can hear their footsteps
And know exactly who they are
You ain't worthy my time or money
Much less my heart
Yet here you are again
Who the hell do you think you are

You've got a million dollar smile
And a half-a-dollar soul
You're a living lesson baby
And your story's getting old

No, no nobody
Not even you, babe
No, no nobody
Is gonna do the things you used to do
