Well I just can't believe it's time for leavin',
Even though I've been deceivin' you,
Guess I guessed that I've been through it wrong again, baby,
Though I remember when I fell in love with you.
Don't you think we oughta try it one more time,
Baby I'm not gonna let you go this easy,
Don't you think we oughta try it one more time,
Oh I just can't get you outta my mind.
After all this time we've been together,
It just ain't right to throw it all away,
Yes I know we have seen some stormy weather,
Though I know tomorrow's gonna be a brand new day.
Don't you think we oughta try it one more time,
Baby I'm not gonna let you go this easy,
Don't you think we oughta try it one more time,
Oh I just can't get you outta my mind.
