Hear a new girl moved to the town
Now your baby just ain't no where to be found
Now you think you're in dispair - no
You feel that chill - that cold black clinging in the air


Love's a game - you're in it
And you're so proud
Someone you can depend on
Someone you can rely on
No matter what you say
You won't come
Running back to you're arms
It's all over baby
Well it don't do no good to cry

How do think I felt when you
Let me stay here never once said that we're through
You didn't fight it all the way, no
But I don't care - you just don't mean that much to me this way

Love's a game - you're in it
And you're so proud
Someone you can depend on
Someone you can rely on
No matter what you say
You won't come
Running back to you're arms
It's all over baby
Well it don't do no good to cry

Love's a game - you're in it
And you're so proud
Someone you can depend on
Someone you can rely on
No matter what you say
You won't come
Running back to you're arms
It's all over baby
Well it don't do no good to cry
