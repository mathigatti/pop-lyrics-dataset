Rain falls upon a sleepy southern town
The midnight moon burning brightly
Memories rush in like a river forlorn
As you lay sleeping without me #
Highway song keeps me rolling on
Still I long for you #


CHORUS:

Desdemona, I will be your only one
Oh yeah

I make my living calling out my pain
Trying to make it through another day
Arms reach for me on the wind I can feel it
They're a thousand miles away #
Yours eyes remind me of everything beautiful and blue
and I won't feel myself till I'm with you #

CHORUS

BREAK

So hold a candle till the darkness fades
Nigh time sleeps but not for long
My heart is pounding like the ocean my soul's empty as the sky
But I know someday I'll be coming home #
Time goes by in the twinkling of an eye
Still I pine for you #

CHORUS:

I just wanna be your only one
I just wanna be your only one
Your only one
