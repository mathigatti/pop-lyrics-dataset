Another day in the life of a stranger
Surrounded by four walls that can't be seen
He knows this dude that lives uptown and he delivers
He often calls him for that perfect dream
But oh, he's got his demons
And they stay right by his side
Through his everyday hell, yeah


He loves his wine and his pretty women
He buys them everything just to stay around
He's got it made cause his daddy's got a bundle
He seldom reaches out but there's no one to be found
Except oh, he's still got them demons
And they stay right by his side
In his man-made hell

Oh, he's got his demons
And they by his side
Another dar in the life of the lonely
All alone in a sold out crowd
He can always buy some cheap thrills with his money
His world of silence has become much too loud
But ho, don't forget them demons
They're still right by his side
Causing all kinds of hell, yeah
