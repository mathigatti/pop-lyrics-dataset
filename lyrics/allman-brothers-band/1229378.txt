Woke up this morning
Something robbed me of my sleep
Reached for you but all I felt
Was a cold, empty sheet


Three nights on the road, babe
I don't know where you been
Say you're working late
Could it be you got another man?

Somebody said they saw you
In a little club downtown
Arms around a stranger
You were really goin' to town

You say they're just jealous
That you'll always be mine
Nighttime has a thousand eyes
Could they all be blind?

Or am I a fool? Am I a fool?
'Cause this confusion, oh, it's killing me
They all say that you're doing me wrong
But our love is much too strong
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me
Who to believe

Baby, I really need you
Though I love you like a child
But I won't have no cheatin' woman
Tellin' lies and runnin' wild

I really want to believe you
When you say that you're bein' true
But everywhere I look
Like the finger points to you

Or am I a fool? Am I a fool?
'Cause this confusion always killing me
They all say that you're doing me bad
You're the best thing I've ever had
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me
Who to believe

Or am I a fool? Am I a fool?
'Cause this confusion always killing me
They all say that you're doing me wrong
But our love is much too strong
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me

Am I a fool? Am I a fool?
'Cause this confusion always killing me
They all say that you're doing me bad
You're the best thing I've ever had
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me
Who to believe
