Everybody's got a mountain to climb
This road we travel gets a little tough sometimes
Sometimes I know you feel like you can't go on
Need somebody help you get back home
Need a friend to help you find your way home
Reverend Pearly Brown say there's peace out on the water at night
Big sun going down, Lord it's a pretty sight
Red and blue across the water makes a wonderful song
Listen to it all night long
Everybody's got a mountain to climb
Don't be discouraged when the sun don't shine
Gotta keep on pulling, you gotta keep on tryin'
Everybody's got a mountain to climb
Everybody's got a mountain to climb.
Who'd cross the face of a little smilin' child?
Take away the loser's one last chance?
Who wouldn't linger down by the old river for a while?
You know the whole world loves you when you're dancin'
So, hey let me tell you what I'm talkin' about
You can't go around with your lip stuck out
Life ain't all good but it sure ain't bad
Anyway it's the best old life I ever had
Everybody's got a mountain to climb
Don't be discouraged when the sun don't shine
Gotta keep on pulling, you gotta keep on tryin'
Everybody's got a mountain to climb
Everybody's got a mountain to climb
Don't be discouraged when the sun don't shine
Gotta keep on pulling, you gotta keep on tryin'
Everybody's got a mountain to climb
