Make a man go crazy, a woman wear her dress so tight
Make a man go crazy, a woman wear her dress so tight
Must be the same thing make a tom cat fight all night.
Make you feel so good when your baby get her evening gown
Make you feel so good when your baby get her evening gown
Must be the same thing make a preacher lay his bible down.
Woah that same thing,
Woah that same thing,
Tell me who is to blame,
Whole world fighting about that same thing.
What makes all these men chase a big leg woman down,
What makes all these men chase a big leg woman down,
Must be the same thing make a poor dog a hurtin' hound.
Woah that same thing,
Woah that same thing,
Tell me who is to blame,
Whole world fighting about that same thing.
Oh that same thing,
Woah that same thing,
Tell me who is to blame,
Whole world fighting about that same thing.
