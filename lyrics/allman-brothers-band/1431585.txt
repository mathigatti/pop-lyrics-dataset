The sky is crying
Look at the tears roll down the street
The sky is crying
Look at the tears roll down the street


I'm feeling sad and lonely
My baby's left me
Understanding and a little lovin'
A little love is all that I need

Understanding and a little lovin'
A little love is all that I need
But misunderstanding and a no-good woman
They both cause my heart to bleed

Now every morning
The weeping willows weep for me
Now every morning baby
The weeping willows weep for me

The birds sing a little tune
I wish they'd sing my baby back home to me
The sky is crying
Look at the tears roll down the street

The sky is crying
Look at the tears roll down the street
I'm feeling sad and lonely
My baby's left me
