It's five oclock, thank God it's friday
Anticipations drivin me wild
One more hour is, one more eternity...
I can't wait just to see your smile
We can dance out on the high wire
Up so high we can't look down
Close your eyes, dive in the deep end
We'll go the distance baby, one more time


Let's play, night games
Let's do, some nighttimes things

Bright lights shine in the starlight,
Were drawn like moth to a flame
Fly straight into the candel...
Oh, baby here we go again

Let's play, night games
Let's do, some nighttimes things
