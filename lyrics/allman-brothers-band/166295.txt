Silent shadows of the night
Faded with the morning light
We just wrote another song
Maybe a word or two is wrong
There's so much that could be said
It's hard to write it in a line
But when the final word is read
Maybe something could be said
For all the brothers of the road
Just like you, we bear a heavy load
Been through hell and back again
If we don't lose we're bound to win


Somehow they gave it all a name
Just like a southern hurricane
We play our music like a storm
They say a brand new sound was born
We're all brothers of the road
Just like you, we bear a heavy load
Been through hell and back again
If we don't lose we're bound to win

Some of us fell along the way
We came together, not too proud to pray
But the music must go on
So there's no one left out there all alone
We're just brothers of the road
Casting shadows in the night
Big wheels rolling on and on
But everything's gonna be all right
