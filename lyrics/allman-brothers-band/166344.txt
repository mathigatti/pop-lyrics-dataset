Well I'm Southbound, Lord I'm comin' home to you.
Well I'm Southbound, baby, Lord I'm comin' home to you.
I got that old lonesome feelin' that's sometimes called the blues.


Well I been workin' every night, travelin' every day.
Yes I been workin' every night, traveling every day.
You can tell your other man, sweet daddy's on his way.
Aww, ya better believe.

Well I'm Southbound.
Whoa I'm Southbound.
Well you can tell your other man, Sweet daddy's on his way.

(Guitar solo)

Got your hands full now baby, as soon as I hit that door.
You'll have your hands full now woman, just as soon as I hit that door.
Well I'm gonna make it on up to you for all the things you should have
had before.

Lord, I'm Southbound.
Yes I'm Southbound.
Whoa I'm Southbound, baby.
Said I'm Southbound.
Well I'm gonna make it on up to you for all the things you should
have had before.
