You better come on into my kitchen, 
cause it's sure to be raining outdoors. 
When a woman's in trouble, 
everybody puts her down 
she look for her good man, 
Lord he can't be found. 
You better come on 
into my kitchen, 
cause it's going to be raining outdoors. 
There's a cold wind blowin', 
leaves tremblin' on the trees, 
don't you know that that good girl 
ya she's leaving me. 
You better come on 
into my kitchen, 
cause it's going to be raining outdoors. 
The woman I've been lovin' 
left with my best friend, 
that joker got lucky, 
stole her back again. 
You better come on 
into my kitchen, 
cause it's going to be raining outdoors. 
Well that good girl's leaving, 
she ain't coming back, 
took her last nickel from her notion sack 
You better come on 
into my kitchen, 
cause it's going to be raining outdoors. 
Mama's dead and gone, 
father's no wheres to be, 
I ain't got nobody 
to love and care for me. 
You better come on 
into my kitchen, 
cause it's going to be raining outdoors. 
Yes, it's going to be raining outdoors. 
Yes, it's going to be raining outdoors.
