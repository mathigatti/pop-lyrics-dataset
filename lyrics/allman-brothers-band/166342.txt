I've had my troubles, 
I know you've had your troubles too.
Sometimes when you need a little sunshine, 
it keeps rainin' down on you.
But I'm not gonna let it get me down,
Keep on pullin', things are gonna come around.
Shine it on,
Shine it on.
Little blue-eyed woman, 
She made me feel so fine.
She got what she wanted,
Then she moved on down the line.
Yes I know about the pain, 
Tears are gonna fall,
Just like rain.
Chorus:
Shine it on,
Look around you see what's goin' on.
Shine it on,
Before you end up out there on your own.
Don't let some rainy day, steal your heart away,
You got to go on,
It's just the dark before the dawn,
Shine it on.
Shine it on,
Look around you see what's goin' on.
Shine it on,
Before you end up out there on your own.
Don't let some rainy day, steal your heart away,
Shine it on,
Look around you see what's goin' on.
Shine it on,
Before you end up out there on your own.
Shine it on, oh baby.
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on, 
shine it on (repeat and fade).
