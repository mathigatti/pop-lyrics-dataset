I've had my fun if I don't ever get well no more
I've had my fun if I don't ever get well no more
I know my help is failing me now
I know I'm goin' down slow


Won't somebody wright my mother
And tell her the shape I'm in
I want somebody to wright my mother
And tell her the shape Im in
I want you tell her to pray for me
Ask her to forgive me for all my sins

Mother please don't send me no doctor
A doctor can't do me no good
I don't want you to send me no doctor now..
A doctor just can't do me no good
Back when I was a young boy, oh
I just didn't do the thing I should
