I need someone's hand to lead me through the night
Need someone's arms, to love and squeeze me real tight.
And when the lights are low, when it's time to go,
I need your love so bad.
I need some soft lips to hold so close to mine
Need someone to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin
When the lights are low, and when it's time to go,
I need your love so bad.
So give it up, and bring it on home to me.
Oh you can write it on a paper so it can be read to me.
Tell me you love me, stop drivin' me mad,
Cause I need your love so bad.
I needed some voice, to take me through the night,
Don't you worry baby, I will not fuss and fight.
Well listen to my plea, now bring it on home to me,
Cause I need your love so bad.
Well, I need your love soooo bad. 
Soooo bad. So baaad. Soooooo bad.
