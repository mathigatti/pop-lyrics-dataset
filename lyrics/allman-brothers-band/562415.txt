As I was motivatin, back towards town,
I seen a Cadillac sign, it said "No Money Down".
So I eased on my brake, and I pulled up there in the drive.
I gunned up my motor and then I walked on inside.
The dealer came down, and said, "Man, trade that Ford.
I can put you in a car, that will eat up the road.
Now, you just tell me what you want, and then sign this line.
I'll have it brought right to your house, in about a hour's time."


I'm gonna get me car and I'm gonna head on down the road.
Ain't gonna have to worry no more, bout that broke-down, raggedy Ford.

Well, mister I want a yella convertible, a 4-door DeVille.
Man, I want a Continental spare, and some wire, chrome wheels.
And power steering, and uh, power brakes.
And a powerful motor, with a jet offtake.
Some nice, cool air condition, and some nice, warm heat.
And a big, old feather bed and my pillow, in the backseat.
I want a shifter shower radio, and a color TV and a phone.
So I can talk to my honey, while I'm ridin alone.

I'm gonna get me car, yeah, and head on down the road.
I'm not gonna have to worry no more, bout that broke-down, raggedy Ford.

Mmmm.
And also, I want 4 carburetors, and I want 2 straight exhausts.
I want a nucleur reactor and I don't care what it costs.
I want a railroad airhorn, and I want a psychedelic, strobe spot.
And I want a 15 year guarantee, on everything that I've got.
I want a 2 dollar deductible, and I want a 20 dollar note.
I want 150,000 dollars liability, and that's all she wrote.

I'm gonna get me car and head on down the road.
Now, I don't wanna have to worry no more, bout that broke-down, raggedy Ford.
