This city mean old world, try livin by yourself
This city mean old world, try livin by yourself
Can't get the one you love, have to use somebody else


I've got the blues, gonna pack my things and go
I've got the blues, gonna pack my things and go
Guess you don't love me, lovin mister so and so

Solo (two times)

Sometimes I wonder why can your love be so cold
Sometimes I wonder why can your love be so cold
I guess you don't love me, gonna pack my things and go

Solo (to end)
