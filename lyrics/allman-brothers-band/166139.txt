Like the hopeful dreams of many, he had everything and more, 
A lovely wife and children, all the things worth fighting for. 
He knows, there was still, still, something missing in his life.
Though he promised to be faithful, he was good at telling lies. 
He had an eye for young girls, he would steal some on the side. 
Oh no, he just could not be satisfied. 
It's a game of all or nothing, there is nowhere safe to run, 
Someone might just pull the trigger, cause temptation is a gun. 
He met her at a night club, on the other side of town. 
Somehow he could not resist her, she's the best he'd ever found. 
She knows, she found her ticket to the other side. 
It's a game of all or nothing, there is nowhere safe to run, 
Someone might just pull the trigger, cause temptation is a gun. 
His foolish ways seem harmless, but his world was so divine, 
Cause at home they know his secrets, they've heard all his alibis. 
As he tries to face his feelings, he can't justify his crimes, 
Now comes the final ending, of the dreams he once held sacred deep inside. 
He can kiss it all good-bye. 
It's a game of all or nothing, there is nowhere safe to run, 
Someone might just pull the trigger, cause temptation is a gun. 
Oh, ummmm, ya baby, ahhhh temptation is a gun. 
Temptation is a gun, All or nothing, all or nothing.
