Theres been so many 
Girls I have known
I've made so many cry
Get I've still wonder why


Here comes the little girl
I see her walking down the streets
She's all by herself
I try and knock her off her feet

But she'll never, never break 
This heart of stone
Oh, this heart of stone, darlin'

What's different about her
I don't really know
No matter how I try 
I just can't make her cry

But don't keep on looking
That same old way
If you try acting sad
Oh, you'll only make me glad

You better listen here, little girl 
You go on walking down the street
I ain't got no love 
I ain't the kind you wanna meet

'Cause you'll never , no, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, this heart of stone, darlin'
This heart of stone
Oh, you'll never break, baby
No, this heart of stone
No, you'll never tryna break, darlin'
No, no, never break 
Better go home, go home
This heart of stone
Better go home
