Well, yes, people I am a poor, drunken hearted boy.
Well, yeah, people I am a poor, drunken hearted boy.
I have a whole ocean of trouble,
And just a little, half pint of joy.


I drink because I'm worried, I don't drink because I'm dry.
I know if I keep on drinkin, I'm liable to drink away my life.
But that's alright.

Baby, bring me another half-a-pint,
I'm trying to drown these blues, yes I am.
People if you had my trouble,
Baby, I know you'd be drinkin too.

Alright.
Baby, bring me some Old Grandad's 100 proof.
Don't play like that man, you'll make me thirsty.
Oh, Lord.

Baby, if I keep on drinkin, I know I can't last too long.
Woman, if I keep on drinkin, people ya know I can't last too long.
That's alright, cause when I'm dead and buried,
Please think about me when you hear this song.
