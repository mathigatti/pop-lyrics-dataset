Had a sweet little girl, 
Run out and took the baby boy, people ain't that sad. 
Oh, had a sweet little girl,
Left me, run out and took the baby boy, oh ain't that sad.
Chorus:
Can't spend what you ain't got,
Can't lose what you never had.
Can't spend what you ain't got,
Can't lose what you never had.
Had some money in the bank,
Got busted, people ain't that so sad.
Oh, I had some money in the bank,
Got busted, people, people ain't that sad.
Chorus
Had a sweet little home,
Got drunk, burned it down, people ain't that sad.
Oh, had a sweet little home,
Got drunk, burned it down, people ain't that sad.
Chorus
Ooooh, hmmmm, hmmmm... oohhhh!
