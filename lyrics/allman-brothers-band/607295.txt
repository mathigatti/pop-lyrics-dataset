He came from the streets, she came from the mountains
A faded star and an angel without wings,
Their passions flowed like a deep running river
They had nothing left to lose and everything to gain and he said


Let's make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,
Plant some seeds deep in the ground,
Let's make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,
Strong enough to hold us down

Seasons will change, we'll last forever we'll see the snow and the
Falling of the leaves
High on the hill with the sky all around us, we'll watch it grow
From two wild seeds

Let's make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,
Plant some seeds deep in the ground,
Let's make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,
Where it's springtime all around

Solo

He came from the streets, she came from the mountains
A faded star and an angel without wings,
Their passions flowed like a deep running river
They had nothing left to lose and everything to gain and he said

Let's make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,
Plant some seeds deep in the ground,
Lets make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,
Where its springtime all around

Let's make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,
Plant some seeds deep in the ground,
Let's make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,
Where it's springtime all around
