Well, it's rainin' out the window.
With no sadness on your face.
As you're cleaning out your closet.
Throw your clothes around the place.


I can't stand to see you leaving.
I'm not ashamed to beg you to stay.
I can't lock the door and keep you.
I won't stand in your way.

Guess I've got to let you go.
But there's just one thing you should know.

It ain't over, it ain't over yet.
You might walk away but you won't forget.
I'll never stop loving you.
My mind is set.
So do what you gotta do yeah.
Cause it ain't over yet.

Guess I should have seen it coming.
But I can see it clearly now.
Gonna change my way of livin'.
Try to get you back somehow.
Some night when you're lonely.
And your thoughts have turned to me.
Just when you least expect it.
I'll come walking through your dreams.

So go on take that taxi ride.
Cause I know time is on my side.

It ain't over, it ain't over yet.
You might walk away but you won't forget.
I'll never stop loving you.
My mind is set.
Do what you gotta do baby.
It ain't over....
