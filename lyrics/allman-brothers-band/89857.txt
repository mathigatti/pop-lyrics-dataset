When you can't find the light
That got you through the cloudy days
When the stars ain't shinin' bright
You feel like you've lost you're way
When those candle lights of home
Burn so very far away
Well you got to let your soul shine
Just like my daddy used to say


He used to say soulshine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah now people don't mind
We all feel this way sometimes
You gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day

I grew up thinkin' that I had it made
Gonna make it on my own
Life can take the strongest man
Make him feel so alone
Now sometimes I feel a cold wind
Blowin' through my achin' bones
I think back to what my daddy said
He said, "Boy, in this darkness before the dawn

Let your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah now people don't mind
We all feel this way sometimes
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day"

Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this
And when your world seems cold, you got to let your spirit take control

Talkin' 'bout your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
And now people don't mind
We all feel this way sometimes
You gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day

Oh, it's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
It's damn sure better than rain
Yeah now people don't mind
We all feel this way sometimes
You gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day
