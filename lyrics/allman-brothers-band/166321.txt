You ride on down the same old street you've seen a thousand times,
That overflows with neon lights and enormous signs.
My God, how you want to leave there. Well, well.
Your head severely poundin' from the night before.
Baby, you just keep goin' back, goin' back for more.
Cause midnight's callin'. Well, well.
You want so bad to leave this whirlwind storm. 
But you can't find no place to grab on.
So 'round and 'round you go again, and it just ain't easy.
You want so bad to leave this whirlwind storm. 
But you can't find no place to grab on.
So 'round and 'round you go again, and it just ain't easy.
No, it just ain't easy.
Lovely ladies all dressed in silk and lace.
While you're there, oh, it seems like such a lovely place.
But when you leave there,
You got your hat down on your face. Well, well.
But oh, when you leave there, got your hat down on your face, well, well.
Ohh, when you leave there, you got your hat pulled down on your face, well.
