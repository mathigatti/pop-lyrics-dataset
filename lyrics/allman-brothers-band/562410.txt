I left you crying at the D.C. station
Had a little spending change
The Lord knows I had the determination
If you want the good life
Got to make it big
That's why I left you waiting
So I could go out and dig
In this big ol' world
But now I'm


I'm Down in Texas
Ain't got one thin dime
I'm so lonely for ya baby
So stop wasting my time

So come on down and get me
Don't blame me cause I tried
I need your lovin' so bad
Get on the train and ride

solo

Climbing up poor means
As you can see
Pale like a half a man
Girl, they work you like you're three
Here in a pallid city
I still get along
So take me pretty baby
Take me back home
Cause I'm so tired, yeah
Now I'm

I'm Down in Texas
Ain't got one thin dime
I'm so lonely for ya baby
So stop wasting my time

So come on down and get me
Don't blame me cause I tried
I need your lovin' so bad
Get on the train and ride

I'm Down in Texas
Ain't got one thin dime
I'm so lonely for ya baby
So stop wasting my time

So come on down and get me
Don't blame me cause I tried
I need your lovin' so bad
Get on the train and ride
