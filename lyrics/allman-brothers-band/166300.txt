I went down to the crossroads,fell down on my knee
Down to the crossroad,fell down on my knee
Asked the Lord above for mercy,take me if you please


I went down to the crossroad,tried to flag a ride
Down to the crossroad,tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me,everybody passed me by

When I'm goin' down to Rosedale,take my rider by my side
Goin' down to Rosedale,take my rider by my side
We can stil barrelhouse,baby,on the riverside

You can run,you can run.Tell my friend,boy,Willie Brown
Run,you can run.Tell my friend,boy,Willie Brown
And I'm standin' at the crossroads.Belive I'm sinkin' down
