Upon my word, what does it mean?
Is it love or is it me?
That makes me change so suddenly,
From lookin' out to feelin' free...


I sit here lyin' in my bed
Wonderin' what it was I'd said
That made me think I'd lost my head
When I knew I'd lost my heart instead...

So won't you please read my signs, be a gypsy...
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
Because you can't find my mind, please be with me...

Of all the better things I've heard
Lovin' you has made the words
And all the rest seems so absurd
'Cause In the end it all comes out, I'm sure

So won't you please read my signs, be a gypsy...
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
Because you can't find my mind, please be with me...
