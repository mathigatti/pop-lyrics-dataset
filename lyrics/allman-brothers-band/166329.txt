I will never forget the time we spent together
And let the whole wide world go by
I can't forget the dreams that we made come true
As the clouds in the sky rolled on


And I can't forget the day we met
Oh our love came so easy
It's so hard for me to say
That we can never go back to yesterday

You must know that it don't happen everyday
Now I see that I let love slip through my fingers
Someone said that love is just a beautiful dream
And let it drift away

Oh another lonely teardrop
Just one more careless love
It's so hard for me to say
That we can never go back to yesterday

Baby let's fall in love again
Baby let's fall in love
Baby let's fall in love again
And maybe we can go back to yesterday
