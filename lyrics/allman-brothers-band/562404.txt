Waiting in the rain at the station,
Standing by the train,
Looks like you're comin home to stay.
It's been quite a while since you've seen him,
Now, inside you smile against the rain,
Cause you still feel the same.


But, you're gonna cry, and search for the reason why,
Carry your pain and you'll finally go insane.
Uh, cause you, baby,
Whoa, you been gone much too long.

You can't believe there's no one there to greet ya now,
You can't believe that no one cares,
To take your hand, you want your man.

But, you're gonna cry, and search for the reason why,
Carry your pain and you'll finally go insane.
Uh, cause you, baby,
Whoa, you been gone much too long.
Yeah, baby, much too long.
Whoa, much too long.
You went away a long time ago.
