Yeah --- Sad eyed woman
boogie 'til the break of dawn
Yeah --- Long a-bout the break of day --- Yeah
oh--- your man has up and gone---


You got 13 lovely children
No proud father knocking at your door
Yeah--- but every hungry woman
has been in your place before

Yeah --- the doctor keep [or "kept"] calling
woah -- found you'd fall-en 
[alternate lyrics: found you bawlin']
Yeah -- you backed him in the corner
oh --- you're doing what you wanna

You got 14 lovely children
No proud father knocking at your door
Yeah--- but every hungry woman
has been in your place before

*** Guitar Solo ***

You got 15 lovely children
No proud father knocking at your door
Yeah--- but every hungry woman
has been in your place before

Yeah --- the doctor keep [or "kept"] calling
woah -- found you'd fall-en 
[alternate lyrics: found you bawlin']
Yeah -- you backed him in the corner
oh --- you're doing what you wanna

You got 16 lovely children
No proud father knocking at your door
Yeah--- but every hungry woman
has been in your place before

Oh-- yeah
Sad eyed woman
ohhhh
