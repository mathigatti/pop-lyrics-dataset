Greg:
Well you can take all of the money that you made and
but it in the jar
Drag out a map that will show you
is heaven very far


You take all of the medicine you need 'til ya
find out who you are 
Maybe you can figure
why that woman wanna be so cruel
But ya, ya just can't forget her, can you fool
Oh-oh

Cher:
Well those winter nights
and the city lights
and the crying of the train
Everyday is a straight up gray
Every memory's a fade
And then ya finally use the sense God gave ya
to come out of the rain
Still you can't figure
why that man is got to be so cruel
But ya just can't forget him, can you fool

Together:
Oh, love is long and love is hard
Love brings lots of pain
She was here
Now she's gone
Lord, bring her back again

Cher:
Well you can take all of the money that you made and

Greg:
but it in the jar
Drag out a map that will show you
is heaven very far

Cher:
And you can take all of the medicine you need 'til ya

Greg:
find out who you are

Cher:
Still you can't figure why
that man he got to be so cruel
But ya just can't forget him, can you fool

Greg:
No you just can't forget her, can you fool

Cher:
Awww, can you fool
