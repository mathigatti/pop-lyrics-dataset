I love the way you walk
I love the way you walk
I love the way you walk, Oh my babe, I got my eyes on you


I see ya every day
I see ya every day
I see ya every day, Oh my babe, I got my eyes on you

(guitar solo)

I love to see ya switch
I love to see ya switch
I love to see ya switch, Oh my babe, I got my eyes on you

You've Got Dimples on your jaw
You've Got Dimples on your jaw
You've Got Dimples on your jaw
