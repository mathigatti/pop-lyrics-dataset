Don't worry for me
Well I'm all right
Lord knows I"m having,
A natural good time,
Pocket full of money
Gonna boogie all night;
There ain't nobody tell me that's crime


Chorus:
When morning comes and it's time to go
Pony boy carry me home
Pony boy carry me home.

Spoken:
All right mama,
Let me see you do that thing now

Band is jumping and so am I.
I'm just groovin', can't stop movin',
My ole man's got that ole eagle eye
But he is just waitin', we're celebratin'

Chorus

Spoken:
I feel a change coming on
Come on, mama!
Here it comes now
Papa's with you now;

Look out the door,
There beside that tree.
Well, that's my pony, looking after me,
Front feet doing the shuffle
Back feet, too.
Blow them good old Georgia blues.

Chorus
