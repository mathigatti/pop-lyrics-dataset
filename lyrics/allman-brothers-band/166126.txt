Gypsy woman told my mama
'while 'fore I was born.
Got a boy child comin' mama,
He'll be a bad one, now.
I'll make all you little girls,
turn your heads around.
Then I'm gonna take you little girls,
gonna take you right on down... with me yeah
Ho, you just wait and see.
I'll be your hoochie coochie man,
I'll set you free.
On the seventh hour of the seventh day
on the seventh month, seven doctors they say.
I've got lots of good luck, you know they all agree.
But now if ya, if you're lookin' for trouble babe,
you better not mess with me.
Hey, 'cause you know I'll getcha one by one.
Ain't no fun. 
I'm that old hoochie coochie man,
a bad son of a gun.
Got a John the conqueroot and got some mojo too,
We got a black cat born, we're gonna slip it to you.
Hey, move over people just as fast as you can.
Said I know you're waitin' for me 'cause I'm the hoochie coochie man.
I'm gonna get you, one by one.
I got set on that old hoochie coochie man
and I'm yo' son of a gun.
Now the gypsy woman told mama, oh 'while 'fore I was born,
she said you know he's comin' mama, he'll be a bad, very bad one.
Make all the ladies, turn their heads around.
You said, I can just see all those women, chasin' him all down.
I'm your hoochie coochie man, everybody knows it.
