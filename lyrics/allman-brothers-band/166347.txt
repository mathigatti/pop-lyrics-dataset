Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low.
You got no nerve baby, to turn Uncle John from your door.


I woke up this morning, I had them Statesboro Blues,
I woke up this morning, had them Statesboro Blues.
Well, I looked over in the corner, and Grandpa seemed to have them too.

Well my momma died and left me,
My poppa died and left me,
I ain't good looking baby,
Want someone sweet and kind.

I'm goin' to the country, baby do you wanna go?
But if you can't make it baby, your sister Lucille said she wanna go.
(and I sure will take her).

I love that woman, better than any woman I've ever seen;
Well, I love that woman, better than any woman I've ever seen.
Well, now, she treat me like a king, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I treat her like a doggone queen.

Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low.
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low.
You got no nerve baby, to turn Uncle John from your door.
