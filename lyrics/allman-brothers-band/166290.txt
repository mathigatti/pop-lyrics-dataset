Say you want to be a rolling stone
Get your sail out in the wind
Get out on the highway and let 'er roll on
Roll on back to someplace you ain't never been
Hey, hey


When I was younger I was hard to hold
Seem like I was always goin' 
Which ever way the wind would blow
Now that travelin' spirit calls me again

Callin' me back to where it all begins

Moon rise and sun go down
Turn my whole world around
Little star up in the sky
Tell my sweet baby please don't cry
Please don't cry

(SOLO)

Moon rise and sun go down
Turn my whole world around
Little star up in the sky
Tell my sweet baby please don't cry
Please don't cry

Travel out across the burnin' sand
Cross the ocean to some distant land
We'll reach the end we'll all be singin' 
and we'll all be friends
Back where it all begins

Back where it all begins
