The way I feel for you
I can't describe
It's almost too intense
To verbalize
Essentially you're all
I'm living for
And basically each day
I need you more and more


CHORUS:
Have you even been so enamored baby
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me
That's how much I love you
Love is yours and mine
'Till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend

Don't underestimate the love in me
It's obvious these feelings run so deep
I fall and fall for you day after day
Nobody else could ever take your place

Have you even been so enamored baby
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me
That's how much I love you
Love is yours and mine
'Till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend

You don't gotta waste your time and worry
You don't gotta look for reassurance
'Cause clearly you're the only one that's getting this and
Sugar I don't need nobody else
But you
And hone I ain't letting go too soon
Because I can't get enough
Why you asking how much?
It's more than you can handle baby

Have you even been so enamored baby
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me
That's how much I love you
Love is yours and mine
'Till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend
