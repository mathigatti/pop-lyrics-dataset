Runway
(The way it feels to fly)
Runway
Runway


They’ll come a day when we won’t have to fight
Won’t be about who is wrong, who is right
Like fireflies, and might ain't even lie
Just you and I, universally tied
There’s truth for those if they want to hear
Somewhere out in the atmosphere
To survive gotta persevere
Close to fly, gotta have no fear

First they love you, like who's trusting you and
Then eventually try to change you
You can push through it, stay the same you and
Never let them bring you down (We do)
Remember there’s only one you (Oh)
There’s a God up above you (You)
You can soar above the herd when it taunts you
Fly like a hummingbird if you want to

Let love be our runway, there is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you’re rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
When the race keep kissing the horizon
Runway, yeah yeah
Runway, yeah
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
When you wasted, let love make your runway

There's a better color that reflects the light you have inside
And you will discover there is flawless through your terrify
And I promise there is truth for those who really want to hear
If you wanna touch the sky and fly, you’ve got to have no fear

First they love you, and then they judge you and
Try to chain you, and they drain you
You can push through it, stay the same you and
Never let them bring you down (We do)
Remember there’s only one you (Ooh)
There’s a God up above you (True)
You can soar above the herd when it taunts you
Fly like a hummingbird if you want to

Let love be our runway, there is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you’re rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
When the race keep kissing the horizon
Runway, yeah yeah
Runway, yeah
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
When you wasted, let love make your runway

Runway, runway
Let love make your runway
Runway, runway
Let love make your runway
Runway, runway
Let love make your runway
Runway, runway
Let love make your runway

Let love be our runway, there is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you’re rising
And you’re face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
When the race keep kissing the horizon
Runway
Runway
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
When you wasted, let love make your runway

The way it feels to fly
