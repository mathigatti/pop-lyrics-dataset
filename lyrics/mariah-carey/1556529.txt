If you could only see
That I was not put here for you
To judge me and dispute my in most truth


And after all these years of enmity, envy and tears
It's a shame you don't know me at all

I was wondering would you cry for me
If I told you that I couldn't breathe
If I was drowning, suffocating
If I told you that I couldn't breathe

Those ageless buried recollections
We transform them and select them
You have yours, I have mine that's fine

Why are we too torn to heal
Our stitches never dissapear
I have mine, you have yours, I'm sure

I was wondering
Would you reach for me
If you saw that I was languishing

I was wondering would you cry for me
If I told you that I couldn't breathe
If I was drowning, suffocating
If I told you that I couldn't breathe
