Make me believe in you
Honestly, for real, one thing true
Take me in, in your arms
Wandering alone, seems so far


Let me know that you made it as far as forever, woah
Let me know that you hear when I cry if you can

You're far away from me
You're far away from me
You're far away from me
Come a little closer
Just a little, oh

Let me know heaven sees
Shines on life our memories
Mmm, make me feel all that you are
Angel child or a radiant star

'Cause I know that we'll meet up again in forever, oh
Let me know you'll be waiting for me in the end

You're far away from me
You're far away from me
You're far away from me
Come a little closer
Just a little

Ah ah ah

You're far away from me
You're far away from me
You're far away from me
Come a little closer,
Just a little, oh
Just a little

Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Just a little
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Just a little
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Just a little
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Just a little
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
