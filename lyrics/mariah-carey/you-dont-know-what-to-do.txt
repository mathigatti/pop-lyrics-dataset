You need to go
Don’t look so surprised
(You better sing it, sing, sing)
Cause we had love
That will be immortalized
Say you need me now
Grow along without me now
But our little romance is through
Because basically boy, you
You just don’t know what to do
Oh


I can give it to ya, but what you gonna do
Win it if I hit it, I bet you stuck, stoop
But sucking your teeth, don’t fuck up my mood
I’m trying to give it all to you
I can understand it’s things we go through
Put C’s on your back, let see this here through
And we can be happy as we can be, no rules
But I gotta get it out of you
She said, “‘Le, throw a ring on it”
She don’t love you unless she put your whole name on it
Gettin’ money at this age is hard knocks
The day to not act the way
When all the pretty girls love you for your stage presence
Uh, and then you shake somethin’

I miss you almost half as much as you miss me
You used to act so tough, pretty insecurity
Now that I found myself, your air can too be mine
Can’t even help yourself from playing the fool this time

Ooh, how I loved you
Ooh, how I needed you
Ooh, boy I feel brand new
Ooh, since you turned me lose

Baby, you don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do
You don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do

Cause you wanna leave
And you never go
I’ma set you free boy
Baby, you don’t know
You don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do
You don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do

You love me more than you loved sunny summer days
And even more than you love floating in a haze
Boy when you lost my heart, you lost everything
Now all that you can do is listen to me sing

Ooh, how I loved you
(How I loved you boy)
Ooh, how I needed you
Ooh, boy I feel brand new
Ooh, since you turned me lose

You don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do
You don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do

Cause you wanna leave
And you never go
I’ma set you free
Cause baby, you don’t know
You don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do
You don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do

I can give it to you, but what you gon’ do
Win it, if I hit it, I bet you stuck, stoop
And the motto I got, no class in this school
Take your bags and go boo
Never mind all of the flexin’ I do
Balenciagas, got you two steppin’ on smooth
Never will I lower my standards, my boo
I could show you we’re attendants like sampress on cue
That’s kinda funny cause love still mean lose
Unless we kill a record and back-and-forth moves
Somehow you keep showing your ass, I see through it
Did you catch that all, screw it
All the girls need is respect and I do it
Never catch feelings 'cause Jets is my fuel
Giuseppe my foot, my sweats be brand new
So sexy, they ain’t sweating me, I bet you ain’t know t

You don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do
You don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do

Cause you wanna leave
(Cause you wanna leave)
And you never go
(And you never go)
I’ma set you free
Baby, you don’t know
You don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do
You don’t know what
You don’t know what
You don’t know what to do

You don’t know you do to me
You don’t know you do to me
You don’t know
I can give it to you, but what you gon’ do
You don’t know
I can give it to you, but what you gon’ do
You don’t know you do to me
I can give it to you, but what you gon’ do
You don’t know you do to me
I can give it to you, but what you gon’ do
You don’t know
You don’t know
