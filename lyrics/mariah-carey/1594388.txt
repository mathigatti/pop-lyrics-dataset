It's 8 am in the morning
And i can't wait to make til to tonight
(Make it til tonight)
I can't wait to welcome you home from work
Tell me what's on your mind
(What's on your mind)
Oh baby get up on me
You don't need no one but me
And now let's put this day behind us
Get your ass over here and make love to me (to me)


Oh when i'm with you i'm all dramatic
You got me up on the car
Like traffic, bumper bumper on ya
It's automatic, the love we got is magical
If you know what i'm saying sing along with me

See i love the way you do me
When you do me like that
And i love the way that it feels
When i fall asleep on your back
And i love the fact that you got me crazy
I don't know how to act
And boy i love the way you do me
When you do me like that

I know they wanna take your place
But they don't know me like that
They don't know me like that
They don't know you like that
I know they all up in my face
But they don't know me like that
They don't know me like that
They don't know you like that

It's 8 am in the morning
And i can't wait to make til to tonight
(Make it til tonight)
I can't wait to welcome you home from work
Tell me what's on your mind
(What's on your mind)
Oh baby get up on me
You don't need no one but me
