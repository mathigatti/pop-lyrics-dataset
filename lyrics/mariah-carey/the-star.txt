One dark night
Something said: Follow the light
So you look up and see the word
That's written upon the sky
Strong and wise
Keeping the Lord as your guide
And through the doubt, you realize
He's with you all the while


Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas

Shining bright
The spirit of love at first sight
And when the door won't welcome you
Heaven will help you inside
Gathered 'round
Bearing the gifts to the crown
A miracle comes, the babe is born
And angels are heard on high

Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas

Follow that voice you heard that no one else believed
Follow the dream that brought the King on Christmas Eve, oh

Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow the voice, follow the song
Follow the word that makes you strong
Follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
