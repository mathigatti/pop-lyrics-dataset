It's really been twenty good minutes
Since I kissed you
Come back boo
I miss you
Wish I had twenty million hours
To caress you
And undress you
To be continued...


Boy you
You don't know how it feels
When you whisper in my ears
Boy you
You gave my body chills
Whenever you are near

And boy I got ya
Whirlwinding on my mind
I got ya
Whirlwinding on my mind
You got me
Wrapped up wrapped up
Ribbon with a bow on it
I got ya
Whirlwinding on my mind
I got ya
Whirlwinding on my mind
You got me
Wrapped up wrapped up
Ribbon with a bow on it
Wrapped up wrapped up
Ribbon with a bow on it
Wrapped up wrapped up
Ribbon with a bow on it

Hey, sometimes we argue and we fight
But they better note that thats my baby
You might even think you cute
But everybody knows that im his lady
Everytime you see us

So proud hes by my side

You don't know how it feels
When you whisper in my ears

Whenever you are near

Wrapped up wrapped up
Ribbon with a bow on it
Wrapped up wrapped up
Ribbon with a bow on it
