Come on
Work that sucker to death


Like a fly you buzz around me
Never knowing when to muffle the sound
Will you push me to the ground
and hold me there
until I am crying aloud?

This is not the time and not the season
Get out of my head
If you can´t come up with a better reason
Use the one I had

By myself and in the darkness
I can hear the trouble flying around
Do you like it when I tell you
I will stay here call me I am the one

This is not the time and not the season
Get out of my head
If you can´t come up with a better reason
Use the one I had

Leave me now
Ease the grind
There is no hole
You may find

Take a hike and never stop
Just keep on walking
I don´t want you around
One day you will understand
The call I made and tell me I got it right


This is not the time and not the season
Get out of my head
If you can´t come up with a better reason
Use the one I had

Leave me now
Ease the grind
There is no hole
You may find

I want to specify
Please
I want to justify my needs
I want the fortified juice
I want to simplify
I will break you
