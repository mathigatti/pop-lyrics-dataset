Swizz beats, ladies and gentlemen (come on, come on, come on)
Ladies and gentlemen (Mariah, Mariah)
Ladies and gentlemen
As we go a little somethin' like this
Hit it!

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

It was a summers day
When walking by
She didn't notice as
As you turned and you discreetly winked your eye
And I remember you from back in the day
You were the boy I couldn't breathe without
The one that got away

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby (secret love)

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby (you're not mine)

Oh, now that I found you, I cannot let you go
You know I got my man at home
But baby, I still need you so
And I know you ain't never leaving that girl
But everytime you touch me, baby, it feels so incredible

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby (oh baby)
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby (you and me)

Oh baby, oh baby (oh baby)
Come give it to me now, baby (come on and give it to me, boy)
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

Breakdown

Secret lovers, yeah

You and me, you and me, you and me, baby

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us (keep it on the hush)
You and me got a secret love, baby

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush (but keep it)
You're not mine got a secret love, baby

Baby, baby, baby
Come give it to me, baby
We got a secret love, darling
Keep it between us, baby
