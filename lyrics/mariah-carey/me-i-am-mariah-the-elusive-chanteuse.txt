On the back cover of this album is a personal treasure
This is my first and only self-portrait
I drew it when I was three and a half and entitled it, "Me, I am Mariah"
Please, don't judge me for such a simplistic title
Come on, I was only three and a half


It was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself
With the purity of a child's heart before it was ever broken
I've kept this drawing private for so long
But because this album is a reflection of some of the peaks and valleys that have made me who I am today
I've decided to share it with those of you who actually care
And have been here for me through it all
I've been through a lot but I've always known me
I am Mariah

Along the way there have been a couple of nicknames
And I've inadvertently embodied many personas
Lately, they've been calling me, "The Elusive Chanteuse"
