Mine
Mine
Mine
You're mine


I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself dying for your touch
Spring time eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up
You're mine

You make me feel
Like love would never end
How can I forget?
Baby, we were the best
Suffered dreams of you all through the night
And, baby, I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

I can't seem to give you up
You're mine
I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

Summer days and summer nights
When I felt you in my arms
Didn't I want you badly?
Wanted to let you have me

Autumn days and stormy nights
When you crush me with your charms
Didn't I need you madly?
Now, I'm lying here, falling apart

I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself dying for your touch
Spring time eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up
You're mine

Boy, you make me feel
Like love would never end
How can I forget?
Baby, we were the best
I suffer dreams of you all through the night
And, baby, I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

I can't seem to give you up
You're mine
I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

Oh
You make me feel
Like love would never end
Tell me, how can I forget that?
My baby, we were the best
I suffer in dreams of you all through the night
And, baby, I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

I can't seem to give you up
You're mine
I can't seem to give you up
You're mine
