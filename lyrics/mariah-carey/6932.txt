Close to me
Oh I need you close to me
Loving me
Close to you
How can I get close to you
Help me to


[Refrão]
Why can't you see
I would give the world away
To have you by my side
I'm so in need
Each and every night I pray
You'll come and save my life
I would love you
Till the end of time

I think of you
Every moment I go through
Thoughts of you
I dream of you
All I have are so many dreams of you
Won't you please come true
Why can't you see
I would give the world away
To have you by my side
Oh I'm so in need
Each and every night I pray
You'll come and save my life
I would love you
Till the end of time

Tell me what you need
Let me give you all of me
Without you nothing's real
You're the reason that I feel

Tell me what you need
Let me give you everything
Every moment I'm alive
Until the end of time

[Refrão]

I would love you till the end of time
