Lullaby
Lullaby


I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

Hey boy, what's going on?
Thanks, I'm doing okay
Don't believe rumours, hey
How's your family?
Please say hello for me
Guess we've both grown up a bit
But I have to admit
It really still feels good
Here by your side
Sitting right next to you
Just like I used to do
You know we can't deny
No one else in our lives
Holds a candle to you and I

I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(So I guess I'll come with you home)
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

So here we are again
All by ourselves
So familiar you know
That it actually almost feels like deja vu
Of that night on the roof
We kissed under the sky amid city lights
A sudden flashback to so long ago
In the dark all alone
With our bodies this close
Guess some things never change
Cause I still melt away
When you touch me
And say my name

I should just hug you goodbye
(Baby I)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(So I guess)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(I'll come and love you to sleep)
And we can revisit us one more time
(Paradise, for a while, by your side)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
(Lullaby)

I should just hug you goodbye
(See I know I should)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(But boy, you just look so good)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(So I'll sing that song you like to hear me sing as we revisit us)
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

Still feels, feels good

(Lullaby)
I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(I can't walk away from paradise)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(So I'll take you home and sing to you baby)
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
(Thought I know that I should just)

I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(I can't cause you)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(You and I both know)
And we can revisit us one more time
(Nobody else in our lives holds a candle to you and I)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
(Shhh! So hush, pretty baby)

I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(It's just me and you)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(As we relive the splendor of you and I)
And we can revisit us one more time
(I'm gonna sing our sweet lullaby)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
