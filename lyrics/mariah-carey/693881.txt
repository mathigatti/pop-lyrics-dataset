[Mariah Carey] (JD)
I am thinking of you (That's right)
In my sleepless solitude tonight (Yeah)
If it's wrong to love you (I like that)
Then my heart just won't let me be right
Cause I've drowned in you (Uh huh)
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side (Oh yeah)

[2:]
I'd give my all
To have just one more night with you
I'd risk my life
To feel your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all
For your love tonight
[JD]
MC come on

[Mariah (JD)]
Your loving arms (Uh)
Around me boy (Yeah)
And like that was a cuddling talk (That's right)
And a feel that won't
I feel damn great
And won't let go, ooowwohhh
Cause that could be no sadder (No)
Sight to see
Than if we were to miss (Uh huh)
This opportunity (So what)
So send me up a signal and I'll catch the light (Yeah)
If there's no time (Uh huh)
You know it's up to you (Uh huh, yeah)
So, won't you...

[3:]
Stay a night, child
Stay a little while, child
Stay a night, child
Stay a night, child

[JD]
And let's take it Uptown, beat it down

[Peter Gunz (JD)]
Since you put it that way, honey, I'm gon' stay (Yeah)
And only your love can make Peter parley (Uh)
Let the limo leave and cancel the flight
And I, only will I stay, girl I'm spendin' the night (Uh huh)
And if it's right, I'm spendin' my life, or album
If it seems like I'm rushin' then I'll sleep on the couch
MC it's your call, I'm ready to ball
And if you need me, I'm ready to brawl (Uh huh, uh huh)

[Lord Tariq (JD)]
And that's forever by law, together we ball, we taking it all
I'll make you feel a way a woman never felt before
I see women on many levels, never higher than yours
With a body like that, that face, no flaw
You got to be havin sense, saying you's a dime
You off to meet her in a seven and you like the way I rhyme
Yes I shine, I'm a veteran
Picture me and honey spendin' money like whatever then (Ha ha ha)
We both got it

[Repeat 3]
[JD]
Come on
Sing along
Yeah
Ha ha, c'mon

[Mariah Carey:]
Ain't no need (Uh, uh huh)
To act surprised (Say what)
Cause that's a move that's not so right
So let's push love to the limit (Uh huh)
And life to the edge
I only want to lust again (Understand)
Sing the whole world

[Repeat 1 &amp; 2: w/o JD]
