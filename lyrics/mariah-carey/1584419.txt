I am a dream just beginning
Truth is I prayed then you open my eyes
And you revealed something to me
Suddenly I am no longer confined


To a life that's defined by limits
I don't need no permission to live it
I'm a break through the door 'til I get in
Everything that I got I'm a give it
One hundred percent
And I ain't stopping 'til I reach the finish

I'm a believer not just a dreamer
I'm giving everything I got
I'm a go getter, one hundred percenter
Undoubtedly I can reach the top
And I ain't gonna let nothing discourage or dissuade me
Cause I'm walking out of here a champion either way babe
I am giving one hundred percent
So go on put your ones up

If you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up
If you know that this is something, put your ones up, ones up
If you really comprehend this put your ones up, your ones up
If you're walking into victory keep on shining
One hundred percent

You can only do it if you do it like I did
Cause suffering ain't easy but
If you can turn your wounds into living proof
That you've survived the fight and you no longer defined

To a life that's defined by limits
I don't need no permission to live it
I'm a break through the door 'til I get in
Everything that I got I'm a give it
One hundred percent
And I ain't stopping 'til I reach the finish, oh

I'm a believer not just a dreamer
I'm giving everything I got
I'm a go getter, one hundred percenter
Undoubtedly I can reach the top
And I ain't gonna let nothing discourage or dissuade me
(Nothing can discourage me, oh)
Cause I'm walking out of here a champion either way babe (hey)
I am giving one hundred percent (hey)
So go on put your ones up

(Hey) if you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up (put your ones up)
If you know that this is something, put your ones up, ones up (everybody)

If you're walking into victory keep on shining (one hundred)
One hundred percent

Stop
