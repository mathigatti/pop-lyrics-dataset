There will be mountains that I'll have to climb
And there will be battles that I'll have to fight
But victory or defeat is up to me to decide
But how can I expect to win if I never try?


I just can't give up now
Come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me

Never said there wouldn't be trials
Never said I wouldn't fall
Never said that everything would go
The way I wanted to go
But when my back is against the wall
And I feel all hope is gone
I'll just lift my head up to the sky and say
"help me to be strong"

I just can't give up now
Come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me
No, You didn't bring me out here to leave me lonely
Even when I can't see clearly
I know that You are with me so I can't give up

I just can't give up now
Come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me
I won't feel no ways tired
I don't believe He's brought me this far
