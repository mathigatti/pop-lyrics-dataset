I know I hurt you so 
The night you heard 
My true confession, boy 
I had to let you know 
I spent the night 
Of guilty passion, so 


I called to say 
There'll never be another 
To take your place, no 
Now I pray 
That you'll put an end to 
These tears of shame 
Rolling down my face 

Chorus: 
I have the strength of heart 
But a weakness of the body 
It tore our love apart 
Now I'm feeling 
Sad and lonely 
I have the strength of heart 
But a weakness of the body 
How can I make it right 
I gotta have you 
Here with me tonight 
(Weakness of the body) 

It didn't mean a thing 
I guess I needed 
To prove my love was true 
I had to feel the sting, mm 
Of a night in another's arms 
Away from you, whoa 

Now I'm lying 
Staring at the ceiling 
Counting my pain, oh 
Now I'm crying 
I've turned 
Our days of sunshine 
Into these days 
And nights of rain 

I have the strength of heart 
But a weakness of the body 
It tore our love apart 
Now I'm feeling 
Sad and lonely 
I have the strength of heart 
But a weakness of the body 
How can I make it right 
I gotta have you 
Here with me tonight 
(Weakness of the body) 

Gotta have your love 
No, no, no 
(Weakness of the body) 

(Fala:) 
Every morning I wake up 
And remember you're gone 
I look in the mirror 
And ask myself 
Why did I do so wrong? 
Now I feel the love 
That burns 
So hot inside me 
Just trust me 
One more time 
And I promise 
To make you happy 

I called to say 
There'll never be another 
To take your place, oh 
Now I pray 
That you'll put an end to 
These tears of shame 
Rolling down my face 

I have the strength of heart 
But a weakness of the body 
It tore our love apart 
Now I'm feeling 
Sad and lonely 
I have the strength of heart 
But a weakness of the body 
How can I make it right 
I gotta have you 
Here with me tonight 
(Weakness of the body) 

I have the strength of heart 
But a weakness of the body 
It tore our love apart 
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely 
I have the strength of heart 
But a weakness of the body 
How can I make it right 
I gotta have you, yeah 

I have the strength of heart 
(But a weakness of the body) 
It tore our love apart 
Now I'm feeling 
Sad and lonely 
I have the strength of heart 
But a weakness of the body, oh 
How can I make it right 
I gotta have you 
Got to, got to 
Oh, oh 
(Weakness of the body)
