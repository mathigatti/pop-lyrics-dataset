Chorus 
Oh damn 
The club 'bout to close in a minute 
Can I get your number baby 
So you and I can go get in it 
Let me come and pick you up 
And go take you out 
Can I get your number baby 
So I can show you what I'm all about 
What I'm all about 
Damn 


Verse 1 
I've been checkin' you out 
And I noticed that you ain't just one of the crowd 
So tell me won't you 
Come on and see about me baby 
I've got the Crys on ice and I'm 'bout to get nice 
Up in VIP with all my ladies 
Tell me how many times in your life 
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight 
Tell me a little somethin' about you 
Here's a little somethin' about me 
I got a house in Capri and my own G4 
And that Benz with the doors that life up from the floor 

Chorus 1 
Oh damn 
The club 'bout to close in a minute 
Can I get your number baby 
So you and I can go get in it 
Let me come and pick you up 
And go take you out 
Can I get your number baby 
So I can show you what I'm all about 
What I'm all about 
Damn 

Verse 2 
Now that you're sitting next to me 
I bet you're wondering 
What my intentions are for you 
And I to get into 
Baby I just wanna 
Hug and kiss and love ya 
Look into my eyes baby don't be shy 
Is it yes or no 
We ain't got all night 
Tell me how many times in your life 
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight 
Tell me a little somethin' about you 
Here's a little somethin' about me 
I gotta PIP penthouse with a sick hot tub 
We can watch the flat screen 
While the bubbles fill it up 

Chorus 2 
Oh damn 
The club 'bout to close in a minute 
Can I get your number baby 
So you and I can go get in it 
Let me come and pick you up 
And go take you out 
Can I get your number baby 
So I can show you what I'm all about 
What I'm all about 
Damn
