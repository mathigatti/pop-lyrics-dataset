The fire is burning
The room´s all aglow
Outside the December wind blows
Away in the distance the carolers sing in the snow
Everybody´s laughing
The world is celebrating
And everyone´s so happy
Except for me tonight 
Because I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can´t get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I´m all right
But then I miss you, most at Christmas time 


I gaze out the window
This cold winter´s night
At all of the twinkling lights
Alone in the darkness
Remembering when you were mine
Everybody´s smiling
The whole world is rejoicing
And everyone´s embracing
Except for you and I 

Baby I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can´t get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I´m all right
But then I miss you, most at Christmas time 

In the springtime those memories start to fade
With the April rain
Through the summer days
Till autumn´s leaves are gone
I get by without you
Till the snow begins to fall 

And then I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can´t get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I´m all right...
But then I miss you, most at Christmas time
