Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Hum, baby, I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind


But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy, baby (sweet)
When I close my eyes (oh)
You come and take me (yeah)
On and on and on
I'm so deep in my daydreams (so deep)
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy, baby (sweet, sweet fantasy)

Yeah
And I want you, oh
Oh, baby
Oh, yeah yeah

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going through my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy, baby (yeah, baby)
When I close my eyes
You come and take me (oh yeah)
On and on and on
I'm so deep in my daydreams (so deep, so deep)
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy, baby (sweet fantasy)

Oh, baby
(Oh, oh, it's just the sweet)  sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me (oh)
On and on and on
I'm so deep in my daydreams (so deep, baby)
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy, baby (fantasy)

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My lovely boyfriend (on and on and on)
There's no beginning and theres no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but Im not sleeping

(Oh, oh, it's just the sweet) sweet fantasy, baby (yeah, baby)
When I close my eyes (yeah)
You come and take me (oh yeah)
On and on and on
I'm so deep in my daydreams (so, so deep)
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy, baby (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Sweet sweet fantasy, baby (baby)
When I close my eyes
You come and take me (oh yeah, yeah)
On and on and on
I'm so deep in my daydreams (touch me baby, you drive me crazy)
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy, baby (you tell me baby, come and take me)

Sweet sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet sweet fantasy, baby (fantasy)
