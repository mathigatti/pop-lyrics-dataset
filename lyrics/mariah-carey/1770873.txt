Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of year


Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share

Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

Christmas time is here
We'll drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
