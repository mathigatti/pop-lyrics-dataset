Yes sir MC
With the remix
Of the American dream
You know me
Oh, yeah, oh yeah
Oh, yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah
(We everywhere)
Oh, yeah, oh yeah
Oh, yeah, oh yeah


I know that you've been
Waiting for it
I'm waiting too
In my imagination
I'd be all up on you
I know you got
That fever for me
Hundred and two
And boy
I know I feel the same
My temperature's
Through the roof

If there's
A camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me
When I do (I do)
If there's
A camera up in here
Then I'd best
Not catch this flick
On You Tube (You Tube)
'Cause if you run
Your mouth and brag
About this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause baby
I'm up in my business
Like a Wendy interview
But this is private
Between you and I

Touch my body
Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more
Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
Like you never did
Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist
Just a little taste
Touch my body
Know you love my curves
Come on and give me
What I deserve
And touch my body

I'll give you
What you deserve
The haters given' you words
That you really
Don't like hearing and they
Get on your nerves
But, I be the one
At the end of the week
Making' you moan
When we alone
To make you shake
When you speak
Your blazing physique
Just makes them haters hate
And they freak about
How you own love
And how
You make it with me but
I know you sick
I know you tired
I know you sick
Of being sick and tired
And I be here
I bring that fire
I'm bringing that heat
When I'm with Mariah
If there's
A camera up in here
Then it's gonna come leave
With me when I do (I Do)
'Cause I got
Too many damn videos
All up on my account
On You tube (You tube)
'Cause if you run your mouth
And shit Mariah say
What I'ma do
(I will hunt you down)
But I love just kissing
Hugging, loving
Rubbing up on you
'Cause you fantastic
And you a bad chick

Oh yes indeed
It's the American dream
When I touch yo
Work yo, taste yo body
I want you to do to my
Get up on my
Sit up on my body
If there's a camera (huh)
It might leave
When I do when (I do)
If there's
A camera in here (huh)
Upload that right up
To You Tube (You Tube)
I'm just playing
Yea MC
Tell what to say
When they thought of me
And you the tabloids
Calling us out
And how can I deny it
When up in here
With you your amazing baby
When you say

Touch my body
Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more
Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
Like you never did
Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist
Just a little taste
Touch my body
Know you love my curves
Come on and give me
What I deserve
And touch my body

I'm a treat you
Like a teddy bear
You won't wanna go nowhere
In the lap of luxury
Baby just turn to me
You won't want
For nothing boy
I will give you plenty
Touch my body

Touch my body
Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more
Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
Like you never did
Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist
Just a little taste
Touch my body
Know you love my curves
Come on and give me
What I deserve
And touch my body

Oh, yeah
Oh yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Touch my body
