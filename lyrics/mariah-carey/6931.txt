If We

Yeah
(I never thought) Who would've thought baby?
(That I'd be) Missin' you baby
(Without you) I need you baby
(Why me?) Why me?
(I never thought) Who would've thought baby?
(That I'd be) Missin' you baby
(Without you) I need you baby
(Why me?) Why me?


Love, I want your body next to me
On me actually, off that ecstacy
Reminiscing how we used to smoke and freak
[Fuck] then fall asleep, rockin' for a week
Now be barely even talk or walk the block
Kiss and cuddle up, girl we're losing touch
What's a man to do but go crazy babe?
I know you're mad but you don't really hate me babe
It's deeper than that, that

Baby if we got together again
Suga, I would be your very best friend (I'd be your very bestfriend)
I would love you unconditionally
You would never wanna let me go baby
I promise I would be by your side
Give you everything you need to get by (You need to get by)
And my broken heart would finally mend
Darlin' if we got together again (Baby if we got togetheragain)

Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend
What if I had the chance to do it all again?
Sometimes for happiness, we hesitate
Just like the game, I hear that love won't wait
What if I had another best friend? (Had another best friend)
What if I had someone on who I could depend? (Me...)
Someone who makes me feel like you used to
Tell me babe, what would you do? (Would you do...)

Baby if we got together again (Oh...)
Suga, I would be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally (I...)
You would never wanna let me go, baby (Never)
I promise I would be by your side (I promise I would be)
Give you everything you need to get by
And my broken heart would finally mend
Darlin' if we got together again (Oh...)

Baby if we got together again (Who would've thought baby?)

I promise I would be by your side (Who would've thought baby?)
(Right by your side) Give you everything you need to get by(Missin' you baby)
And my broken heart would finally mend (I need you baby)
Baby if we got together again (Why me?)

Why would you wanna go
Through the pain of loving another man?
The truth is nobody can love you like I can
It's a damn shame we can't get along
We used to get it on, where did it all go wrong?
I admit, the flesh is weak, but the game is strong
You go my way, your way baby, we're moving on
It's true, I'm gonn' miss you
Who would have thought I'd be without you, uh?

(I never thought) Baby, there's nothing to lose
(That I'd be) You know my soul's so cold
(Without you) And my love is pain
(Why me?) Baby one more time
(I never thought) My baby
(That I'd be) Pride and joy
(Without you) I'mma make you mine
(Why me?) Ja Rule
