Guess mine
Is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you


You know
I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
(Both)
But baby can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's no where to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm outta my head
hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you (you)
Hopelessly devoted to you
Whoo
