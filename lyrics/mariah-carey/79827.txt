When you get caught in the rain with no where to run
When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes and you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, what you say is 
I can make it through the rain 
I can stand up once again on my own 
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith 
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain 
And if you keep falling down don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly 
And you'll find what you need to prevail 
What you say is 
I can make it through the rain 
I can stand up once again on my own 
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith 
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain 
And when the rain blows, as shadows grow close don't be afraid
There's nothing you can't face 
And should they tell you you'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say-ay-yeah-yeah-hey-ey-yeah 
I can make it through the rain 
I can stand up once again on my own 
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith 
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain 
I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I live one more day 
And I can make it through the rain
(Yes you can) 
You're gonna make it through the rain
