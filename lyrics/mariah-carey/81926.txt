Said Jermaine likes it, and I like it
You know I'm really missing you baby
You know I'm really missing you baby
You know I'm really missing you baby
Baby baby I'm missing you


Longing for you everyday
And I reach for you every night
Baby nothing's been the same
Since the day we said good-bye
And I can't go on
Like this for too long
Baby, baby, I'm missing you

Boy I need you next to me
And I'm hungering for your touch
Caught up in the memories
And you're all I'm thinking of
Cause I can't get past
What we used to have
Baby, baby, I'm missing you

I'm talkin' bout how I used to like it
When you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me
And those beautiful things
Baby won't you come cause
I'm really in need
I'm lost in your love
And I don't know what to do with myself
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I just think about you
Think about us
Think about how much
I miss you

All I do is reminisce
Of the love that we used to share
Can't recover from your kiss
Because nothing else compares
Ain't no substitute
When it comes to you
Baby baby I'm missing you

Visions of us hand in hand
Come to me when I close my eyes
Baby I don't understand
How we let it all slip by
Tell me can we try
Baby one more time
Baby baby I miss you

I'm talkin' bout how I used to like it
When you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me
And those beautiful things
Baby won't you come cause
I'm really in need
I'm lost in your love
And I don't know what to do with myself
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I just think about you
Think about us
Think about how much
I miss you

Remember when
Our eyes first met
I knew I'd never be the same again
Why can't it just
Be like it was
Enough is enough
Ja-da-muah

Uh, uh huh
Yo, I remember when I first kicked it to you
We hit it off well, then I used to whisper to you
It was all swell
Said you came from a family with money
Me, I was fresh off the block handling twenties
When I smile was you open or what (uh huh, yeah)
Say you can't judge a book by the cover 'til you open it up
Past hot, we was more like lava-ble (uh huh)
Used to chill and the smoke didn't bother you
Beauty of a rose, scent of a flower
Love when I tell her to, get in the shower, hit it for hours (wooo)
When I thought you was able to cope
That's where things fell apart ma, then it stagnated us both
And now the pain is killing you crazy
While all the time in your mind, you knew I was feeling you crazy
But Kiss is official boo and I'mma come clean
You miss me, well I miss you too, come on

I'm talkin' bout how I used to like it
When you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me
And those beautiful things
Baby won't you come cause
I'm really in need
I'm lost in your love
And I don't know what to do with myself
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I just think about you
Think about us
Think about how much
I miss you
