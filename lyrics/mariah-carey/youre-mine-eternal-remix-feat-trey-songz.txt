You made me feel
Our love would never end
How can I forget
Baby, we were the best
I suffer dreams of you all through the night
Baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine


Oh, you got me feelin' some type of way
Ain't no you without me, hope you feel the same
'Cause if there's no you, there's no me
Ain't no us, ain't no we
That just can't be, don't you see
Mariah, Trigga in Miami

I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself, dying for your touch
Springtime eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up, you're mine

You made me feel
Our love would never end
How can I forget
Baby, we were the best
Suffered dreams of you all through the night
Baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine

I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mine

Summer days and summer nights
When I felt you in my arms
Didn't I want to badly
Wanted to let you have me
Autumn days and stormy nights
When you crushed me with your charms
Didn't I need you madly
Now I'm lying here falling apart

I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself, dying for your touch
Springtime eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up, you're mine

You made me feel
Our love would never end
How can I forget
Baby, we were the best
Suffered dreams of you all through the night
I suffer dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine

It's Valentine's day and I'm feeling this way
Man I really just hope I don't kill myself
Stop all this sh*t that you talkin'
You talkin', you talkin' like you did find somebody else
Stop that, stop that
Girl don't you know that it's mine
I might just need to remind
Slide up in there from behind
Oh, you got me feelin' some type of way
Ain't no you without me, hope you feel the same
'Cause if there's no you, there's no me
Ain't no us, ain't no we
That just can't be, don't you see
Mariah, Trigga in Miami

You made me feel
Like love would never end
Tell me how can I forget that
My baby, we were the best
I suffer dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine

I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
