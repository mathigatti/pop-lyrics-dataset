Come closer
You seem so far away
There's something I know you need to say
I feel your emotions
When I look in your eyes


Your silence
Whispering misunderstandings
There's so much you need to realize
You'll feel my emotions
If you look in my eyes

Hey darlin'
I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby it's all in your mind
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby it's all in your mind

Believe me
I believe in you
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do
Move closer my darling
Feel the love in my eyes

Hey darlin'
I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby it's all in your mind
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby it's all in your mind

I know you feel my love
In your mind

Hey darlin'
I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby it's all in your mind
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby it's all in your mind

Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
Got to let you know baby
Baby it's all in your mind
You know my love is good now baby
Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
Yeah darling!
Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
