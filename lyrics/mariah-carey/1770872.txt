Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down
Santa Claus Lane


Vixen, Blitzen
And all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing
Children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings
With Christmas cheer
Ho, ho, ho
Who wouldn't go
Ho, ho, ho
Up on the housetop
clik,click,click
Cause santa claus
Comes tonighy

So gather round, gather round

Oh tonight becomes the day

So gather round, gather round

We're gonna have a good time, celebrate

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down
Santa Claus Lane

Vixen, Blitzen
And all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing
Children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings
With Christmas cheer
Cause santa claus
Comes tonighy

Santa claus is comming tonight
