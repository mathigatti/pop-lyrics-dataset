Whitney:
Many nights we prayed, with no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song, we barely understood
Now we are not afraid, although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long, before we knew we could


Chorus:
There can be miracles, when you believe
Though hope is frail, It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles, you can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

Mariah:
In this time of fear, when prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds, too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here, my heart so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words, I'd never thought I'd say

Chorus:
There can be miracles, When you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail, It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles, You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

Bridge: (Both)
They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fear
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see you way clear through the rain
A small but still resilient voice
Says help is very near

Chorus: (Both)
There can be miracles (miracles)
When you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe
Somehow you will
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
You will when you, you will when you believe
Just believe, just believe
You will when you believe
