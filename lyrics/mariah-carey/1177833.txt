Keep it movin', bounce, hey
Keep it movin', bounce, hey
Keep it movin', bounce, hey


Once again nothin' jumpin' up in your place
Sick of your berry buzzin' all in my face
Way too much to tolerate, time to roll
Y'all know I gots to migrate
Speed dial connecting me to Rae Rae "Hey"
Click in Shawntae and Mae Mae "Hey"
"Treat It As a Holiday" 'cause he's a wrap
Y'all know I had to migrate

So I'm on my way home
'Cause my jeans, yeah, they fit, but it might benefit
Me to throw something on
To feature my hips accentuate my ^!^$
And steal the show

Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "Yo"
Tryin' to get us goin' off the Patrón
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If your neck and your wrist coordinate
Hair braided or faded, okay...
We can move this back to my place
It's time to migrate

From my car into the club, we migrate
From the bar to V.I.P, we migrate
From the party to the after party, migrate
After party to hotel, migrate

As we proceed gettin' buzzed the envious ones
Hatin' but they can't take they eyes off us
But we don't see none of that
They playin' my jam and the floor is packed
So ya'll need to migrate up out the door
We clickin' glasses compliments of the club
We raise they status so you know they show us love
Everywhere we go, they gon' flock
Them boys migrate to where it's hot, it's hot, it's hot

Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "Yo"
Tryin' to get us goin' off the Patrón
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If you're inked up thuggin' that swag I like
Face body and Lamborghini outside
Obviously, boy, you're qualified
Otherwise, migrate, bye

From my car into the club, we migrate
From the bar to V.I.P, we migrate
From the party to the after party, migrate
After party to hotel, migrate

[T-Pain Rap]
This is where it begins and ends at the very same time, I'm
Teddy Pain, the main man of the hour
Got a flow that'll flex your tire
Got stacks, plus I'm back with Mariah
We stay down like four flats on a Cadillac
Back to the back, we fall flat, girl
If you feel like doing a dance
I'm gonna pull up my pants, c'mon back, girl
But I gotta migrate to bar
From the bar to the floor
From the floor to the car
From the car to the crib
Then back to the club
Or we can migrate it all night and mini coupe sittin' on dubs
Whatcha waitin' on?
I can't stand in one place, I'm on a Platinum Patrón
And I hate when I don't get it my way
So don't wait for me to buy drinks or you gon' dehydrate
It's time to migrate, yeah

Soon as I walk through the door
They know I'm from the 8-5-0
I need three bottles of that Patrón
I can make the Chevrolet grease up slow
If your ^|^$ and your ^|^$ coordinate
Shawty, show it like it ain't OK
We can move this back to my place
Shawty, best believe, it's time to migrate

Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "Yo"
Tryin' to get us goin' off the Patrón
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If you're inked up thuggin' that swag I like
Face body and Lamborghini outside
Obviously, boy, you're qualified
Otherwise, migrate, bye

Keep it movin', bounce, hey
Keep it movin', bounce, hey
Keep it movin', bounce, hey
Keep it movin', bounce, hey
