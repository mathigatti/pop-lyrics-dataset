Once I was a prisoner
Lost inside myself
With the world surrounding me
Wandering through the mysery
But but now I am free


You gave me a breath of life
Unclouded my eyes
With a sweet serenity
Lighting a ray of hope for me
And now I am free

Free to live
Free to laugh
Free to soar
Free to shine
Free to give
Free to love
Free enough to fly

Once I was all so alone
Unsteady and cold
but your love rained down upon me
Washing away uncertainty

But now
I am free
