Uhh haa ooh
Doodoodoo
Doodoodoo


I wonder if you think of me
Somewhere in the shadows of your mind, ooh
Although our love could never be
I found I think about you all the time, ooh baby

Am I in your fantasies
The way you always wander into mine, ooh
Are you longing endlessly
Just like me deep inside

Oh baby baby
When the nights are dark and cold
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
And when you're lying all alone
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
When you feel the touch of another love
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
Am I the one you're dreaming of
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)

Uuuuuh
I picture you embracing me
We drift away and leave the world behind, baby
But it's only make-believe
Love can be
So unkind

Oh baby baby baby
When the nights are dark and cold
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
When you're lying all alone
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
When you feel the touch of another love
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
Am I the one you're dreaming of
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)

Oh
Hey
Tell me baby (tell me baby)
'Cause I need you, baby ('cause I need you, baby)
Really love you baby
Oh
Hey

And ooooh
When the nights are dark and cold
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
And when you're lying all alone
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
When you feel the touch of another love
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
Am I the one you're dreaming of
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)

When the nights are dark and cold
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
And when you're lying all alone, baby
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
When you feel the touch of another love
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)
Am I the one you're dreaming of
(Do you think of me, do you think of me)

'Cause I think about you, baby
I'm lying here alone yeah
I think of you, yes I do
