You look at me and see the girl
Who lives inside the golden world
But don't believe
That's all there is to see
You'll never know the real
Me


She smiles through a thousand tears
And harbors adolescent fears
She dreams of all
That she can never be
She wades in insecurity
And hides herself inside of me

Don't say she takes it all for granted
I'm well aware of all I have
Don't think that I'm disenchanted
Please understand

It seems as though I've always been
Somebody outside looking in
Well here I'am
For all of them to bleed
But they can't take my heart from me
And they can't bring me to my knees
They'll never know the real me
