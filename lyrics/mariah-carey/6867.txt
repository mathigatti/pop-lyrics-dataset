You look into my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy but
You still can touch my heart


And after all this time
You'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type

If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll be holding it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No no no no no no
I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together
If we believe that true love
Never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
Oh, baby, yeah, yeah
I had a dream
You and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
(Uh, baby I do)
Someday you and me
Just give me one more try
And love again
I had a dream
(I miss your love)
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
