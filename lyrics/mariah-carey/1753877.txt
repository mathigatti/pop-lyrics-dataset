Oh Santa
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa


Santa
If you get this letter
Won't you help me out
I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how
You do the things you do while I sleep on Christmas eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this burn inside
And I just can't take it

I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night

Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night

Oh Santa
I heard that it's really gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and them all the 8 reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up
And scoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
Make this Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on oh Kris Kringle send me help

They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night

Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa

Oh Santa Claus
If you get this letter
Please don't make me wait
Cause all December I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies

The trees all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas

Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
