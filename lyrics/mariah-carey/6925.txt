I want him (x4)
I need him (x4)
I love him (x8)


Ludacris:
Is it the glitter on her breast or the gloss on her lips
Hickeys on the chest or the toss of the hips
I'm lost in the mix, so I floss in the sea
Turning out the hits...

Shawna:
It's the mo' maker, dough chaser
Now get it right, would ya, heartbreaker
I keep it tight but I'm no faker
You can laugh now but you'll cry later

Ludacris:
I think I like you in ya freak clothes, freak those
In my specialized peep shows
And then I'll make ya touch ya knees to ya elbows
Toes, girl from the street of Melrose

Shawna:
It's clear to see I like it when we smoke that
Choke that, I'll freak that (No doubt)
You kind of got me like in a freeze when you roll out
You got itchy balls from where I blow that

Mariah:
I got myself a lover
Who knows what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
When my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we're going
It's delirium time

He's all mine
And his loving gets me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Chorus:
Loverboy
Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy
Come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
So come on sugar daddy
Take me for a ride
Whatever way we're going
It's delirium time

I get weak
And his candy's just so sweet
He caressed my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Chorus x2

22:
Come on, yeah, well I'm kind of innocent
A vision of lover, you adore me
Even though my image is thug

Da Brat:
What I see in you is for my eyes only to see
I bring out the freak in you, up and down on me
I'm your lovergirl

22:
Me your loverboy
But when we roam alone We come touch toys
Making noise
We can't avoid

Da Brat:
The way I throw that, can't pop
Backdrop, stopwatch, Brat-tat
Get ya more rock, hard up
All of the things that you wanna do to me
If you wanna we can get obscene
My cream and you're ding-a-ling mingle
Bother me not
When the sensation come out

22:
I'll make you scream "Uh huh uh huh baby"
Feel me When I pump the pump lady
Behind me we can be close like family
You're so sweet you taste like all types of candy
Starburst to jellybeans

Da Brat:
Banana split my dairy queen
Butterfinger my tangerines
Chickens only taste my Loverboy in they dreams
All my ladies et me hear you scream
Hate on me much as you want to
You can't do What the fuck I do
Bitches be emulating me daily
Hate on me much as you want to
You can't be Who the fuck I be
Bitches be imitating me lately

Mariah:
Loverboy
Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy
Come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

Chorus x3 with ad libs
