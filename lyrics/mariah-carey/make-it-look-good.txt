Ok
You make me wanna say
Yeah, yeah
Oh boy you make me say


Something about you makes every girl high
Suffering without you
I just want a taste of what you got
But my mama always told me not to

Play with those players who play you til there’s no more
Game left to be played
Look at what you got me going through
Can’t help myself

Boy you make it look good (make it look good)
Say you make it look good (make it look gooder than them other fools)
Around you I know I ain’t supposed to be
Acting like I know you notice me
Fantasize about the way you lick your lips
Fingertips on my hips as we dip
Oh, boy you make it look good (make it look gooder than them other fools)

Baby, baby, sometimes, I need you
But I feel so shy
Suffering, can’t leave you
Cause them other girls are gonna try
Guess their mama never told them not to

Play with those players who play you til there’s no more
Game left to be played
Look at what you got me going through
Can’t help myself

Because you make it look good (make it look good)
Said you make it look good (make it look gooder than them other fools)
Around you I know I ain’t supposed to be
Acting like I know you notice me
Fantasize about the way you lick your lips
Fingertips on my hips as we dip
Oh, boy, you make it look good (make it look gooder than them other fools)

Ooh boy
Make me go high
Oh boy you make me say
Ooh, ooh boy you
My mama said don’t play with them players
No, no
Look at what you got me going through
Fantasize about the way you lick your lips
Oh, it’s gooder than them other boys
Yes, it is
