Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?


For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne

Ten, nine, eight
Seven, six, five
Four, three, two, one

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne

Eh, oh ehh
Eh, ehh ehh
Happy New Year, baby
Eh, oh

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?

Does anybody really know the words?
Might as well sing along

Happy New Year, baby (oh)
Happy New Year, baby

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?

Happy New Year to you and your friends
And have a drink on me
Happy New Year to you, too
And have a drink on me

Ten, nine, eight
Seven, six, five
Four, three, two, one
Happy New Year
