If you cut, I will bleed, bring me down to my knees
You make me feel what I am is never good enough
Can you help me understand, thought I made you a better man
I guess somehow along the way, things just change


It seems just like a distant memory
That you used to be good for me
But, baby, now it's clear

I give you take, somehow it's gonna break
I pray for the strength, I hate to say
I know we can't go on this way
I give you take, I know we're gonna break
And it hurts my soul, I hate to say
We can't go on this way

With your words you pull me in, I always lose I just can't win
And though I see my heart is blind, it gives in every time
You've got me on constant repeat, I need a cure or a remedy
'cause if I stay there won't be, nothing left for me...

Now there's nothing left for us to save 'cause only bitterness remains
What we have is like a house of cards and it's falling apart
And It's impossible to get it back with the bridges that you've burned
I guess it's time to walk away 'cause now it's so clear...
