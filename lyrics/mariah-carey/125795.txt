I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself


I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling, now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me 'If You Think You're Lonely Now'
Wait a minute this is too deep
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
"I only think of you" and it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryin' to keep it together but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element throwing things
Crying tryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

Baby, when you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gon' talk to me 'till the sun comes up?
Who's gon' take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
