I really hope when you hear this song
That you're happy with somebody new
(Happy, na, na, na, na)
Baby, because I found a love I can call my own
And I owe it in part to you


Can't stop now, ha, we can't stop, ha
You can't stop, ha, don't try, ha
Can't stop now, ha, we can't stop, ha
You can't stop, ha, don't try, ha
Can't stop now, ha, we can't stop, ha
You can't stop, ha, don't try, ha
Can't stop now, ha, we can't stop, ha
You can't stop, ha, don't try, ha

Don't you know that you seem just a little crazy?
You had my trust and intimacy
But you threw it away, just threw it away
And now it's all in the past
When I think of you, I just laugh
My friends must have thought
I was high to have given so much
To someone not worth my time

Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do (did I do that?)
You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype
'Til your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool

You were so insecure and your crew was so immature
Conversations painfully weak
You were much better off when you didn't speak
But boy, to tell you the truth
It was my illusion of you
Being somehow destined for me
That had me in a daze
But we're not the same in truth

Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do (did I do that?)
You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype
'Till your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool

I really hope when you hear this song
That you know it was meant for you
(You, you, you, you)
Though your attention span's not that long
Try to do the best you can do!

Can't stop now, ha, we can't stop, ha
You can't stop, ha, don't try, ha
Can't stop now, ha, we can't stop, ha
You can't stop, ha, don't try, ha
Can't stop now, ha, we can't stop, ha
You can't stop, ha, don't try, ha
Can't stop now, ha, we can't stop, ha
You can't stop, ha, don't try, ha

Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
(You, you just lose your mind)
And do things you would never do
(Do the things you'd never do)
(Did I do that?)
You rhapsodize (rhapsodize)
And get caught up in the hype (caught up in the hype)
'Till your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool
Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
(Oh, you can lose your mind)
And do things you would never do
(Do the things, do so stupid things)
(Did I do that?)
You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype (caught up in)
'Till your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool
Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do
(I was such a fool, but I won't be a fool no more)
(Did I do that?)
You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype
'Till your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool
(No, see it ain't my fault)
Funny how sometimes (funny how sometimes)
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do
(I won't be a fool no more)
(Did I do that?)
You rhapsodize
