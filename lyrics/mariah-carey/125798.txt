Verse 1 
Baby baby don't you ever let go 
More and more until we both overflow 
Got a feeling that my heart's never known 
I found love 
Tender kisses and I'm floating on air 
You can have me anytime, anywhere 
When you need me I will always be there 
I found love 


Chorus 1 
And our love goes round and round 
Way up high, a joy ride 
We can touch the stars above 
We found love 
And our love was heaven sent 
From the day we first met 
We've got something they can't touch 
We found love 

Verse 2 
Loving you is like a taste of heaven 
Wanna gaze into your eyes forever 
Run away and spend our lives together 
I've found love 
Baby baby 
All it takes is one touch 
And immediately I feel a rush 
Baby boy, too much is never enough 
I found love 

Chorus 2 
And our love goes round and round 
Way up high, a joy ride 
We can touch the stars above 
We found love 
And our love was heaven sent 
From the day we first met 
We've got something they can't touch 
We found love 

Bridge 
I don't need anything 
When you're here next to me 
Nobody in this whole wide world 
Could ever replace you in my eyes 
We found paradise 
Forever you and I 
Our love goes round and round 
On a joy ride 
(with ya babe, with ya babe, 
with ya babe, with you baby)
