Mah baby
Hey
Hm
Shattered dreams
Cut through my mind
Tragically our love has died
Memories confine my head
Bitterly I face the end
Trustingly
I gave myself to you
I let you inside
Believing your lies


And you don't remember
Every time you told me
You were mine for ever
For eternity
Uhhuh
And you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
How you needed me
How we used to be
In love

Stranded here
In notingness
With only tears
And lonliness
Foolishly
I gave my soul to you
I let you inside
Believing your lies

And you don't remember
Every time you told me
You were mine for ever
For eternity
Uhhuh
And you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
How you needed me
How we used to be
In love
Helplessly
I fell so deep
I was so naive
To let you in
Why did I let you in
To my heart
(And you don't remember)
No
(Anything you told me)
Anything that you told me
(You were mine forever)
You were mine forever
For eternity
Yes you will
And you don't remember
(And you don't remember)
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
Together
How you needed me
How we used to be
In love
Hoooa
