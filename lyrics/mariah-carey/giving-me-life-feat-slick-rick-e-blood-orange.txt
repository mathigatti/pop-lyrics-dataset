Hey, baby, what's happenin'?
How you doin'?
We can make it, baby
Me and you (Me and you)
It wasn't really, wasn't really
It wasn't really much at all
It wasn't really


So, it's summertime, lil splash a wine
And forget about it
If you're so inclined, let's take a ride tonight
So, then maybe if the stars align
We'll fix our minds on another tangent
And it's kinda like impossible to top this at all

Giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Feelin' myself like I'm norma jeane
Here in my arms is where you should be

It wasn't really, it wasn't really much
It wasn't really much at all
It wasn't really, it wasn't really
Wasn't really much at all

Oh, my philosophy
Doesn't quite apply to you and me
But I won't think too much
So, come on and feel my touch
It wasn't really much at all
Just a little sensitivity, yeah that's all
Here in my heart is where you should be
Ooh, you are

Giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Livin' like Babs 'cause it's evergreen
Here in my arms is where you should be

It wasn't really, it wasn't really much
It wasn't really much at all
It wasn't really, it wasn't really
Wasn't really much at all

Wassup, ma? Hush, got fly
Here's a quest, why you left?
Was it my messed up eye? Why?
Reminisce, wannabe, huh?
See, hon, followed sheep from once the first chick
Clark wallabees on
Swag, honey drip, spendin' some time
Remember them rhymes?
Your gold fronts looked better than mines did
Was ecstasy, poundin' in the bm
Clownin' me and that was way before
Wore gowns and the skin'
Givin' me life

Giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Feelin' myself like I'm Norma Jeane
Here in my arms is where you should be
Ooh, you are giving me life
And it's everything

Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Livin' like Babs 'cause it's evergreen
Here in my arms is where you should be
Ooh, you are giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Feeling myself like I'm norma jeane
Here in my arms is where you should be
Giving me life and it's everything

It was a stone groove, my man
You are the most righteous
Yeah, right, just get the fuck out

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life, da-da-da, yeah
(Yeah, givin', givin' me life)
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Whoa, whoa-whoa
Giving me life and it's all
Oh, giving me life and it's all
