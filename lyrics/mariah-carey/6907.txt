Once upon a time you whispered softly in my ear
Loving words, and fairy tales that I longed to hear
I gave you my body and soul and you took control
As you slowly swept me up and carried me away


You told me pretty lies
As I held onto you tight
You knew how to get your way
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace

Long ago
You used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

Every now and then I drown in thoughts of yesterday
And the fools paradise that you blew away
I feel you beside me again and remember when
You came to my window on a dark and stormy day

Baby I need you now
Tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

Long ago
You used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
Long ago
You used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

Baby I need you now
Tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

Long ago
You used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
(Repeat)
