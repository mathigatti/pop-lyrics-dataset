This is dedicated to all the ladies out there
That's tired of getting played
Y'all know?


Y'all know what this is so, so def
(I ain't even gotta say it)
And your girl's mean me
Thanx for nothing
No, nothing
You were just playing a game
(MC)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Thanx for nothin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You were just playin' a game

I can't even know what to say
I've been hurt, I've been played
And I'm so shamed
I can't even cry it's that deep
You just lie and you cheat
Like it's nothin'

See, you said that you loved me too
And so I trusted you
But I guess that subconciously I knew
But I didn't wanna face the truth
That I was only being used
And you was just frontin'

Ay, boy, thanx for nothin'
I never knew enough about you, babe
And I guess I only have myself to blame
Now I'm broken-hearted and shattering
But you were just playin' a game
Nothin' anyone could do to convince me, babe
I was livin' in a lie, just a masquerade
Now I only know that I'll never be the same
But you were just playin' a game

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Thanx for nothin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You were just playin' a game

Every day and every night I stay by the phone
Never go no place so just in case you call I'll be home
Seems like what I do is think about our pseudo romance
While you're somewhere burnin' diesel, in the streets havin' laughs

Somebody say you know what I'm going through
You been left with nothin' too
Much you can't count on one hand
Singing, 3, 4, 5, 6
7 days a week, you're drowning in tears
He was so insincere
Now you're layin' up in bed every night singing

Ay, boy, thanx for nothin'
I never knew enough about you, babe
And I guess I only have myself to blame
Now I'm broken-hearted and shattering
But you were just playin' a game
Nothin' anyone could do to convince me, babe
I was livin' in a lie, just a masquerade
Now I only know that I'll never be the same
But you were just playin' a game

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So thanx for nothin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So thanx for nothin'
