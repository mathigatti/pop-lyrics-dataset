Girl you know you get me so erotic 
Especially when I be sippin hypnotiq 
Got me feelin like I'm smokin on 
When we fuckin it be so exotic 
Now I know that I be turnin on fiyay Wit Mariah 
And she know she be dealin wit a balla 
Can't go fast cuz I'm heavy through the wire 
Fulfillin' desires like a chi shot calla 
Do you love how the twist throw it at you 
Do you love when I hit it from the back too 
Let me feel how you work it that one way 
Come on baby girl let me see what that do 

Mariah: 
I wish that we could 
Blow out the speakers 
Over N Over 
Tell Jokes and secrets 
Forever your lady 
You act right then , then maybe 
Ain't nothing to talk about 
With the music loud 
So they wont hear me say 
Ah-hahaha ahh! 
Come and be my one and only 
Tired of being so lonely… come hold ne 
Ah-hahaha ahh! 
I wanna wrap myself around you whenever you want to 
Come make me say

Come and be my one and only 
Tired of being so lonely… console me 
Ah-hahaha ahh! 
I wanna wrap myself around you whenever you want to 
Come make me say 


Twista: 
Now we pullin up out the garage 
In the platinum blue winage? 
Me and you about to hit that club 
To the bounce so we can sip that bud 
Both of us together we would be the livest 
If I had to break it down how would I describe it 
(Ah- ahahaha ahhh!) 
We the type of couple when we get up on each other 
we get it crackin in the kitchen or the bedroom 
it don't matter where we at we be makin noise 
so play the track so the base will make ya head boom 
break ya off when here one leg up 
And you know I like the way you put it on me 
It's the eastcoast queen and the midwest mombo? 
Shorty I will never leave ya lonely 


Mariah:
