There are nights
When i can't help but cry
And i wonder why
You had to leave me why did it have to end so soon
When you said that
You would never leave me tell me
Where did i go wrong
What i did i do to make you change
Your mind completely when i thought
This love would never end
But if this love's not ours to have
I'll let it go with your goodbye why did it have to end so soon
When you said that
You would never leave me tell me
Where did i go wrong
What i did i do to make you change
Your mind completely when i thought
This love would never end
But if this love's not ours to have
I'll let it go with your goodbye
