It wasn't raining yet
But it was definitely
A little misty on
That warm November night
And my heart was pounding
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive


And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moet and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart

And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words I love you
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
Pretty baby, how I'm missing you

(Every time)
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Every time I feel the need
(When I feel the need)
I envision you caressing me
(I envision you over and over and over again)
And go back in time
(It was so sweet)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Every time I feel the need
(Last night I had the strangest dream)
I envision you caressing me
(It was actually quite symbolic)
And go back in time
(As I whispered, that I love you)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(Very subtly)
On the rooftop that rainy night

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
