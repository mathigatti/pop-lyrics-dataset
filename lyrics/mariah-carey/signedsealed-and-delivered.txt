Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm
Yours
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm
Yours


Here I am baby
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby,
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
I've done alot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
Hey, hey, yea, yea, didn't I, oh baby

Seen alot of things in this old world
When I touched them they did nothing, girl
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm
Yours, oh I'm yours
Oo-wee babe you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you are my only desire
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm
Yours

Here I am baby
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby,
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
I've done alot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man but here I am

With your future, got your future babe (here I am
Baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby, (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby, (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
