I know you don't believe that is over like that

(She know you still love me)
Baby I know this, know this, know this
(And I love you too)
Ain't gon' be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss
(You know ain't no kiss gon' be our last kiss)
Ain't gon' be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss
(I know you don't believe that is over like that)


Feel so empty inside since our last kiss goodbye
Picture you in my mind and I can't seem to rationalize
The way we let it end
It just don't make no sense
This can't be happening
I need you back again

Everybody asking questions
Like we're some kind of obsession
For the millionth time asking I'm like
Uhh, let it rest
Can I get a minute to breathe
They're like: Nope!
What's up with you and so and so?

But in my heart I know this (what?)
Ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is?
Our love will always exist
Oh listen to me
Boy you know we trill
So stop frontin'
What we got is still somethin' somethin'
Oh, this feeling it's too good to miss (too god)
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss

Ooh, you said you'd never leave me so I'll keep believing
That eventually
We gon' kiss away the hurt do it like it were
And wake up how we used to be
(I know you don't believe that is over like that)
Never let it go get it right
Bring it back home stay for life
Call it what you want it's in your eyes
We gon' make it thru this I'll prove it
Somethin' bout our love will not fade away
Always everlasting and

But in my heart I know this
Ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is?
Our love will always exist
Oh listen to me
Boy you know we trill
So stop frontin'
What we got is still somethin' somethin'
Oh, this feeling it's too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss

(What we got is thrill, is too real to be the last kiss)
Baby I know this, know this, know this
(I mean is too big for us to quit)
Ain't gon' be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss
(You know)
Ain't gon' be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss
(I know you don't believe that is over like that)

But in my heart I know this
Ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is?
Our love will always exist
Oh listen to me
Boy you know we trill
So stop frontin'
What we got is still somethin' somethin'
Oh, this feeling it's too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss

But in my heart I know this
Ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is?
Our love will always exist
Oh listen to me
Boy you know we trill
So stop frontin'
What we got is still somethin' somethin'
Oh, this feeling it's too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss
