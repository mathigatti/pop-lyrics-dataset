(I'm lookin' for my one and only)
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So so lonely
(I'm lookin' for my one and only)


I'm riding home in pain again baby
But that don't mean shit to you
You're currently engaged in an intimate conversation
With a young groupie or two
They say: Players only love you when they're playing games
Still I gave my heart to you
I should have stayed away
Like my friends all told me to

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So so lonely
(I'm lookin' for my one and only)
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?

See I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow
Make me sing real high
When he goes down low
But see it ain't just a physical thing
He's gotta treat me affectionately
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust
Just like every other motherfucker does
Is this just an impossible dream baby
To elusive to pursue
It's been such a sad and windy road for me
Just searchin' for the truth

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So so lonely
(I'm lookin' for my one and only)
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?

Now you know roll a beemer and a benz
When I'm dishin out ends
Why you trppin on a player baller
Havin good conversation while we rollin on 2-4's
And I know you got doubts
But why you listenin to what people talkin bout
You ain figured out why they call ya
The hefas steady hatin cause you rollin on 2-4's
See how yo money flo
You dressed in designer clothes from head to ya toe
You ain't satisfied well tell me what you lookin for
(I'm lookin for my one and only)
Well I'll be yo one and only if you give me a chance
I'll make a change for you girl
I know I ain been the mos faithful nigga in the world
But lets stay togetha so we can shine like pearls
Spit it to her while I fill her got her hot like fire
To kiss yo lips I desire
Twis and Mariah togetha like them grips on ya tires
(I'm lookin for my one and only)
Well come here shawty well let me make it better
We can do whateva while we sittin on sued and leather
Flickin through the city while we ridin on chrome
Lets kick it in the Chi
I know I messed up wit you and I ain't gonna lie
I know you was feelin' you really know yo guy
But baby girl I ain't mean to blow yo high
Let me pick the pieces up and but um back togetha
Cause I wanna be wit you don't wanna leave you lonely
Ride wit you like a hommie neva no fony
Shawty can I be yo one an only

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So so lonely
(I'm lookin' for my one and only)
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?
(Still lookin' for my one and only)

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So so lonely
(I'm lookin' for my one and only)
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?
