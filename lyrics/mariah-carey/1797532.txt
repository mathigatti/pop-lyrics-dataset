Ah
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
Don't want it
If there's a remedy
I'll run from it
From it


Think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you

I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't wanna get over
Sweetest hangover

Yeah, I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get
I don't wanna get...over

Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Boy your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I know I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I can not resist
And oh..

Boy I can do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Could you love me, baby
Hold me, feeling now
Go and break my heart

Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things that you know
Understatement to relinquish my love to you
But I can not resist at all

Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Ooh, I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure

Sweet lovin'
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love

Don't call my doctor
Don't call my momma
Don't call my preacher

No, I don't need it
I don't want it
Sweet love, I need you

If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it no
Dont want, dont need

Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
