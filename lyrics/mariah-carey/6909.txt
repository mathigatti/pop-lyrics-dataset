You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above


I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high

It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine

It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh baby, you've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above, oh

You know the way
To make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so high

Oh, oh baby, oh baby
Hey!
All right, all right, oh
Oh, oh, hey, hey

Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Oh, yeah! You've got me feeling emotions
Yes you do!
Oh, yeah! You've got me feeling emotions, yeah!
Higher!
You've got me feeling higher!
