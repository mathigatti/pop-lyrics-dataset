How do you feel? You feel good, right? I feel wonderful!
And all of that good energy is coming right up here on the stage.
Now - little earlier in the evening we didn't get a chance to rehearse so
my newest girlfriend came in my trailer and we talked a little girl talk,
we laughed, we had fun, she's gonna came out shortly and join me on stage, OK?
Now, give me that riff again, whats that riff? Think right.
No, OK, do it - play it again! This is my son Teddy, graduated Michigan State University.
Should we start the party? Are we ready? Start the party? Hey!


Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)
Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)
Chain chain chain, chain of fools

For five long years
I thought he was my man, you know, yes I did
But I found out, uha
I'm just a link in his chain, yes I was
He held me where he wanted me
I was nothing but his fool, oh yeah
He treated me mean, yeah
He treated me cruel, allright

Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)
Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)
Chain chain chain, chain of fools

Now every chain (every chain) has got a weak link
I might be weak, but I gave you strength
Oh yeah
(Uh uh)

 He tell me to leave him alone
My father said, "She can come on home"
My doctor said, "Take it easy"
But his lovin' was much too strong
I'm wedded to him

Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)
Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)
Chain chain chain, chain of fools

One of these mornings
Mariah: That chain is gonna break
Yes it is
But up until then I'm gonna take all I can take
Oh

Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)
Chain chain chain (chain chain chain)
Chain chain chain, chain of fools

Uuuh yeah

Oh hail the Queen Of Soul, Aretha Franklin!
Miss Carey, Mariah. Thank you so much.
We love you.
We love you. We'll be back, shortly, don't go nowhere
