Just play
(Boy, boy, boy, boy)


I can't help it
When I'm not around you (Boy)
'Cause all I ever seem to do is drift away
In dreams about you
'Cause when I'm without you (Boy)
It always seems like part of me is missing baby

Sometimes I don't call
Like I don't care at all
But secretly
You're the only thing that lifts me up
And makes me smile
When I'm unhappy
All you gotta do is call
And suddenly
Things don't really seem so bad at all

(Boy) I need you
(Boy) Adore you
(Boy) Gotta have you
(Oh boy) I wanna feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love
Baby anything you want
Feeling you (Boy)
Fiending for you (Boy)
Just waiting on you (Boy)
When I see you (Oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up
Inside my love
And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy

My heart races when
My Motorolla beeps
Or my cell rings
I just make a wish and if it's you
My whole day changes
'Cause when I know
You're thinking of me (Boy)
Heaven knows
Suddenly it's not so dismal baby

Sometimes I don't call
Like I don't care at all
But secretly
You're the only thing that lifts me up
And makes me smile
When I'm unhappy (Oh boy)
All you gotta do is call
And suddenly
Things don't really seem so bad at all

(Boy) I need you
(Boy) Adore you
(Boy) Gotta have you
(Oh boy) I wanna feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love
Baby anything you want
Feeling you (Boy)
Fiending for you (Boy)
Just waiting on you (Boy)
When I see you (Oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up
Inside my love
And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy

Uh mami feelin' my gangsta
Cause usually I stay on the block
But the girl went world jet straight to the yacht
Eight in the shock jewellery, chrome and stones

Eight keys, two hammers, lobster and shrimp
