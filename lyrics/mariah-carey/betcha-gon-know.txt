Oh, welcome to a day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel
Oh, welcome, welcome, welcome to a day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel


Mariah:
Though the lights were low
I could see you both
In a lover's silhouette
And my heart stood still
I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door
Jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous
To be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows
Just so I could breathe
I can't believe you just actually did this shit to me
I'm going 'bout a hundred
Mascara running
Laughing out of anger
But it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you
I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this
Happen in my own bedroom

Betcha gon' know oh how it feels
(When I get you back)
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels
(When your heart's been cracked)
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels
(When we fade to black)
How it feels for real
And you see your whole world collapse

R. Kelly:
Before we both get loud
I'ma break it down
And let you know what happened for real
I was over her house
Me and her on the couch
And the whole plan was just to chill
And then it got hot
After taking some shots
The time must have slipped away
Because all I know
I woke hungover
And girl it was the very next day
With the sun in my face
I woke up in a rage
Screamed, "What have you done to me?"
And I'm telling you babe
I know it sounds crazy
She must have put something in my drink
I know you don't believe it
And you think I'm dead wrong
Standing there butt naked
With nothing but a sheet on
Then she came down
With nothing but a robe on
And that's when
I put my damn clothes on
Got the fuck up out of there

Girl you know I know how it looks
(See I know how it looks)
Girl you know I know how it looks
(But baby it ain't like that)
Girl you know I know how it looks
(So don't go accusing me of something that I didn't really mean to do)

Baby, I had all my trust in you and look at what you put me through (this is not my fault, no it isn't)
You got me all crazy, somewhere down the line you gon' get what you deserve, you fucking jerk
Your were supposed to save me, my sweet baby (but I love you, I don't love her)
Now we're fading away (don't fade, don't fade, no)
But you gon' know how this feels
Even if it's the last thing I ever do
To be continued
