Verse 1 
You're kissing me 
And saying I'm the one you need 
To keep you warm 
And lay with you tonight 
Baby I feel the same way 
I don't want to leave 
Wanna hold you close 
And feel your love inside 
But I don't wanna play myself 
Cause I know you're with someone else 
And I don't need complications in my life 
And I don't wanna fall back in 
And get caught up in you again 
Boy I'm so conflicted in my mind 


Chorus 1 
You keep saying stay the night 
Just let me rock you till the morning light 
It's cold outside 
And much too late to drive 
You know I need you baby 
I'm so lost without your love 

Verse 2 
Obviously, procrastinating just to be 
Close to you a little longer now 
It's hard for me to break away from you baby 
Never could resist you 
And I still haven't learned how 
And I don't wanna be a fool 
But it's hard when it comes to you 
And I'm feeling vulnerable tonight 
Cause I don't wanna miss the chance 
Of reliving our sweet romance 
Boy I'm so confused down deep inside 

Chorus 2 
You keep saying stay the night 
Just let me rock you til the morning light 
It's cold outside 
And much too late to drive 
You know I need you baby 
I'm so lost without your love
