The wind has taken you
You're free finally at peace
So still you lie
Leaving your cares behind
The pain is gone
Gone with the spirit in your eyes
Now you're wandering around
Above us
Looking downward
As we cry


You've flown into the wind
Escaping all the hurt within
Took to the sky
Leaving the world behind
So young to die
How could you let it all pass you by

And to the wind go so many dreams
That you had inside
Now you're just a memory
Burning in my mind

So young to die
How could you let life pass you by
And now you'll never know I loved you
And now you'll never know I cared

I really loved you
And now you'll never know

You'll only fade
Into the wind
