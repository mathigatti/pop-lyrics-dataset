Jadakiss:
Hey yo
The crib got your friends working
We travel to France for French curtains
You was there when I was on the bench hurtin'
Now that I own my team
It's only right that can I dole my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now
She carries the money
The --- is immaterial across town
And understand she's fine
And understand she's mine
She understand the grime
Cook, cleans, and irons


Whenever she wanna push
I'ma co-sign it
If I ain't got it already
Then I'ma go find it
I guess I'm a lucky Don
And she a lucky queen
'Cause the jewelry box
Look like Lucky Charms
All color stones
And she know I'm in the hood
But she also knows that I'm comin' home
Mr. Raspy
Thought I was in love with money
'Til the first time we did the nasty

Mariah: K-I-S-S me
Jadakiss: And I just wanna make
Mariah: Love, love, love
Jadakiss: I love it when you say
Mariah: K-I-S-S me

Mariah: Love, love, love

Yo, whatever the road to paradise is beyond it
Gave me your income tax checks
So I could get on wit'
Those were the days
These are the times
You held me down
With nearly damn near everything
Even my rhymes
I will play a song for you
And you will tell me exactly
How the ladies will respond
From a woman's point of view
(Mariah: From a womans point of view)
And thats why my girls with me
I love it when she layin' in the bed
In the --- Vicky

The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with the fat ass
And a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes
And tell she real
Just imagine the way she smell
The way she feel
The sex was crazy
Then it's crazy still
(Mariah: Crazy still)
You know I'm from the streets
So it's crazy ill
(Mariah: Crazy ill)
We waitin' on a new island
We been to all of them
Four or five times
Come on mami

Jadakiss:
When things was rough
Only person I could call was you
Now everything I do
I do it all for you
Uh

Mariah:
Come touch me
Come kiss me
Come love me
Any way you want to boy

Jadakiss:
When I'm good
As long as I'm close to you
And we doin' what grown folks
Are supposed to do
Come on

Mariah:
Come hold me
Come feel me
Come take me
Any way you want to boy

Jadakiss:
Money is great
But what we got is more better
We got the four letters
When it comes from the heart
It's more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Thus far I appreciate what we've built
All the minks that I've bought you
That drag the floor
And all the nights that you sat up
And bagged the raw
Damn, I'm thinkin' you gotta hate it
But yet still we tolerate it
(Mariah: We gon' make it, we gon' make it)
That's why I'm thinkin'
We gotta make it

Mariah: K-I-S-S me
Jadakiss: And I just wanna make
