Cry, cry, (cry), cry, cry
Cry, cry (cry), cry, cry


Maybe I didn't leave much between us that day
And maybe I shouldn't have told you I loved you
Played the game, and now I understand
Wish I could have you back
And kiss you soft and feel your hands on me

Til we both break down
Til we both break down
Til we both break down
And cry

Cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry

And maybe I didn't give you your space back then
And maybe I should have just held out a little bit longer
But I was seduced by you, and I didn't know enough
Truly too enchanted to disregard the words you said to make me yours
I need to hold you until we break

Til we both break down (break down)
Til we both break down
I should have known that you were trying to love me
Oh, til we both break down and cry

Oh, my love, imprudently I left every cell in me
So naked, somewhere at the core of you
Bless our souls

I just need you til we both (til we both break down)
I'm just saying
Til we both break down
Might as well tell the truth about the matter (til we both break down)
Guess it's selfish of me to just expect that I'm entitled to have you)
But tonight all I wanna do is just hold you (til we both break down)
We both break down and cry

Cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry

Til we both break down and cry
