Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty


Chasing them bright lights
Even change your name
Sayin' you're a my boss now
Ain't nothing out your range
Well, almost anything

You used to be Mister all about me
Now you're just thirsty for celebrity
Best thing that happened to your ass was me
Pull down them Tom Fords, and act like you see

You thirsty for a dream
Leaving me drowning
Boy there ain't no SOS
Filled with discontent
Finding you can't quench
Why you try so damn hard?

Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty

Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty

That Bel-Air wood sign
Calling you again
So you stunting on your Instagram
But that shit ain't everything

You used to be Mr. all about we
Now you're just thirsty for celebrity
Best thing to happened to your ass was me
Pull down them Tom Fords, and act like you see

You thirsty for a dream
Leaving me drowning
Boy there ain't no SOS
Filled with discontent
Finding you can't quench
Why you try so damn hard?

Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty

Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty

Boss now, you're tryin' to be a boss now
Thinking you a boss now
Boy you just looking thirsty
Boss now, you're tryin' to be a boss now
Thinking you a chief now
Boy you're just fucking thirsty now

Oh, you're thirsty
You're living life and fancy cars
Like stars, don't know who you are
Happy happy, want more for you to see
I found a club that add me constantly
Can't get the real me oh 'cause boy you're thirsty, yeah
