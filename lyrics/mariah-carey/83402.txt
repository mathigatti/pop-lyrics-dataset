I'm so high
To the tippy tippy top you don't stop
To the tippy tippy top you don't quit
And to the tippy tippy top you don't stop
And to the tippy tippy top you don't quit


Hey now who can take you higher
Add fuel to your fire
Tag team and desire
Track Masters and Mariah
Take you higher

One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find

And we drifted, drifted, drifted, drifted
Ooh and I was yours
And you were my own
My own baby
As we lay
As we
Lay underneath the stars
Baby

Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
So shy
A bundle of butterflies
Flushed with the heat of desire
On a natural high

Drifted
I'm so high
On a natural high
Drifted
I'm so high
On a natural high
Drifted
I'm so high
On a natural high
Drifted
I'm so high
On a natural high

Beautiful and bittersweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good-bye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was
Drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting

And I was yours
And you were my own
My own baby
As we lay
As we
Lay underneath the stars

I was drifting drifting drifting
I'm so high
I was drifting drifting drifting
I'm so high
