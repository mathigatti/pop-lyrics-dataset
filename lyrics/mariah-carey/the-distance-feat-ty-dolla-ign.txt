S-P-I-R-I-T, it's great to see
We got it, the spirit
Hey, hey, let's hear it


Ain't nobody stopping us
What we have is dangerous
Left their opinions in the dust
Say can't nobody fuck with us
They'll never find a way to make us fade away
Our love won't fade away (no)
They'll never find a way to make us fade away
Our love won't fade away

Warm days, cold nights, late October
Separated, people saying what we have is over
But the hate only made us get closer (close!)
And closer

Said we couldn't go the distance, yeah
Look at us, we're going the distance
They just wanna be us
They don't wanna see us going the distance (yeah!)
For laughs, for laughs, la di da
Said we couldn't go the distance
For life, for life, la di da
Look at us, we're going the distance
The distance, oh

They was no good, had their hands up
Tried to diminish me
But we stayed down, kept on that crown
In spite of them difficulties
But they can't, but they can't, but they can't
Take away them precious memories (yeah!)
And I won't, and I won't, and I won't
Let 'em come between you and me (woo!)

We've been goin' all the way, ay
For the longest (ooh yeah)
We're too strong (too strong)
We're too solid (ooh yeah)
They can't stop it now (ooh)
We a problem now (ooh)
Fuck all their comments (fuck all their comments)
They be so toxic (they be so toxic)
We be kissing in public
You like it, I love it
You with it, I'm with it
We going the distance
