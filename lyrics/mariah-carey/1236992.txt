It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
4 real, 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
4 real, 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
4 real, 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
4 real


It's 4real, 4real

Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real

Sometimes you be
Blowin' my mind
If you were mine
I'd take my time
With you but on the low
I'm shy though
I front like I'm
So next level fly
With them other guys
Really I wanna reach out
And just touch you
If you could only realize
How much I like to
Come knock knockin'
At your door
Give ol' girl the heave ho
And give a demonstration
Of what it's like

When it's 4 real, 4 real
100 percent 4real
Hotter than cable TV
Like something
Out of your dreams
It's 4 real, 4 real
Million percent the deal
So I'll just keep doin' me
And eventually you'll see
I'm 4 real, 4 real

Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real

All my friends say
I'm wastin'
My time on you
Tryin' to dissuade me
With schemes
Wanna make you
Less than you seem
But I'm not that one
To listen to dumb
Chicks that want to be
Where I'm gonna be
Really I wanna reach out
And just touch you
If you could only realize
How much I'd like to
Lay myself
Down next to you
Fall asleep
Watching cartoons
And wake you up
With somethin' good
Cause it's real

When it's 4 real, 4 real
100 percent 4real
Hotter than cable TV
Like something
Out of your dreams
It's 4 real, 4 real
Million percent the deal
So I'll just keep doin' me
And eventually you'll see
I'm 4 real, 4 real

Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real

How to come
At you off tay day
It's morning
And I wanna

Lately
But on the low
Rock a shout like MJ
I don't know
What to say, say, say
But I know
Who I wanna do, do, do
I'm 4 real, 4 real
That's you, you, you
You ain't ever met
Nobody like me, me, me
I don't need
Comcast inside
I like TV
Lemme demonstrate
How it's supposed to be
Cuz it's something
You can't imagine
Like outta ya dreams
Obviously people
Gon hate on me
They don't want me
To date on you
They don't want you
With a paid woman
But they can't deny
They got Mariah
Since day one

When it's 4 real, 4 real
100 percent 4 real
Hotter than cable TV
Like something
Out of your dreams
It's 4 real, 4 real
Million percent the deal
So I'll just keep doin' me
And eventually you'll see
I'm 4 real, 4 real

Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
Baby, it's baby
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4real
