Can't let go
Uh baby


There you are
Holding her hand
I am lost
Dying to understand
Didn't I
Cherish your right?
Don't you know
You were my life?

Even though I try
I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night I see
You in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go

Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am
Still holding on
I can't accept
My world is gone no no

Even though I try
I can't let go
'Cause something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night I see
You in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go

Do you even realize
The sorrow I have inside
Everyday of my life?
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies?
I try and try
To deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind

Even though I try
(No no I just can't get you out of my mind)
I can't let go
Something in your eyes
(I never can)
Captured my soul
(Say goodbye)
And every night I see
You in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go

Even though I try
I can't let go
Something in your eyes
(Something about you)
Captured my soul
(That I need so badly)
And every night I see
You in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go

Uh baby
