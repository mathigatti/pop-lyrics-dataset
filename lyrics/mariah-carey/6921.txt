It's just the way I want you baby
Oh so bad
It's just the feeling that comes over me


I had a crush on you
Painstakingly I
Would conceal the truth
You probably always knew
But I was timid like a child
Inhibited and way too shy
I'd glance but then avert my eyes
All twisted up in my desire
But I am not that girl today
Ain't a lot of time for games
I've waited and I've waited now
It's time for me to tell you
'Bout the way

It's just they way I want you baby
Oh so bad
Every night and everyday
Must we hesitate
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I cannot alleviate
Please don't make me wait
It's just the way I want you baby
Oh so bad
Every night and everyday

Baby I
Was so into you
Now I wonder why
I never pursued
You the way I wanted to

Kiss me and touch me and
Immerse your love in mine
I'll keep unraveling
As we explore our fantasies tonight
(Tell me what you like)
(Now show me what you like)

It's just the way I want you baby
So bad
Every night and everyday
Must we hesitate
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I cannot alleviate
Please don't make me wait

Repeat
