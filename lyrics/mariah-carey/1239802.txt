Here we are
On Earth together
It's you and I
God has made us
Fall in love
It's true
I've really found
Someone like you


Will stay?
The love
You feel for me will stay?
That you
Will be by my side
To see me through
Until my life
Is through

Well, in my mind
We can conquer the world
In love you and I
You and I, you and I

I am glad
At least in my life
I found someone
That may not be here
Forever
To see me through
But I found
Strength in you
I only pray
That I have shown you
A brighter day
Because that's all
That I am living for
You see
Don't worry
What happens to me

Cause' in my mind
You will stay
Here always
In love
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
In my mind
We can conquer the world
In love
You and I, you and I
You and I
