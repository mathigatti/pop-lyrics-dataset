Reflections of your love have come to wither
I thought I'd done my best to memorize
A picture face of you and I together
I haven't come to terms with how we said goodbye


Did you really care
Care at all for me
Did you really care
Did you care at all for me

A displaced little girl wept years in silence
And whispered wishes you'd materialize
She pressed on night and day to keep on living
And tried so many ways to keep her soul alive

Did you really care
Care enough for me
Did you really care
Did you care at all for me

If I'm not quite good enough
Or somehow undeserving of
A mother's love
You could've had the decency to give me hope
Before you gave me life

Don't you even care
Just the slightest little bit for me
Cause I really need to feel you care
Even once upon a time for me

I need to believe
In my heart of heart of hearts you cared for me
I need to understand
Why you left me there so helplessly

Don't you even care
Care at all for me
Oh

Reflections of your love have come to wither
I thought I'd done my best to memorize
