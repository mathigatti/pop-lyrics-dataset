You're with me
Till the bitter end
What we had transcends
This experience
Too painful to
Talk about
So I'll hold it in
Til my heart can mend
And be brave enough to love again


A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace

Oh
Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
always remember
Love

There's a hero, if you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid of what you are
There's an answer, if you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know will melt away

And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you

Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone, tear them away
Hold on, there will be tomorrow
In time, you'll find the way

And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you

Nobody can take your place
You're never too far
