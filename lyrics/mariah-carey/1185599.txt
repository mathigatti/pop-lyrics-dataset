M C , uh uh uh, in the place to be, uh uh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah


I know that you've been waiting for me
I'm waiting too
In my imagination I be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me
Hundred and two
And boy, I know I feel the same
My temperature's through the roof

If it's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do (I do)
If it's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube (YouTube)
Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
Cause they be all up in my bidness like a Wendy interview
But this is private 'tween you and I

Touch my body
Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more
Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
like you never did.
Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist
Just a little taste
Touch my body
I know you like my curves
C'mon and give me what I deserve and touch my body

Boy you can put me on you like a brand new white tee
I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
And float away with you in my Caribbean Sea

If it's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do (I do)
If it's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube (YouTube)
Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
Cause they be all up in my bidness like a Wendy interview
But this is private 'tween you and I

Touch my body
Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more
Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
like you never did.
Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist
Just a little taste
Touch my body
I know you like my curves
C'mon and give me what I deserve and touch my body

I'ma treat you like a teddy bear
You won't wanna go nowhere in the lap of luxury
Layin' intertwined with me
You won't want for nothing boy
I will give you plenty joy

Touch my body
Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more
Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
like you never did.
Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist
Just a little taste
Touch my body
I know you like my curves
C'mon and give me what I deserve and touch my body

Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah,oh oh oh oh
Every little way you like to touch my body, baby
Just touch my body
Touch my body
C'mon and give me what I deserve
