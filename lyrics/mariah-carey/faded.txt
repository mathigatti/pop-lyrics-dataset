You're faded
Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
Faded
Faded


It was overcast that day
And I was feeling some kind of way
I pulled the covers up over my head
Tried reaching for you but that was then
I can't forget

My heart's hung over
But ain’t nothing different
I close my eyes
Nothing but faded pictures of you
Of you

Faded
Baby, you're faded
Baby, you're faded
Faded

You come
And you go
You're just
An echo
A whisper in my ear
But in the morning you're not here
So intangible
Just like an echo

Still try to pretend it’s possible
To bring us back to life
But we continue to subside
Hanging on for life
On this roller coaster ride

I call your name baby subconsciously
Always somewhere but you’re not there for me
Boy you
Boy you

Faded
Baby, you're faded
Baby, you're faded
Faded
(Boy you just come and you go)

You come
And you go
You're just
An echo
A whisper in my ear
But in the morning you're not here
So intangible
Just like an echo

Faded
Faded

You're always somewhere but you're not there for me
Not there for me
Not there for me
You're always somewhere but you're not there for me
Not there for me
Not there for me
