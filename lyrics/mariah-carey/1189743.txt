Way out west, they got a name
For rain and wind and fire
The rain is Tess, the fire's joe 
And they call the wind Mariah


O no, Mariah blows the stars around
And sends the clouds a-flying
Mariah makes the mountain sounds
Like folks were up there dying
Mariah, they call the wind Mariah

Now before I knew Mariah's name
And heard her wail and whining
I had a girl and she had me
And the sun was always shining
O, but then one day I left my girl
I left her far behind me
And now I'm lost, I'm oh so lost
Not even God can find me

Mariah, O, Mariah 
They call the wind Mariah
I hear they got a name for rain
And wind and fire only
But when you're lost and all alone
There ain't no words but lonely
And I'm a lost and lonely man
Without a star to guide me
Mariah, blow your love to me
I need my girl beside me
He, Mariah, o, Mariah
I'm lonely can't you see
Mariah, o, Mariah
Please blow my love to me
Mariah, blow my love to me
