O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by.


Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The ever lasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wandering love.

O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing, to God, the King
And peace to men on earth.

O, Holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today.

We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our lord Eimanuel.

And peace to men on earth...
