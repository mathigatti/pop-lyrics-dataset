(Make it last forever)
For the world
(Ever)
I will baby
(Don't let our love end)
Desert Storm baby
(Thank God I found you)
Check it, this for you


Let's show the world you my golden girl
When we shopping
They see us on the street
They say son scooped a hot one
You taste like banana cake
You shaped like the number 8
And you my number one candidate
I can't lose you
It's like I'm betting in Vegas crucial
Sweating knowing these players is wanting you boo
I get the chills when you in my sight
Feels like it's meant to be right
(Thank God I found you)
I feel the rush when I kiss you at night

Shorty knows she my baby girl
And player haters try hard to get her
But she'll be lounging in my cradle tonight oh
Typically a thug wouldn't say this
But you see your love has got me fading
No girl ever made me feel like you do

Imma be here night after night
To feel your loving arms around me
Baby baby baby baby
You make it all right
No one but you baby baby
Can make me feel
The way you make
Make me make me make me feel

(We make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
Make it last
(We make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
Don't let our love end
(We make it last, make it last)
Oh don't you let it end
(We make it last, make it last)
Make it last forever
(We make it last, make it last)
And ever
(We make it last, make it last)
Thank God I found you

Your touch
Is wonderful
(So wonderful)
Your love
Is so marvelous
Joy
That's what I feel
When I'm with you

Nothing
No one
(No one boy)
Could compare to what we have
(Oh no baby)
Love
It feels so good
I'm so glad you're mine

(We make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
Make it last forever
(We make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
Don't let our love end
(We make it last, make it last)
No no no boy
(We make it last, make it last)
Make it last forever
(We make it last, make it last)
And ever
(We make it last, make it last)
Thank God I found you

A thug's dream wife
Jeans tight
Beautiful skin
Matching brown tims
Hot as jalapenos
She knows how to hide the ninos
The rap Rudolph Valentino
In thief I become the black Al Pacino
Relax sweetie and you can watch the TV
Lay back and pump Mariah's hot CD
And I'm a touch you in the wrong places
We could walk through a park
And Bubble North Faces?
I'm lost in your love
Thank God I found you
You my crown jewel
I'm saying boo
The type I give my last name to
(Make it last)
And lover's lane
Put the top up
When it start to rain
In the parking lot
Then we finish doing our thing
Fog the windows
Getting very sentimental
Sipping cosmos
With the cherry in the middle
I keep it honest
Word to real
That's my promise
Signing off
Truly yours
Nastradamus

Ohh don't you let it end
(We make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
Make it last
(We make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
See I was so lost without your love
(We make it last, make it last)
I was lost without you
(We make it last, make it last)
My every wish and dream
(We make it last, make it last)
Became reality
(We make it last, make it last)
Then you brought the sunlight
(We make it last, make it last)
Oh I
(We make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
(We make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
My baby I'm so thankful
(We make it last, make it last)
Thank God I found you
(We make it last, make it last)
I was so lost without you
(We make it last, make it last)
My every wish and every dream
(We make it last, make it last)
Somehow became reality
(We make it last, make it last)
You brought the sunshine
(We make it last, make it last)
Completed my whole life
(We make it last, make it last)
Make it last forever baby
(We make it last, make it last)
Thank God I found you
(We make it last, make it last)
