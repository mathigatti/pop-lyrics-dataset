La da do do do
Yeah eh eh eh


On amends
Touch good morning
I was gone
Game over
Not too tight
A fitting moment
Back at me
Far from solace
So i left the bitterness behind
All that sadness and distress of mine
And we found ourselves out spending (yeah)
Hovering above the roof laying over (laying over)

This single
Jump bumpin
Won't nothing
Skydiving
You had me
Floating on up to the sea

This single
Won't nothing
Eternal
Skydiving
You got me lifted baby
Our love is like a skydiving

You got me lifted baby
Our love is like a skydiving

So they say you got some chick
That keeps you warm at night, along for the ride but
If you ask me that's bullshit
Because obviously heaven sent you for me
See they never told me about love or life
But i'm learning each moment we fly
We were laying as though no consequence
We're in tenderness beyond intense
