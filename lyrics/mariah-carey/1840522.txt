Oohahoo baby love, my baby love
I need you, oh how i need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me, what did i do wrong
To make you stay away so long


'cause baby love, my baby love
Been missing ya, miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Let's do some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms why don't you stay

Baby love, my baby love
Why must we separate, my love
All of my whole life through
I never loved no one but you
Why you do me like you do
I get this need

Ooh, ooh, need to hold you
Once again, my love
Feel your warm embrace, my love
Don't throw our love away
Please don't do me this way
Not happy like i used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me
My love, my baby love
I need you, oh how i need you
Why you do me like you do
After i've been true to you
So deep in love with you
Baby, baby, ooh 'til it's hurtin' me
'til it's hurtin' me
Ooh, baby love
Don't throw our love away
Don't throw our love away
Don't throw our love away
Don't throw our love away

Baby baby baby uuu


Stop in the name of love, before you break my heart.


Baby baby i'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet
But this time before you run to her leaving me all alone and hurt

Think it over ( haven't i been good to you?)
Think it over ( haven't i been sweet to you?

Stop in the name of love before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybee once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more then my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charm

Think it over (haven't i been good to you?)
Think it over (haven't i been sweet to you?)

Stop in the name of love before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you would stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid of losing you for ever

Stop in the name of love before you break my heart (baby think it over)
Stop in the name of love (think it over baby) before you break my heart (oooh think it over baby)
