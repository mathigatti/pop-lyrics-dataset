Oohh-oohh-ohh... Oohh-oohh-ohh...
Oohh-oohh-ohh...


I saw you yesterday
And I heard what you had to say
All those ugly ways you think about me, heeyeah...
But I know it's ok
Gonna keep the smile on my face
Hate don't change the way I feel about
My inner being

Cause I won't let them dim my light
And I'm holding my head up high
And I know my exterior is not impeccable to you
I don't know if my wrongs is right
But I'm gonna keep livin' my life
Defame my name that I made and they
Don't care what they say about me

Imperfect...
That's all that I?ll ever be
And God knows that's alright with me
Cause I know there's no one greater and everybody's
Imperfect...
When you're tryin to live in harmony
But the song of life is out of key
Just be perfectly...
Imperfect, imperfect...
Imperfect...imperfect.

As I look at the tv screen
In there and in magazines
So much insecurity surrounds me, heyeah...
Wish I could change the page
Got to stay with my self-esteem
Folks so superficial
Makes it hard to just survive

Cause I won't let them dim my light
And I'm holding my head up high
And I know my exterior is not impeccable to you
I don't know if my wrongs is right
But I'm gonna keep livin' my life
Defame my name that I made and they
Don't care what they say about me

Imperfect...
That's all that I?ll ever be
And God knows that's alright with me
Cause I know there's no one greater and everybody's
Imperfect...
When you're tryin to live in harmony
But the song of life is out of key
Just be perfectly...
Imperfect, imperfect...
Imperfect...imperfect.

I may not walk like a supermodel (noo..)
All look as flawless as they do (noo..)
I don't know where you get off judgin'
Cause I'm imperfect just like you
So I don?t care about your status (noo..)
No I swear up to here I've had it (noo...)
Ain't try to win no beauty pageant
Cause in my heart is all that matters

Imperfect...
That's all that I?ll ever be
And God knows that's alright with me
Cause I know there's no one greater and everybody's
Imperfect...
When you're tryin to live in harmony
But the song of life is out of key
Just be perfectly...
Imperfect, imperfect...
Imperfect...imperfect.

Ooooh!...Wohhwohh...

That's all that I'll ever be
And God knows that's alright with me (and God knows that's alright with me)
Cause I know there's no one greater and everybody's (cause I know there's no one greater and everybody's)
Imperfect...

When you're tryin' to live in harmony (tryin', tryin'...)
But the song of life is out of key
Just be perfectly...
Imperfect... imperfect, imperfect
Imperfect, imperfect, imperfect...
Imperfect, imperfect.
