An angel appeared
Of the Highest One
And Mary believed
The word she received
Of God's only Son


The Virgin rejoiced
Gave thanks to the Lord
And as Joseph dreamt
The angel was sent
With tidings of peace and joy
Of love, blessed baby Boy

They traveled for miles
To reach Bethlehem
Yet when they arrived
No one could provide
A place at the inn for them

But God kept them safe
From hurt, harm and danger
In His warm embrace
Away in a manger
Waiting for Jesus' birth
To glorify the earth

Then He came...

One Child
Can change the world
Christmas morn
The King of all Kings was born
He reigns forever more
Let us worship and adore
Christ the Lord

Oh a wondrous star
Led shepherds and wisemen
Through valleys and mountains
Angels surrounded them
As they traveled far

As heaven and hope
Rang out for the savior
The sweet Prince of peace
Lay majestically
Asleep glorious and pure
And His mercy endures

For always...

One Child
Can change the world
Christmas morn
The King of all Kings was born
He reigns forever more
Let us worship and adore
Christ the Lord

One Child
Can change the world
Christmas morn
The King of all Kings was born
He reigns forever more
Let us worship and
Let us worship and
Let us worship
Christ the Lord

An angel appeared
An angel appeared
Christ the Lord
On Christmas morn
