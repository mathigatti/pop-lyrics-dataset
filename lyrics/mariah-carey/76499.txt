My dear, my dear, my dear,
You do not know me
But I know you very well
So let me tell about Da Brat tatatat
I'm light skin, redbone,
Peanut butter complexion
Very affectionate, very direct
When I'm expressing myself
I'm 5'5"
My astrology sign is aries
Thick in my thighs, 36Bs
Pretty brown eyes, no hair weaves
Put it down with hese lucious suckable
Lips
Making you wanna reach out and touch'em
Come on and give me a kiss
Could it be those hips just pokin out of my jeans
I showed them once or twice
And some niggers have become feems 
I'm a javouci rocking, hat cockin,
Blunt smoking
No stopping, weave cocking
With constant heat dropping
Bombs on nonbelievers charming
All the people
They call it the life of leisure
I'm preaching what I'm speaking
This shit you ain't used to seeing
So please believe it you needin the B
To the R muthafucking AT


I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you
And I can't let it go

I'm steppin in the club now ya'll
Hey now
Niggers showing me love ya'll
Hey now
I rapp for my thugs ya'll, hey now
Especially my niggers,
They got the ouoo!
I'd be sitting in my car waiting on you
To drop off my package
A big zipped locked baggy to support my habit
We'll go together like roger
And jessica rabbit
I'm spoiled rotten,
I'm rocking pink silk panties
At the moment
But I'm sport cotton
But jeanie's dreamin of
Jeanie will blink me to scottie
So he can beam me pump adrenaline
Into my blook steam
Proceed extremely with caution
I'm probably gleaming
Because my bling bling is
Worth a fortune
It seems things will never change
So I puffed often cause these dayz,
Niggers is crazy
You can't pay me to roll without my AK

I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you
And I can't let it go

I can't let go of this game
I can't let go of this fame
But for sure, before I go
You niggers gonna know my name
Cause I'm so doogie, one in a million
Cop a brazzillion for the coochie
That rides smoothly
Pass the doogie, the dutchie
Rudely interrupted, your regularly
Scheduled program
I throw down and bust it
There ain't no hoe around touching me
I'm sharper than cutlerly
I slice niggers to itty bitty pieces

I'm steppin in the club now ya'll
Hey now
Niggers showing me love ya'll
Hey now
I rapp for my thugs ya'll, hey now
Especially my niggers,
They got the ouoo!

I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you
And I can't let it go...
