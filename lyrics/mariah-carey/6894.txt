I've often wondered if there's
Ever been a perfect family
I've always longed for undividedness
And sought stability


A flower taught me how to pray
But as I grew that flower changed
She started flailing in the wind
Like golden petals scattering

CHORUS 1
And I miss you dandelion
And even love you
And I wish there was a way
For me to trust you
But it hurts me everytime
I try to touch you
But I miss you dandelion
And even love you

I gravitated towards a patriarch
So young predictably
I was resigned to spend my life
Within a maze of misery

A boy and a girl befriended me
We're bonded through despondency
I stayed so long but finally
I fled to save my sanity

CHORUS 2
And I miss you little sis and
Little brother
And I hope you realize
I'll always love you
And although you're struggling
You will recover
And I miss you little sis and
Little brother

So many I considered
Closest to me
Turned on a dime and sold me
Out dutifully
Although that knife was chipping
Away at me
They turned their eyes away and
Went home to sleep

CHORUS 3
And I missed a lot of life
But I'll recover
Though I know you really like
To see me suffer
Still I wish that you and I'd
Forgive each other
'Cause I miss you, Valentine
And really loved you

I really loved you-
I tried so hard
But you drove me away
To preserve my sanity-
And I found the strength
To break away
Fly...
