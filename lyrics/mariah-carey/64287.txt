I guess your mamma never told you that what goes around comes back around

I should've left it at how ya doin?
I should've left it at I like your music too and
I should've never called you back when you pursued me
I should've never given you my fuckin' two way
I should've never listened to your woeful stories
The ones I'm sure you told a thousand times before me
You should've never intimated that we were lovers
When you know very well we never even touched each other


Who's gonna love you when It all falls down?
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
(I guess your mamma never told you that what goes around comes back around)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
(I guess your mamma never told you that what goes around comes back around)

I gotta break it to aya delicately honey
Takin' my g5 twenty minutes wasn't nothin'
But I guess you wouldn't know
That's the way I roll
Consequently now your ego's fully overblown
You don't want the world to know
That you're just a puppet show
And the little boy inside
Often sits at home alone
And cries, cries, cries, cries

Who's gonna love you when It all falls down?
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore

Your pain is so deep rooted
What will your life become?
Sure you hide it but you're lost and lonesome
Still just a frail shook one

(Tell me who's gonna love you?)
Who's gonna love you when It all falls down?
(Who? I'de like to know)
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
(If you didn't have nothing)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
(Who? Who'd still be there?)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
(Nobody, nobody, nobody)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
(Ohh there ain't nobody baby)
(Bullies in the school yard)
(When they fall, they fall hard)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
(Yeah so you better think twice, better play nice)

(Cause who's)
Who's gonna love you when It all falls down?
(Gonna be there when the jokes on you?)
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
(A marionette show)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
(Who's makin you move thought?)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
(I know what kills you slow)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
(I'm gonna keep your little secret thought)
(And you know that I know)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
(You're no super hero)

I guess your mamma never told you that what goes around comes back around
Pow
