If you've ever had
A broken heart
You promise yourself
To never let it happen again
Ddon't wanna think about it
Don't wanna dream about it
But it finds
It's way back into your head


The i love you' 's
The i need you' 's
They're only words
That people say
They're just words
When they're hand in hand
With the games that people play

If i never see
The top of a mountain
If i never set
One foot in the sea
I promise you
I'll love you forever
You'll always be
The biggest part of me

Chorus:
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will follow
You've changed the way
That i need to think
In promise you
I'll love you forever
You'll always be
The biggest part of me

Take a look at me
I let you have my heart
I swore i'd never let it
Happen again
I'm not mad about it
But i know on you girl
I can depend

'I love you' 's
'I need you' 's
Are only words
That people say
They're just words
When they're hand in hand
With the games
That people play

If i never see
The top of a mountain
If i never set
One foot in the sea
I promise you
I'll love you forever
You'll always be
The biggest part of me

(Chorus)

I believe
Yes, i believe
I believe in love again
And i swear
I'll always be there
Isn't that the way
That it should be?

If i never see
The top of a mountain
If i never set
One foot in the see
