If I could recaputre
All of the memories
And bring them to life
Surely I would
Hear the distant laughter
Wasn't it you and me
Survivng the night
You're faiding out of my sight
Swiftly


You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing

I was so enraputred
No sensability
To open my eyes
I misunderstood
Now you're fading faster
It's suddenly hard to see
You're talking the light
Letting the shadows inside
Swiftly

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're

Reaching out into the distance
Searching for spirits of that past
Just a trace of your existance
To grasp

And if somehow I could recaputre
All of the memories
And bring them to life
Lord know I would
But now you're fading faster
Getting so hard to see
You're talking the light
Letting the darkness inside
Swiftly

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing

You're vanishing
Drifting so far away
You're vanishing
Away
