O o o oo o o o oo o o o oo o o o
Here's your standing o


Boy you remind me
Of a love that seemed so sublime
Your kisses told me, oh, so many lies
Shades on like I be stuntin' through the night
But I'm just hiding puffy eyes
To keep the world from knowing what's inside
I didn't know O-O-O-O-O-O
I was a show O-O-O-O-O-O

And your words, they had no meaning
How didn't I foresee this
Happiness and congrats
And all that I'll pretend I mean it

So cheers, toast, bravo to you
'Cause you're the man of the hour
I'mma have to send you some flowers
Whoa, cheers, toast, bravo to you
The man of the hour
You played the one that loved you the most

So here's your standing o
O o o oo o o o oo o o o oo o o o
Boy, so here's your standing o
O o o oo o o o oo o o o oo o o o
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it
So here's your standing o

Here's your standing ovation
Doctor, I was too patient
Even when you wasn't enough
I'm the one who taught you how to love

And, boy, I gave you all of me
The parts of affection you couldn't see
As you embrace her in your arms, give her my all
Give her more than you gave to me

When you had nothing, I gave
When you were weak, I made you brave
You want to leave me with scars on my heart
It's funny how y'all forget it all

So cheers, toast, bravo to you
'Cause you're the man of the hour
I'mma have to send you some flowers
Whoa, cheers, toast, bravo, to you
The man of the hour
You played the one that loved you the most

So here's your standing
O o o oo o o o oo o o o oo o o o
Boy, so here's your standing
O o o oo o o o oo o o o oo o o o
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it
So here's your standing o

Round of applause
To the biggest fool in the world
Give them all that you got
And they still ride out
Into the sunset with the next girl
