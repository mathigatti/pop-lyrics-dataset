I'd never have known
The way it feels to love
Without the love
You showered
Down upon me
Warm
Warm as the sun
Melting away the rain
Giving me strenght
To face another morning


So many times I felt afraid
And turned to you
To find my way
I reach inside
And find you there
You are with me everywhere

All
It would take all
All of my life to find
Someone more there for me
There for me
And I'm never alone
Cause in my heart I know
You're always there for me
There for me

I
I won't let go
Of precious memories
They are the light of hope
That burns inside me
And everytime I lose my way
You shine for me
And I'm okay
You lead me way beyond it all
And you never let me fall

All
It would take all
All of my life to find
Someone more there for me
There for me
And I'm never alone
Cause in my heart I know
You're always there for me
There for me

You'll always catch me
When I fall

All
It would take all
All of my life to find
Someone more there for me
There for me
And I'm never alone
Cause in my heart I know
You're always there for me
There for me

My love
You're always there for me
