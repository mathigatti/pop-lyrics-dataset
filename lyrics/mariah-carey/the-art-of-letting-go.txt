I'm making a statement
Of my own opinion
Just a brief little reminder
To help myself remember
I no longer live in your dominion
No, no, no


You're just trifling
Nothing more than a liability
Gotta abandonate all your possessions
Outside the kitchen window right now

Letting go
Letting go ain't easy
Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful
'Cause somebody you used to know
Is flinging your world around
And they watch as you're falling
Down, down, down
Falling down, baby

Evidently your words were
Merely lies
Reverberating in my ears
And the echo won't subside

There's deep, deep loss of hope
And the anger burns in me
I hope you don't get no ideas 'bout re-uniting, baby
'Cause that's the last thing I truly need

Your audacity
Is too much to be believed
So, go to mimi on your contacts...
Press delete

Letting go ain't easy
Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful
'Cause somebody you used to know
Is flinging your world around
And they watch as you're falling
Down, down, down, down

Baby, letting go ain't easy
Baby, letting go ain't easy

Baby, letting go
It ain't easy
'Cause somebody you used to know
Is flinging your world around
And you know what?
They watch as you're falling
As you're falling
Down

Fall, it ain't easy, baby
