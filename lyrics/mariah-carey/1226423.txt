Take this seriously
Like pac, all eyes on me
That's right you are intrigued
I'm that chick you like
You know this what it be
I'm like the lottery
Hot bentley with the keys
Take me for a ride


Wipe in the sky, let's fly high
Boy, I got you caught up inside of my haze
And you're gonna be gone for days

I'm like that oooweee
You're fiendin to blaze up and taste me
Got flavor like ice cream
'Cause I'm that chick you like
And you know you need this, man
And you know I got this, man
Gonna be your everything
I'm that chick you like

La da da oooweee
I'm that chick you like
La da da oooweee
I'm that chick you like

I do'z it naturally
Hypnotize like biggie
But you ain't havin' dreams
I'm that chick you like
Nah you ain't seeing things
Or hallucinating
I brings that levity
Take me for a ride

Wipe in the sky, let's fly high
Boy, I got you caught up inside of my haze
And you're gonna be gone for days

I'm like that oooweee
You're fiendin to blaze up and taste me
Got flavor like ice cream
'Cause I'm that chick you like
And you know you need this, man
And you know I got this, man
Gonna be your everything
I'm that chick you like

La da da oooweee
I'm that chick you like
La da da oooweee
I'm that chick you like

Boy, just relax and unwind
Pull me in and breathe, once you do
There ain't no rules, it's up to you
(Ain't no rules, it's time)
Just keep on kissin' me
Hold on and, baby, we
Could party all night through the night
All right

I'm like that oooweee
You're fiendin to blaze up and taste me
Got flavor like ice cream
'Cause I'm that chick you like
And you know you need this, man
And you know I got this, man
Gonna be your everything
I'm that chick you like

La da da oooweee
I'm that chick you like
La da da oooweee
I'm that chick you like

I'm like that uptown haze
Them real thugs blaze
We'll touch the sky
'Cause I'm that chick you like
