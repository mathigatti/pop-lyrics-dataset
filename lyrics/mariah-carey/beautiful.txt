A$AP Rocky:
It's like our first date
Time pass fast like the flash of a blink
A little Chardonnay, lingerie and a mink
All I can think (oh, oh, you're beautiful)
So don't complain when I'm in home late
A couple loose lips and the ship gon' sink
Don't even try to act like your shit don't stink
But still, A$AP
Hold up, wait, hit both brakes
Fuck third base 'cause I hit home plate
I'mma party hard like the disco days
Fat black plaques and a french roll braid
'Cause homie pack steel like below waist
Shorty got grilled like chipotle
And my favorite meal be the shrimp lo mein
But still


Miguel:
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that
And a smile so bright
Oh, you're killing me
You know it ain't fair

You're beautiful
And your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can't pretend
That that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You're beautiful
Good Lord, you're fucking beautiful
And I can't pretend
That that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah

Mariah Carey:
I like when you run red lights
Don't stop 'til you thrill me
Oh, how you thrill me
Always in control
How you do it, I don't know
But I don't care
Take me anywhere

'Cause it's beautiful
Ooh, you make me feel undressable
And I can't pretend
That that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, ooh
You're beautiful
And your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can't pretend
That that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yes

You're beautiful
Good Lord, you're fucking beautiful
And I can't pretend
That that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah

Ah, ah, you're beautiful
Ah, ah, you're beautiful
Ah, ah, you're beautiful
Ah, ah, you're beautiful
