I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm colder


In my life
There's been heartache and pain
I don't know
If I can face it again
Can't stop now
I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

Gonna take a little time (take a little time)
A little time to look around me (oh)
I've got nowhere left to hide (nowhere left to hide)
It looks like love's finally found me (oh)

In my life
There's been heartache and pain
I don't know
If I can face it again
Can't stop now
I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is (oh)
I want you to show me (me)
I wanna feel what love is (feel what love is)
And I know you can show me (show me, I wanna know)

I wanna know what love is (I wanna know)
I want you to show me (and I feel you so much, love)
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me

Oh, let's talk about love
