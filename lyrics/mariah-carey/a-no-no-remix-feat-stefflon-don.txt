I ain't even mad, no, not like befo'
Off with your head, now slither out the door
Snakes in the grass, it's time to cut the lawn
Ed Scissorhands, AKA I cut you off (no)
You ain't gonna lie to my face no mo'
Hit me with I'm sorry, but I'm sorry (no)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (no)
Get me Ed Shapiro on the phone
Case closed

You shoulda known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no 'tention to you

[Mariah Carey &amp; Stefflon Don]

[Mariah Carey]
You came so close, you just don't know
Irregardless of what transpired
It ain't even worthy of a slick reply
Even if I was the last woman alive
I would be like Ginger, you ain't Gilligan
I really don't care, I'm in love with the island
Rockin' Dior 'cause it goes with my diamonds
Got a pink gown Custom by Alaia
I'll be on stage when the stadium light up

You shoulda' known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no 'tention to you

I said no
No, no, no
A no-no

That's a no-no

[Stefflon Don]
Trippin' on 'dis saint, never been a clown
Kept my legs closed, I ain't never been about
So I don't understand why you got yo'
Tongue on my name
Most bitches talk shit, then get punched in the face
The name's Don
And they don't call me that for nothin'
Fear ain't in my blood, I ain't scared of nothin'
I take the trash out
Brothers wan' play me, I blow they back out
I ain't with the he say, she say, get the strap out
Got the bloodclaat and my tribe
Burn down 'ya house like Lisa Left Eye
A-A-Ain't no nigga left, aye
It's plain and simple, they addicted to me
I keep it ghetto, then I flip it like a perro in heat
If you got money, then you'd betta' put 'ya money on me
It's MOB
Money over bum niggas and D
All you see, you ain't 'pressing me, you never get the best of me
Chanel Coco, keep these nigga bitches bailin' me
They like my posts on the 'Gram, but they envy me
Snatchin' bitches crimes, committin' felonies
(Definitely)
