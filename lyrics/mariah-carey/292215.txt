Don't forget about us
Don't baby, don't baby
Don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
Don't baby, don't baby
Don't let it go
My baby
(Y'all know what this is)


Just let it die
With no goodbyes
Details don't matter
We both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes
It'd be like that baby
Now everytime I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn, and I walk and I let it ride
Baby I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
Don't forget about (us)

Late nights playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, You'll always be in my heart and
I can see in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh They say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know
Nothing comes close to
What we had it perseveres
(That we both can't forget it
How big we used to get it)
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one
That's a fact
That you can't deny
So baby we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we both regret
So don't forget about us

Late nights playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, You'll always be in my heart and
I can see in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

At least she got you
Hell I messed up
Now that's all trickery
Sure I ain't act like you know how this lovin used to be
I bet she can't do it like me
She'll never be MC
Baby don't you, don't you forget about Us

Late nights playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms boy
You'll always be in my heart and
I can see in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby no
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
