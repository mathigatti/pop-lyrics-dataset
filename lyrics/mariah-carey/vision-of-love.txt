I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be


I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you Lord

If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it
Make it happen

I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through without you by my side
I'd give my all to have

Just one more night with you
Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow
In time, you'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on

And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you, you, you, you

I didn't mean it when I said
I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should have let you go

I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
Right here, 'cause, baby
When you left I lost a part of me

It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby
We belong together

(oh, oh, you're beautiful)
I like when you run red lights
Don't stop 'til you thrill me
Oh, how you thrill me

Always in control
How you do it, I don't know
But I don't care
Take me anywhere

'Cause it's beautiful
Ooh, you make me feel undressable
And I can't pretend
That that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, ooh
You're beautiful
