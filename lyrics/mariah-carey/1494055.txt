Once upon a time
We swore not to say goodbye
Something got a hold of us and we changed
Then you sat alone in pride
And I sat at home and cried
How'd our fairytale just end up this way


We went round for round til' we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through
These emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you
Break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you

This was a love phenomenon
No one could explain
And I wish I could press reset
And feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind and watch us everynight
Wanna pause it, but I can't make it stay

We went round for round til' we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pay like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through
These emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you
Break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you

No need to call my phone
'Cause I changed my number today
And matter fact, I think I'm moving away (away)
Sorry, the frustrations got me feeling that way
And I just keep having one last thing to say
And I just wanna hold you, touch you
Feel you, be near you
I miss you baby baby baby
I'm tired of tryin to fake through
But there's nothing I can do
Boy I can't wait to hate you

I can't wait to hate you
Make you, pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through
These, emotional changes
Seems like such a lost 'cause
I can't wait to face you
Break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you, baby
