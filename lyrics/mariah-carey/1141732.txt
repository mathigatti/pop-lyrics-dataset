Good times
Any time you meet a payment
Good times
Any time you meet a friend
Good times
Any time you're out from under
Not getting hassled
Not getting hustled
Keeping your head above water
Making a wave when you can
Temporary lay offs
Good times
Easy credit rip offs
Good times
Scratching and surviving
Good times
Hanging in a jury
Good times
Ain't we lucky we got them
Good times
(Yeah)


Work
You better work
(Work the runway)
Work it girls
(Work it out)
Work it girls
(Sashay)

The divas
Okay, okay
