I got one for the money

[Mariah:]

for a moment in time
and it seemed everlasting
that you would always be mine
now you want to be free
so I'll let you fly
'cause I know in my heart baby
our love will never die
[CHORUS:]
[Xscape:]
you'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinetly
boy don't you know you can't escape me
ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
and we'll linger on

no way you're ever gonna shake me
ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

'cause you know in your heart babe

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[BREAKDOWN:]
[Xscape &amp; Mariah:]
I know that you'll be back boy
when your days and your nights get a little bit colder
I know that you'll be right back baby
oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time

[VERSE:]
[Da Brat]
Who brings the ruckus and the pain like Ness
it's evident tha residents of So So Def
Got the industry on lock where
outsiders can't enter
Ever since the arrival of this west side
Representer who rocks your musicbox
And break down your structure you
Fantasize as you visualize me as your dreamlover (WHOA!)
With your emotions unplugging your daydream face
Reality reason through mc's
Inflicting fatalities
Ain't no cap on my salary
I'm gettin' g's if you heard of me's
Then you know that we's makin' g's
Let's Xscape with Mariah Carey and me
To tha back steady stacking papers smokin' on fat
Stacks of danks see to some
I'm a hero of this feel on file
But that's my style
And they don't pay me nor can they fade me
So what I do is keep it true and real
For my peeps in that street cause to them
I'ma always be their baby

[Mariah:]
May we always be together
In the sands of time

[REPEAT REPRISE OUT TO FADE]
[2ND TIME OF REPRISE REPEAT CHORUS OUT]
