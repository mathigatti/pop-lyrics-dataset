Baby, I had enough of danger
And people on the street
I’m looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it’s time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don’t, just let me go


‘Cause teacher, the things
That I don’t want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don’t wanna learn
Hold you, touch you
(touch you)
Think that you’re mine
(Think that you’re mine)
Because it ain’t no joy
For an uptown boy, whose teacher has told him goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn’t fear the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me NO
So you think that you love me
Know That you need me
I wrote this song, I know it’s wrong
Just let me go

And teach her, the things
That I don’t want to learn
Oh the last one I had
Made me cry, oh
So I don’t wanna learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you’re mine
Because it ain’t no joy
For an uptown boy, whose teacher has told him goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Who is that teacher
I’m the student
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Boy I’m just gonna say
You are my teacher
You are my leader

So when you say that you need me
That you’ll never leave me
I know you’re wrong
You’re not that strong
Let me go

And teach her, the things
That I still have to learn
But the one that I had
Is my cry
Oh, so I don’t wanna learn
Hold you, touch you
(touch you)
Think that you’re mine
Because it ain’t no joy
For an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold
Inside
Maybe just one more try
