You know you got me
You know you got me
You know you got me
You know you got me


Uh it's Mariah and Free
Just Blaze beats, yeah
It's the Roc and Mariah and the women go (oh)
And I love it when the ladies sing (uh uh uh uh)
And they love it when the whistles blow over the ring
Slide upon ya strip and go (Uh uh uh uh)
Just to pick up ya sister bro
You like to pick and choose who she dates
While I state who I like to stick and move
Silly fool, she know that I got her
I'll run up on the strip and go (Uh uh uh uh)
For Mariah play a brother role
I'll play a different role
Let her roll in the wheel, long days nowhere to go
And no other slimie will do
She just like honey so she got me like Winnie the Pooh
Long nights let her chill with the crew
Only backwards will do and she know how to roll
They say out with the old and in with the new
But she's my dreamlover so I can't let go, hell no
Please believe me, I've never been a liar
Touch fire Mariah and Free-weezy

I get shy around you
Don't know what to say
I don't know what to do
'Cause you do something to me
That I can't describe baby

Always catch myself thinkin' 'bout
The things you do
There ain't no one else
I got my heart set on you
You really got me, baby it's true

You know you got me
So in love
You know you got me
Daydreamin' 'bout us
You know you got me
Starry eyed and elated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby
You know you got me
Hypnotized
You know you got me
With you on my mind
You know you got me
Feeling intoxicated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby

Boy I'm entangled up in you
These feelings I just can't elude
'Cause you're so captivating
That I inadvertantly

Always catch myself thinkin' 'bout
The things you do
There ain't no one else
I got my heart set on you
You really got me, baby it's true

You know you got me
So in love
You know you got me
Daydreamin' 'bout us
You know you got me
Starry eyed and elated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby
You know you got me
Hypnotized
You know you got me
With you on my mind
You know you got me
Feeling intoxicated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby

Mami got me buyin' property
Speedin' too fast, high velocity
Coppin' bracelets, baby rock piece
Vacation in Centro and Capri
And usually I be on my shit
Harlem Shakin' these groupies off me quick
But this time it's diff
Think the love gon' stick
Like Velcro, let go, hell no
Ma, you know you got me

Said I'm insecure when I'm around you
Don't know what to say or do
Catching feelings boy, in spite of myself
I can't think of nobody else sugar
You're the star of all my dreams
I just wanna be your everything
Boy you know you really got me

You know you got me
So in love
You know you got me
Daydreamin' 'bout us
You know you got me
Starry eyed and elated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby
You know you got me
Hypnotized
You know you got me
With you on my mind
You know you got me
Feeling intoxicated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby

You know you got me
So in love
You know you got me
Daydreamin' 'bout us
You know you got me
Starry eyed and elated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby
You know you got me
Hypnotized
You know you got me
With you on my mind
You know you got me
Feeling intoxicated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby
