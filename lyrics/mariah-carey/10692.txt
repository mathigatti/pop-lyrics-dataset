Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace


Silent night
Holy night
Son of God
Oh love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Jesus, Lord at thy birth
Oh, Jesus, Lord at thy birth

Sleep, sleep
Sleep in heavenly, heavenly peace
Sleep, sleep, sleep in heavenly, heavenly, heavenly peace
Peace, peace
Sleep, sleep, sleep in heavenly peace
