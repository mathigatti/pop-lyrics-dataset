(What it look like
What it do


What it look like
What it do)

Got me fly and sexy
Somethin' in you gets me
So tingly inside
Visions of us in the club tonight
And I find you so appealing
Definitely feeling you
If you didn't know
Boy you're the secret I've never told

Betcha think I'm teasin'
But I ain't got no reason
To deny
The way I feel inside
Tonight
I just wanna touch you
Put my hands on you
And love you
You'll be like
"I want you over and over and
Over and over again"

What it look like
Me and you
Makin' it last all night
What it do, what it do
My heart it's beating faster
All the time
What it look like, look like
Boy you don't even know
Everythin' that flows
Through my mind
What it do, what it do
Ooh boy, what you gon' do about it?

[JD Rap]
Listen I got stacks like
The international house of pancakes
Your man great, got more Rovers then a Land makes
I make hits and i don't care about your damn hates
Can't stop doing it , i just do it for the fans sake
You know this man take trips to japan
Tell him to try to run out away
What would I land on
'05's my year
'06 ain't stoppin'
You woke up again and your chart I'm toppin'



What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freaking you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freaking you

Tonight
I need your body
Tonight
You got my time
Tonight
You won't be sorry
Tonight
You gon' be mine

Betcha think I'm teasin'
But I ain't got no reason
To deny
The way I feel inside
Tonight
I just wanna touch you
Put my hands on you
And love you
You'll be like
"I want you over and over and
Over and over again"

What it look like
Me and you
Makin' it last all night
What it do, what it do
My heart it's beating faster
All the time
What it look like, look like
Boy you don't even know
Everythin' that flows
Through my mind
What it do, what it do
Ooh boy, what you gon' do about it
