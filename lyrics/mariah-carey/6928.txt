Last night a dj saved my life
Last night a dj saved my life yeah
Cause I was sitting there bored to death
And in just one breath he said
You gotta get up you gotta get on you gotta get down girl


You know you drive me crazy baby
You've got me turning to another man
Called you on the phone
No one's home
Baby why leave me all alone
And if it wasn't for the music
I don't know what I'd do

Last night a dj saved my life
Last night a dj saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a dj saved my life
Last night a dj saved my life with a song

You know I hopped into my car
Didn't get very far no
Before I had you on my mind
Why be so unkind
You've got your women all around
All around this town
But I was trapped in love with you
And I didn't know what to do
But when I turned on my radio
I found out all I needed to know

Check it out
Hey listen up to your local dj
You better hear what he's got to say

There's not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it in the mix
And if your man gives you trouble
Just you move out on the double
And don't let it trouble your brain
'Cause way goes trouble down the drain
Said way goes trouble down the drain

Last night a dj saved my life
There's not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it in the mix
There's not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it in the mix
In the mix, in the mix
Last night a dj saved
My life
In the mix, in the mix
