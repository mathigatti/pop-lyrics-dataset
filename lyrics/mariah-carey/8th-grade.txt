I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life


That cigarette, put it out, put it out
Keep lookin' my way, turn around, turn around
This is a moment you can't buy
I see that longing in your eyes

Somethin' is tellin' me you're ready, am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me, then I was gone?
Better not be leadin' me on

I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life

I'm a confirmation, should you feel unsure
I'm that security when you're insecure
I'll be that baby girl when you're immature
Don't be ambivalent towards me

Somethin' is tellin' me you're ready, am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me, then I was gone?
Better not be leadin' me on

I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose (nothing)
Never no pressure (never)
Just put yourself into my shoes (into my shoes)
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life (I'm not your life, oh baby I'm)

I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life (baby, I wanna be your life)
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules (limitless)
Nothin' to lose (nothing to lose)
Never no pressure (no pressure)
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life, baby
Aah

Break it down
(I'm not your world)
(No, I'm not your life)
(Tell me what that means to you)
Said, I'm not your world
(By your side)
(Limitless, without no rules)
(Nothin' to lose)
Nothin' to lose, no pressure
Uh (Limitless, without no rules)
(Nothin' to lose)
Nothing (c'mon, MC)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (c'mon)
Nothin' to lose, no pressure (break it)
No pressure (break it)
Ooh (c'mon, MC)
Ah, ah, ah, ah (uh, c'mon)
La-da-da-da-da-da, I'm not your life (what you say, girl?)
Limitless, without no rules (break it)
Your life (c'mon, what you say, girl?)
(What you say, girl?)
(What you say, girl?)
(C'mon)
