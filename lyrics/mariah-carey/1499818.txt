And I was like: Why are you so obsessed with me?

So, oh, oh, oh, oh (hey, hey, hey)
So, oh, oh, oh, oh (hey, hey, hey, hey)
So, oh, oh, oh, oh (will the real MC, please)
So, oh, oh, oh, oh (step to the mic?)
So, oh, oh, oh, oh (MC, MC)
So, oh, oh, oh, oh (you need an MC)
So, oh, oh, oh, oh (place to be)
So, oh, oh, oh, oh (MC the MC)


All up in the blogs sayin' we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Sayin' we up in your house, sayin' I'm up in your car
But you in LA and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'

Oh, oh, why you so obsessed with me?
Boy, I wanna know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me
When everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Oh, oh, oh

Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losin' your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, ya know
Why you wastin' your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you, like you're bathin' in Windex
Oh, oh, oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?

So, oh, oh, oh, oh
So, oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all my ladies say)
(Obsessed)
So, oh, oh, oh, oh
So, oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all my girls say)
(Obsessed)

You're on your job, you're hatin' hard
Ain't gon' feed ya, I'ma let ya starve
Graspin' for air, I'm ventilation
You're out of breath, hope you ain't waitin'
Tellin' the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you trippin'?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference and you're a conversation

Oh, oh, why you so obsessed with me?
And boy, I wanna know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me
When everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Oh, oh, oh

Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this

See right through you, like you're bathin' in Windex

(Hey, he's all up in my George Foreman)
Boy, I wanna know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me
(Lyin' that you're sexin' me, me)
When everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Oh, oh, oh

Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
(He's all up in my George Foreman)
Boy you're losin' your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, ya know
(But I can't do nothing for him)
Why you wastin' your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon Complex
(You love me, you love me)
See right through you, like you're bathin' in Windex
(You really, really love me)
