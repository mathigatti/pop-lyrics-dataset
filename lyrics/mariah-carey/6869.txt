No, I can't forget this evening
Nor your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows


No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

No, I can't forget this evening
Nor your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

(Oh! I can't live)
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, can't give anymore
