Uh huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
With you


With you, you, you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
(Mustard on that beat, ho)

It was all so overwhelming
She was like: I don't know, don't tell me
He had eyes that said: Girl, I'll save you
She had doubts, like they might not make it
So both held tight to face it
They wrote vows, she was bound to take him
She was full of such trepidation
There in front of the whole damn nation

It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this role
He said: Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong

Ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn, I fucks with you
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, boy
Oh, baby, I'm in love, it's true

With you, you, you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
Baby, I'm in love, it's true

Waves were breakin' on the shore
As we were sneakin' through that door
Had to leave by half past 4
Still I yearned to touch you more and more

It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this role
He said: Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong

Ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn, I fucks with you
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm supposed to do boy
Oh, baby, I'm in love, it's true

And ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn, I fucks with you
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, boy
Oh, baby, I'm in love, it's true

With you, you, you (with you, with you, with you)
With you, you, you (oh, yeah)
With you, you, you (oh, yeah)
Oh, baby, I'm in love, it's true
