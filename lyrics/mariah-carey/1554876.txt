Yet another early morning
And you walk in like it’s nothing
Hold up, hold up, hold tight
Ain’t no donuts, ain’t no coffee
See I know you see me calling and calling
I should crack you right in your forehead


Let me take a breath (let me take a breath)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (told you one more time)
If you effed up it’s over

When it’s gone, it’s gone, it’s gone, it’s gone
You’re dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo-do-do-do-do, scoo-do-do-do-do baby
It’s a wrap for you baby (it’s a wrap)
It’s a wrap for you boy (it’s a wrap)
Oh, baby

If I ever misrepresented my self-image
Then I’m sorry
I was oh so acquiescent
But I learn my lesson
Boy, you’re sorry
Bump-bump-bump-bump
All out in the open
Don't make me go call Maury Povich

Let me take a breath (let me take a breath)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (told you one more time)
If you effed up it’s over

When it’s gone, it’s gone, it’s gone, it’s gone
You’re dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo-do-do-do-do, scoo-do-do-do-do baby
It’s a wrap for you baby (it’s a wrap)
It’s a wrap for you boy (it’s a wrap)
Oh, baby

Put all of your shit in the elevator
It’s going down like a denominator
Trying to keep holding on, holding on
Boy, let me go
You gon’ wake my neighbors, get away from my door
That was your last shot, you ain’t coming back
It’s the martini I mean it, baby
It’s a wrap

When it’s gone, it’s gone, it’s gone, it’s gone
You’re dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So wrong, so wrong (you’re dead wrong)
So just scoo-do-do-do-do, scoo-do-do-do-do baby

Boy I'm checkin' the gate
I told you
I told you
If you f'ed up one more time it's over
So get up out my face I'm hung over
Been sitting here all night
Leave me alone
Since quarter to three I been drinkin' Patrón
Watch the credits roll
It's a wrap
