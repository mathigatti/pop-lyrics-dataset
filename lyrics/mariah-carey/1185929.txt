Do the thing
Watch yourself
Get on the floor
Move your feet


Mystikal
There ain't nothing you can do with the man
Except for shake yo ass and clap yo hands
Bob your head and move your feet
I ain't the type of rapper just to ride the beat
I set the track on fire
I take the roof, the house and knock out your tyres
It's the funk in here
Let mystikal move you and Mariah sing


CHORUS

Mariah
Don't stop, baby
It's ecstacy
Turn me up little higher
Baby, light my fire
Tell me every little thing you wanna do
Baby, I'm into you
Don't stop, baby
It's ecstacy
Turn me up little higher
Baby, light my fire
Tell me every little thing you wanna do
I just wanna love you
(bob yo head and move yo feet)

Mystikal
Heads up, look out, it's about to go down,
And what they didn't know about me then, I bet they know now
I'm bout to prove my fame
So just get out the way and let me do the thing
Its on tonight
I'm known to be more vulgar than the garbage truck
You can't stop the train
You ain't got no umbrella so get your ass out the rain
You ain't louder than this
I'm like a bowl of gumbo, you ain't hotter than this
I'm what they play in the club
I keep them moving till I leave, thats what they paying me for
You already know what i do
So have my money and my munchies and my cigar too
I'm known for bringing the heat
Ain't nobody cutting up but MC now MC



Chorus



Mystikal
Go head **** and party,
Mix that with that dark but don't waste that on my Jordans,
Keep laughing till your mouth tired,
Go ahead and lit something up but take that ciggarette outside,
Get on the floor,
Its another number one debut for sure,
Now say it ain't real,
And if i ain't a fool why you can't keep still, sing



Mariah
I feel it
And i let it get into me,
Jamaica funk thats what it was,
Oh let it get into you....



Chorus



Repeat chorus till fade
