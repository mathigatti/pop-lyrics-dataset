I'd raher be with you but you never tried to Holla
We could spend a couple milly actin' silly in Milano
Boy hit your horn beep beep I'll follow
Have your whip in my driveway by tomorrow
Secretly I know you wanna hit it like the Lotto
And after that we can ketchup like tomato
We can make love in Italy in the Grotto
Fresh off the jet at the met
They're screamin' Bravo, Bravo, Bravo


Steppin in my Jimmy Choo's Yeah
I got it all cute for ya baby
Nothing like them other girls
I Would never be rude to you baby
Can't wait just say that you wanna be

More Than Just Friends
Boy I'm gonna love you until the end
The end, The end, The end, The end
More Than Just Friends
Boy I'm gonna love you until the end
The end, The end, The end, The end
More Than Just Friends
Boy, Until the end

Boy you got me all mixed up like Serato
You got me spinnin' round for ya like a lil' model
Steady fiendin for you like them fries at McDonalds
I wanna be all on your lips like gelato
Permanently paint me in your picture like picasso
Love me down till i hit the top of my soprano
We can pop bottles get me actin' all me Llamo
Then baby come and flip this thing like a channel

Steppin in my Chrissy Lou'S Yeah

The end, The end, The end, The end
More Than Just Friends
Boy I'm gonna love you until the end
The end, The end, The end, The end

Who's gonna speaj and start off this thing
Is it you is it me
We should say how we feel for real sugar baby
Boo i need you touch

Friendship just ain't enough
Boy, I wanna be with you until the end
