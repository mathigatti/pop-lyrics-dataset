I know the rhythm of the music
I see the beat in the dark
Emotion got me where I'm with him
It's so hard to get to your heart


Fascination you know it brought me to you
Satisfaction makes me want to
Want to start by tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart
Tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart

I know I'm only getting so close
I see you're up on your guard
Secrets I wanna get to know those
'Cause down deep I'm after your heart
All I'm giving is some good old-fashioned love
(Wanna give it all to ya)
I wanna give to ya prove it to you
Let me start by tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart
Tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart

Oh tearing down
Wanna take the time to show ya
Really wanna get to know ya
Oh tearing down

Let me start by tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart
Tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart

(Tearing down tearing down tearing...)

Fascination you know it brought me to you oh
Satisfaction makes me want to
Want to start by tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart
Tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart
