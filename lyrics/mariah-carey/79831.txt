I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through without you by my side

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Put your loving arms around me, boy
And hold me like I was a cuddly toy
Let me feel that warmth of your embrace
Don't let go

And there could be no sadder sight to see
Than if we were to miss this opportunity
So send me up a signal and I'll catch the line
If there's no time, you know it's up to you

(So why don't you)
Stay a little while, child
Stay a little while, child
Stay a little while, child
Stay a little while

And let's take it Uptown
Beat it down!

Since you put it that way, honey, I'm gon' stay
And only your love can make Peter parley
Let the limo leave and cancel the flight
And I, only will I stay, girl I'm spendin' the night
And if it's right, I'm spendin' my life, or album
If it seems like I'm rushin' then I'll sleep on the couch
MC it's your call, I'm ready to ball
And if you need me, I'm ready to brawl

And that's forever by law, together we ball, we taking it all
I'll make you feel a way a woman never felt before
I see women on many levels, never higher than yours
With a body like that, that face, no flaw
You got to be havin sense, saying you's a dime
You off to meet her in a seven and you like the way I rhyme
Yes I shine, I'm a veteran
Picture me and honey spendin' money like whatever then
We both got it

(Why won't you)
Stay a little while, child
Stay a little while, child
Stay a little while, child
Stay a little while

There's no need to act surprised
'Cause there's no room for selfless pride
So let's push love to the limit, and life to the edge
I've only one request of you
Stay a while

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
