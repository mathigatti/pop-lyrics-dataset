Oh, no, no

X-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on
Don't you know? Don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
X-girlfriend, you don't listen (X-girlfriend)
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go


Hey x-girlfriend
It's too bad when you had him your thing didn't work
But he's all mine now, so stop pursuing him
Before you get your feelings hurt
See, our love is hot and no, it won't stop
'Cause I got him on lock
And although he rejects you
It doesn't seem to affect you
'Cause you just keep trying to get with him

So don't, don't keep, keep calling
Hanging up the phone
When I answer, I know it
Tears you up inside and
Why do you sit in silence
On the other end
'Till I hang up and you
Predictably call right back again?

X-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on
Don't you know? Don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
X-girlfriend, you don't listen (X-girlfriend)
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

Hey x-girlfriend, whatever your name is
I'm really not amused
'Cause the things you do are very offensive
And sometimes straight up rude
All those late night calls and notes on his car
Won't get you anywhere
You can call his mom as much as you want
And he won't really care

So don't, don't keep, keep calling
Hanging up the phone
When I answer, I know it
Tears you up inside and
Why do you sit in silence
On the other end
'Till I hang up and you
Predictably call right back again?

X-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on
Don't you know? Don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
X-girlfriend, you don't listen (X-girlfriend)
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

I understand why (I understand why)
You want him back
But you need to know
Our love's too strong for you to penetrate
It's too late, he's not your baby no more
X-girlfriend, x-girlfriend (It's time to let him go)
X-girlfriend (X-girlfriend)
(Don't listen)
X-girlfriend
See, he's not gonna give in

X-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on
Don't you know? Don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
