(Diana Ross)
It's about 
Ain't no mountain high enough
If you need me, call me
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh
Uhhh
Uhhh
Yeah


(Spoken) (Diana Ross)
If you need me, call me.
No matter where you are, no matter how far.
Just call my name, I'll be there in a hurry.
On that you can depend and never worry.

No wind, no rain, no winters cold
Can stop me babe, if you are gone.
No wind, no rain can stop me babe
If you are gone.

(Faith Hill)
No wind, no rain, no winters cold
Can stop me babe, if you are gone.
No wind, no rain can stop me babe
If you are gone.

Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh

(Spoken) (Mariah Carey)
I know, I know you must follow the sun,
Where ever it leads...but remember...
And if you should fall short of your desires,
Remember life holds for you one guarantee.
You'll always have me.

(Spoken) (Donna Summer)
And if you should miss my lovin',
One of these old days...
If you should ever miss the arms 
That used to hold you so close,
Or the lips that used to touch yours
So tenderly.
Just remember what I told you,
The day I set you free...

Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you.
Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough,
To keep me from you.
Ain't no mountain high enough,
Nothing can keep me, 
Keep me from you!
Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough,
To keep me from you.
To keep me from you.

Ain't No Mountain High
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough
