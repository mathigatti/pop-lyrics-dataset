For the record, you oughta know
You wasn't thinking when you let me go
But whatever that's how it goes
Win some you lose some
And others you hold in your heart


Why it gets so hard, tears you all apart
Even though you try to let go, no, no, no
Suddenly you're here
And it's so surreal
And I don't know what the deal

(CHORUS)
Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (one time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

Them other irregularities
They can't compete with MC
The whole entire world can tell
That you love yourself some me

People see ya know asking all about me
And how they always thought we were so perfect together
Let's re-write the end, start over again
And it's gon go better now

(CHORUS)
Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (one time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

For the record
You'll always be a part of me, no matter what you do
And for the record
Can't nobody say I didn't give my all to you
And for the record
I told you underneath the stars that you belong to me
For the record
It's obvious that we just can't let go of us, honey

(CHORUS - 02x)
Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (one time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

For the record, baby
Now you know, baby
