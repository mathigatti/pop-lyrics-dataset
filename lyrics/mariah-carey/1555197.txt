I still remember
That hazy September
I've been waiting for somebody like you
To come back around


We would walk in the park
Every Saturday
Brand new all in love kissin' time away
You was all up on me, It was plain to see
That I was your girl

Way back when it was the simple thing
Anklets, name plates that you gave to me
Sweet tarts, ring pops
Had that candy bling
And you were my world

Now I wish I could go back
And make time stop
I would take this love
Throw back from the top
Go DJ play my song
And I'm gon' think about you
All night long

Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love any more
But somedays I sit and wish
We was in love again
Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love any more
But somedays I sit and wish
We was in love again

Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you

My sweet baby
My sweet thang, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
(I can't delete your picture from my mind)

It was everything that I could do
To stay away
And I often reminisce about
The games we played
It was tag, chase, spin the bottle
Then butterflies would last
Till tomorrow
Then the lights came on
I had to run right home

Now I wish I could go back
And make time stop
I would take this love
Throw back from the top
Go DJ play my song
And I'm gon' think about you
All night long

Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love any more
But somedays I sit and wish
We was in love again
Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love any more
But somedays I sit and wish
We was in love again

Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you

My sweet baby
My sweet thang, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
(I can't delete your picture from my mind)

I'm the same Mimi
Fame ain't changed me
Butterfly flow like Muhammad Ali
Wish I could bring you back like the O.D.B.
Thinkin' about the whirlpools
Me you and Jack
No matter what I do
All the memories are stacked
Thinkin 'bout 10th grade grade
Thinkin 'bout 11th
Then you went dougie fresh
All the way to heaven

Back in the days we were in love
(Back in the day)
We're not in love any more
But somedays I sit and wish
(I sit and wish we was)
We was in love again
Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love any more
(I wish we was just like back in the day)
But somedays I sit and wish
We was in love again

Irresponsible things we would do like
(Still remember)
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
(Now I'm back to)
Now I'm back to the future missin' you
(Now I'm stuck in the future missin' you)

My sweet baby
My sweet thang, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
(I can't delete your picture from my mind)

My sweet baby
(I can't delete your picture from my mind)
My sweet thang, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
(After all this time)
Missin' you my sweet baby
(I can't)
