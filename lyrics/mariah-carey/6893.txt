Yo, what's happenin'?
What you're cryin' for?
You know you look too damn good to be cryin'
Come here, how about a player?
DPG style
You know, you know


When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby I cry

Ok, so it's 5 AM and
I still can't sleep
Took some medicine
But it's not working
Someone's clinging to me
And it's bittersweet
'Cause he's head over heels
But it ain't that deep
I finally changed my number
Got a different pager
Then last saturday
Your cousin called to say you're
Tryin' to reach me
Probably because you see that
I'm with someone new

Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone
In my new friend's home
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know (so that he won't know)
I still cry baby (I cry baby)
Over you and me

Sipping Bailey's Cream
By the stereo
Trying to find relief
On the radio
I'm suppressing the tears
But they start to flow
'Cause the next song I hear
Is a song I wrote
When we first got together
Early that september
I can't bear to listen
So I might as well drift
In the kitchen
Pour another glass or two
And I try to forget you, you

Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone
In my new friend's home (in my new friend's home on my)
On my tippy toes (tippy toes)
So that he won't know (so that he won't know I)
I still cry baby
Over you and me (you and me)

Baby hear me when I say
Let that man be on his way
Don't even waste your time
And worry how he handle thangz
Baby hear me when I say
A playa feelin' good today
Don't even waste your time watch how I handle thangz
Man ur a fool for this (for this)
But on the real dog I'm cool with this we do and this
D-O-DOUBLE G-Y
Kiss the girls and make them cry!

(Oooh It's late)
Late at night like a little child (I'm like a little child)
Wandering around alone (wandering around alone)
In my new friend's home
On my tippy toes (tippy toes)
So that he won't know (so that he won't know)
I still cry baby (I was spiraling)
Over you and me (over you and me)

(Why is it 5 AM and)
Late at night like a little child (I'm still struggeling and)
Wandering 'round alone (walking 'round)
In my new friend's home
On my tippy toes (on my tippy toes)
So that he won't know (so that he won't know)
I still cry baby (I still cry)
Over you and me

I don't get no sleep
I'm up all week
Can't stop thinking of you and me
And everything we used to be
It could have been so perfectly
I cry, I cry, I cry
Oh, I gotta give me some sleep

Baby and I cry, cry, cry, cry

On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
I still cry
You and I

Oh, like a little child
Wandering 'round alone
Do-do-do-do-do

On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
I still cry
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do

I cry, cry, cry, cry
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
I still cry
Baby and I
