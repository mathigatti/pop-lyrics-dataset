This is the point when I need everybody get to the dance floor
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that, y'all)
Da, da, da, da
A like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that, y'all)
It's like, da, da, da, da
A like that y'all (that y'all)


I came to have a party
Open off the Bacardi
Feelin' so hot tamale
Boy, I know you're watchin' me, so what's it gonna be?
Purple taking me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy, you got me inspired
Baby, come and get it if you're really feelin' me

'Cause it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just making the most of life

Everybody is livin' it up
All the fellas keep lookin' at us, because
Me and my girls on the floor like, what?
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut

It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like, da, da, da, da
A like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like, da, da, da, da
A like that y'all (that y'all)

You like this and you know it
Caution, it's so explosive
Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion
Baby, come and get it, let me give you what need
It's a special occasion
Mimi's emancipation
A cause for celebration
I ain't gonna let nobody's drama bother me

'Cause it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just making the most of life

Everybody is livin' it up
All the fellas keep lookin' at us, because
Me and my girls on the floor like, what?
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut

It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like, da, da, da, da
A like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like, da, da, da, da
A like that y'all (that y'all)

'Cause it's my night (it's my, it's my night)
No stress, no fights
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Baby, I'm making the most of life

Everybody is livin' it up (I said everybody)
All the fellas keep lookin' at us, because
Me and my girls on the floor like, what?
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut

It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like, da, da, da, da
A like that y'all (that y'all)
(It's life)
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
That y'all (that y'all)
It's like, da, da, da, da
A like that y'all (that y'all)
(This is my night)
