This last song was originally recorded by
the incomparable Aretha Franklin.


Don't play that song for me
'Cause it brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
Those days that I spent with you
Oh no don't leave me, baby (oh no)
Cause it fills up my heart with pain
So please stop it right away
Cause I remember just what he said

He said "Darling I love you"
But I know that he lied
"Darling I need you"
Know that you lied
"Darling I love you"
Darling you lied
Lied
You lied
(To me)

Hey mister
Don't play no more
Don't play no more
I can't stand it
Don't play it no more
(No more)
No more I can't stand it
I remember on our first date
He kissed me and he walked away
I was only 17
I never dreamed he'd be so mean
He told me

Darling
"Darling I love you"
But baby baby you lied
"Darling I need you"
You lied
"Darling I love you"
Darling you lied
Lied
You lied
You
Lied
(To me)

Yeah
"Darling I love you"
But I know that you lied
"Darling I need you"
I know that you lied
"Darling I love you"
Darling you lied
Lied you
Lied
Led to me and hurt me
You lied
Don't play it no more
No baby
Don't do it
Don't play it no more
'Cause I can't stand it no
More

Thank you.
