I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side


I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all
For your love tonight

Baby, can you feelÂ me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're just so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all
For your love tonight

(Just one more night)
(Just one more night)
(Just one more night)
(Just one more night)

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all
For your love tonight

(Just one more night)
(Just one more night)
(Just one more night)
(Just one more night)

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night
I'd risk my live to
Feel your body
Feel your body
Feel your body baby
Baby baby
No, I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all
For your love tonight

I'd give my all
I'd give my all
I'd give my all
I'd give my all
I'd give my all
I'd give my all
I'd give my all
Tonight

I feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Go on without your love
I'd give my all
For your love tonight

I...
I'd give my all...
