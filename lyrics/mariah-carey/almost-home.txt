Hey, hey, you're almost home
Almost home, almost home
I've seen the light in the sky
And the skys are like fireflies
Burning bright
Just to vanish in the dark


I've had hope in my two hands
But there will be another chance
To find the kingdom
I believe in my heart
Cause underneath the good
There's something greater than you know

When you're almost there
And you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
When you're almost there
Almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When you run, run so far
You forgotten who you are
Where you're from is like some other universe
They count your steps
Like they're regrets
You catch one breath and lose again
Wrong is right, right is left
And there is no where left to turn

So don't believe in everything
You think, you think you know

When you're almost there
And you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
When you're almost there
Almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When let your heart be the compass
You won't get alone, not if you trust it
When you hear the sound of the trumpet
Louder than ever before

Oh, when you're almost there
Almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
Cause you're almost there
Almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When you're almost there
Almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
Almost there
You're almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home
