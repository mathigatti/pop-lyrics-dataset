How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath
With you, hmm hmm
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all


How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

So, take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So, take a look at me now
When there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me
Is against all odds
And that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one 
Who really knew me at all

So, take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
Still there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me
Is against all odds
That's the chance I've got to take

Take a look at me now
