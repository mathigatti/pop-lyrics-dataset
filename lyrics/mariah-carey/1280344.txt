(Mariah Carey and Akon):
This is for my people's
Who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby
Your man, or your lady
Put your hands way up high
(Put 'em way up high)
We will never say bye
Never, no, no
(Never say goodbye)
Momma's, daddies
sisters, brothers
Friends and cousins
(Yeah)
This is for my people's
Who lost they grandmothers
(Yeeeeaaahh)
Lift ya hands to the sky
(Lift 'em way up high),
'Cause we will never say bye
(Never say goodbye)


(Akon):
I know, I know you're gone
I know i'll see you again
One thing that I can promise
That we gon' meet up again
Hopefully up in heaven
Prayin' that i'm forgiven
For everything that i've done
And everything
I forgot to mention
If feel so bad
To be without my homie
And every since
You've been absent
I've been so lonely
Why does our life cycle
Round like a trophy
Even though know somebody
Took the time to warn me
That you just keep me
'Til the end it's just crazy
And everyday i'm wishin' you
Could come save me
And I know a man
Ain't supposed to cry
It's taken all the strength
In my soul to say goodbye

(Mariah Carey/Chorus):
Bye, bye (22x)

(Mariah Carey):
And you never got the chance
To see how good i've done
And you never got to see me
Back at number one
I wish that you were here
To celebrate together
I wish that we could spend
The holidays together
I remember when you used
To tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear
You gave to me
That I held so tight
I thought you
Were so strong
That you can make it
Through whatever
It's so hard
To accept the fact
You're gone forever
I never knew
I could hurt like this
And everyday
Life goes on like
I wish I could talk to you
For awhile
I wish I could find a way
Try not to cry
As time goes by
And soon as you reach
A better place
Still
I'll give the whole world
To see your face
And I'm right here
Next to you
It feels
Like you gone too soon
The hardest thing to do
Is say bye, bye

(Mariah Carey/Chorus):
Bye, bye (22x)

(Lil' Wayne):
How come
They call it goodbye?
How come the good die?
See I just get high
And think of the good times
That I had with my pops
He was a good guy
How come the good die?
As i protect my mother
'Cause i'm her oldest son
And there
Are different worlds
And we in the coldest one
Which one did granny go to?
And why do death come?
As my baby ask
Where do babies come from
I tell her where
I tell her why
And I tell her I love her
Until I tell her bye
And whenever
I shall ever die
I hope you celebrate it
I hope you never hated
And they say heaven's gated
But I think I know the code
And let's get your life right
By the end of the road
That's why I drive alone
Down memory lane
So if I crash
I hope ya'll
Remember Wayne

(Mariah Carey/Chorus):
I never knew
I could hurt like this
And everyday
Life goes on like
I wish I could talk to you
For awhile
I wish I could find a way
Try not to cry
As time goes by
And soon as you reach
A better place
Still
I'll give the whole world
To see your face
And I'm right here
Next to you
It feels
Like you gone too soon
The hardest thing to do
Is say bye, bye

Bye, bye (22x)

It's hard to say
Bye, bye, bye, bye
So come on
Somebody say it with me
Wave ya hands up high
'Cause this is for my people's
Who just lost somebody
See this is for everybody
Just lift ya hands to the sky
'Cause we will never say bye, bye
