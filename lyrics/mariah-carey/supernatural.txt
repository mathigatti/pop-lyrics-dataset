You make beat
You make beat go
You make beat
You make beat go


Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I’m for sure
It’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love

You, got me lost in the clouds
Loating, like you keep me here always
You’re the only thing that’s true

Beautiful as the sun
Shadows of my new baby

Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I’m for sure
It’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love

Baby, communicate without saying a word aloud
Heavenly, it’s more than a state of mind

Now that you’re in my life
And you…

Beautiful as you lay
All my tears dissipate, cause

Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I’m for sure
It’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love

You make beat
You make beat go
I got you
Mami
I love you mami
I love you much

Beautiful as you lay
All my tears dissipate

Cause our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually I’m for sure
It’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love

You make beat
You make beat go
You make beat
You make beat go
You make beat
You make beat go
On and on and on and on
