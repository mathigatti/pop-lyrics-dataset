Yo if you ever been in a relationship
And got hurt really really bad
This song's for you
I mean you know what it feel like
(Now MC baby tell 'em what we talking' about)
To not ever wanna do it again
Then you meet somebody
Without a doubt you know they the one
Huh yeah but you be so scared and nervous
That you don't wanna get hurt again
(Now MC baby tell 'em what we talking' about)


See I'm going through a situation that I can't help
Wanna get a little closer but I promised myself
That I would never give my heart away again, uh uh babe
I know it's hard butcha gotta understand it
The truth is all the hurt and the pain
And the shit that you get when you have it
Ain't worth it
I've been there so many times I should know better but I
Can't stop what I feel when you're next to me
I really think I

Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one

Finally found somebody that could be the one
(I think I finally)
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
(Boy I'm so afraid)
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one

See the problem with relationships
In general is that it's always a game
In the beginning they'll do anything to have you
And once they do it's never the same
And I know everyone out there can relate
So the question is
One: do I really wanna trust this feeling?
Two: do I wanna let it pass me by?
Three: do you think it's only superficial?
Four: could it actually be different this time?
Someone to love me
Someone to be my everything
Maybe I've stumbled upon

Finally found somebody that could be the one
(The only one)
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
(No no)
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
(I just don't wanna be hurt)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
(But boy I think you might be the one)

Finally found somebody that could be the one
(Maybe I've found)
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
(Boy I'm so afraid)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one

Oh baby
Sweet darling
I think I finally found
(Now MC baby tell 'em what we talking' about)

Finally found somebody that could be the one
(The only one)
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
(I don't wanna be hurt no more)
'Cause I know that you're the one
(I think you might be the one)

Finally found somebody that could be the one
(Finally found)
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
(I promised myself not to give in)
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know baby you're the one

Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
(Please, baby baby)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know baby you're the one

Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause baby you're the one
