One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing
We hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find


And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Underneath the stars
(Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars
(Young love, young love, young love)

Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
So shy
A bundle of butterflies
Flush with heat of desire
On a natural high

As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart to you there in the dark
Underneath the stars
(Young love, young love, young love)
(Young love, young love, young love)

Beautiful and bittersweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you
(Baby, baby)
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said goodbye
And left our secret place so far behind

(And I lay in bed all night and I was drifting)
And we drifted to another state of mind
(Drifting drifting drifting drifting)
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
(Uh, and I was yours and you were my on)
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
(As we lay, as we)
Underneath the stars
(Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars
(Young love, young love, young love)

I was drifting drifting drifting
And I
Underneath the stars
Baby, baby
