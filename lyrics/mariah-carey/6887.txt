Do you know
How it feels
Lying here without you baby
You could never understand what's happening to me
So alone
Nothing's real
I just dream about you baby
And forever wonder why you had
To break free


Even though you're not my lover
Even though you're not my friend
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again

It's so hard
To believe
I don't have you right beside me
As I long to touch you
But you're out of my reach
And my heart doesn't feel
It's so very cold inside me
Just a shadow of someone that I used to be

Even though you're not my lover
Even though you're not my friend
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again

You were the only one (only one)
That I allowed inside my heart
Now I'm just holding on
To something so far gone
Where did I go wrong

Even though you're not my lover
Even though you're not my friend
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again
Just to hold you once again
