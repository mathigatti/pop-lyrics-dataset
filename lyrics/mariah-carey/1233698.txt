Oh, I stay, oh, I stay in love
Baby, baby, I stay in love with you


Dying inside 'cause I can't stand it
Make up, break up can't take this madness
We don't even really know why
All I know is baby I try and try so hard to keep our love alive

If you don't know me at this point then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me that unconditional love I used to feel
It's no mistaking if we just erase it
From our hearts and minds
And I know

We said: Let go; but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like, Oh, well; each time you let me down
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Baby, I stay in love with you

It cuts so deep, it hurts down to my soul
My friends tell me I ain't the same no more
We still need each other when we stumble and fall
How we gon' act like what we had ain't nothin' at all now?

Hey, what I wanna do is ride shotgun next to you
With the top down like we used to hit the block
Proud in the SUV
We both know our heart is breaking
Can we learn from our mistakes?
I can't last one moment alone
Altough I know

We said: Let go; but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like, Oh, well; each time you let me down
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you

We said: Let go; but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like, Oh, well; each time you let me down
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you

I stay in love
