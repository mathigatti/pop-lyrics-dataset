Start spreading the news,
I'm leaving today
I want to be part of it,
New york, new york


These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it,
New york, new york

I wanna wake up in a city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill,
Top of the heap

These little town blues
Are melting away.
I'll make a brand new start of it,
In old new york.

If I can make it there,
I'll make it anywhere.
It's up to you,
New york, new york.

New york, new york.
I want to wake up in that city
That never sleeps
And find I'm a number one
Top of the list,
King of the hill,
A number one.

These little town blues
(All) melting away.

I'm gonna make
A brand new start of it
In old new york.

And if I can make it there,
I'm gonna make it anywhere.
It's up to you,

New york,
New york!
New york!!
