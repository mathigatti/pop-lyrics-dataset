I look at you looking at me
Feels like a feeling meant to be
And as your body moves with mine
It's like I'm lifted out of time


And time again
Patiently I've waited
For this moment to arrive

CHORUS 1:
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer
After you go
Will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade

I feel your touch caressing me
This feeling's all I'll ever need
With every kiss from your sweet lips
It's like I'm drifting out of time

Alone will tell
If you feel the way I feel
When I look in your eyes

CHORUS2:
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer
After you go
Will you return to love me
After the night becomes the day

Time
And time and time again
So patiently I've waited
For this moment to arrive

CHORUS3:
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer
After you go
Baby will you return to love me
After the night becomes the day
After tonight begins to fade
