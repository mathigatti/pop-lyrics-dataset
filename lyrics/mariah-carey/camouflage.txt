I remember so many nights in the bed alone
Wondering could I muster the strength to exist in the bitter cold?
But you showed up once in a while, I guess that's all right
'Cause I told my heart that you needed time for yourself; it's fine
Ohh, ohh, ohh


I camouflage my tears and you wear your disguise
And 'round I go
To know that you still love me
(I need to know, say that you do)
To know if you still love me
(I need to know, say that you do)

Weary sometimes when I try to discern our reality
Wish that I just could be somebody else if you talked to me
Kept praying inside let him love me for who I am
Please, my lord
But you were just somewhere the sun couldn't reach
Couldn't understand
(All that I needed was you to really see me)
I camouflage my tears and you wear your disguise
(You wear your disguise)
Around I go
To know if you still love me
(I need to know, say that you do)
To know if you still love me
(I need to know, say that you do)

Didn't we swear we'd give each other everything
(Didn't we swear passionate heart and our love)
Didn't I give you all of me?
(Didn't I give you all of me?)
Oh oh oh
No night or day goes by
No no no
When I don't wonder inside
(You still feel the way)
If you feel the way you used to feel
I camouflage my tears
And you wear your disguise
And 'round and 'round I go

(I need to know, say that you do)
I remember so many nights...
(I need to know, say that you do)
I camouflaged...
That's all I really wanted
(Oh say...)
That's all I really wanted...
(Tell me that you love me...)
I cry and cry as you laugh and laugh...
(I pray that you still love me)
I cry and cry as you laugh and laugh at the question
But I need to know
Weary sometimes when I try to discern our reality...
