Wait a minute
Before you walk away
Let me finish
I've got a lot to say


Baby I'm not gonna tolerate
This game that you play
You'll regret it
If you desert me this way

When there's nobody to dry your eyes
Suddenly you're gonna realize

Don't you know?
You need me
Don't you see?
Believe me
Before you act so hastily
Baby remember you need me

Honey listen
Don't make a big mistake
I'm in your system
You really can't escape

When there's nobody to hold your hand
Suddenly you're gonna understand

Don't you know?
You need me
Don't you see?
Believe me
Before you act so hastily
Baby remember you need me

Don't you know?
You need me
Don't you see?
Gotta believe me
Before you act so hastily
Baby remember you need me

No one understands you like I do
After everything that we've been through
Baby, you can turn around and leave
But I know that you'll keep comin' right back to me
Yeah darling!

Don't you know?
You need me
Don't you see?
Gotta believe me
Before you act so hastily
Baby remember you need me

Don't you know?
You need me
(You need me, you need me, you need me)
Don't you see?
Believe me
Now before you act so hastily
Baby remember you need me

Don't you know?
You need me
Don't you see?
Believe me
Baby remember you need me
