(Young juiceman)


I can't wait to hate you
Big Boi:
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
Gucci:
(Boy don't you know that)
I can't wait break through these emotional changes
(Yeah, ah-ha)(y'all know I do these remixes)
Seems like such a lost cause
(Let's go y'all)
(Boy don't you know that)

All nite I think of you (get out)
I want to be your lady baby (get out)
I still love you boo, can't wait to hate you (get out)
I just can't go on cause I gave my all to (get out)

Ohh this was a love phenomenon no one could explain
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind and watch us everynight
Wanna pause it but I can't make it stay
Just gotta let it play

We went round for round till we knocked love out (out, out, out)
Laying in the ring not making a sound (ye, ye, yeah)

And I just wanna hold you, (I'm desert)
Touch you
Feel you
Be near you
I miss you
Baby, baby, baby

I'm tired of tryin to fake through
But there's nothing I can do
Boy I can't wait to hate you
(Boy don't you know that)
I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
(Boy don't you know that)
I can't wait break through these emotional changes
(Aw, Mc)
Seems like such a lost cause
(Let's go to the east side)

Uh, shawty, hate me
No longer wants to date me
She say that I'm lost cause
She even hate my dirty draws
Tryin to keep it real
Everytime she try to shake me off
I'm okay, I'll be good
Everyday for lay me on
H-a-t-e on your juice,
But you can't lead on jui melon
Everytime I come around you sneak and try to use your phone
Girl you should know that
You men riot on its crown
Its ain't jury, dirty, think you have familiar on my home

(Boy, don't you know that)
All nite I think of you
I want to be your lady, baby
I still love you boo, can't wait to hate you
I just can't go on cause I gave my all to
(Let's go to the east point mad across)

Big Boi:
I can't wait to hate, n-no escape
The situation is not that race
I know we ain't one, that's a lot stake we gotta say honey
Since the day one, I was the real deal
No big just me and this apple appeal (shit)
I just wanna pee a lot in the field,
Pill me before somebody gets killed (really)
I kinda see all the spilled milk (that, that)
Cad that it up, this time don't be risk
No worries, no flurries
No blusets, cold shoulder
Could bloodies, no desert
And now that I'm older I told ya
The gold fast sum
They play it when I'm colder
Then apole would be a strong man
Then my shoulder to the dow place

Gucci Mane:
Jam and lie my lambourghini
Gotta in the rebok inner
So much money make a wish
I can be your dreaming tease
Mimi play me with me, deal me
So material they should crown it
How your girlfriend is hating on me
She can't wait to leave me alone
Found then in a lot of mall
Down we such a made the tess (get out)
This is alls a saint cause
Mimi you'll be crazy baby
Me, you can go crazy places
Fly you, buy you crazy bustless
Lately I've been workin crazy
I know that you waiting patient
Pennut, like to thank all me

Gucci mane made my ski
All you did was behave on me

You got leave but can't be stronger

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
(Boy don't you know that)
I can't wait break through these emotional changes
