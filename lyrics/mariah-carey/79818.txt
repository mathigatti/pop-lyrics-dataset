Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone you got beyond the haze
And I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love


I look into your eyes
You turn the other way
And now I realize
It's all a game you play
I hold you in the night
And wake to find you gone
You're running out of sight
It's so hard holding on
All alone in love

Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone you got beyond the haze
And I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love

You haunt me in my dreams
I'm calling out your name
I watch you fade away
(You know your love is not the same)
I've figured out your style
To quickly drift apart
You held me for a while
Planned it from the start
All alone in love

Sitting in the dark without you
How am I supposed to make it
Through the night
(How am I supposed to make it)
(Through the night)
(How am I supposed to make it)
Slowly fall apart without you
Cry away the hours
Till the morning light

Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone you got beyond the haze and
I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love
I guess I'm all alone
Guess I'm all alone in love
O yeah! I'm so all alone
Yes! All alone in love
