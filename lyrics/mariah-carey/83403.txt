I guess your mamma never
Told you that what
Goes around comes back around


I should've left it all
How ya doin'
I should've left it all
I like your music too and
I should've never called you
Back when you pursued me
I should've never given you
My f****'n two way
I should've never listened
To your woeful stories
The ones I'm sure you told
A thousand times before me
You should've never intimated
We were lovers
When you know very well
We never even touched each other

Who's gonna love you
When it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you
When your bank roll runs out
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
Fall down
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
Fall down

I gotta break to ya delicately, "dunny"
Takin' my G5 twenty minutes wasn't nothin'
But I guess you wouldn't know
That's the way I roll
Consequently now
Your ego's fully overblown
You don't want the world to know
That you're just a puppet show
And the little boy inside
Often sits at home alone
And cries, cries, cries, cries
(boo hoo... who?)

Who's gonna love you
When it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you
When your bank roll runs out
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Noboby... (nobody!...)
Nobody

Your pain is so deep rooted
What will your life become
Sure you hide it
But you're lost and lonesome
Still just a frail shook one

Superman leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, 
Got no ring on this finger now 
I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship save it bitch, baby-sit? 
You make me sick, superman ain't saving shit
Girl you can jump on shady's dick

Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell 'em off like a slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face
 
I'm a different man kiss my ass, kiss my lips
Bitch why ask, kiss my dick get my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Wont get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out; popping shit wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

Am I too nice? Buy you ice
Bitch if you died wouldn't buy you life
What you trying to be my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice

But I do know one thing 
Though bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday 
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one-day maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fucking runway hoe

Tell me who's gonna love you? Who?
I'd like to know
If you didn't have nothing
Who'd still be there?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
There ain't nobody baby
Bullies in the schoolyard
When they fall they fall hard
Yeah... so you better think twice
Better play nice
Cause who's gonna be there

Cause who's gonna be there
When the joke's on you
A marionette show
Who's making you move though?
I know what kills you slow
I'm gonna keep your little secret though
Mmmmm hmmmmm....
And you know that I know
You're no superhero

I guess your mamma never
Told you that what
Goes around comes around... pow!
