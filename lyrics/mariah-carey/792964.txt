What will 2000 bring?
The war of a billion things
When darkness seizes the lords
And darkness sends his judgement sword
They march through the battle fields
Start the destruction wheels
A scream of terror through the night
The armies do their final fight


Holocaust
Final loss
Holocaust

What will the end bring
To my life?
Are you poisoned by?
Are you for the night?
Are you by the night?

Holocaust
Final loss
Holocaust

Listen to what i say
We are coming upon the day
When toxic gas fills the air
And life on earth can't
Be found anywhere
You run, but where can you hide?
From the shelters i hear you cry
The bombs bursting in air
God help me i'm so scared!

Holocaust
Final loss
Holocaust

What will the end bring
To my life?
Are you poisoned by?
Are you for the night?
Are you by the night?

Holocaust
Final loss
