Too live for things impossible
Come dream, my carpet overflows
Right now we face
The sun rise of love


Your body closes in on mine
Wishes breaking unjustified
Sweet hurricane of love flowing with
The tide
Now say you mean
The world to me
Say what you are

(It’s Infamous)

It’s such a rush
Reality
I’m so into you
The things you do

I know it’s dangerous
But I believe
A greater love
Than ever be
I’m hoping boy

So turn and see

Carry on and on and rock with me
Love is a sport and we’re infamous

A, a, a, a, a, a, a

Rise up this moment’s drizzling boy
Face time come back to playing and joy

My champion
You would always save
The day
Ready to stop and start again

Return to blissful innocence
Go pass the places
I never show

She cause a low

I said you mean
The world to me

Say what you are

It’s infamous

It’s such a rush
Reality
I’m so into you
The things you do

I know it’s dangerous
But I believe
A greater love
Than ever be
I’m hoping boy
So turn to be
Carry on and on and rock with me
Love is a sport and we’re infamous

Okay
We both call a reputation
Been around since day 1
Baby my A-1
Know we have a little days
But yea
Ain’t nothing like our creation
Carry on and on and rock with me
Long as we’re rolling it’s infamous
I call you bae
So you know that mean
It ain’t my last temptation
I know that my feelings is clouded
But baby we can’t live without it
Love, no, game
Carry on and on and rock with me
Long as we rolling
It’s infamous

Now say you mean
The world to me
Say what you are
It’s infamous
It’s such a rush
Reality
Reality

The things you do

I know it’s dangerous
But I believe
A greater love
Than ever be
I’m open boy
So time to see

Carry on and on and rock with me

Long as we’re scrolling
Long as it’s moments
