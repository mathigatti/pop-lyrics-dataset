Gotta get up
Cause you know the world is waiting
Can you keep up?
Everyone you see is racing

And you know what you are
It’s true, you will go far

Cause you’ve got the night to light up the sky
Meteorite in front of every eye
A shooting star, your fame is a flame
They watch you burn up, turn up, turnt up all the way

Meteorite-ite-ite
(A shooting star)

So here we go
Listening, what are you saying?
Put on your show
Try to make it entertaining

And you know what you are
It’s true, you will go far

Cause you’ve got the night to light up the sky
A meteorite in front of every eye
A shooting star, your fame is a flame
They watch you burn up, turn up, turnt up all the way

(All the way)
Meteorite-ite-ite
A shooting star

Cause you’ve got the night to light up the sky
A meteorite in front of every eye
A shooting star, your fame is a flame
As they watch you burn up, turn up, turnt up all the way

Yeah, you got me turnt up all the way
Yeah, you got me turnt up all the way
Yeah, you got me turnt up all the way
Yeah, you got me turnt up all the way
Meteorite-ite-ite
