It's not chipped
We're not cracked
Oh, we're shattered


I thought we had something special
And we had something good
But I should've had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walking by ya, boy
Don't you even speak
Pretend you're on a sofa
And I'm on the TV
You might see me on a poster
See me at a show
But you won't see me for free
Boy, this ain't no promo

Acting all shamed now
Wherever you've been laying, you can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your momma house

When I break, I break, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face (when I break, I break)
Uh, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face (when I break, I break)
You ain't ever gonna feel this thing again
You're gon' get a lot of calls
'Cause I CC'd all your friends (when I break, I break)
I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby
I break (when I break, I break)

So look who's crying now
Boo hoo hoo
Talking about you're missing
Your boo hoo hoo
I know you ain't gettin' it
I know you ain't hittin' it
I know you ain't a rapper
So you need to stop spittin' it

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
You'll wonder who I'm messing with while you ain't next to me
I'm going, bye, ha, ha, ha, ha
So pay the consequences 'cause you acting all ignorant

So you're ashamed now
Wherever you been laying, you can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from you momma house

When I break, I break, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face (when I break, I break)
Uh, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face (when I break, I break)
You ain't ever gonna feel this thing again
You're gon' get a lot of calls
'Cause I CC'd all your friends (when I break, I break)
I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
They're collecting my bags, baby
I break

'Cause when I break, I break, I break
And no super glue can fix this sh*t
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a welder and a builder can rebuild this sh*t
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a nail technician
With a whole lotta gel and acrylic can fix this
When I break, I break
If we were two lego blocks
Even the Harvard university graduating class of 2010
Couldn't put us back together again

When I break, I break, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face (when I break, I break)
Uh, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face (when I break, I break)
You ain't ever gonna feel this thing again
You're gon' get a lot of calls
'Cause I CC'd all your friends
I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
They're collecting my bags, baby
I break

Boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
(I tell you what)
Up out my face, boy
(Tell you nothin')
Up out my face, boy
(Here, I'll tell you somethin')
Up out my face, I break
(I'm outta here, oh, yeah)
Up out my face, boy
