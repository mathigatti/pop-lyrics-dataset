Lying beside you
This joy is so deep
I reach out and touch you
Tenderly


Looking inside you
My world is complete
I struggled to find you
Now I'm free

Precious love
Burning so deeply
Shining completely for you

So blessed
Amazingly
Touching you now
Awakens me
You are my heart
My everything
Feeling you now is all I need

Adrift in the moment
So sacred and pure
Alive for you only
I am yours
As you touch me so sweetly
And you whisper my name
I feel how you love me
We are the same

Precious one
Don't ever leave me
Forever need me
This way

So blessed
Amazingly
Touching you now
Awakens me
You are my heart
My everything
Feeling you now is all I need

Stay with me
Beyond the end
I treasure you
Cause you made me whole again

So
So blessed
Amazingly blessed
Touching you now
Awakens me
You are my heart
My everything
Feeling you now is all I all I really need
Feeling you now is all I need
