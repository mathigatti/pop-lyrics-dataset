How about you (you, you)
How about you (you, you)


You took my love for granted
You left me lost and disenchanted
Bulldoze my heart as if you planned it
My prince was so unjustly handsome

Who was a knight in shining armor?
I coulda sworn you loved me harder
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
I ain't the type to play the martyr

How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Get the fuck out
How 'bout you take your tings and be on your merry way?
Fly off with a wink, bye bye baby
(How 'bout you) scusami, let me call your valet
(You just) take your tings and be on your merry way

My friends all saw it in your eyes
They told me they once, they told me twice
I looked beyond the signs
I guess fool's love makes you blind, ay

Who was a knight in shining armor? (You, you, you)
I coulda sworn you loved me harder (you, you, you)
Might as well down this Caymus bottle (you, you, you)
I ain't the type to play the martyr

How 'bout you get the fuck out? (How about)
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How about you get the fuck out?
How 'bout you take your tings and be on your merry way?
How 'bout you fly off with a wink? Bye bye, baby
(How 'bout you) scusami, let me call your valet
How 'bout you take your tings and be on your merry way?
How 'bout you get the fuck out? (Fuck out, fuck out)

Don't tell me these lies when you're bluffing
(How 'bout you get the fuck out?)
Go stay at your friend's house or something
(Don't mean to be rude, but take your shit and leave)
How 'bout you go stay at your friend's house or something?
How 'bout you go and stay with your homeboys you was talking to?
(How 'bout you) I ain't tryna be rude, but you're lucky
(How 'bout you) I ain't kick your ass out last weekend

How 'bout you take your tings and be on your merry way?
How 'bout you fly off with a wink? Bye bye, baby
