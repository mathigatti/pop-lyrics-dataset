Hey

And I think she want me
To feel her

(Touch my body)

Hey

And I think she want me

Drinking in the club
Two stepping in the club
Like hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, heeeeey

Now, let's take a look
At your body
Go over you body
And anyway you say

To your spot
And baby girl

I'm gonna touch it
But if I touch it
Ima wanna hit it
But if hit it
Ima wanna split it
Lay around flip it
You be
Screaming quit it
But I can quit it
I'm just
Ggetting started

And Ima touch yo body
And you know

Are gonna wanna hate
When they hear
This free-style

So if some

Honey's up in here
That wanna roll out

Drinking in the club
Two stepping in the club

Mariah:
Boy
You can put me on you
Like a brand new white tee
I'll hug
Your body tighter
Than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me
Like a tropical breeze
And float away with you
In the Caribbean Sea

If there's
A camera up in here
Then it's
Gonna leave with me
When I do
(I do)
If there's
A camera up in here
Then I'd best
Not catch this flick
On YouTube
(YouTube)
'Cause if you run
Your mouth
And brag about
This secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause baby
I'm up in my bidness
Like a Wendy interview
But this is private
Between you and I

(Touch my body)

Hey
It's the remix killer
And I think she want me
To feel her

(Touch my body)

Hey
It's the remix killer
And I think she want me
To feel her

You know
We shining in the club
Drinking in the club
Two stepping in the club
Like hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, heeeeey
