It's 2:11 and I'm stressing
Watching TV in my hotel suite
I check my service every second
At 2:10 you still hadn't called me
So I'm gonna leave my cell phone
Turned on in my purse by the bed
And before I fall asleep
I guess I'll just check my machine
Again and again
Because I'm obsessing on you


I wanna be your babydoll
(I just wanna be yours)
Wrap me up nice and tight
(Wrap me up nice and tight)
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll

Zoning out
Thinking about you and me
Between the sheets
I want to get intimate
But you're not within my reach
So I'll have a little more wine
And I'll try to drink you
Out of my head
And I'll lie awake awhile
'Til I'm high enough
I can forget about you
Until I wake up again

I wanna be your babydoll
(Baby I wanna be)
Wrap me up nice and tight
(Wrap me up nice and tight)
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll
My babydoll

Slipping into dreams
I feel my love surround you
My subconscious seems
To weave itself around you
Do you care for me
Beyond idolization
Tell me how you feel
But don't keep me at bay
'Cause I won't be waiting long

I wanna be your babydoll
(I want you)
Wrap me up nice and tight
(So tight, baby)
Love me all through the night
(All through the night)
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
(Rock me on and on and on)
You wanna be my babydoll
(On and on and on)

I wanna be your babydoll
(I just wanna be the one you wanna rock until the morning light)
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And cuddle up next to me
C'mon and be my babydoll

Don't you wanna be my babydoll?
Come rock me on
And on and on

I'm laying up in bed
It's 3:27
My body's longing
Why ain't you calling?
I'm ready for you
Boy don't you do it
You can ring my bell
Ring my bell
Don't you wanna be my babydoll?
