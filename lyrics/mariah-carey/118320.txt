Here we are
Just going through the motions 
One more time
You looked in my eyes 
But you don't see me
Here I am
Feeling like a stranger in your arms 
I touch you, I hold you
But lately I don't know you 
Something is wrong 
But we go on from 
Day to day 
And we just pretend it all away
We act like nothing's changed
But in our hearts we know it's not the same


Cause we're not makin' love anymore 
Baby we're not makin' love like before 
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's all right 
But we're not makin' love

Remember when you couldn't 
Wait to run into my arms 
When the love inside 
My heart was all you needed 
Remember when you made me 
Wish the night would never end 
The fire, the thunder, we lived
To love each other 
If ever two hearts were one
Then it was yours and mine 
But that was another place in time 
Now all we have to show
Are memories of a dream we used to know 
Cause we're not makin' love anymore 
Baby we're not makin' love like before 
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's all right 
But we're not makin' love

When did we lose our way
We had it all 
Don't know how 
It all just slipped away 
But can we get it back again 
Is it too late
Can we try (can we try)
Just one time
Cause darling.

Cause we're not makin' love anymore 
Baby we're not makin' love like before 
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's all right 
But we're not makin' love
