I've got to see you 
Wherever you are 
And I've got to be there 
I'm wishing on stars 
I've got to reveal what's inside of my heart 
But the words escape me 
And I'm paralyzed 
So helpless when I 
Look into your eyes 


Chorus
And how I wish you only knew 
What I feel inside for you 
You probably haven't got a clue 
But I wish you knew 
How I love you, baby 

Honestly, I know it's silly of me 
To want you so badly 
But keep it concealed 
See my inferiority complex kicks in 
And the words escape me 
And I'm paralyzed 
So helpless when I 
Look into your eyes 

Chorus
And how I wish you only knew 
What I feel inside for you 
You probably haven't got a clue 
But I wish you knew 
How I love you, baby 

Spoken 
I don't if anybody outside there tonight 
Who knows what it feels like 
To love somebody so bad 
That nothing and nobody 
Can ever seem to fill out that void 
That is the situation that I'm talking about right now 
And if you feel me 
Sing the song with me 
Come on 

Chorus
And how I wish you only knew 
What I feel inside for you 
You probably haven't got a clue 
But I wish you knew 
How I love you, baby
