Baby, when you look my way
You keep on blowin' my mind
You keep on makin' me high
Keep giving me butterflies and
Every little thing you do
Just lifts me off of the ground
Heart leaps when you come around
See, I'm just breakin' it down


You got everything I need, just
Want you to want me, you
Just can't imagine, boy
I'm on a tangent

'Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out
Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do

Oh it's hard to make believe
It's just a casual thing
You're so unnerving to me
Feels like I'm living a dream, but
Baby, please don't wake me up
I'm lost in the reverie
Drifting ethereally
I'm right where I wanna be

You got everything I need, just
Want you to want me, you
Just can't imagine, boy
I'm on a tangent

'Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out
Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do

I don't care 'bout nothing but you baby
(Nothing but you, baby)
I don't care 'bout nothing but you baby

'Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy you got me twisted out
Thought of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do
