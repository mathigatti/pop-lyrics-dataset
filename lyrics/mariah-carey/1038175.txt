Here we go again
I don't wanna let you in
But you know what happens


When I, when I,
When I feel it.

I feel it deep inside,
I feel it come alive,
Here comes that feeling again.

I feel it deep inside,
I feel it come alive,
Here comes that feeling again.

Keep telling you it's over,
But boy here we go again.
You say 'I'm coming over'
'Cause you know I'll let you in.
So sly and so persuasive,
I don't wanna let you in,
But my respect's diminishing
And then I go
When I, when I,
When I feel it.

I feel it deep inside,
I feel it come alive,
Here comes that feeling again.

I feel it deep inside,
I feel it come alive,
Here comes that feeling again.

Keep trying to convince myself
You ain't no good for me,
Make futile resolutions
That I'm gonna let you be
But everytime you come back,
My defenses start to wane,
And I can hardly break away
And then I go
When I, when I,
When I feel it.

I feel it deep inside,
I feel it come alive,
Here comes that feeling again.

I feel it deep inside,
I feel it come alive,
Here comes that feeling again.

When I, when I, when I
When I feel your love
Here comes that feeling again.

Here it comes again boy,
And I feel it, and I feel it!
Here comes that feeling again.

And I feel it, oh baby
Here it comes and here it comes
And here it comes...
