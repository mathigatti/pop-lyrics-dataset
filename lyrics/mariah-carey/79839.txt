Something that you do
Hypnotizes me
Sets my soul at ease
Every time you're near me
I'm in heaven baby


I don't know how you do it
Never felt like this before
I don't wanna lose it
Give me all your love
More and more and more

Something that you do
Mesmerizes me
Sets my body free
Every time you touch me
I'm in heaven baby

I don't know how you do it
Never felt so sweet before
I don't wanna lose it
Give me all your love
More and more and more

I just wanna be around you
Tell me are you feeling the same
I just wanna be around you
Every minute of the day
Oh I'm never gonna let you go

Every time you smile
It captivates my mind
And it lifts me to the sky
Anytime you touch me
I'm in heaven baby
I don't know how you do it
Never felt so sweet before
I don't wanna lose it
Give me all you love

I just wanna be around you
Tell me are you feeling the same
I just wanna be around you
Every minute of the day
Oh I'm never gonna let you go

I just want
To be the only one you live for
I just want
To give you all my love
More and more and more

I just wanna be around you
Tell me are you feeling the same
I just wanna be around you
Every minute of the day
Oh I'm never gonna let you go
