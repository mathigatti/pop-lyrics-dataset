Oh, lullaby of birdland that's what I
Always hear, when you sigh
Never in my word-land could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel


Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we make with our lips
When we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love

Lullaby, lullaby

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we make with our lips
When we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
And it's all because we're in love
