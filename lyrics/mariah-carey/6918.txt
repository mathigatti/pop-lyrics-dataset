Let you take me out
I knew what you were all about
But when I did
I wasn't tryin' to lead you on


Now you bring me home
And tell me goodnight's
Not enough for you
I'm sorry baby
I didn't mean to turn you on

You read me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
I want a friend
I didn't mean to turn you on

I didn't mean to turn you on

I know you
Expected a one night stand
When I refused
I knew you wouldn't understand

Boy I told you twice
I was only tryin' to be nice
Only tryin' to be nice
Oh
I didn't mean to turn you on
Oh I didn't mean to turn you on

Turn you on

Tell me why should I
Feel guilty cause I won't give
Guilty cause I won't give in
I didn't mean to turn you on

(repeat chorus)

You think that I'm a fool
Cause I wouldn't play by your rules

(I didn't mean to turn you on)

You don't stand a chance
All I want to do is dance with you

(I didn't mean to turn you on)

I told you twice
I was only tryin' to be nice

(I didn't mean to turn you on)

I loved you for a friend
But I guess this is the
End of our relationship
Cause I didn't mean to turn you on

I didn't mean to turn you on
Sorry.

Repeat
