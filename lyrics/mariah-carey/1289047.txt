(T.I.):
Show you I care 
I tried just 'cause
Take care of solitaires 
I buy just 'cause
I just love 
You in the nude 
In the bed in the pool 
And your legs when you move
All your booty and your cutie 
And the sexy way you do it 
Make me wanna buy 
All the you desire times two
Like the biggest Louis bags 
The bentley and newest jags 
And the huge pad 
And make you laugh 
When you be mad
Just invite your friends 
Over for diner 
And you can brag 
Chanel and Tiffany this 
Versace and Gucci that
Lifestyle 
Like that if you leave 
You'll be back
Erway you could go 
They eitha broke 
Or pretty wake
plus y'aint gotta ask 
Where my heart really at 
But you wanna waste time 
With one of dem silly cats
Gon' be my guest tho' 
I dont suggest 
It's just so hard to get 
Love like this

Don't want another 
Ain't never 
Gonna be another 
Can't nobody do 
What you do to me (3x)

(Nobody)

(Can't nobody love me)

I'll be loving you long time 
(As I can be)
I'll be lovin' you long time 
(Eternally)

Long as I know you've got me
I'll be loving you long time 
(As I can be)
I'll be lovin' you long time 
(Eternally)
There's no stopping you and me 
I'll be loving you long time 
(Eternally)
I'll be lovin' you long time 
(Eternally)

Long Time 

I'll be lovin' 
I'll be lovin' you
(I'll be lovin' you long time)
