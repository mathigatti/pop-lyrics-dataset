Who would've believed
That you and me would fall
And land together


And who could've foreseen
In you I'd find the place
I've belonged forever

And if I move closer
Then love will take over
And lead the way

I'd given up hope
Losing the faith that love
Could be mine to treasure

And now nothing's the same
I found myself reborn
On the day I met you

And if we move closer
Then love will take over
And lead the way

Suddenly you are lying
Here with me
And the truths I used to hold
Have changed

And if I move closer
And let it take over
Then love will lead the way

If we move closer
And let it take over
Then love will lead the way
