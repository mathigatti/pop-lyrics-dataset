I don't want a lot for christmas
There is just one thing i need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All i want for christmas is you


I don't want a lot for christmas
There is just one thing i need, and i
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa claus won't make me happy
With a toy on christmas day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All i want for christmas is you, youuuuu, ooh ooh
Baby, oh oh

I won't ask for much this christmas
I won't even wish for snow, and i
I just want to keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the north pole for saint nick
I won't even stay up late
To hear those magic reindeer click

'cuz i just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can i do
Oh, baby all i want for christmas is you, youuuu, ooh
Baby

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children'
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me
The one i really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me quickly, yeah

Ohh ohh, i don't want a lot for christmas
This is all i'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Ohh ohh, i just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh, baby all i want for christmas is you, you ooh,
Baby

All i want for christmas is you, ooh baby (repeat tofade)
