Sorry, I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
Cause you've flown away
So far away


Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day
And I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven

Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
And I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
(But I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day
And all that I know is I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven

Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day
Eventually I'll see you in heaven

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day
Eventually I'll see you in heaven

Sorry, I never told you
All I wanted to say
