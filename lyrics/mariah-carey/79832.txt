O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth


A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night divine
O yes, it was

(O night divine)
Oh yes, it was
(O night divine)
O, it is the night of our dear Savior's birth
(O night divine)
It was a holy, holy, holy, holy
(O night divine)
Oh, oh, oh, yes it was

O night divine
