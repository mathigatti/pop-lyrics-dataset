Happy jolly
And it's merry
Christmas in New York


What do you feel like doing today?
Is it snow?
Will it snow?
Will it keep on raining so?

Going on shopping
We're not stopping
Ain't no stopping cause
It's Christmas in new york
We're gonna be singing
And shouting
Praising
It's amazing
Christmas in New York

I'm free styling and it's not my best
But there are still there
Still there
It's Christmas in new york

I feel like a don't
Cause I don't know what to say about it
But it's happiness everywhere
City streets
Bright lights and people
I love you so
Come you know
To my mini show
Oh, oh, oh, oh

We're gonna make it snow
We're gonna make it snow
On the stage later on
I hope we're gonna make it snow
Let it snow
Let it snow

Christmas time makes me feel so good
Especially when it's Christmas in New York
