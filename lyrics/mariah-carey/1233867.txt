This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put you hand way up high
We will never say bye
Momma's, daddy's, sister's, brother's, friends and cousins
This is for my people's who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky
'Cause we will never say bye


As a child there were them times
I didn't get it but you kept me in line
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On sunday mornings and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things
Separation brings
You never let me know it
You never let it show
Because you loved me and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today face to face

Never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life rolls on I
Wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you but I try not to cry
As time goes bye

And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye

Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye

And you never got a chance
To see how good I've done
And you never got to see me
Back at number one
I wish that you were here
To celebrate together
I wish that we could spend
The holidays together
I remember when you used to
Tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave me
That I held so tight
I thought you were so strong
You'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact
You're gone forever

Never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life rolls on I
Wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you but I try not to cry
As time goes bye

And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye

Bye bye bye bye bye bye
(The hardest thing to say is bye)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye

This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put you hand way up high
We will never say bye
Momma's, daddy's, sister's, brother's, friends and cousins
This is for my people's who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky
'Cause we will never say bye

Never knew I could hurt like this
(I never knew it)
And everyday life rolls on I
(Everyday of my life I wish)
Wish I could talk to you for a while
(I wish)
Miss you but I try not to cry
(I wish as time goes by)
As time goes bye

And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye

Bye bye bye bye bye bye
(It's hard to say bye bye bye bye bye bye)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
(So come on somebody sing it with me wave your hands up high)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
(Cause this is for my peoples who just lost somebody)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
(So this is for everybody)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
(Just keep your hand to the sky)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Cause we will never say bye bye
