Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Playing soft against your skin
Like the shadows on the wall


Come and lay down by my side
'Til the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it
Through the night

Well I don't care
If it's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
'Cause tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

I don't care if it's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend

Well I don't care
If it's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Cause tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

I don't wanna be alone
Help me make it
Through the night
