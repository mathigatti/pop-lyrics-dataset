You come to me with a casual flow
And suddenly my defenses start to go
When you talk to me in that sensual tone
It envelopes me and I lose my self control


And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face, I go off
I just wanna break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

Imagining that you're taking it slow
And so tenderly
'Til the feeling overflows
When you look at me I go soft and cave in
And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening

And baby I just melt away
(I fall like rain)
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face, I go off
(I lose myself control)
I just wanna break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

You and me in a cloud of reverie
Spin around inside my head unendingly
(Over and over, over and over)
Throughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Paint pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine

(Baby I)
And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face, I go off
I just wanna break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face, I go off
I just wanna break it down
(You and me ain't got a typical thing)
Anytime you come around
(You and me ain't got a typical thing)
Maybe I could melt away in your arms
