Ooh, Aah, Ooh, Ahh
Ooh, Ahh, Ohh, Ahh
Ooh, Aah, Ooh, Ahh
Ooh, Ahh, Ohh, Ahh
Why you mad, talkin’ ‘bout you’re mad
Could it bad that you just lost
The best you’ve ever had
That’s your bag, yup, that’s too bad
Show is over, you ain’t gotta act
Name hold weight like kilos
Boy you actin so corny like Fritos
Wouldn’t have none of that without me, though
Ain’t none of my business
It’s tea, though, out of ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game you’re a free throw
It’s nothing that you don’t already know


Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally, there’s an end to infinity
To infinity, to infinity

How I say this, fact that you still exist
No disrespect, no second thought it truly, truly is
Truthfully, I’m thought with this
Why are you still doing this, answer the phone like
who is this
Take your head and knock some sense

Je ne comprends pas (I don’t understand)
Ain’t no complements (duh), ain’t no being friends (duh)
Ain’t no false pretends (duh), ain’t no make amends (duh)
Ain’t no come agains (duh), that’s the story, ain’t no happy ends

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally, there’s an end to infinity
To infinity, to infinity

Is it lack of ice got you so cold
Have you ever felt this on your own
Why you tryin to play like you’re so grown
Everything you own boy you still owe

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally, there’s an end to infinity
To infinity, to infinity

You’re leavin, you’re leavin, you’re out the door
Infinity lovin me more and more
You’re leavin, you’re leavin, you’re out the door
Infinity lovin me more and more
Cause I believe infinity, is more than just a made up dream
I believe infinity, is more than just a made up… dream
Ooh, Aah, Ooh, Ahh
Ooh, Ahh, Ohh, Ahh
