I've been waiting for someone to come into my life
Who would bring me joy and give me pleasure
I have taken chances on romances once or twice
And I found that in my heart it's you I treasure


You and only you can make me feel the way I do
You and only you can make it better
You and only you can do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and that's forever and ever

All my life
My love's been waiting for you
All my life
My heart's been waiting too

All my lifeâ€¦

I've been wishing on a star
I've been praying on my knees
I've got some sly and sexy tricks to show you
Most of all I'll give you anything boy that you need
To keep you right here by my side
I know you
I'll show you

You and only you can make me feel the way I do
You and only you can make it better
You and only you can do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and that's forever and ever

All my life
My love's been waiting for you
All my life
My heart's been waiting too
Don't you know I need you
And adore you
All my life I'll give to only you
