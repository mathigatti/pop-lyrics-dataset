What you think about
You and me baby
Going one on one? (Say what)
JD y'all
MC y'all
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything that you see in your dreams
Baby, let nothing and nobody tear us apart
And forever you'll be my sweetheart


Boy haven't you noticed
A gleam in my eye
Because of you
I'm a little hypnotized
But everytime you're with me
I feel so positive
Now with a little love
Something's got to give

A full moon
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my night
Here we are
Hoping that we never part
Stay with me

Baby, wont you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
(What you think about)
(What you think about, you and me baby going one on one?)
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
(What you think about)
(What you think about, you and me baby going one on one?)
Just you and I

You are no Casanova
I know that you'll be true
And that's why
I'm so in love with you
But each romantic evening
You leave me at my door
But tonight
I'd like us to explore

A full moon
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my night
Here we are
Hoping that we never part
Stay with me

Baby, wont you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
(What you think about)
(What you think about, you and me baby going one on one?)
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
(What you think about)
(What you think about, you and me baby going one on one?)
Just you and I

JD y'all
MC y'all

See I saw you at the party with your eyes on me
Fittin' the description of what I want my bride to be
As live as me
Don't know the same guys as me
But a lot of a style unusual name like Ivory
I agree with my name's
You the baddest I ever seen in a long time
A woman with her own shine
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Is one time and don't hit
'Cause I'm tired of dealin' with the wrong kind
Gettin' nothin' but the bullshit
She gotta playa tryin' to think of new things to say
She's in the corner sippin' Dom P. Ros√©
Shakin' it up with her homegirls payin' no attetion to us
They in they own world, hey yo girl
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything that you see in your dreams
Baby, let nothing or nobody tear us apart
And forever you'll be my sweetheart

Stars are bright
Mood is right
(Say what, MC, baby sing it to me)
To keep me warm away from harm
Nowhere better than my baby's arms

Stars are bright
Mood is right
(Say what, MC, baby sing it to me)
To keep me warm away from harm
(Come on, baby baby, come on, you can be my)
Won't you be my

Baby, wont you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
(Do you like how it's going down?)
(Do you like how it's going down?)
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
(Do you like how it's going down?)
(Do you like how it's going down?)
Just you and I

Sweetheart
(Let's get together)
We could share a storybook romance
(Live happily ever after)
Won't you be my sweetheart

We could share a storybook romance
(Oh baby)
Just you and I
