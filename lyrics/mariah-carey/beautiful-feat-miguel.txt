You're beautiful
You're beautiful


Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that
And a smile so bright
Oh, you're killing me
You know it ain't fair

Ride on
Through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that
Your jeans so tight
Oh, you're killing me
Baby, do it again

You're beautiful
And you're mine, it's ****ing beautiful
And I can't pretend that
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me
You're beautiful
Good Lord, you're ****ing beautiful
And I can't pretend that
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me

I like when you run red lights
Don't stop 'til you thrill me
Oh, how you thrill me
Always in control
How you do it, I don't know
But I don't care
Take me anywhere

'Cause it's beautiful
Ooh, you make me feel undressable
And I can't pretend
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me
Oh, you're beautiful
And your mind is ****ing beautiful
And I can't pretend that
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me

Yes, you're beautiful
And Lord, you're ****ing beautiful
And I can't pretend that
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me

You're beautiful
You know that you're beautiful
You're beautiful
