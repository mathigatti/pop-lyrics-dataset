(7x):
Ay baby, it won't end
Won't end, won't end


(JD): MC said
(JD): You gotta make it knock
(MC): Let's talk about love, Let's talk about love
(JD): When you hear that
(MC): Talk about love, talk about love
(MC): This is my love story
(JD): Yall know what that is

This is my love story
Boy meets girl and looks in her eyes
Time stands still and two hearts catch fire
Off they go rollercoaster ride
Up and down and around
Twisted all out they minds

And then his friends said: "It's too soon to settle down"
And then her friends said: "He's a playa, slow it down"
They couldn't be who they was
'Cause it just seemed like love wasn't on they side

(CHORUS)
But this isn't just another my love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's just too real
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon end up like that Casablanca movie, no
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction
This is truly, ours for the eternity
There'll be no end to our love story, baby

(4x):
Ay baby, it won't end
Won't end, won't end

Chapter two:
When they meet up again second time around
See but they're just friends
But the feelings still strong
And it's been too long
To be trippin' like they ain't been missing
They on the phone like
"Ay, baby baby, let's meet up today
Gots bout an hour or two, you might as well come thru"
We can make it like it was, just the two of us
Back up on that rollercoaster, like we been supposed to

(CHORUS)
'Cause this isn't just another my love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's just too real
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon end up
Like that Casablanca movie, no
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction
This is truly, ours for the eternity
There'll be no end to our love story, baby

Just when it seemed like all the odds were stacked against them
They came back stronger then before
Matter fact then some, stronger then pride
Lookin' like them
Lookin' like her
Lookin' like him
Stronger than hate and the whole world too
Lookin' like me
Lookin' like you

(CHORUS)
'Cause this isn't just another my love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's just too real
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon end up
Like that Casablanca movie, no
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction
This is truly, ours for the eternity
There'll be no end to our love story, baby

(4x):
Ay, bay, bay it won't end
Won't end, won't end
