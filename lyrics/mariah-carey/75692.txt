You know me well we go too far back
How could anyone else compete with that
So I just can't help feeling sentimental
About things in the past


We promised to keep it casual
But at times that can be so difficult
This relationship's so untypical
And I can't understand

Tell me why
Tell me why

First you love me
And then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion
You're so deceiving
Cuz I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend
There goes my heart again

Baby why can't we be just friends
It's a mess but we still pretend
Any fool could foresee the end
But there goes my heart again

When I feel your stare
Catching me off-guard
Boy, It's just not fair
Cuz you know for sure
How to lure me in
With that magnetic smile

Tell me why
Tell me why

First you love me
And then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion
You're so deceiving
Cuz I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend
There goes my heart again

Baby why can't we be just friends
It's a mess but we still pretend
Any fool could foresee the end
But there goes my heart again

Tell me why
Tell me why

First you love me
And then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion
You're so deceiving
Cuz I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try so very hard not to bend
There goes my heart again

There goes, there goes baby
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again (there goes, there goes)
There goes my heart again (baby, baby, baby, baby)
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again (cuz you love me then you leave me baby)
There goes my heart again (I try to keep it casual)
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
One, two, three, four, five, six, seventh heaven
