That's Mariah

They said I couldn't come no harder
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother
They said I couldn't they said I couldn't
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother


I see you with your favorite dress on again
I guess you thought that you were slick
But I already peeped
You got your tag tucked in
You're strugglin'
Tryin' to look cute in your best friend's boots
But they don't hardly fit
Why you back again?
Tryin' to steal my man
I told you once before but
You don't hear me
I ain't who you think I'm is
I will snatch off all this ish

You think I won't come out these heels
And make it clear
I ain't the one
You think I won't fuck up my hair
And take it there
I ain't the one
Keep your hands up off my boo
Ain't no telling what I'll do
What makes you think you fly enough to
Take my man, no
Sho ain't the one
Sho ain't the one
I ain't the one

All these J.O.'s want what's mine
But they done lost their mind
They on him like the ice cream man,
Night and day
Why I got to fight to keep 'em all away
They crammin' but they know
They can't have none
Obsessin' but they're messin' with the wrong one

I ain't who you think I'm is
I will snatch off all this ish

You think I won't come out these heels
And make it clear
I ain't the one
You think I won't f**k up my hair
And take it there
I ain't the one
Keep your hands up off my boo
Ain't no telling what I'll do
What makes you think you fly enough to
Take my man, no
I ain't the one

They said I couldn't come no harder
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother
They said I couldn't come no harder
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother
They said I couldn't come no harder
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother
They said I couldn't they said I couldn't
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother

You think I won't come out these heels
And make it clear
I ain't the one
You think I won't f**k up my hair
And take it there
I ain't the one
Keep your hands up off my boo
Ain't no telling what I'll do
What makes you think you fly enough to
Take my man
I ain't the one
Sho ain't the one
Sho ain't the one
