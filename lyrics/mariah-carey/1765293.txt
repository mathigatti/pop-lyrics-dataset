O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord


O Sing
Choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing all
That hear in heaven
God's holy word
Give to our Father
Glory in the Highest
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

All Hail!
Lord, we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
O Jesus!
For evermore
Be Thy name adored
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
