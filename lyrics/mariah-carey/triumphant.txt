Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em


Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out

It's like you're falling in a dream
And you keep trying so hard to scream
No matter how afraid you feel
Don't let 'em, just get 'em

Oh, all you need is to remain and wait for it
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
It's not too far

You stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out

Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars (reach)
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

All fall down

Oh, all you need is to remain and wait for it
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
It's not too far

You stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out

Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars (reach)
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

All fall down

Ooh

Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)

You stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out

Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Make 'em all fall down

Make 'em all fall down
Let's make 'em all fall down
Let's make 'em all fall down

Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
