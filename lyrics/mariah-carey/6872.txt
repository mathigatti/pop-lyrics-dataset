We were as one baby
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart baby
Our love will never die no


You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Oh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

I ain't gonna cry no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably you'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart baby
Our love will never end no no

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Oh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

I know that you'll be back boy
When your days and your nights
Get a little bit colder
I know that you'll be right back baby
Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time
Time

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Oh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
(Never, no no)
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
(You and I will always be)
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
(You and I)
No way you're never gonna shake me
(You and I)
Oh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

You and I will always be
No way you never gonna shake me
No way you never gonna shake me
You and I will always be
No matter what you do baby
