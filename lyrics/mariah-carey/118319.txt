I must have rehearsed my lines
A thousand times
Until I had them
Memorized


But when I get up the nerve
To tell you the words
They never seem to
Come out right

Whoa
If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you

Whoa
If only you knew
(How much I do)
I said you don't know
(Do love you)
How much I love you
Sugar
Mh

(Someday I'll wish upon a star)
(And wake up where the clouds are far behind me)
Mh
(Where troubles melt like lemon drops)
(Away above the chimney tops)
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere
Over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And if those happy little bluebirds fly
Over the rainbow
Why then
Then why
Can't I
Why can't I
Why can't I
