Uh, uh, uh, uh
H-O-V and M.C. H-O-V Young Jeezy (yeah)
H-O-V and M.C. H-O-V Young Jeezy
I know you all see how it's going down
The best in the business baby
Live from the over Morpheus
Let's Get It!


Ladies and gentleman, it's How
Break up is imminent, I know
What's the sense of putting it off till tomorrow?
Pretending it is not going to end, let's roll
Got to move baby, know its hell of hard
You got to find your groove baby like Stell-in-a
That is not you baby, got to let her do what it do baby
Shed a tear or two but don't get too crazy baby
Why are you behaving like it is not other fish
In the fish bowl for the disco, nigga let's go
The Emancipation of M-I-M-I, I spray ?Ra-mus? RA, RA
Twenty worldwide nigga get your plaques
Guess who the fuck got his swagger back
Shake them all, uh, shake them all, uh
G4's and all we take off, uh we flawless mister
I'm the boss, El Presidente, caliente
Call me the other dog, so fuck all you all
The boy is back along with the voice is back
M.C., shake them off

(Shake it off)
By the time you get this message
It's going to be too late
So don't bother paging me
Because I'll be on my way
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're going to miss me baby
Hate to say I told you soooo
Well at first I didn't know, but now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

I got to shake it off
Because the loving is not the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I got to sh-shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial, I
Really got to get, up outta here
And go somewhere
I got to shake it off got to make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I got to sh-shake it off
Got to do what's best for me
Baby and that means I got to shake it off

I got to shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off

Yeah, you all ready know what it is man!
A-Town's finest! What's cracking, M.C.?
Young Hov, what's good baby? Eh-eh
Let's Get It

Make me imagine that
For real playgirl like I'm having that
Bronze on my tip can't shake them off
Take her to the crib then I break them off
On my team cause she know that I'm a winner
Drink Cris out the bottle, eat Popeye's for dinner
Left the coupe at the crib, scooped her up in the Chevy
Got the top down and the bass beating heavy
See he-he spoils you me I ignore ya
Sh-shake ya off, don't answer ya phone calls
You say I'm tripping but me I call it tough love
So tell your friends you're in love with a straight thug
What's happening with you honey
Young Snowman chase nothing but some money

I found out about a gang of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one by the pool
On the beach, in the streets
Heard you all was Hold up my phone's breaking up
I am hang up and call the machine right back
(I got to get this of my mind)
You wasn't worth my time, so I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't you know
