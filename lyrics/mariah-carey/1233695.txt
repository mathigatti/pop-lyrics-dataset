It's forever, forever
Forever, forever
It's forever, forever
Forever, forever


It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever

Baby, no matter how long it be
We never lose that chemistry
And it's the strongest thing I've ever experienced
So sorry what ever happened to empathy
I know y'all mother f!*#ers feel like we
When you're messin' with the one true lover that make you O.O.C.

Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C.
Out of control, baby
Although we've both moved on to another still long
For each other, it's wrong but eternally
I get so O.O.C.
And that's just the way it be

It's forever, forever
Forever, forever
It's forever, forever
Forever, forever

It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever

Baby, everytime you touch me
Still get that electricity
And after all this time, it don't even make no sense
So scusi me, te quiero mucho papi
Je ne sais pas mais c'est la vie
When you're messin' with the one true lover that make you O.O.C.

Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C.
Out of control, baby
Although we've both moved on to another still long
For each other, it's wrong but eternally
I get so O.O.C.
And that's just the way it be

It's forever, forever
Forever, forever
It's forever, forever
Forever, forever

It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever

It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever
It's forever... it's forever

Hands in the air

You out of control?
I'm out of control
Bounce on, bounce on
Just bounce on, just bounce on, c'mon...

Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C.
Out of control, baby
Although we've both moved on to another still long
For each other, it's wrong but eternally
I get so O.O.C.
And that's just the way it be

Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C.
Out of control, baby
Although we've both moved on to another still long
For each other, it's wrong but eternally
I get so O.O.C.
And that's just the way it be
