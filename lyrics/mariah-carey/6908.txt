A lover
A lover

A lover

A lover
A lover
A loverboy for me

I got myself a lover
Who loves what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
Oh my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we're going
I expect to leave on time

He's all mine
And his loving makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Loverboy
Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
(Baby all night long)
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long
(All night long)

I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
He's quite a bit of heaven
When he comes inside
So come on sugar daddy
Take me for a ride
Whatever way we're going next
I expect to leave on time

I get weak
And his candy's just so sweet
When he caressed my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Loverboy
Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
(I enjoy the way you rock me)
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you (Yes I do)
Cause you affect me
Fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now (Whoo)

My thoughts flow in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you (Candy)
Simply put, you're the reason why
Even though I'm real shy
It's like candy
I attempt to look my best for you (Indeed I do)

Loverboy
Loverboy
Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
(I enjoy the way you rock me)
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long (Strawberry)
Loverboy come on and take me (Raspberry)
Only you know how to make me (All those good things)
Shudder with anticipation (Diamonds and gumdrops)
All night long (That's what you seem to me)
Oh loverboy
Loverboy
Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long
