Whoa
Welcome to a day of my life
Day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel


Whoa
Welcome, welcome, welcome
To a day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel

Though the lights were low
I could see you both
In a lover's sillouete
And my heart stood still, i just frozen right there
Staring down right at her red dress

So i bolted out the door
Jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous to be
In the vicinity of where you are (slut)

Rolled down all the windows
Just so i could breathe
'Can't believe you just
Actually did this s**t to me

I'm goin' about a hundred
Mascara runnin'
Laughing out of at anger
But it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you
I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this happen
In my own bedroom

Betcha gon' know, how it feels
When i get you back
Betcha gon' know, how it feels
And your heart's been cracked
Betcha gon' know, how it feels
When we fade to black
And you see your whole world collapse

And i'm gon' la-la-la-la-la laugh
And i'm gon' la-la-la-la-la laugh
And i'm gon' laugh right in your face boy
Betcha gon' know, how it feels...

So i pull to the side of the road to fix my face
But i can't cover with makeup what my tears want to erase

I wake up in a haze
Morning dew and sun rays
As i drive i hide my eyes behind my black cavalli shades

A block from the house
Slowly creepy in the driveway
Tip-toe through the door
But you're there, wide awake
You're like "where you've been?"
I'm like "sorry but i fell asleep on jasmine's sofa,
I could've sworn that rae rae called you and told ya"

You like "you ok?" i'm like "mm i'm all right
A little sleep and i'll be fine"
But if you only knew what was in the back of my mind
Already stung, but you really gon' find out in time, oh i

Betcha gon' know, how it feels
When i get you back
Betcha gon' know, how it feels
And your heart's been cracked
Betcha gon' know, how it feels
When we fade to black
How it feels for real
And you see your whole world collapse

This is for real, for real, for real
Oprah winfrey whole segment for real, for real
20/20 Barbara walters for real, for real
60 Minutes for real

(Baby)
I had all my trust in you and
Look at what you pull me through
(You got me all crazy)
Somewhere down the line you gon' get what you
Deserved you f***in' jerk
(You were supposed to save me
My sweet baby
But now we're fading away)

But you're gonna know how this feels
Even if it's the last thing i ever do

To be continued...
