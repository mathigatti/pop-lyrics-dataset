Christmas time is in the air again
Christmas chimes reminding me of
When we fell like the snow
So deep in love
High above us the evergreens
Sparkling lights and feel the breeze
As when they filled your Christmas memories


Christmas shoppers glance at us and smile
'Cause the mistletoe is occupied
And the dream is to share
This Christmas cheer with you all year
And not wait till the morning
When Christmas time is in the air again

Mr. Grinch simply can't resist
Warming up when he looks our way
Even Old Scrooge makes a Christmas wish
For a family to hold on Christmas day

And to feel love like I always
La da da, da da dum

And the dream is to share
This Christmas cheer
With you all throughout the year
And not wait till the morning
When Christmas time is in the air
Christmas time is everywhere
Christmas time is in the air again

Again
And again
