I ain't even mad, no, not like before
Off with your head, now slither at the door
Snakes in the grass, it's time to cut the lawn
Ed Scissorhands AKA I cut you off


(No)
You ain't gonna lie to my face no more
Hit me with: I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, no
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, no
Give me Ed Shapiro on the phone, case closed

You shoulda known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I 'ready been through
I can't waste no time, pay no attention to you

I said no
No, no, no
A no, no
No, no
That's a no, no
No, no
I said no, no
No, no

You came so close
You just don't know
Irregardless of what transpired
It ain't even worthy of a slick reply
Even if I was the last woman alive
I would be like Ginger, you ain't Gilligan, I
Really don't care, I'm in love with the island
Rockin' Dior 'cause it goes with my diamonds
Got a pink gown, custom by Alaïa
I'll be on stage when the stadium lights up

You shoulda known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I 'ready been through
I can't waste no time, pay no attention to you

Parlez-vous francais? I said no
