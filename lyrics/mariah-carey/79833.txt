You don't think that I'll be strong enough
I won't be a prisoner of your love


Maybe you don't think that I'll be strong enough
But I'm not gonna be a prisoner of your love
I know you're lying, denying all of your actions
So listen up 'cause here's my reaction

Here comes the night
No more living in the shadow of your love
This is my life
You always tried so hard to keep me down
But now I'll rise above
Those empty lies
Stop pretending that my accusations
Take you by surprise
I've realized
Now I'm ending all the secrecy
I see through your disguise

All the dreams we planned
I believed so I held on
I understand
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone

You don't think that I'll be strong enough
I won't be a prisoner of your love

No longer blind
I can focus on deception
Used to keep me by your side
I read your mind
Don't believe it's all a mystery
There's nothing you can hide
It's all defined
There's nothing you can tell me now
To change the way I feel inside

All the dreams we planned
I believed so I held on
I understand
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone

You don't think that I'll be strong enough
I won't be a prisoner of your love
I'm just not the girl you thought I was
I won't be a prisoner of your love

So if you wanna be my love
You can't be a liar
Play around
You see me and then say "Mariah I miss you"
Expect me to hug and kiss you
Don't mean to diss you
But I guess I'm not the kind of girl you thought i was
I've had enough and now I'll see ya later 'cause
Boy maybe you don't think that I'll be strong enough
But I won't be a prisoner baby of your love
No more no more no more no more no more no more

I won't be a prisoner of your love
I'm just not the girl you thought I was
I won't be a prisoner of your love

I'm not one of those girls who'll wait around
Crying 'cause you're playing dirty all over the town
You can't do that
I'm not a door mat
You're just a player
That's not my format
