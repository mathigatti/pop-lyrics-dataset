Don't be afraid to fly
Spread your wings
Open up the door
So much more outside


Don't be afraid to fly
Come spread your wings
And just fly
Fly, fly, just fly, just fly
Don't be afraid
Don't let your spirit die
She said

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly

Don't be afraid to fly
Don't be afraid to just fly
You, you've become a butterfly
Don't be afraid to just fly
