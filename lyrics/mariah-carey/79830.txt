Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep


But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing
If I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen

You're gonna make it happen
Oh yeah

I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on
You'll never find the answers
if you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do

Still I have to keep on going
Never knowing
If I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
(I know you're gonna make it happen)
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
(He's gonna make it happen)

If you believe in yourself enough
(If you believe)
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Yes you are)
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
(You just got hold on)
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
Make it happen

Make it
You're gonna make it
Make it
Ohh baby

Make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And finally found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
(Yes He is)

If you believe in yourself enough
(If you believe)
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
(You can make it)
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen

I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you Lord

If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it
Make it happen

Yeah
You can make it
Make it happen
Gonna make it
Gonna make it
Gonna make it

If you believe in yourself enough
(Gonna make it)
And know what you want
(Gonna make it)
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
