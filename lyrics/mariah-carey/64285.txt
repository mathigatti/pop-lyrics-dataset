You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life
Now I believe in miracles
Baby I'm forever yours

Tender love's what you're giving me and
You surpass all my fantasies and
I keep thanking the Lord above for
Blessing me with oh so much

Cause I know how it feels to be part of you boy
Everyay of my life's so abundant with joy
And I honestly never thought love could be real
Until the angels guided you to me

You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life
Now I believe in miracles
Baby I'm forever yours

I never knew this was possible
And it finally feels like my life has begun
Now that I can share it with someone

You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life
Now I believe in miracles
Baby I'm forever yours

Anything you ever need
You know I'll be right here and
(And you know and you know)
You don't have to worry boy
I won't betray your trust
Because I'm so much in love
(So much in love)

Every time your lips meet mine
It still feels like the first time
And if you lost everything
I'd keep on standing by your side
And boy it seems like everyday
I fall deeper in love
Because I can't get enough
