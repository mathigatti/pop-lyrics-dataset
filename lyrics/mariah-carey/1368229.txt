I lay awake sometimes
Scared to close my eyes
And I wonder where I left myself
I lost the will to fly


And the night melts into morning
Still it's cold beneath the sun
'Cause the fire in me's languishing
And I'm too frozen to run

Every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find
Somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine
In time
'Cause you see
I've got a lot to dream
There's more than this for me

An angel lands with broken wings
Warms me with his eyes
And the ice that sheaths around my heart
Unravel as he smiles

See I grew up locked in sorrow
So I learned to block the pain
But I won't give up tomorrow
'Cause I've come to life again

Every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find
Somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know I'm gonna be fine
That's right
'Cause for real
I've got a right to dream
There's more than this for me

But I keep on going 'cause
Every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find
Somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine
In time
'Cause you see
I've got a right to dream
There's more than this for me
