So So Def (yeah)

Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give into love
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad cuz I know that you're the one


I'm going through a situation that I can't help
Wanna get a little closer but I promised myself
That I would never give my heart away again
See, I know it's had but you gotta understand it
The truth is all the hurt and the pain and the @#%$
That you get when you have it ain't worth it
I've been there so many times I should know better but I
Can't stop what I feel when you're next to me I really think I

JD: Now how you gonna tell me that I'm not the one
MC: Baby, I need to be for sure before I give you my love
JD: But you'll never know until you give me a chance
MC: But there's a lot of things about me I don't think you understand
See, I've been cheated on
JD: Baby I have too
MC: And I've been treated wrong
JD: I know what you've been through
See, I've been there, done that, back again
And all I'm lookin' for is my special friend
MC: But I've been lied to and cried through
Some cold, lonely nights
JD: I've been played and betrayed
And this fake sh*t ain't right
Tell me what you wanna do
MC: Baby I'm just so confused
Cuz this time it might be true that baby, you're the one

See, the problem with relationships in general
Is that it's always a game
In the beginning they'll do anything to have you
But once they do it's never the same
And I know everyone out there can relate

So the question is
One, do I really wanna trust this feeling?
Two, do I wanna let it pass me by?
Three, do you think it's only superficial?
Four, could it actually be different this time?
Someone to love me
Someone to be my everything
Maybe I've stumbled upon

Bonecrusher:
It's just me and you, baby
You're so sexy, you drive me crazy
You smell so good, I wish you would
Meet me in the street
