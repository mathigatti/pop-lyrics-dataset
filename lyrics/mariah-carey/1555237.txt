Call my phone
Baby call my phone
Baby call my phone
I've been waiting to hear your ringtone
Call my phone
Baby call my phone
Baby call my phone
I've been waiting to hear your ringtone


Lost without my other half
How I can I live without ya
I don't want another,
That's why I'm messed up about ya
Can't even dream without seein' you
Why should I even try to breathe
And everything is off
Where are you
Guess it's all my fault
Lady sings the blues
No one could deny it,
We were flying like United
Thought we'd never be divided
Cause the love we had inside us was

Inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong
Inseparable
Just lost your love
Cause you swore
You never ever give it up
Cause you thought y'all was
Inseparable
Thought we'd stay together
Always and forever
But now I see that no one is
Inseparable, except for us
One of us just has to pick the phone up
Cause I know we're still inseparable

Got photos of us, on my refrigerator
Videos on my phone,
Boy I just can't erase 'em
The first text I ever got from ya
Still saved in my
Inbox and I read it back 'time after time'
Boy I'm lost can't you look
Won't you please find me
I'm down to my last tear come rescue me
See it's broken my heart
To the point where
I don't leave the house
No reason no, weekends out,
Just ain't the same without you
Boy I thought we were

Inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong
Inseparable
Just lost your love
Cause you swore
You never ever give it up
Cause you thought y'all was
Inseparable
Thought we'd stay together
Always and forever
But now I see that no one is
Inseparable, except for us
One of us just has to pick the phone up
Cause I know we're still inseparable

It's been sixteen days
Since I held you tight
Balled me up and my pillow
In the middle of the night
Boy I just wanna wish you'd show up
And make everything all right
So what you waitin' for
Cause both of us still know that we're

Inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong
Inseparable
Just lost your love
Cause you swore
You never ever give it up
Cause you thought y'all was
Inseparable
Thought we'd stay together
Always and forever
But now I see that no one is
Inseparable, Except for us
One of us just has to pick the phone up
(I know, I know, I know we are? hey)
Cause I know we're still inseparable
(I know, I know, I know we are)

Inseparable
(We are)
If you're bumping this song
(Thought we'd stay together)
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong
(Always and forever)
Inseparable
Just lost your love
Cause you swore
You never ever give it up
Cause you thought y'all was
Inseparable
Thought we'd stay together
Always and forever
(Pick the phone up)
But now I see that no one is
(Gotta pick the phone up)
(Pick the phone up)
Inseparable, Except for us
(Gotta pick the phone up)
(Phone up)
One of us just has to pick the phone up
(Gotta pick the phone up)
Cause I know we're still inseparable
(Oh baby you just gotta pick the phone up)
(The phone up)
(The phone up)
