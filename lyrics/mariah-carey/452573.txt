When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
'Cause we belong together


Show your respect
Whenever you hear me or see me
This is the emancipation of Mimi
Hot like a real fever, the real diva
So successful, yet still so eager
No matter what they say, it's on for ever
It's our time right now, more than ever
'Til the death, we gon' get it on together
And MC, you know we belong together
Come on

I lost a part of me
When you left boy can't you see
Boy come back baby please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When the times get rough
Who's gon' talk to me
'Til the sun comes up
Who's gon' take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I only think of you
On two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke
If I could be wit' you
Only you can make it right
Make it right, make it right

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singin' to me
"If you think you're lonely now,
Wait until tonight"
Boy, I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, cryin'
Tryin' to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life
Baby

I lost a part of me
When you left boy can't you see
Boy come back baby please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When the times get rough
Who's gon' talk to me
'Til the sun comes up
Who's gon' take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together
