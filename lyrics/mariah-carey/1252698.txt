(Jay-Z):
Everytime
The guns goes blast
Another day goes past
I don't miss my dogs
I'm wishing the days
Could go fast
So I could crash
Close my eyes
Try to go to sleep
And bring you back but
I can bring you back
(Nah can bring you back)
So I back
Back memories of us
Acting bad
Wish time could freeze
But time is up
And I promise ya
Imma hold it down
Till it's my time
To leave and I'm ok
I mean
Am allright not ok
And it hurts my soul
I won't see your face
But if u truely
Are in a better place
Like what say
And that's ok
I'll be allright
I've been up all night
Like if I didn't
With my nigga to be living
With the time
Tick-tick-ticking away
So forever I'm forever
I'm in search of yesterday
(Yesterday)
Like a beattle song
I close my eyes
Repeat the song
Tryna bring us back
To where we belong
Middle of the club
When be was on
I tear the song
Blowing on stank
Like Cheech and Chong
Going back before
So when I meet the don u
Should know I meet way back
With my dog when I go
So when times says goodbye
Y'all say hello


(Mariah):
Bye, bye (3x)
Bye, bye

(Jay-Z):
Rock with me
MC come one

(Mariah):
And you never got the chance
To see how good I've done
And you never got to see me
Back at number one
I wish that you were here
To celebrate together
I wish that we could spend
The holidays together

I remember when you used
To tuck me in at night
With the Teddy Bear
You gave to me
That I held so tight
I thought you
Were so strong
That you can make it
Through whatever
It's so hard
To accept the fact
You're gone forever

Never knew
I could hurt like this
And everyday
Life goes on like
I wish I could
Talk to you for awhile
I wish I could find a way
Try not to cry
As time goes by
And soon as you reach
A better place
Still I'll give
The whole world
To see your face
And I'm right here
Next to you
It feels like you
Gone too soon
The hardest thing to do
Is say bye, bye

Bye, bye (3x)
Bye, bye

This is for my people's
Who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby
Your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
(Put em up, put em up)
We will never say bye
(No, no, no)
Mamma's, daddy's, sisters
Brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my people's
Who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky
(Lift it up lift it up)
'Cos we will never
Say bye, bye

Never knew
I could hurt like this
(I never knew it)
And everyday
Life goes on like
(Everyday of my life I wish)
I wish I could
Talk to you for awhile
(I wish)
Miss you
But I try not to cry
As time goes by
(I wish, I wish
I wish as time goes by)
And as soon
As you reached
A better place
Still I'll give the world
To see your face
And we were here
Next to you
It feels
Like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing
To do
Is say bye, bye

(It's hard to say
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
So come on
Somebody sing it with me
Wave your hands up high
Hey, hey
This if for my people's
Who just lost somebody
So this is for everybody
You put your hand to the sky
'Cos we will never say bye, bye)
