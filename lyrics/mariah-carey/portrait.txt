Where do I go from here?
How do I disappear?
Here beyond the looking glass
Somewhere off the beaten path
Heart ache never seems to pass, just lasts
And I'd go


Yet I know that tomorrow comes, so I'll be here when you rise
Stay real close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
A portrait of my life

Somewhat desensitized, still the same hopeful child
Haunted by those severed ties
Pushing past the parasites
Down but not demoralized
Unconfined, but don't let go

Yes I know that tomorrow comes, so I'll be here when you rise
Stay here close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
A portrait of my life

And for the finale, she can float around effortlessly
And dream away the hours in her mind
And I'd let go

Yet I know that tomorrow comes, so I'll be here when you rise
Stay here close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
This portrait of my life
