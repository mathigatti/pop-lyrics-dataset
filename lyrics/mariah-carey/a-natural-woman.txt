Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But your love was the key to peace my mind


You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman, yeah

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm looking for
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need no more

Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman

Oh, baby, look you've done to me
Makes me feel so good inside
And I just want to be close to you
You make me fell so alive

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman

Make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman
