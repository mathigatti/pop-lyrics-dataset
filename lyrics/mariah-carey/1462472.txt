Who's right there every time you cry
Gonna sleep and wake up on your side
Endless love i always provide
They hatin' on us and u should no why
But who's be lovin you latley
Who's willing to go half on a baby
Who.. who.. who's trying to flag our ship
They just tryna get the love u give


But baby
Tell me what they know about my love
My love(x8)

They don't understand why i'll never leave u
Explain my love? i don't need to
Got everybody way up in our business
'cos lovin' each other stay on their wish list?
I see them reachin everytime u call me baby
They on my back like a shirt get off me baby
They don't love me let them wonder why
Here to stay and they going bye bye
Who's the one callin' u baby
Who's in love with your ass like crazy
Who.. who.. who's tryna flag our ship
They just tryna get the love u give baby

Tell me what they know about my love
My love(x8)

My love is your love
There ain't nothing in this world that they can do to
Make me give u up
Oh baby you will always be my girl
So let them do whatever, say whatever
'cos i ain't givin' her up

Tell me what they know about my love
My love (x8)
