Gypsy, sittin' lookin' pretty
The broken rose with laughin' eyes
You're a mystery
Always runnin' wild
Like a child without a home
You're always searchin'
Searchin for a feeling
That it's easy come and easy go


Oh - I'm sorry but it's true
You're bringin' on the
heartache
Takin' all the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Oh can't you see

You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see
Oh

You're such a secret
Misty eyed and shady
Baby, how you hold the key
Oh, you're like a candle
Your flame slowly fadin'
Burnin' out and burnin' me
Can't you see
Just try and say to you

You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Oh can't you see

You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see
Can't you see
No
No
No

You got the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Oh can't you see
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the
heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache

You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
