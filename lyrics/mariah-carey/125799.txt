"Weeping may endure for a night
But joy comes in the morning"
Trust Him


Somehow I know that there's a place up above
With no more hurt and struggling
Free of all atrocities and suffering
Because I feel the unconditional love
From one who cares enough for me
To erase all my burdens and let me be free to

Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need You now, Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of You by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray You'll come and carry me home

Can we recover, will the world ever be
A place of peace and harmony
With no war and with no brutality?
If we loved each other, we would find victory
But in this harsh reality
Sometimes I'm so despondant that I feel the need to

Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need You now, Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of You by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray You'll come and carry me home

He said He will never forsake you
Or leave you alone
Trust Him

I need You right now, right now, Lord
I need You right here by my side

Keep your head to the sky
With God's love you'll survive

Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need You now, Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of You by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray You'll come and carry me home
Carry me higher

Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need You now, Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of You by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray You'll come and carry me home
Carry me higher

Higher, higher, carry me higher
Higher, higher, carry me higher
Higher, higher, carry me higher
Higher, higher, carry me higher
Higher, higher, carry me higher
Higher, higher, carry me home

Higher, Jesus!
Carry me higher, Lord
