Just Be Good To Me

Friends tell me I'm crazy
That I'm wasting time
with you
You'll never be mine
That's not the way I see it
'Cause I feel you're already mine
Whenever you're with me


People always talk about reputation
I don't care about the other 
girls
Just be good to me
Friends are always telling me you're a user
But I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me

You may have many others
But I know when you're with me
You are all mine
Friends seem to always 
to listen
To the bad things that you do
You never do it to me

People always talk about reputation
But I care about the other 
girls
Just be good to me
Friends are always telling 
you're a user
I don't care what you do to 
them
Just be good to me

La la la la la la la la
Just be good to me

Just be good to me in the morning
Just be good to me in the afternoon and evening
Ooh yeah be good to me

La la la la la la la la 
Just be good to me

I'm not a jealous type
I won't let you down when you need
I'll be around
I'll be good to you
You'll be good to me
And we'll be together, be together

La la la la la la la la
Be nice to me
Be sweet to me
Baby
Just be good to me
