Oh ooooh yeah
The mix
Yaaay us!
Yaaay us!


Oh, they keep trying, but they can't stop us
'Cause we got a love
That keeps rising up
And yeah they fight it but we just proceed
To be who we are baby you and me

In the mix, life turns around
Round and round it goes
Oh, it's a mixed up world
And that's for sho'
In the mix, we gonna get by (We gonna)
On our own, side by side
Love's all we need to be free
I got you, you got me

Yaaay us! (in the mix)
Yaaay us! (in the mix)

We keep it inspiring even though they set limits for us to follow
Won't let 'em break us
It's all so shadowy
Never stop striving and we gonna keep climbing up
Nah, we won't cower
We stayin' strong now with superpowers

In the mix, life turns around
Round and round it goes
Oh, it's a mixed up world
And that's for sho'
In the mix, we gonna get by (We gonna)
On our own, side by side
Love's all we need to be free
I got you, you got me

Yaaay us!

In the mix, life turns around
Round and round it goes
Oh, it's a mixed up world
And that's for sho'
In the mix, we gonna get by (We gonna)
On our own, side by side
Love's all we need to be free
I got you, you got me

Yaaay us! (in the mix)
Yaaay us! (in the mix)
Yaaay us! (in the mix)
Yaaay us! (in the mix)

Something that they can't define
It's tough sometimes
Just 
Get in the mix (in the mix-ish)
