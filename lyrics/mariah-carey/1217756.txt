Y'all know what this is


[Mariah Carey]
Can't get him outta my mind
Can't explain it but it's somethin' 'bout him makin' me hot
Like a motor revvin' over and over, it don't stop
He cruised beside me, now I'm flyin'
Driving

Through yellow lights
I'm ignorin' every sign of caution that they provide
Driver's Education 101 slipped out of my mind
I need me a caddy with some cruise control
No, no, no

I've been told
So many sagas
He brings the drama
Six baby mamas
But uh oh
I can't resist him
Just want to kiss him
I need cruise control

Might need to go slow
I don't know
Why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control
I-I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night he's cruisin' through my brain

Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, ooh, he's so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't want to lose him
He already know, I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control

C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control

Can't nobody, can't nobody tell me nothin'
When he comes into view
'Cause he's the flyest ting
When he be cruisin' on me avenue

When the door open
De gals pon de block, they be hopin'
To rob tha clock, me said "No man!"
Step up, step up, bottle broken
Think I'm jokin'?

I've been told
So many sagas
He brings the drama
Six baby mamas
But uh oh
I can't resist him
Just want to kiss him
I need cruise control

Might need to go slow
I don't know
Why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control
I-I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night he's cruisin' through my brain

Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, ooh, he's so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't want to lose him
He already know, I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control

[Damian Marley]
You put your hand in cruise control
And you deny me if you want
And you will starve yourself of love
If you don't speed and break the law
You can't get no speeding ticket
On the highway to my heart
And it might be a rocky road
And you can exit if you want

(Why you always) look at life just like a pessimist?
You already like a wife up in my premises
And right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis
Just come again and stop and start just like a genesis

[Mariah Carey]
Might need to go slow
I don't know
Why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control
I-I don't know (I don't know)
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night he's cruisin' through my brain

Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, ooh, he's so smooth with it (ooh he's so smooth with it)
Deep down inside, don't want to lose him (don't want to lose him)
He already know, I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control
