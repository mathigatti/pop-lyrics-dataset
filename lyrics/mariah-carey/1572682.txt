When you saw
It was love at first sight
I called you
Did everything
To see you
And love
When I met you
Everything changed unintentionally
I
The like
You
First friends
After love
Was flowing
Faded
Pain


[Chorus]
I accidentally fall in love
I was with you
But I can not
Control myself
At the entrance
This life
The winner is the passion
Beats stronger this heart
Emotion
Much tension
Eh eh
So long
What I do not see
I remember our kiss
Inevitable
Happened
Love not forgotten
Unforgettable
Wish.
[Chorus]
I accidentally fall in love
I was with you
But I can not
Control myself
At the entrance
This life
The winner is the love [3x]
Did everything
To see you
And love
When I met you
Everything changed unintentionally
I
The like
You
First friends
After love
Was flowing
Faded
Pain
[Chorus]
I accidentally fall in love
I was with you
But I can not
Control myself
At the entrance
This life
The winner is the passion [4x]
Beats stronger this heart
Emotion
Much tension
Eh eh
So long
What I do not see
I remember our kiss
Inevitable
Happened
Love not forgotten
Unforgettable
Wish
