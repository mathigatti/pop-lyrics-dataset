So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby I'm so afraid


So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading fast
It seems you know you're slipping away from me

I keep on reaching
And I
I keep on trying
But you never even hold me
And it seems like you don't know me baby

I keep on yearning
And I
I guess I'm learning
That it's just a losing fight
'Cause there's no passion in your eyes

So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby I'm so afraid

So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading fast
It seems you know you're slipping away from me

I keep denying that our
Our love is dying
But it's all a big charade
And it's a fruitless game to play

I can't remember when
You last were tender
And it's always touch and go
The silence chills me to the bone

So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby I'm so afraid

So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading fast
It seems you know you're slipping away from me

Away, away, away, away, away
Further, further

(You're so far)
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby you're slipping away from me

(You're so far)
Time after time I reach for you
(From me baby baby)
Try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby you're slipping away from me

(You're so far)
So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
Slipping away from what we have
Tell you I just don't understand

You're so far
So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading so fast
It seems you know you're slipping away from me

Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby you're slipping away from me

Time after time I reach for you
(So far)
Try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
(Baby baby baby baby I'm)
Baby you're slipping away from me

Time after time I reach for you
(So afraid)
Try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
(Away)
Baby you're slipping away from me

Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try but you're so aloof
(So far)
Where is the boy that you used to be?
(So far)
Baby you're slipping away from me
