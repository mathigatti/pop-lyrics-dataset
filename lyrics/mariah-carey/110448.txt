I am over here
Looking at you
You are over there
Watching me too
Painting pictures of
Of how we'll kiss and fuck


So what we gonna do
(So what you gon' do? What you gon' do?)
Tell me why we're standing here
The moment's fresh and so sincere
You've got my mind blown
And, baby, I'm ready to go

(But uhh)
If it's worth your while
Say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while
Say somethin' good to me
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
If it's worth your while
Do something good to me

(Let's make it)
Hot as you can stand it
Something like volcanic
You and me seems organic
Just like the stars and planets
Yeah, we are
So what ya gonna do
(So what ya gon' do? What ya gon' do?)

Tell me why we're still in here
There's nothing for us to fear
I can tell with my eyes closed
That, baby, I'm ready to go

(But uhh)
If it's worth your while
Say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while
Say somethin' good to me
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
If it's worth your while
Do something good to me

If it's worth your while
Say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while
Say somethin' good to me
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
If it's worth your while
Do something good to me

Snoop's Rap:
Everytime I fall though
Want me to speak on the word or two
It's the D-O-double-G
And I do it so lovingly
Diggin this track by the Neptures
Babygirl, follow me to the west room
Now get buck wild
Don't make a sound
I'll take you, lay you down
Make your body go round and round
Do you want me too?
Don't say you won't
I know you do
Most girls play shy
It won't hurt until you give it a try
I know you like my smile
Dig my style, dig the bow-wow

(But uhh)
If it's worth your while
Say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while
Say somethin' good to me
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
If it's worth your while
Do something good to me

If it's worth your while
Say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while
Say somethin' good to me
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
If it's worth your while
Do something good to me
