There's a hero, if you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid of what you are
There's an answer, if you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know will melt away


And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you

It's a long road, when you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love, if you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt will disappear

And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you

Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone tear them away
Just hold on, there will be tomorrow
In time, you'll find the way

And then a hero comes along, with the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth, that a hero lies in you

That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
