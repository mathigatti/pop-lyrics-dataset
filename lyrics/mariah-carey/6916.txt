Won't you talk to me?
This is so out of hand, out of hand
Something's gone wrong
With the life that we planned


Won't you look at me?
You're avoiding my gaze, yes, you are
And it seems like you've changed
In so many ways

It isn't fair, it isn't right
If it's really gone, then tell me tonight
If it's over, if it's over
Let me go

Won't you speak to me?
I'm just here holding on, holding on
'Cause, baby, I really don't need to wait around, oh, no
If the feeling is gone

Oh, it isn't fair, it isn't right
'Cause if it's really gone, then tell me tonight, baby, yeah, yeah
If it's over, if it's over
Let me go, let me go

Don't you know?
I don't need no apologies, no
I'm not looking for no sympathy
All I'm asking for is for your honesty
Won't you give it to me?
Give it to me now

It isn't fair, it just isn't right
'Cause if it's really gone
You got to say the word tonight, oh, yeah
If it's over, if it's over
Baby, if it's over
Won't you let me know?
Baby, if it's over
If it's over, over, let me go
