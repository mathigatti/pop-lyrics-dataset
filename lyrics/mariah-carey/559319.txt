Don't you wanna go with me
Leave your cares and worries behind
Don't you wanna roll with me
Talk about the time of your life
Baby won't you smile for me
Gonna feel so much better inside
Everything's alright baby
We're gonna have the time of our lives
(The time)
So right
(Of our life)
Everything is so nice
Take a minute to enjoy the sunshine
(The time)
We're gonna get by
(Of our life)
So keep your head to the sky
Baby we're gonna have the time of our lives
Don't you wanna go with me
We're gonna have the time of our lives
