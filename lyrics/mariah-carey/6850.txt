Oh, oh, honey got me hooked on you
I like that
(Come on, MC)
La, la, la, la
(Come on) la, la, la, la
(MC)
La, la, la, la, la, la (I like that)
(Let's go)


Honey, you can have me when you want me
If you simply ask me to be there 
And you're the only one who makes me come running
'Cause what you got is far beyond compared, oh

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (that's right)
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency
Always longing for another taste of your honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, crying for you, I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day
I can't hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey, I can't describe how good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe how good it feels inside

I can't be elusive with you, honey (I like that)
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
You're the only thing I wanna do

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency
Always longing for another taste of your honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, crying for you, I adore you
(I need you, babe)
One hit of your love addicted me
(Boy, your love addicted me)
And I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day (I'll be waiting for your love)
I can't hardly wait for another taste of honey
Baby, I can't hardly wait
(Tell the world we won't stop)
(And mariah, you're on fire)
Gotta have another taste
(Tell the world we won't stop)
(So, mariah, take us higher)
(Tell the world we won't stop)
(And mariah, you're on fire)
(Tell the world we won't stop)
(So, mariah, take us higher)

Breakdown
Oh, oh, every little thing you do
(Now what we gonna do right here)
(We gonna smooth it out, come on)
Uh, uh, honey, got me hooked on you
(MC, and she won't stop)
Honey, it's like

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, crying for you, I adore you
(I need your love, right now, baby)
On hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day (Every week, I need to taste your honey)
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
It's like honey when it washes over me (I need)
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, crying for you, I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

It's like honey when it washes over me (I need)
You know sugar never ever was so sweet (that's right)
And I'm dying for you, crying for you, I adore you (I need)
One hit of your love addicted me (I need)
And I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey (I need)
Honey, I can't describe
