This goes out to you and you
And you know who you are


When glory days turn to stormy nights
You must have been so petrified
(Didn't ya, didn't ya feel so cold?)
You against the world in a losing fight
(A losing fight)
Captive of your demons inside

So you sought an enemy
(I'm not your enemy)
Like times before to mock ignorantly
(He lives in you, you know it's true)
(But the Lord said: Love your enemy; so just)
Take heed to the Word, it's time
Check Proverbs 19:29
Don't cry

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I truly wanted solidarity
Still wearing my blinders back then
(So much I didn't see)
I weep for what I've dreamed we all could be
(And so I still weep, I still weep, I still weep)
I'll keep you in prayer till the end
(Oh, still bruised)

Still bruised, still walk on eggshells
Same frightened child, hide to protect myself
(Can't believe I still need to protect myself from you)
But you can't manipulate me like before
Examine first John chapter 4 verse 4

And I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

(Be strong in the Lord and the power of His might)

If my shows of gratitude
Are miniscule inside your mind, sorry
(I am so sorry, please, forgive me)
There's only so much I can do
I love you and did all that I could
(I did all that I could)

Maybe when you're cursing me
You don't feel so incomplete
But we've all made mistakes
Felt the guilt and self-hate
I know you've been there for me plenty
Maybe still got love for me
But let him without sin
Cast the first stone brethren

But who remains standing then
Not you not I
See Phillipians 4:9
(Put it into practice and the God of Peace will be with you)

So I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

(He, who the Son sets free, is free indeed)

No weapon formed against me shall prosper
(Every time I'm afraid, I will trust in the Lord)
Surely God is my salvation
I will trust and not be afraid
The Lord, the Lord is my salvation
I will trust in Him, yes
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know
But I have had God's help to this very day
And so I stand here and testify to small and great alike

So the more you curse me, the more you're blessing me
The Word said it: Love your enemies
Do good to those who curse you
Pray for those who mistreat you

Psalms 129:2
They have greatly oppressed me from my youth
But they have not gained victory over me
(In Jesus' name... I wish you well)

(He that keeps his mind state on the Lord, He will keep them in perfect peace)
