I see fields of golden flowers,
Shine in the evening Sun,
Above are misty mountains,
It's so beautiful
As the wind caresses my eyes,
Gazing gently at the sky,
The Moon inside a halo,
It's so beautiful


When I think of all the beauty,
That nature gives to me,
From the flowers to the mountains,
It's so beautiful
There's glory and a wonder,
Far wider than the sea,
I say yes to all this loveliness
It's so beautiful

(Humming)
