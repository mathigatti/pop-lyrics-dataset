It's MC and YJ another hit, okay
We lookin' fine takin' off
Saw us on a runway
On any given Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
They try to confuse me
I never let 'em use me


I was a girl, you was a man
I was too young to understand, I was naive
I just believed everything that you told me
Said you were strong protecting me
Then I found out that you were weak
Keepin' me there under your thumb
Cause you were scared that I'd become much

More than you could handle
Shining like a chandelier
That decorated every room inside
The private hell we built
And I dealt with it like a kid I wished
I could fly away

But instead I kept my tears inside
Cause I knew if I started
I'd keep crying for the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it
But I still live with the side effects
Wakin' up scared some nights
Still dreaming 'bout the violent times

Still little protective' bout the people that I let inside
Still little defensive thinkin' folk be tryna run my life
Still little depressed inside I fake a smile and deal
With the side effects (oh, oh)
Side effects (oh, oh)
Side effects (oh, oh)
Side effects (oh, oh)

It didn't stop, no one was there
Couldn't be real
Had to keep quiet once in awhile put up a fight
It's just too much night after night
After awhile I would just lie
You was dead wrong said you was right did what
I could just to survive
Couldn't believe this was my life

Flickering like a candle
Do my best to handle
Sleeping with the enemy
Whether he was smothering every last part of me
So I broke away and finally found the strength to leave

But instead I kept my tears inside
Cause I knew if I started
I'd keep crying for the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects
Wakin' up scared some nights
Still dreaming 'bout the violent times

Still little protective' bout the people that I let inside
Still little defensive thinkin' folk be tryna run my life
Still little depressed inside I fake a smile and deal
With the side effects (oh, oh)
Side effects (oh, oh)
Side effects (oh, oh)
Side effects (oh, oh)

Hey, hey, hey
Let's go
Hey Magnifico, or should I say Magnificent?
Ain't nothing worth your happiness
And I ain't caring who you're
With misery love company so we ain't tryin' to hang with y'all
Hurt you if ya let 'em in
Gotta keep ya sucka smilin'
Keep tryin' to play I tell him
I ain't blowin' tho think they want me outta here

I tell 'em
I ain't goin' tho
Side effects
Bbe drowsiness
Loneliness
How is this?
I think the call it hateration
What can you prescribe for this?

Forgive but I can't forget
Every day I deal with this
I live with the side efffects
But I ain't gonna let them get the best of me

But instead I kept my tears inside
Cause I knew if I started
I'd keep crying for the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects
Wakin' up scared some nights
Still dreaming 'bout the violent times

Still little protective' bout the people that I let inside
Still little defensive thinkin' folk be tryna run my life
Still little depressed inside I fake a smile and deal
With the side effects (oh, oh)
Side effects (oh, oh)
Side effects (oh, oh)
Side effects (oh, oh)
