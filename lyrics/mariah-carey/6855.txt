Break break down
Steady breaking me on down
Break break down
Steady breaking me on down
Break break down
Steady breaking me on down
Break break down
Steady breaking me on down


You called yesterday
To basicallly say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was ok
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do when
Somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing I Will Survive
Do you lash out and say: How dare you leave this way?
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

Break break down
Steady breaking me on down
Break break down
Steady breaking me on down

Gonna break it down
Only if you let it
Everyday crazy situations rockin' my mind
Tryin' to break me down
But i won't let it
Forget it

I'll be feelin' like you're gonna break me down
Kickin' me 'round
Stressin' me out
I think I better go get out and let me relieve some stress

Don't ever wanna feel no pain pain
Hoping for the sun but it looks like rain rain rain rain rain
Oh I just wanna maintain

Yeah I can feel the pressure yo
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over
It's ending here

Well I guess I'm trying to be
(Ooh, I'm crying)
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
(I'm gradually dying inside of my heart)
Underneath the disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
(How do I feel)
And I lie convincingly
(I'm losing my mind)
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry
(I break down and cry)

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
(I'm slowly losing my mind)
Underneath the disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
(How do I feel)
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
(Why do you think you gotta know I'm suffering)
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
(So I)
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
