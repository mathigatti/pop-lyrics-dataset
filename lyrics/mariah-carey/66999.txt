[Ice Cube]
Slippin' slidin' glidin'
Low ridin' (yeah)
Ain't no hidin' from this hit (On the real)
Fool you know how we do it (Irresistible)
Just keep it poppin' ain't no stoppin'
Fo' hoppin' xxx droppin'
Keep it poppin' ain't no stoppin' (What, Mariah)
Fo' hoppin' xxx droppin' (Westside)


[Chorus]
Everytime I try to leave (She's comin' to the Westiside, Westside)
Something pulls me back baby (Mariah's on the Westside, Westside)
Tried and tried to let you go (Yeah hittin' on the Westside, Westside)
But it's just impossible (Irresistible)
Everytime we say goodbye (Westside, Westside)
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes (She's comin' to the Westiside, Westside)
Wish I didn't need you so (Mariah's on the Westside, Westside)
But you're irresistible (Yeah hittin' on the Westside, Westside)
(Irresistible)

[Mariah Carey]
I don't wanna lose you to somebody else
But I can't go on contradicting myself
I know that it's pointless to keep hodling on
But something inside tells me you're where I belong

[Chorus]
Everytime I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go (Yeah)
But it's just impossible (Irresistible)
Everytime we say goodbye (Westside, Westside)
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible

[Mariah Carey]
I know that it's unrealistic to think
That things will get better between you and me
Cause time after time you just shatter my heart
But when I'm without you I feel so torn apart

[Chorus]
Everytime I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Everytime we say goodbye (Westside, Westside)
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible (You know how we do it)

[Mariah Carey]
B-oy I wi-sh
That I di-dn't
Love you so - oh ooh oh ooh oh oh
I try to tell you no
But you're ir-resistible - oh ooh oh ooh oh

[Ice Cube]
Westside, Westside
She's comin' to the Westside, Westside (Oh yeah)
Mariah's on the Westside, Westside (Yeah)
Hittin' on the Westside, Westside

[Mack 10]
Ain't nothin' goin' on but a party and a hit song
Jumpin' all night long
It's like times gettin' deeper and the game's gettin flier
Cause the Westside done connected with Mariah
I hit the Grammy party and the 64 is what I drove through
Cause divas like thugs too
Mack 10, I'm so so gangsta with meals
And I ain't lyin' that's on everything I'm keepin' it real

[WC]
Can you feel it nothin' can save ya
From this young rider with big wheels and paper
The Millenium Clyde and Bonnie, doin' 90
With Giovannis on the big body
Ya friends say "Girl he ain't lovin' ya right"
You stay down with this thug in ya life
What we got is deeper than physical
Dub C and Mariah, gangsta lovin' is irresistible

[Mariah Carey]
See I only want it to be like it was
When we got together and first fell in love
Sometimes it's just like I'm addicted to you
This love's so consuming I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
Everytime I try to leave (She's comin' to the Westiside, Westside)
Something pulls me back baby (Mariah's on the Westside, Westside)
Tried and tried to let you go (Hittin' on the Westside, Westside)
But it's just impossible (Irresistible)
Everytime we say goodbye (Westside, Westisde)
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes (She's comin' to the Westiside, Westside)
Wish I didn't need you so (Mariah's on the Westside, Westside)
But you're irresistible (Irresistible)

Everytime I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Everytime we say goodbye
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible
(You know how we do it)
