Oh, my little snowman
He’s the coolest guy in town
He's jolly and he's happy
Nothing's gonna bring him down
All the people say that there ain't no way
This Christmas he ain't coming around
Oh, my little snowman
He's the finest boy to me (ooh, ooh, ooh)
He's got them pretty little eyes
And the biggest belly you've ever seen (ooh, ooh, ooh)
He's got his hat to the back 'cause he's cool like that
And they don't know how he makes me feel


Oh, my little snowman
Does what no one else can
You can't tell me he ain't for real
Baby, baby, my baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Baby, baby, my baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, my little snowman
Does what no one else can
You can't tell me, he ain't for real
