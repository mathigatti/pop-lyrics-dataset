And I'm gonna spend my time,
Drawing pictures in the sand for you.
And I'm gonna ride the tide,
And I'm gonna make a rendezvous.


Sitting by the sea,
Sipping at my tea,
Drawing pictures in the sand,
And writing message to you.

Pictures in the sand (Drawing pictures in the sand)
There is nothing I would rather do (There is nothing I would rather do)
Than just sit here in the sand (Drawing pictures in the sand)
And think of thinks I'd like to say to you (I love you true)
Every single day (Every single day)
I waste my time away,
Drawing pictures in the sand,
And writing messages to you.

(All together)
Pictures in the sand. (Drawing pictures in the sand)
Pictures in the sand.

If I didn't have a dime,
Would you still be loving me?
While I spend my whole life through,
Drawing pictures just for you.
But I could never draw my love,
It's so very hard to do.

Every single day,
I waste my time away,
Drawing pictures in the sand,
And writing messages to you.

Pictures in the sand. (Drawing pictures in the sand)
Pictures in the sand. (Do-bum, do-bum...)
Pictures in the sand. (Drawing pictures in the sand)
