I'm on an island
And I've got no where to swim
Oh what a mood I am in
I'm on an island


I'm on an island
Since my girl left me behind
She said that I'm not her kind
I'm on an island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me

I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on the island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on this island

I'm on an island
I'm on an island
