They call me the Long Tall Shorty
'Cause I know what love is all about
They call me Long Tall Shorty
'Cause I know what love is all about
Well I can tell you where the lights go
Oh, when they go out


Girls, if you get lonely
Dial 4-2-4-6-8-9
Well, girls, if you get lonely
Dial 4-2-4-6-8-9
And your troubles will be over
I'll even give you back you dime
Oh yeah

I like 'em long, I like 'em tall
I like 'em short, and that ain't all
Now when I die, don't bury me deep
Just put some women to my head, to my feet
Tell all the world now, to come and peep
Long Tall Shorty now has gone to sleep
Whoa now

I like 'em long, I like 'em tall
Oh yeah

They call me Long Tall Shorty
'Cause I know what love is all about
They call me Long Tall Shorty
'Cause I know what love is all about
Well I can tell you where the lights go
Oh, when they go out
