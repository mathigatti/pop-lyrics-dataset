How much more do we need,
Money, power and greed,
Possessions steal your soul, ooh.


Why are we so blind,
An arrogant, thoughtless kind,
We use our bodies and waste our time, ooh.

Social difficulties,
desperate politics,
Disorders of the mind,
Ooh.

Life is a drag and it's too senous,
I'm so much in love,
But I'm too serious,
The world is so sick,
And I'm delirious.

Morality bores me it's so serious,
No minds of our own,
And it's too serious,
Governments lie and it's so curious.

Too serious,
Too serious,
Too serious.

Tell you what we need,
We need less authority,
A lot more honesty, ooh,

I've been preached to all my life,
I've listened till I could cry,
But I don't need anymore, ooh,

Now we must make a stand,
To fight for the spirit in man,
The future is in our hands, ooh.

But life is a drag and it's too serious,
I'm so much in love that I'm delirious,
Life is so strange and it's mysterious,

No minds of our own,
And it's too serious,
Morality bores me it's so serious,
Governments lie and it's so curious.

Too serious,
Too serious,
Too serious.
