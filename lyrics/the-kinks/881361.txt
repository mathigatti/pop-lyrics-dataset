See that girl walkin' down the street
She looks like a prima donna
She's a star in her head and the world's at her feet
She looks at you twice and your heart skips a beat
She didn't learn it at high school or from a glossy magazine
You see she's a natural, she gotta natural gift
You gotta rise above your stupidity
You're dumb but don't give in
You gotta rise above your station
Discover what's within
And with some luck and dedication and some careful manipulation


Everybody needs some inspiration
Everybody needs some motivation
Mix it up with some imagination
And use your natural gifts, you gotta natural gift
You got natural gifts
Ah, hey, hey, hey, ah, hey, hey
And use your natural gifts, you got natural gifts

You don't have to be a genius to find
All the hidden potential deep in your mind
You don't have to know about nuclear physics
Know all the formulas and vital statistics
You don't have to be an intellectual, you don't have to be a scientist
To use your natural gifts, you got natural gifts, yeh
Use your natural gifts, you got natural gifts
You gotta stop this depression you're in now
Stop this emotional rift, you need a psychological lift now
Everybody needs some inspiration, everybody needs some motivation
Mix it up with some imagination and use your natural gifts
There are bad people, mad people, bitter people, scared people
Wanna put you down and keep you in your place
But you gotta chance to break out, you gotta chance to get out
And use your natural gifts
