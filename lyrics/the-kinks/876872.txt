I met her in a club down in old soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like coca cola
C-O-L-A Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L-O-L-A Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola


Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola, lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man
Oh my Lola, lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candle light
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said "dear boy, won't you come home with me?"
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
But when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola

Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me

Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Girl will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Well, I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said "dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man"

Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad that I'm a man and so is Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola

Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
