I need you
I need you more than birds need the sky
I need you, it's true little girl
That you can lift the tears from my eyes


But if you ever tell me good-bye
I'll break down and you'll hear me cry
I need you
More than anybody else has needed anyone before

I need you
There's no one else to stand in your place
I need you, you know little girl
That you can keep the smile on my face

But if you ever tell me good-bye
I'll break down and you'll hear me cry
I need you
More than anybody else has needed anyone before

I need you
There's no one else to stand in your place
I need you, you know little girl
That you can keep the smile on my face

But if you ever tell me good-bye
I'll break down and you'll hear me cry
I need you
More than anybody else has needed anyone before (2x)

(3x)
I need you
