I look back at the way I used to look at life
Soft, white dreams with sugar coated outside
It was great, so great
Young and innocent days


I wish my eyes could only see
Everything, exactly as it used to be
It's too late, so late
Young and innocent days

I see the lines across your face
Time has gone and nothing ever can replace
Those great, so great
Young and innocent days
