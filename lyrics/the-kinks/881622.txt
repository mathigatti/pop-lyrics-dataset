You worry 'bout the sun
What's the use of worrying 'bout the big ol' sun
You worry 'bout the rain
The rain keeps falling just the same
You worry when the one you need has found somebody new


But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

You worry 'bout yourself
What's the use of worrying now you're almost grown
You worry 'bout your own
What's the use of worrying 'cause you'll die alone
Times will be hard, rain will fall
And you'll feel mighty low

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

Times will be hard, rain will fall
And you'll feel mighty low

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
