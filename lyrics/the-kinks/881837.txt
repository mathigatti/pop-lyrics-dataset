I've been trying to get a message to you,
But the operator can't put me through,
Because the vandals went and wrecked all the telephones.
And all my enemies are spreading bad news,
You won't call me, that's why I'm calling you,
To put you straight about the rumors they're spreading about me back home.


I should have known, sooner or later,
You'd get the news, sooner or later,
The word of mouth will get right back to you.

Somehow we lost communication,
My only chance in my situation,
Is that the word of mouth gets my message through.

The word of mouth,
The word of mouth,
But who are they to say the things they do?

The word of mouth says that I've gone insane,
That wine and women have affected my brain.
Well who's the big mouth spreading the news again?
The word of mouth says I'm round the bend,
It's all over, this is the end.
Exaggeration sure gets the better of people who send[?].

The word of mouth,
The word of mouth,
But who are they to say the things they do?

The word of mouth said I should be put in my place.
The word is out I'm in disgrace -- a waste of space.
But if they say it, say it to my face.

People talking, trying to dig up the dirt,
There are so many lies around.
They spread their gossip and the rumors around this town.

Word of mouth, face to face,
My word of mouth has stated my case,
And I'm saying I'm coming back home to you.

You should have know sooner or later,
You'd get the news sooner or later,
The word of mouth will get right back to you.

The word of mouth,
Shut your mouth,
Shut your face!
