Pressure pressure I got pressure, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Pressure pressure I got pressure, oh yeah


I don't really want to give it to you
'Cos it's really contagious
You can pick it up anywhere
And it can be quite dangerous
You can spread it mouth to mouth
You can even get it when you're alone
But I can always live with it
Whenever I am close to you

Pressure pressure I got pressure, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Pressure pressure I got pressure

I get it driving in my motor car
I get it when I'm drinking in a bar
I get it riding on the subway
I get it regular every day
And anyone who never had it yet
And doesn't know what I'm going through
But I forget the pressure
When I am close to you

Altogether now-Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Pressure pressure I got pressure Oh yeah. oh yeah. oh yeah
Pressure pressure FEEL THE PRESSURE

You got the pressure and that's a fact
I can tell by the way you act
And I can tell that you're pressurised
By the look that's in your eyes
I know the pressure 'cos I've got it too
So I know what you're going through
But I forget the pressure
Whenever I am close to you
