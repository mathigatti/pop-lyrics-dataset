Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.


I went down to Australia,
With my rock 'n' roll band.
It's very hot in Australia,
Still I'm gonna do the best I can.
Still I'm going to Tokyo,
Somehow I've gotta go.

I've gotta go to oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.

When I get to Tokyo,
I'm gonna see my girlfriend.
She gonna hold me so tight,
She gonna be my friend.
And when we have an argument,
She gonna tell me where to go.

"Why don't you get out and go to oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo"
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.

I went to sushi bar,
I saw pretty Tokyo girl.
I had lots of sake, sake, sake,
Make me feel drunk, feel good.
I went for a drink with Road Hog and Romeo,

In oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.

Pretty soon,
I'm gonna fly away.
Me and my girlfriend,
We gonna come back some day.
When I fly back to England,
I'll think of all the people I know,

Way back in oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.
