Won't you sing me a song or two,
Won't take you long to just sing to me please,
Won't you whistle a tune.


I got nothing to gain, I got nothing to lose,
But if you sing me a song,
You'll make me happy.

Sing Mr. Songbird,
Sing Mr. Songbird,
Sing Mr. Songbird,
You help to keep my troubles away.

Sing Mr. Songbird,
Sing Mr. Songbird,
Sing Mr. Songbird,
You help to keep my troubles away.

Mister, won't you sing me a song,
Won't you sing a little melody.
Won't you try to help me along,
Won't you sing a little song for me, oh yeah.

Sing me a song or two,
Won't take you long to just sing to me please,
Won't you whistle a tune.

Though I ain't got a beanie
'Cause I've nothing to dream,
So if you waiting for nothing,
Do something for me.

Sing Mr. Songbird,
Sing Mr. Songbird,
Sing Mr. Songbird,
You help to keep my troubles away.

Sing Mr. Songbird,
Sing Mr. Songbird,
Sing Mr. Songbird,
You help to keep my troubles away.
You help to keep my problems away.
You help to keep the devil away.
