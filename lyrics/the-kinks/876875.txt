(Hello, who's that speaking, please?)

I'm on a party line,
Wonderin' all the time,
Who's on the other end?
Is she big, is she small?
Is she a she at all?
Who's on my party line?


Wish I had a more direct connection.
This party line was here when I arrived.
And I'm not voting in the next election,
If they don't do something about finding out
the person who is on my party line.

I'm on a party line.
I'm on a party line.

I can't speak without an interception.
This is private, please get off my line.
Please tell me when I can have my privacy.
I'd like to meet the girl who's always talking
when I'm speaking on my party line.
