Get out of that house,
Stop watching T.V.
Have you heard the news,
Well there's a new world here,
And it's staring straight at you,
Don't want no politics,
Religion too.
They've got nothing left to prove,
Well my heart's beatin' rhythm,
And my soul keeps singin' the blues,
I know we can make it happen,
Anytime we want it to,
I know we can make it happen,
Now it's all up to you.


Chorus
We got nothing more to lose,
Nothing more to lose,
Nothing more to lose.

We're so proud of our intellect,
Arrogant selfish fools
Who can look no further than,
A bunch of separative rules.
Well if we're all so clever and technology
rules,
Why is it we're so scared.
I got a rockin' psychosis,
And my juke box blown a fuse.
Don't look there's someone watching,
Though they're many light years away.
Don't stop,
They may be listening to every single word
you say.

Chorus
Nothing more to lose,
Nothing more to lose,
Nothing more to lose.

Can you feel something strange in your
heart,
In your brain,
But it's not what you think.
You're just waking out of sleep.

Chorus
Nothing more to lose,
Nothing more to lose,
Nothing more to lose.
I know we can make it happen,
Anytime we want it to,
I know we can make it happen,
Now it's all up to you.

Chorus
You got nothing more to lose,
Nothing more to lose,
Nothing more to lose.
Can you feel something strange in your
heart,
In your brain,
Nothing more to lose.

Repeat
