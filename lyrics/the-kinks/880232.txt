Eastern eyes they cry,
Western eyes they cannot see,
Memory is gone,
I'm alone, and I am free,
In my mind I see
All my spiritual history,
Egypt calls me back,
But I must change the past in me.


Chorus: Oh, could it be a love
everlasting for you and me,
Peace let there be,
I know now I love you,
Oh, let it be,
Please leave us be,
We are seeds of heaven, eternally.

Eastern eyes they smile,
Over all our western trials,
All we see will fade,
All that's real will be again.

Chorus: Oh, could it be a love
everlasting for you and me,
Peace let there be,
I know now I love you,
Oh, let it be,
Please leave us be,
We are seeds of heaven, eternally.
