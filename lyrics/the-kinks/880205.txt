I've seen you, cold winter,
I know you, cold winter.
You showed me no mercy,
Still I shan't forget[?] the warning.


You'll never know how it feels to be loved.

I know you, cold winter,
You broke my heart, cold winter.

I missed you, warm summer,
Never thought I'd see you, cold summer.

You'll never know how it feels to be loved.

I thank you, cold winter,
Never leave that game[?] to life's story.
You healed me, cold winter,
You taught me how to face the morning.
