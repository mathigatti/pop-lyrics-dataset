Don't you fret, now, I'll be there
I'll be there to hold your hand.
I'll be there to see the sunrise,
As it lightens up the sky.


Don't you fret, now, I'll be there,
I'll be there to put you right.
I'll be there to hold you tightly,
When the Sun goes down at night.

I can't wait until the day,
I'll come home to you again.
For my love won't ever fade,
I will always feel the same.

Don't you fret, don't you fret,
I'll come home to you again.
Don't you fret, don't you fret,
I'll come home to you again.

Make a brand new pot of tea,
Make my favorite kind of dish.
Do the things that I remember,
That'll make my dearest wish.

I can't wait until the day,
I'll come home to you again.
for my love won't ever fade,
I will always feel the same.

So don't you fret love,
Don't you fret love, no more.
Don't you fret love, no more.
