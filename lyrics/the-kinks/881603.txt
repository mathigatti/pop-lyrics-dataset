Once under a scarlet sky I told you never ending lies
But they were the words of a drunken vagabond
Who knew very well he would break your heart before long
Oh forgive me Genevieve


Now I've come back to see Sweet Lady Genevieve
This time I'll give you some security
And I will make promises I can keep
So will you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve

Let me rock you, hold you
Take you in my arms
Forgive me, please
Smile away all your sadness, put your trust in me

Oh if you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve
I'm not the impetuous fool you used to know
I know that I used you and I hurt you so
But that was so long ago Sweet Lady Genevieve

Oh, love me
Take me in your arms
Let me rock you, hold you
Smile away all your sadness, put your trust in me

Once under a starry sky I led you on and told you lies
Drank too much whiskey on that hot summer night
I acted so slyly because you were acting so shy
Oh forgive me Genevieve

If you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve
You're not the child who smiled so innocently
And I'm not the rogue that I used to be
So will you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve

Oh Genevieve, Oh Genevieve
