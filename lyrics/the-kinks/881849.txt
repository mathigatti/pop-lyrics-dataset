When I first saw her
She looked alright,
Second time that I saw her
She looked outta sight.
And I said,
You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
And I feel alright,
Yes, I feel alright.


She got all the angles,
So directly applied.
And when I see her,
I have to cry,
You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
And I feel alright,
Yeah, I feel alright.

You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
And I feel alright,
And I feel alright.
