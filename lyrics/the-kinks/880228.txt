Down all the days
Though the past is just a blink away,
The future waits for me and you,
Down all the days to 1992


Here is hope for all the people
And generations yet to come,
An the future's bright tomorrow,
Illuminated by the morning sun.
Here's for all the working people
And me the ordinary man
For assembly workers in the factory
For farmers toiling on the land

Down all the days
All nations will unite as one
A new horizon clear to view
Down all the days to 1992

So lonely on this island ever since she set me free.
Breaking out of my isolation
Reaching out with hands across the sea
Down all the days, down all the days

Hello my Celt and Gaelic ladies.
Bonsoir my green colleen from Ireland
Wilkommen Deutch and Dutch and Dansk
Gutten tag amour prego ola combien

I'm losing all my bitterness
It's time to find some happiness
Around the earth, the sky, the sea
Down all the days

Bon soir, my little senorita, c'est magnifique
Au revoir, my little fraulfin baby, it's so tragique
Achtung parlez vous Englese, bon appetit
Jawohl, mambo Italiano, ca va, O.K. I'm on my way
Down all the days.

Can we heal the wounds of many wars?
And the battle scars that went before
Down all the days to 1992
There's gonna be a celebration in 1992
Somehow we lost communication
But I'll find you girl and come back home to you
Down all the days
There's gonna be a celebration in 1992
Somehow we lost communication
I'll find you girl and come back home to you
Down all the days.
Around the earth, the sky, the sea, down all the days
Around the earth, the sky, the sea, down all the days
