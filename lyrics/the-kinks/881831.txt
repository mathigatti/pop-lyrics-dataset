Who'll be the next in line for heartache?
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you?


Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line?

Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next to watch your love fade?
All your affections finally fade away.

There'll be no use in sighing.
Who'll be the next in line?
For you?

I was the best one you had,
I was the one who gave you love.

Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches?
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you?

There'll be no use in sighing.
Who'll be the next in line?
For you?

One day you'll find out when I'm gone,
I was the best one you had,
I was the one who gave you love.

Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches?
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you?
