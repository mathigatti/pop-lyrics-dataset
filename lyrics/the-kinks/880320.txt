Ever since I was a child,
I loved to wander wild
Through the bright city lights,
And find myself a life I could call my own.
It was always my ambition
To see Piccadilly,
Ramble and roam around Soho
And Pimlico and Savile Row,
And walk down the Abbey Road.
So I saved all my money
And packed up my clothes,
And I said good-bye to my friends
And my folks back home.
And I left for a life of my own.
I left for a life on the road.


I'm a real hungry tyke,
And I know what I like.
And I know where I'm goin':
To those bright city lights.
Oh yeah, oh yeah,
This time I'm gonna get there.
I'm bound for a life on the road.
Give me life on the road.
I said life on the road.

When I arrived in Euston,
I was little more than a child.
And I didn't know then
That the dives and the dens
Would be so vulgar and wicked and wild.
Mama always told me
The city ladies were bawdy and bold.
And so I searched night and day
To catch a kissable lady,
But all that I caught was a cold,
'Cause those stuck-up city ladies
Didn't notice me walk by.
Now I've got holes in my shoes
'Cause I've been walkin' the streets all night.
And I'm livin' the life that I chose.
Livin' my life on the road.
I said life on the road.
I want life on the road.
Life on the road.

I was standing with the punks in Praed Street,
When a muscle man came my way.
He said, "Hey, are you gay?
Can you come out and play?"
And like a fool, I went and said, "O.K."
Ever since I was knee high,
I thought the city was paved with gold.
But I've seen so many losers
And down and out boozers
Who were tired of bein' bought and sold.
City women are a tease,
But I'd really love to please.
Now I've got blood shot eyes
'Cause I've been walkin' the streets all night.
And it sure knocks you out on the road.
And I'm livin' my life on the road.
I said life on the road.
Life on the road.
I want life on the road.

One of these days,
I wanna go home,
Visit my friends,
And see all the places that I used to know,
And say good-bye to a world that's too real;
Good-bye to a world that's forgotten how to feel.
And it's slowly usin' me,
And there's no security.
Sometimes I hate the road,
But it's the only life I know.
But I'm livin' the life that I chose,
So I'll live out my life on the road.

Give me life on the road.
I said life on the road.
(repeat)
