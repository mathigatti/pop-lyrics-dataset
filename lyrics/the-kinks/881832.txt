Whose foolin' who?
Whose foolin' who, well I can't believe my eyes


High wire, firewire, stressed, doomed, denigrated
Bush whacked, side-tracked, tired of being manipulated
Brain dead, paranoid, the mutant pact is activated.
Acting out..just automated

Forked tongues everywhere, can't believe a word they're sayin'
In the news, on the net, channel hopping, mind boggling
Trying hard to find solutions, constant media pollution
Mind control robot stare me in the face

Where do I look, where can I turn?
Always conquering the world, is there nothing we have learned?
I look in the mirror and what do I see?
Is it really my reflection or a channel on TV?

Whose foolin' who?
Whose foolin' who, well I can't believe my eyes
Whose foolin' who?

Electromagnetic vibrations fill the air
Contaminate my mind, confusion and despair
I can't tell what's going on most of the time
I'm full of desires, that aren't even mine!

Hounded, grounded, frowned upon, isolated
Sensory overload, not what I anticipated
Totally drained, and I'm down on my knees
Existence in denial, I'm losing my mind

What do you see when nothing is real
Are you a dream or just a figment of my mind
Or a chemical reaction running rampant inside?
Truth is not what it used to be!

Whose foolin' who?
Whose foolin' who, well I can't believe my eyes
Whose foolin' who?

Whose foolin' who?
Whose foolin' who?
Whose foolin' who?
If you're fooling yourself, then whose foolin' who?

Can you trust what you see?
What you hear?
What you read in the papers, on TV?
CNN, CBS, UPN, TBN
When will it ever end?
Always living in the red
Are we the living dead?
This is living hell
Strange little world that's all in your head

What do you see when nothing is real?
Are you a dream or just a figment of my mind
Or a chemical reaction running rampant inside?
Truth is not what it used to be!

Whose foolin' who?
Whose foolin' who, well I can't believe my eyes

Whose foolin' who?
Whose foolin' who, well I can't believe my eyes

Whose foolin' who?
Whose foolin' who?
Whose foolin' who?
If you're fooling yourself
Then whose fooling who?
You!
Here! I'm talking to you!
