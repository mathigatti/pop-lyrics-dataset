Baby, you don't know what you're saying
Because you're a victim of bright city lights
And your mind is not right
You think the world's at your feet


'Cause you're starstruck, baby, starstruck
Taken in by the lights
Think you'll never look back
You know you're starstruck on me

Baby, you're running around like you're crazy
You go to a party and dance through the night
And you'll drink 'till you're tight
And then you're out on your feet

'Cause you're starstruck, baby, starstruck
Taken in by the lights
Think you'll never look back
You know you're starstruck on me

Baby, watch out or else you'll be ruined
'Cause once you're addicted to wine and champagne
It's gonna drive you insane
Because the world's not so tame

And you're starstruck, baby, starstruck
You're taken in by the lights
Think you'll never look back
You know you're starstruck on me
Don't you know that you are
Starstruck on me
And you always will be
Starstruck on me
Starstruck on me
