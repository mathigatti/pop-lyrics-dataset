They want your mind and your body
But they don't understand
And don't care much about it
Gotta work for your country
Society's built on concrete and money
If this room was to vanish
And the toys of man turned to civilized dust
There'd still be you and me, honey
With our history gone
But the spirit lives on


Build those highways, build those cars
On a planet full of scrap metal
There'd better be life on Mars

Chorus:
It's alright, it's alright
If you don't think about it
It's alright
If you don't look at it, it's alright

How time slips away
Live by the Good Book
That's what the wise men say
But where does it leave us
Were they right or were they wrong
Gotta have hope, gotta carry on

It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

They want your soul and your spirit
Make them understand
These things they never can have
Gotta work for your family
A community built on trust, not money
If this town was to vanish
And the office blocks were just turned into ashes
They'd be you and me, honey
With the will to survive
And the spirit lives on

Build those factories
Plants and cars
On a planet so desecrated
There'd better be life on Mars

Chorus

How time slips away
Live by the Good Book
That's what the wise men say
But where does it leave us
Were they right or were they wrong
Gotta have hope
Gotta carry on

It's alright, it's alright
