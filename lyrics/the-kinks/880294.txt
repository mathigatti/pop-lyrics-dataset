In a space allocated to me by the human race
Inhabiting this area until I die this space is occupied
I'm in a space leased by kind permission of the human race
Close up I am big but far away I'm small and hardly here at all
'Cause in a space out in space
We disappear without a trace


Now I'm out in inner space
And lookin' at the people. standing face to face
And filling up the space
Men and women boys and girls
There are so many people in the world
Thinkin' about the world
And all the people in it
And I'm staring at the stars
And into the infinite
In a world within a world
On a planet that's
Driftin' in a space

Seconds into minutes and minutes
Into hours and hours into days
And days into months and months into years
And years into decade tens into thousands
Thousands into millions, millions into billions
Billions into zillions and forever and forever

In a space allocated by the human race
Somewhere in outer space it's far away and I like it that way
Now I'm out in inner space
And lookin' at the people, standing face to face
And filling up the space
Men and women boys and girls
There are so many people in the world
Thinkin' about the world
And all the people in it
And I'm staring at the stars
And into the infinite
In a world within a world
On a planet that's
Driftin' in a space

In a space, in a space, in a space
Now I'm out in inner space
And lookin' at the people standing face to face
And filling up the space
On a planet that's
Driftin' in a space
