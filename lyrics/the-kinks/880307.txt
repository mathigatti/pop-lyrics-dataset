Please step inside
Just for a while
I want to befriend you
And just make you smile


You've nothing to lose
I've nothing to gain
I shall not molest you
I shan't break your brain

Friends we'll become
Friends we will stay
Friends till forever
Or just today

Please don't deceive
Please don't pretend
Just be my companion
And friend till the end
