Dear Margaret I beg of you
Dear Margaret gonna tell on you
Don't want to be patronized
By those lying eyes
Dear Margaret I wanted you


You're warming me up
So you can leave me cold
Kissin' up to the rich
Intending to control
All the money money money
Is that all you live for
You're a model and example
Of a greed that will destroy

Dear Margaret I beg of you
Don't you like Rock 'n' Roll
Dear Margaret gonna tell on you
I like your wiggle when you walk
Dear Margaret I trusted you
Don't you let me down
Dear Margaret I wanted you

You had me living the illusion
To be a millionaire
Investing in stocks
Look at you now stringin' other guys along
You're into swinging
Now the money is all gone

Dear Margaret I beg of you
Don't you like Rock 'n' Roll
Dear Margaret I trusted you

Your economic growth
And your cool suntan
But what have you done to your fellow man
You've betrated us all with just a
Wave of your hand
What good is prosperity
When it starves the soul in man

Dear Margaret I beg of you
Don't you like Rock 'n' Roll
Dear Margaret gonna tell on you
I like your wiggle when you walk

Don't want to be patronized
By those lying eyes
Dear Margaret I trusted you
Don't you let me down
Dear Margaret I wanted you
