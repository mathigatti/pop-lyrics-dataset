They took my baby to Holloway jail,
They took my baby, down Holloway jail,
She was a lady when she went in,
Now she's in jail, and it's giving me hell.


She was just succeeding in the city,
She was just beginning to excel,
And then a spiv named Frankie Simes
Led her to a life of crime,
And led her on the downward trail.

Frankie came home late from work one evening,
The C.I.D. were hot on his trail,
Frankie promised everything,
And then he went and turned her in,
She went and took the rap for him,
Now she's impaled in Holloway jail.

They took my baby, down Holloway jail,
They took my baby to Holloway jail,
There ain't no pity, there ain't no bail,
And she assures me that it's living hell.

She was young and ever so pretty,
Now she looks so old and pale,
She never sees the day,
She wastes her life away,
Sitting in that prison cell.

They took my baby to Holloway jail,
They locked my baby in Holloway jail,
She was a lady when she went in,
Now she's in jail, and it's giving me hell.

She's impaled, in Holloway jail.
