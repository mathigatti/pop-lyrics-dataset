It is time for you to stop all of your sobbing
Yes it's time for you to stop all of your sobbing
There's one thing that you gotta do
To make me still want you


Gotta stop sobbing now
Yeah, stop it, stop it
Gotta stop sobbing now

It is time for you to laugh instead of crying
Yes it's time for you to laugh so keep on trying
There's one thing that you gotta do
To make me still want you

Gotta stop sobbing now
Yeah, stop it, stop it
Gotta stop sobbing now

Each little tear that falls from your eye
Makes, makes-a me want
To take you in my arms and tell you to stop all your sobbing

Yes it's time for you to stop all of your sobbing
Yes it's time for you to stop all of your sobbing
There's one thing that you gotta do
To make me still want you

Gotta stop sobbing now
Yeah, stop it, stop it
Gotta stop sobbing now
Stop it, stop it
Gotta stop sobbing now
Sobbin' sobbin' sobbing
