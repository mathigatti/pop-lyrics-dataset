Oh, oh darlin',
Little darlin',
Did you ever see such a stormy sky?
It's never been like this before.


All the people,
They're runnin'.
Ev'rybody's try'n' to hide,
To get away from that stormy sky.
Perhaps it's a sign
Of what we're headed for.

We're under a stormy sky,
Watchin' the clouds roll by.
But won't you let me keep you warm,
And leave the storm outside?
It's only a stormy sky.

I feel it.
Do you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feels like we're in for a stormy night,
But I can't see a cloud in sight.

I see it.
Do you see it?
Can't you see it,
See that warning in that stormy sky.
But perhaps its gonna pass us by,
So don't you cry.
There's nowhere we can hide.

But if you hold me tight,
I know that we'll be all right.
Tomorrow we'll laugh about it;
Greet the mornin' light.
It's only a stormy sky.

We're under a stormy sky,
Watchin' the clouds roll by.
But there'll be another dawn
To clear the storm away,
And we will be all right.
