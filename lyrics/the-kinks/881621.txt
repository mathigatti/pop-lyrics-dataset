There is a war going on,
A Spiritual change,
There is a world going wrong,
Don't ya wanna run away and hide,
And it seems so hard.


We're on a psychic battlefield,
Fighting for our souls,
To make us free,
You and me.

Chorus
The world is changing hands,
There will be a bright tomorrow,
The world is in our hands,
We are Spirit,
We are free.

Repeat

There is a world going on,
And it won't go away,
There is a love going on,
That's stronger than all these silly words
I say,
Yes it's true.

Think of the most selfless thing to be,
Send it,
To the whole humanity,
You and me.

Chorus
The world is changing hands,
There will be a bright tomorrow,
The world is in our hands,
We are Spirit,
We are free.

Repeat
