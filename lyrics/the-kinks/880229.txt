When I look so far away
Please don't wake me from my dreams
I'm just wondering who I could be
If I lived inside my dreams


I could be a king or a football star
Drive around in a big sports car
An astronaut or a millionaire
I could do anything or go anywhere

Dream I'm far away
Dream I'm far away

Racing driver or a great politician
A man of power or a man of religion
I could be almost anything
If I could live inside my dreams

Dream I'm far away
Dream I'm far away
Please don't wake me from my dreams
Please don't wake me from my dreams
Please don't wake me from my dreams

When I look so far away
Please don't wake me from my daze
I'm just wondering who I could be
If I lived inside my dreams
