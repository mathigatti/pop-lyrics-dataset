The first time that I saw you, you were modestly waiting for a bus 
Now you're driving around in hired limousines 
And you talk so upper class. 


The cost is high, but it's not the only price you ultimately pay 
Add it up, you might have got some money 
But you lost me on the way 

Add it up, oh 
Add it up, oh 
Add it up, oh 
Add it up, oh 

Ah, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci 
Cartier, Cartier 
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci 

Add it up, 
You multiplied and multiplied but what's it leading to? 
Add it up, 
The only thing subtracted is the love I had for you 
So add it up, oh 
Add it up, oh 
Add it up, oh 
Add it up, oh 

Symbols of perversion and insanity 
Symbols of social immorality 
Symbols of economic cruelty 
Symbolize all what you did to me 

Ah, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci 
Cartier, Cartier 
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci 
Cartier, Cartier 

Money can't cover up the fact you're getting older every day 
And you can't disguise your sad little eyes that give your loneliness away 

Add it up, oh 
Add it up, oh 
Add it up, oh
