Don't ever change
Don't ever change from the way that you are now
If you ever change
I would be sad 'cause I wanted you just as you are


Don't you ever change now
Always be the same now
No, don't ever change from the way that you were
Last night

Don't ever change
What can you prove if you're changing your ways to me?
Please don't ever change
Please don't be blind 'cause I need you can't you see?

Don't you ever change now
Always be the same now
No, don't ever change from the way that you were
Last night

Don't ever change
Don't ever change, I'd be sad
And I would cry
If you leave me
Don't ever leave me

Don't ever change
Don't ever change from the way that you are now
If you ever change
I would be sad 'cause I wanted you just as you are

Don't you ever change now
Always be the same now
No, don't ever change from the way that you were
Last night

Don't ever change
Don't ever change
