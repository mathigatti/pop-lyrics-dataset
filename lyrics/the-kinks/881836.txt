Well I wonder where my baby is tonight
I wonder where my baby is tonight
I wonder where my baby's gone
Hope she'll do no wrong
Lookin' for my baby, she's not around
I wonder where my baby is tonight


I wonder what on Earth's my baby's doin'
If she's not at home there's trouble brewin'
If she really loves me she'll believe in what I say
Tryin' hard to find out where my baby is tonight
If she's not at home I'd better go

Well I only know I wanna see my baby
Went to call for her but she is gone right out of sight
Looking for my baby
She's not around
I wonder where my baby is tonight

Well I wonder where my baby is tonight
I wonder where my baby is tonight
I wonder where my baby's gone
Hope she'll do no wrong
Lookin' for my baby, she's not around
I wonder where my baby is tonight
I hope that everything's gonna be all right
Well I wonder where my baby is tonight
