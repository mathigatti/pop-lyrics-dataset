You don't have to look at me
You don't have to smile at me
You just have to love me till the sun shines
You don't have to cook for me
You don't have to laugh with me
You just have to love me till the sun shines


Take my money, I don't mind
You can be such a helpless kind
You just have to love me till the sun shines

You don't have to sleep with me
Or rest your head upon my knee
You just have to love me till the sun shines
Baby you can wear my clothes,
Play my records, stay at my home
Long as you just love me till the sun shines

You can take it, I don't mind
Please don't be such a helpless kind
You just have to love me till the sun shines

Baby, baby I don't know what I'm doing
Everything I do it turns to ruin

Baby you can kiss my friends
Baby there's nothing that I'll end[?]
Long as you just love me till the sun shines
You don't have to walk the streets
When there's someone waiting here
Come on, baby, love me till the sun shines

Come on, baby, I don't mind
Two lonely people, the helpless kind
Come on, baby, love me till the sun shines

You don't have to look at me
You don't have to smile at me
You just have to love me till the sun shines
You don't have to cook for me
You don't have to laugh with me
You just have to love me till the sun shines

Take my money, I don't mind
You can be such a helpless kind
You just have to love me till the sun shines
