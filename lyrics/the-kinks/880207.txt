Come on now
Come on, let the music get you movin'
Let 'em see that you're not losin'
See the clock, it's gettin' late now
Get you coat and fix your face


So come on now (baby come on now)
Well come on now
Well it's getting late and we better go
(it's getting late and we better go)

Come on now
Come on now while we still got time
Come on, baby, the sun is shinin'
Put your coat on and stop your whinin'
Oh, baby, oh it's all right

So come on now (baby come on now)
Well come on now
Well it's getting late and we better go
(it's getting late and we better go)

Come on now
Come on now honey and let me see
Just how much you do for me
I'm not waiting all night long
You told me to love you and that's all wrong

So come on now (baby come on now)
Well come on now
Well it's getting late and we better go
(it's getting late and we better go)
