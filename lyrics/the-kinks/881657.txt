One hand on the controller
One hand on the re-wind
You can even watch it all in slow mo'
'Cos you just sit at home all day
Now you got plenty of time


If you want some real live action
And the video's too tame
If you wanna touch some heat
But you don't know how to light that flame
If you want some satisfaction
Instead of studying the freeze frame

I used to have this spot on Main Street
It was bounding, it was hot
It was dark, it was dirty
But dull it was not
The joint was jumping every night
But now it's just a parking lot

This city was cruel
This city was keen
This city was alive
This city was mean

Till the office blocks and parking lots
Came and closed this city down
I could stand outside
The kids hung round
And the neon sign said
Welcome to Sleazy Town
Welcome to Sleazy Town
Sleazy, Sleazy Town

Everybody hung loose
It was cool and easy
People used to meet and have a good time
Down in Sleazy Town, Sleazy Town, Sleazy Town, Sleazy Town

Then the corporations came along
And bought this piece of ground
The leases all went up
And so the buildings all came down
They built the motorways and shopping malls
And they killed off Sleazy Town

This city was cool
This city was keen
This city was alive
This city was till the office blocks and parking lots
Came and closed this city down
I could stand outside, the kids hung round
And the neon sign said
Welcome to Sleazy Town
Welcome to Sleazy Town, Sleazy, Sleazy Town
City Hall killed off that scene
Now Sleazy Town is just a dream
