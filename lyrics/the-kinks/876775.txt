The world's spinning round like a looney balloon
Heading for a collision with Saturn and Mars
And we're narrowly missing the man in the moon,
Spinning out of control crashing into the stars.
Have we all lost our gravity, reason and sanity?
Is this the price that we pay?
Have we now lost our way on this looney balloon?


Drift away, just drift away.
It's so easy to just drift away.
Drift away, just drift away.
Drifting away on this looney balloon.

The air is running out, the computer's gone down.
The mechanic just panicked, he's nowhere to be found.
So automatic control is just spinning us round
No point screaming in space, you just can't hear a sound.
Now the pilot's gone mad, he just jumped overboard
With a lunatic smile on his face
And he laughed as he cut the umbilical chord
Now he's drifting forever in space.

Drift away, just drift away.
It's so easy to just drift away.
Drift away, just drift away
Drifting away on this looney balloon.
We're out of control on this looney balloon
Narrowly missing the planets and stars.
Even optimists say that it's all gloom and doom.
We've got to get somewhere or hit something soon.
First class and economy, we all played the game
For selfish profit and gain.
So together we'll all go insane on this looney balloon.

Drift away, hey, just drift away,
Drifting away on this looney balloon.
Drift away, hey, just drift away.
Drifting away on this looney balloon.
Drift away, hey,
Drift away. Drift away.
