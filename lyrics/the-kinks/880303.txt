It's too late now for you to say your sorry
It's too late now for you to make amends
You're gonna pay for all the lies you told me
Well don't apologize 'cause it's too late


It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late now for you to sympathize, dear
The wheel of time is grinding 'gainst your dreams
I really wouldn't want to cause no pain now
You said those words, you said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late
