Chorus: Telepathy
For you and me,
We can be
A unity.


It threads right through the airways,
On a long magnetic tube,
Then joins into your brainwaves,
Sees everything you do,
It is no science or miracle,
There is no place to hide,
Oh, when we have telepathy,
There will be no more lies.

Chorus: Telepathy
For you and me,
We can be
A unity.

Project electric fibres from your mind to the sky,
Direct it to a Martian,
And tell him why you cry,
Or send it to the childrern on earth,
They have no one,
And alter your telepathy into magnetic sun.

Chorus: Telepathy
For you and me,
We can be
A unity.
Mentally,
Telepathy,
We can be
A unity.

Feel my thoughts,
Guide and surround you,
Free your sorrow,
Feed your soul,
Heal tommorow,
No more shadows.

Chorus: Telepathy
For you and me,
We can be
A unity.
Mentally,
Telepathy,
We can be
A unity.
