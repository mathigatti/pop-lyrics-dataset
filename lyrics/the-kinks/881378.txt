So you've decided to set me free
I've paid my debt to society
Fresh out of jail trying to make a new start
On the street with a bitter heart
But my past keeps on haunting me
There ain't no chance for a man with my history


Once a thief
Always a suspect
Once a liar
Never be believed
Will they ever forget that
I was once a thief?

I was out in the cold
I was soaked to the skin
I needed a home
And your heart took me in
Then I heard all the lies
and I lost my belief
You threw away my hope
and you called me a thief

So you've decided to set me free
I'm out of jail but you've still got the key
There was a time when I thought you respected me
But somehow you always suspected me

Once a thief
Always a suspect
Once a liar
Never be believed
Will they ever forget that
I was once a thief?

Instead of offering me charity,
You should've tried to put some faith in me
Instead of making me a better man,
You kept reminding me of what I am

Instead of offering me charity,
You should've tried to put some faith in me
How many years must a criminal pay?
Until he's old and his hair turns to gray
You smile at me
But I know underneath
You're thinking
Once a thief always a suspect.

Once a thief
Always a suspect
Once a liar
Never be believed
Will they ever forget that
I was once a thief?
