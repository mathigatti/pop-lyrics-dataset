Charity, all the world really needs is charity
We're living in a dream


I'll plead with you all till it tears me apart.
Is this all that we want?
Is this all that we really are?

Turn away if you want, turn away if you like,
For the rest of your life, every day every night,
In your house and your car, yes I know who you are.
Can you not hear the world in its pain trying to call to you?

Oh, oh, charity, we're living in a dream.
Charity, can't fool me with your vanity.
I've seen what's in your heart.

I'll plead with you all till it tears me apart.
Is this all that we want?
Is this all that we really are?

Will our hearts ever change, does it sound so strange?
When people touch[?] children cry, can you not wonder why?
In your own little world, can you not say a word?
Try to help someone else on this earth besides yourself.

Oh, oh, charity, we're living in a dream.
Charity, can't fool me with your vanity.
I've seen what's in your heart.

Charity, all the world really needs is charity.
Is this all that we want?
Is this all we really are?
