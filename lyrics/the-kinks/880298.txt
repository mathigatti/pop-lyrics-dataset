Chorus: Is this the only way,
For the wheel keeps turning,
Is there no other way,
Ooh, heart is yearning.


There is hope in your eyes,
And all the people say,
You're a star,
And you're playing the part,
But how long do you think it will last,
I know you, you're not so innocent,
No way out,
Well not by your intellect,
Who are you,
With no time to resurrect,
Who are you,
You say you're the president.

I can't wait any longer,
Ooh, my love's getting stronger,
Ooh,
Why do we need you so,
Is there no other way,
To lead our children home,
There is a light that shines on you,
You're in a hole and I'm in it too.

Chorus: Is this the only way,
For the wheel keeps turning,
Is there no other way,
Ooh, heart is yearning.

All your world's a disguise,
For big business deals, oil bribes,
Clever men, but where are the wise,
Cause in reality, freedom lies,
Who are you, smug in your intellect,
Dishing out old fashioned politics,
Money, war, solves everything it seems,
Nothin' new, same as it's ever been.

I can't wait any longer,
Ooh, my love's getting stronger,
Ooh,
Why do we need you so,
Is there no other way,
To lead our children home,
There is a light that shines on you,
You're in a hole and I'm in it too.

Oh, we can't let it go.

Is this the only way.
