You stay at home,
All on your own with nothing but walls to talk to.
You never go anywhere,
You say you've nothing to wear,
So you keep all your troubles inside of you.
There's something hidden in you,
And you keep it out of view.
You shouldn't feel any guilt,
Or have any doubts,
You gotta let yourself out whilst there's something left of you


Hey baby blue,
Don't hide your troubles inside.
I'd sure like to knoe you,
And there's so much to show you on the outside.
Somehow I know that we are goona get by,
So stop acting like a ladfy come and cry like a baby on the outside
Outside
I know that the weather is fine,
Outside
I know we're gonna be alright.
Somehow I know that we are goonna survive.
So stop acting like a lady come and cry like a baby on the outside
On the outside


You think you're a freak,
And you're afraid to compete,
In a world that you thinks got it down on you,
You're a closet queen,
You think it's obscene,
To let the people see what's deep inside of you.
I know what you're going through,
But what you are is nothing new,
So don't feel ashamed
'Cos you're not to blame,
Role up the blinds and let the sun come shining through.

Hey baby blue
Don't hide your troubles inside,
You should be glad in the gay,
Nobody cares anyway on the outside.
Somehow I know that we are gonna get by,
So stop acting like a lady come and cry like a baby on the outside.
Outside
I know that the weather is fine
Outside
I know it's gonna be alright.
Somehow I know that we are gonna get by,
So stop acting like a lady come and cry like baby on the outside.
On the outside
On the outside
