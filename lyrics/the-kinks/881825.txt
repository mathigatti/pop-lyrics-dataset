When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.


In a part of this once-great city
Stands a child crying out in pity.
Gone is hope in the heart of each hungry hour.

Every year in this land of plenty
There are millions of starving children
What will I say if they look my way?
This is an emergency.

When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.

Bow your heads to the lost generation
Scars so deep, bringing God's damnation.
Businessmen sip wine while congress argue.

But for grace we enjoy our pleasures
What we face will be our salvation
Go build your towns, but remember time will not forget
That this is an emergency.

When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.

Think of what the wise men said.

When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.
