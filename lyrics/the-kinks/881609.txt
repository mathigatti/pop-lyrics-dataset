Boys like you were born to waste
You never listen to a word I say
And if you think you're here to mess around
You're making a big mistake
'Cos you're gonna find out the hard way
You gonna find out the hard way


No matter what I do or say
You're much too dumb to educate
One day life's going to turn around and slap you in the face
Then you're gonna find out the hard way
You'll take the hard way
Gonna take the hard way

Well, you'll do it your way and I'll do it my way
And we'll see who's the one to survive
You'll find that with no foundation
Or qualifications
There's no way that you can get by
No, there's no way you can get by

Why don't you take the easy way?
Why don't you co-operate?
Don't just sit there and vegetate
Do you want to end up illiterate?
You think that life's a vacation
And you've no inclination
To dust away the cobwebs of your mind
Now it's time for confrontation
And I'm tired of being patient
So I've got to be cruel to be kind
Yeah, I've got to be cruel to be kind

I'm wasting my vocation teaching you to write neat
When you're only fit to sweep the streets
Your intellect is such
That it requires a killer's touch

So I'm going to play it your way
We'll take the hard way
Going to take the hard way
You can take the hard way
Gonna take the hard way
Gonna take the hard way
