I mustn't stay in this job too long
I gotta get out before the hold is too strong
Gotta get out before my ambition is gone
'Cos it's breaking me up and bringing me down.


But when I get home you make it all worthwhile,
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day sorting out the files
You make it all worthwhile.

Wife:
Oh, I've just remembered we've only got shepherd's pie,
Do you like it?

Star:
No, I hate it.

Wife:
Hate it? But you see Norman loves it so much and you did ask me to
act normally, didn't you. I mean I can't cope with all that
fancy stuff you like to eat.

Star:
Alright, I'll eat it and afterwards, I'll write a whole verse about
your cooking.

You mustn't blame yourself like you do,
It's gonna make a nervous wreck out of you,
So wipe your nose and dry your eyes,
What's the point of cracking up all because of shepherd's pie?

Baby, you never know what I've been through.
I break my back and sweat and slave
To bring some money home to you.
Baby, you won't believe it but it's true
What a boring occupation can do,
It can make a nervous wreck out of you,
It can kill your spirit and destroy your mind.

But when I get home you make it all worthwhile.
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day sorting out the files
You make it all worthwhile.

Wife:
Would you like steam pudding and custard for afters.

Star:
Darling, that would be marvellous.

And when I come home you make it all worthwhile.
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day working on the files
You make it all worthwhile

Star:
Come on darling, let's go and have dinner.

And when I come home you make it all worthwhile.
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day working on the files
You make it all worthwhile.
