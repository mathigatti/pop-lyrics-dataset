The local factory's been pulled down
By an overseas corporation
Now all of my brothers are looking around
For alternative occupation


I was sitting by the telly with my brother, Kenny
When suddenly the penny dropped
While all of my brothers are sitting at home
I've got a bank loan and I've opened up my very own
Video shop
Video shop

At the video shop
I can fly, fly you away

Comedy and tragedy are all sitting on my shelf
And if you've got a fantasy
For a small rental fee
You can set yourself free
At my video shop
At my video shop
At the video shop

I can fly, fly you away
At the video shop
Let me fly, fly you away
From all of the depression in you head
Caused by all the living in the red

I've got a bootleg version of Citizen Kane
A second hand copy of Psycho
I've taped them off the telly so you shouldn't complain
And there's no guarantee you'll get your money back again
From my video shop
My video shop

If you want to escape, I can rent you a tape
To relieve your situation
If you feel a bit low, I got a good peep show
'Cos everybody knows almost anything goes
At my video shop
At my video shop

One fifty a day and I'll fly, fly you away
It's nothing to pay to fly far, far away
I can help you through that lonely night
I've got Technicolour, black and white
I can guide you through those empty days
Make you smile and take your blues away

O let me fly you away
At my video shop
Fly, fly you away

Another factory's been knocked down
But nobody ever complains
And all of my brothers are customers now
We all play video games
I can see it in the eyes of all the lonely wives
If they're bored and they feel like a change
I do sales, rentals, even a swop
And if you feel like a change, well it can all be arranged
At my video shop
At my video shop
At my video shop

At my video shop
Let me fly, fly you away

And everyone who walks in through that door
Has got something that they're looking for
At my video shop
At my video shop
At the video shop
I can fly, fly you away

At the video shop
Let me fly, fly you away
Oh, at the video shop

Oh, at the video shop
Oh, at the video shop
