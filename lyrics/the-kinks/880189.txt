Beautiful Delilah, sweet as apple pie 
Always gets a second look from fellas passing by 
Every time you see her, she's with a different guy 
Beautiful Delilah, that's the reason why 


Rebecca don't allow me fool around with you 
You are so tantalizing, you just can't be true 

Beautiful Delilah, dressed in the latest styles 
Swinging like a pendulum, walking down the aisle 
Sees so many guys, speaks so low and mild 
One day she will marry, settle down, after a while 

Rebecca don't allow me, fool around with you 
You are so tantalizing, you just can't be true 

Beautiful Delilah, bathing in the sun 
Audience of 17, and noticed not a one 
Local Casanova who wouldn't be outdone 
Let her steal his heart away, she break it just for fun 

Rebecca don't allow me, fool around with you 
You are so tantalizing, you just can't be true
