There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.
I'm thinking all the time,
There's too much on my mind,
It seems there's more to life than just to live it.


There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

My thought just weigh me down,
And drag me to the ground,
And shake my head till there's no more life in me.
It's ruining my brain,
I'll never be the same,
My poor demented mind is slowly going.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

There's too much on my mind.
