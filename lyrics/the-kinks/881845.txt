I've been travelling on this road
I get the feeling its getting on
I keep moving on
I keep rolling on
But does anybody know my name


Travelling oh so long
I get the feeling thats something's wrong
I keep rolling on
I keep rolling on
But does anybody know my name.

How could you believe when you don't know my name

repeat

I see life is such a simple game
I sit and watch it from my moving train
A bumpy ride to-day
I'm not alone this way
Does anybody know my name.

Arrested in '69
For upsetting a tourist guide
Well pay the fine or jail
I just smiled and said
That I'm oh so glad to be alive.

How could you believe when you don't know my name

repeat

How could you believe when you don't understand.
