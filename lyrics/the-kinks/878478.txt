It was a matter of fact that when I paid all my tax
I held my world in the palm of my hand
And all of my debts were causing me to defect
To a land of bananas and sand
So I ran, yes I ran, yes I ran to a foreign land
Here I am, here I am
Here I am in a foreign land


I'm so glad we made it
I thought we'd never land
I grabbed all my cash
And I decided to dash far away
Far away, far away in a foreign land
Here I am, here I am, here I am in a foreign land

Goodbye to all of the rich men's daughters
Goodbye to my debts now I'm way across the water
Far away, far away in a foreign land
Here I am, here I am, here I am in a foreign land

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Please tell my mother and all my ex-lovers
That I've finally made the grade

Please tell my debtors and the money collectors
That all of my bills will be paid some day
I'm away, I'm away in a foreign land

Goodbye champagne and the caviar set
I wanna slum and drink all of the rum I can get
I'm away, I'm away in a foreign land
Here I am, here I am, here I am in a foreign land
But I'm all out of my jack and I can't go back
I'm away, far away, far away in a foreign land

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
