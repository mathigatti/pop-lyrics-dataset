A hopeful adventure
Got missionary ways
Could start in the jungle
Feel this way
Search for an answer
Over land and over sea
All the mountains
Of promised opportunities


I cried out but you were lost
In a corporate position
So money's the solution
Curing all that ails the nation
But what about the hearts of man
The spiritual needs
I'm staring at the starlight
And I just can't quite believe
That I'm

Chorus:
Lost in the fire
So close to the wire
Got to survive
So close to the wire

The soul needs attention
Like the body needs to breath
But banks want investment
So who are we
Cultures are dying
But gold reserves are safe
Can't live in this jungle
But can't escape

Whatever happened
To the dreams we shared together
A taste of wine
A moonlight song that lasts forever

Chorus

Feel the expectation
Written in the ways
Each move of a man give away

You look good to me
Sat in your ministry position
An image for the masses
Making serious decisions
Talk about, sham about
For all the world to see
Your rhetoric's a quiz game
And a mystery to me

Chorus

So close to the wire
