Here's wishing you the bluest sky, 
And hoping something better comes tomorrow. 
Hoping all the verses rhyme, 
And the very best of choruses to 
Follow all the doubt and sadness. 
I know that better things are on the way. 


Here's hoping all the days ahead 
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you. 
Be an optimist instead, 
And somehow happiness will find you. 
Forget what happened yesterday, 
I know that better things are on the way. 

It's really good to see you rocking out 
And having fun, 
Living like you just begun. 
Accept your life and what it brings. 
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things. 
I know tomorrow you'll find better things. 

Here's wishing you the bluest sky, 
And hoping something better comes tomorrow. 
Hoping all the verses rhyme, 
And the very best of choruses to 
Follow all the drudge and sadness. 
I know that better things are on the way. 

I know you've got a lot of good things happening up ahead. 
The past is gone it's all been said. 
So here's to what the future brings, 
I know tomorrow you'll find better things. 
I know tomorrow you'll find better things.
