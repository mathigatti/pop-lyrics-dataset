On reflection, it was not all wine on the wall 
It was not all cuts and bruises 
Or the pulling out of hair 
And the bloodying of nose 
And the tearing off of clothes, although 


It was really animal, truly animal 
There were times when there was absolute compassion in the air 
Though it was really animal, truly animal 

It could not compare to times we cared 
And were in control and less emotional 

While the intellect controls the spiritual 
The animal respects what's natural 
Ying and yang control man's actions 
And both extremes are a natural reaction 

It was really animal, truly animal, 
Well there were times when there was absolute compassion in the air 

On reflection it was not all crash and bang 
Broken bottles and abuse 
Sometimes there were sunsets on the sands 
Holding onto caring hands 
But there were vampire fangs 
As the angels sang 
It was ying and yang, oh yeah 

It was truly natural, though it was really animal 
In a sense it fell into a truly natural romance 

Oh yeah, 
It was really animal, truly animal 
There were times when there was absolute compassion in the air 

True love, true love, true love is really animal
