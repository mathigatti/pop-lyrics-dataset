Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the is right
For dancing in the street


They'll be dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
In New York City
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be records playing,
Dancin' and swayin'
Dancing in the street

Well, doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So every guy grab a girl
Every night around the world

There'll be dancing in the street
This is an invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughin' and singin'
And music swingin'
Dancing in the street

Philadelphia, PA
Baltimore and DC. now
Can't forget the motor city
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be dancin' and swayin'
Records playing,
Dancing in the street

Well now, doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So every guy grab a girl
Every night around the world

There'll be dancing in the street
This is the [?] across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughin' and singin'
And music swingin'
Dancing in the street
