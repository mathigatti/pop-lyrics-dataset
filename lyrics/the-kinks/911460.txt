We are men of destiny, our fates amalgamated in one 
Comrades against adversity, heading for the setting sun 
But all about us there are doubters who'll cheer us when the battle is won 
They said it could never be, said that it could never be done 


We're against the tide, with the wind in our face 
With the Great Divide and a goal to chase 
And if I don't survive, will you stay on the case 
And will you testify in my place? 
So bring on the storm 
And bring on the rain 
When we're against the tide 
That's the time when we're on the top of our game 

We are men of destiny, our fates amalgamated in one 
Comrades against adversity, heading for the setting sun 
But when the cruel winds blow, we'll be in the race 
When your spirits are low, we'll put a smile on your face 
When the going's slow, we're gonna pick up the pace 
But with dignity and with grace 
La la la la la la, la la la la la la 
La la la la la la, la la la la la la 

We're gonna weather the storm (we're gonna weather the storm) 
So bring on the rain (so bring on the rain) 
Weather the storm (weather the storm) 
We're gonna shrug off the rain (we're gonna shrug off the rain) 
When we're against the tide 
That's the time when we're on top of our game 

When we're against the tide, that's when we'll do our best 
And they'll be all surprised when we stand the test 
With a ticket to ride and a mutual quest 
Together we'll stand the test 
So bring on the storm (bring on the storm) 
The thunder and rain (the thunder and rain) 
Bring on the storm (bring on the storm) 
Bring on the rain (bring on the rain) 
When we're against the tide 
That's the time when we're on top of our game
