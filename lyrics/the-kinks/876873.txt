Under a lamp light
Monica stands at midnight,
And every guy think he can buy her love,
But money can't buy sweet lovin' from Monica.


Morning to moonshine,
Monica knows every line.
Don't ever propose 'cause Monica knows, you know.
She'll turn up her nose and say what a fool you are.

I, I shall die,
I, I shall die if I should lose Monica.
(Oh Monica my love.)
People can try,
People can try, but they can't buy Monica, my love.

You take the sunshine,
I'll take the nightly shadows.
'Cause everyone knows that Monica glows at night.
She'll do something wrong and prove to you she is right.

I, I shall die,
I, I shall die if I should lose Monica.
(Oh Monica my love.)
People may try,
People may try, but they can't buy Monica, my love.

Morning to moonshine,
Monica knows every line.
Don't ever propose 'cause Monica knows, you know.
She'll turn up her nose and say what a fool you are.
Monica.
