You go down the pub 
You wear make up 
And old dads trousers 
Why don't you tidy up 
You talk like a docker but you act like a queer 
You drink champagne then complain it's too dear 
You try so hard not to follow any trends 
Then you cry in your beer and say you've got no friends 
But is it any wonder that you've got no friends 
But it's not the make up 
Or the way you dress 
It's not your appearance, that they all detest 
It's not your manners, that you gotta improve 
ooooo--it's your attitude. 


Chorus 
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo 
Your attitude 
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo 
Your attitude 

Take off your head phones 
Hear what's going on 
You can't live in a time zone 
You've gotta move on 
But before you get there 
There's one thing you've gotta do 
Oh change your attitude 
It's your attitude 
It's your attitude 

Chorus 
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo 
Your attitude 
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo 
Your attitude 

The '80s are here, I know cuz I'm staring right at them 
But you're still waiting for 1960 to happen 

You might have the illness, but you've got the cure 
You've got the answer, you will endure 
You're the only person that's gonna pull you through 
Ooh, with your attitude 

Chorus 
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo 
Your attitude 
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo 
Your attitude 

You gotta learn to be positive, it's your only chance 
You mustn't be so defensive, you gotta join in the dance 
But it isn't your dancing that you've gotta improve 
Ooh, it's your attitude. 

Chorus 
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo 
Your attitude 
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo 
Your attitude 

It's all the music 
It's all in your brain 
You've used all the old licks 
Now it's all gotta change. 
Change your attitude 
It's your attitude 
Attitude
