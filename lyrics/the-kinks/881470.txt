Remember how we used to laugh away
those hours
We would spend.
We thought they'd last forever.
Oh,
Though I must go,
I know the pain I leave,
But oh,
These things will change,
'Cause nothing last forever.
For now at last,
I see all life as one,
All children are my own,
I'll never be alone.
Please don't cry,
For there's a brighter sun,
That allows us to be free,
Allows us to be bound


Chorus
Run,
Run,
Find a place of my own,
Yeah,
Somewhere where I can grow.
Got to run, run,
Find a place of my own,
Somewhere where I belong,
Yeah.
Somewhere where I can grow.

If there was a way to tell you,
Exactly how I feel,
All I can say,
That in my heart you'll always be.

Chorus
Yeah,
I've got to run,
Run,
Find a place of my own.
Yeah,
Somewhere where I can grow.
Run,
Run,
Run,
Run.
Find a place of my own.
Yeah,
Somewhere where I belong.
Yeah,
Somewhere I can grow.
