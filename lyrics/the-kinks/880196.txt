How much longer must we linger on,
In this wonderland,
In this unreal,
And this is not our home what we are doing here,
We are pure my love, we are energy,
Things never change but we must move on,
Through the galaxy,
It is true my love.


Distraction,
Everywhere,
Programmed people,
Study the genetic tapes.

Chorus: Who's in that body,
Who's in that jail,
Who's in there with you,
Can we get bail,
You're not your body,
Though you treat it like gold,
No you cannot deny it,
Oh, we'll never get home,
Who's in that body,
A slave within time,
Who's in that body.

We are slaves of time and stranded here,
In this sad, sad world,
In this tragedy,
This is the strangest place I've ever been,
Is it real my love,
Or is it fantasy,
We cannot hide here forever,
For we are pure my love,
For we are energy,
Decipher, magnetic code, DNA,
Computer bank, 4, 1, 8.

Chorus: Who's in that body,
Who's in that jail,
Who's in there with you,
Can we get bail,
You're not your body,
Though you treat it like gold,
No you cannot deny it,
Oh, we'll never get home,
Who's in that body,
Trapped within time,
You're in that body,
Trapped within time.
