You gotta listen to me
Every little thing I wanna say to you
All the little things that I've gotta do
If you listen to me
You gotta listen to me and do things my way
And listen to what I've got to say


You know you gotta listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me

You gotta listen to me
I'm gonna take, gonna take care of you
Dedicate my life for you
If you listen to me
You gotta listen to me and do things my way
And listen to what I've got to say

You know you gotta listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me

You gotta listen to me
Gonna let, gonna let the whole world know
Never gonna let you
You gotta listen to me
You gotta listen to me and do things my way
And listen to what I've got to say

You know you gotta listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
