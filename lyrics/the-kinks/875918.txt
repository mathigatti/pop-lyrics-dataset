You don't need no fancy clothes 
Where'd you get them, goodness knows? 
Just show some civility. 
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me. 


I don't need no luxuries, 
As long as you are understanding, 
I'm not difficult to please. 
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me. 

Well I'm the kind of guy who likes 
To take you as I find you 
So throw away those false eyelashes and, 
Act nice, act nice, baby. 

Come on baby, hold my hand. 
Come on baby, understand, you gotta 
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me. 
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me. 

Come on baby, hold my hand. 
Come on baby, understand, you gotta 
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me. 
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me.
