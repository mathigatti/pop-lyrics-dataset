All I see is imitation
And there's no earth beneath my feet.
There are no trees or fields in front of me
Only slabs of concrete.
Skyscrapers reaching up to the clouds,
Don't give the moon a chance to shine,
And I've got imitation moonlight
Standing underneath the neon sign.


Is it real or just illusion?
Can there be day-time when it's night?
Is it merely my delusion
Or are my senses telling me lies.
Is it just hallucination?
Have I been drinking too much wine?
I don't know if it's day or night,
When I'm underneath the neon sign.
Underneath the neon sign.

Electronic nature made by man with robots in mind.
Big city lights guide my way into the night, darkness shines
When I'm standing underneath the neon sign.

If there isn't any sunshine
We'll sunbathe by the neon sign
And if we can't see any stars at night
We'll sit and watch the traffic lights.
If there isn't any day-time
I've got an imitation dawn,
I've got a simulated sunshine
Standing underneath the neon sign.

Is it only an illusion?
Have I been drinking too much wine?
Can there be day-time when it's night
Underneath the neon sign.
Underneath the neon sign.
Is it mother nature
Playing tricks with my eyes
For darkness shines
When I'm standing underneath the neon sign.
