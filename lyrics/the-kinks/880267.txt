Here comes yet another day, creeping through my window.
Drank myself to sleep last night, beer stains on my pillow.
I gotta pull my things together,
The night can last forever.


Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.
Can't stop, can't be late, mustn't make the people wait.
Can't even comb my hair or even change my underwear,
Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day,
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.

There goes another night, here comes another flight,
Can't stop gotta go, here comes yet another show.
Gotta pack up my clothes, brush my teeth, blow my nose.

No time to use the John, gotta keep a rollin' on.
Here comes a new day, here comes a new stage,
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.

Made a lot of conversation, talked a lot of weather,
I hope we meet again some day, and spend some time together.
No time for affection,
I'm moving in a new direction.

Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day,
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.
Can't stop, can't be late, mustn't make the people wait.
Can't stop to comb my hair or even change my underwear.
See that morning break, oh Lord, here comes yet another day,

Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.
