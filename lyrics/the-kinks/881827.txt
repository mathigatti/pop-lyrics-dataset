We are born to this fantasy
Can't believe what they've done to you
Hard to see all these years go round
Taught to hide all that's true inside


What was it like
When you were a child?
Did you see the world
In a different light?
When the veil came down
Our destiny grew away from us
Don't it make you weep
Can't you see

I believe that we were meant for each other
We'll get along somehow
If they leave us alone
Why don't they let us be
...Just what we want to be
Don't it make you weep, can't you see?

I can't believe what they've done to you
They've got you just where they wanted you

When we sleep, dream each other's dreams
Casting memories on a sea of hope
Remember life as a child could be
Bring it back for all of us to see

What was it like
When you were a child?
How did it feel?
Did your mother treat you kind?
Mend those broken toys?

For in your heart there's innocence
Waiting to be free, can't you see?

When you were a child
