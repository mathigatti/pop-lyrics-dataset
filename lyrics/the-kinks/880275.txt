It's been a while, I haven't seen you for at least
A year or more, or is it less? I can't be sure
Well, anyway, you must have heard about the
Troubles that I had, but somehow I got through
I always managed to... and by the way
How are you?
How is your life?
How is it going?
Are you still dreaming and making big plans?
How are the nights are they still lonely?
Are you still struggling the way that I am? Oh
How, how are you? How are you?


You always said that you would try to change
Turn a new leaf and start all over again
But I bet you're making all the same mistakes
You're a lot like me, that's why I'm still your friend
Still no offence, no more hard feelings left on silly sentiment
No harm was ever felt or ever meant
You go your way, I'm bound to see you on the street again some day
And when I do I'll always say
How are you? How are you?

How is your life? How is it going?
Are you still dreaming and making big plans?
How are the nights? Are they still lonely?
Are you still struggling the way that I am? Oh
How, how are you? How are you?

I know you're making all the same mistakes
You're a lot like me that's why I'm still your friend
I bet go, I gotta thousand little things I better do
Ah, but it was really good to talk to you
Be on my way, I'm bound to see you on the street again someday
And when I do I'll say
How are you? How are you?

How is your life? How is it going?
Are you still dreaming and making big plans?
How are the nights? Are they still lonely?
Are you still struggling the way that I am? Oh
How, how are you? How are you?
