Time lives our lives with us
Walk side by side with us
Time is so far from us
But time is among us


Time is ahead of us
Above and below us
Standing beside us
And looking down on us

When we were young
And our bodies were strong
We thought we'd sail
Into the sunsets

When our time came along
Now that we're nearing
The end of the line
Time has changed

Time would heal
Time will mend and conseil
In the end everything will be fine
And if we concentrate

Time will heal all the hate
All in good time
We go on
Drifting on

Dreaming dreams
Telling lies
Generally wasting our time
Suddenly it's too late

Time has come and can't wait
There's no more time
We go on
Drifting on

Dreaming dreams
Telling lies
Generally wasting our time
Suddenly it's too late

Time has come and can't wait
There's no more time
