I'm not content to be with you in the daytime
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night


I believe that you and me last forever
Oh, yeah, all day and nighttime yours, leave me never
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
Oh, come on

I believe that you and me last forever
Oh, yeah, all day and nighttime yours, leave me never
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night-time
All day and all of the night
