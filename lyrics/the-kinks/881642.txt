As I walked home the other night,
I looked up to the sky.
It hit me like a light in the head
He showed me of the world
In a different way.
Oh, I'll never be the same.


[This is space-sector calling] Are you talking to me?
[We have a message for you] I could not help but listen.
[Children of earth must all become] One family.
[Your leaders will not listen] But what can I do?
[People will listen to you] I'm just a poor fool,
[Reach out and help us and] Make them understand.

A place for everyone,
In their sacred plan.
Living in all lands.
I'll never turn away,
Now my life has changed,
I'll never be the same.
