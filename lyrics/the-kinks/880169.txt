You're just an animal in the zoo 
Sittin' round feeling persecuted and abused 
You're locked up and I'm on the loose 
But I can't quite tell who's looking at who 
'Cause I'm an animal, too 
But you're locked up in a zoo 
And you look at me and I look at you 


God made the heaven and the deep blue sea 
But man picked the flowers and he pulled up the trees 
God mad the moon and the rain and the sun 
But man made the money and the bombs and the guns 
So we're all animals, too 
But you're locked up in a zoo 
And you look at me and I look at you 

I'm a prisoner but I got no cage 
I'm locked up but I got no chain 
But the good guys lose and the bad guys win 
That's why you're looking out and I'm looking in 
But we're all animals, too 
But you're locked up in a zoo 
'Cause you look at me and I look at you
