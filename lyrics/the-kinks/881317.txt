Have you heard about trouble throughout the land
With the fascists and the left wing militants
Out of work executives are killing themselves
And the I.R.A. are killing everybody else
Don't panic, don't lose control
Keep your head, keep a hold
Act normal, there's nothing wrong
Stay cool, just carry on


You gotta live life and be yourself
You can't live life for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Don't get depressed when you read in the press
About world revolution and social unrest
Try not to panic when you switch on the news
And see the crooked politicians and the unemployment queues
It's only life, it's really fine
So don't you believe all you read in the headlines
Live life, see it through
Carry on, it's all you can do

You gotta live life for yourself
You can't live for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Trendy intellectuals always take action,
For every cause that's ever been in fashion
Weekend revolutionaries protest and sing
Because they're dedicated followers of any old thing
They got every solution for every revolution
They live in the slums just like the poor people do
But they'd rather sniff coke instead of glue
Right-wing fascists beat up the blacks
Then they salute the Union Jack
You can't pretend there's nothing wrong
It's not the end, so just carry on

You gotta live life for yourself
You can't live for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother
Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother

You gotta live life for yourself
Can't live life for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you can do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Live life, you gotta live life
You gotta live life, you gotta live life
