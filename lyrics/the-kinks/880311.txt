I'm King Kong and I'm ten feet long,
Got a big six gun and everybody is scared.
I'm King Kong, got a hydrogen bomb,
I can blow up your houses so you better beware.


Everybody wants power,
Everybody wants fame.
Everybody wants money.
La-la-la-la-la, King Kong.
La-la-la-la-la,
Little man's weak and big man's strong,
Everyone wants to be King Kong, oh yeah.

I'm King Kong, I got so much money,
I can buy anybody who gets in my path.
I'm King Kong, and I'm big and strong,
I can blow up your houses so you better beware.

Everybody wants power,
Everybody wants fame.
Everybody wants money.
La-la-la-la-la, King Kong.
La-la-la-la-la,
Little man's weak and big man's strong,
Everyone wants to be King Kong, oh yeah.
