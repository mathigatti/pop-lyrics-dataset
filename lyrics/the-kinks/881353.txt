Life is only a moving picture
Nothing in life is a permanent fixture
Oh no oh oh no


Black girls, white girls oh what a mixture
Looking as pretty as a picture
Oh no oh oh no

We live, we die no one knows why
We come, we go we see the show
And it's always moving, always moving
Life is only a moving picture

Oh, life can sometimes not be very nice
But then you make your choice so you must pay the price
You take the good and bad 'cos life's all work and play
And it soon fades away
Oh no oh oh no

Life is only what you make out
So make the verses rhyme and all the pieces fit
There isn't any time to make much sense of it
It soon fades away
Oh no oh oh no

Life is only a moving picture
Nothing in life is a permanent fixture
Oh no oh oh no

We live, we die no one knows why
We come, we go we see the show
And it's always moving, always moving
Look at all those moving pictures
Nothing in life is a permanent fixture
Oh no oh oh no

It's only moving, only moving, only moving pictures
