When I look up from my pillow I dream you are there with me.
Though you are far away I know you'll always be near to me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.


I look around me and feel you are ever so close to me.
Each tear that flows from my eyes brings back memories of you to me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.

I was wrong, I will cry, I will love you to the day I die.
You alone, you alone and no one else, you were meant for me.

When morning comes once more I have the loneliness you left me.
Each day drags by until finally night time descends on me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.
