Let me take you on a little trip
My supersonic ship's at your disposal
If you feel so inclined, well, alright
We're gonna travel faster than light
So do up your overcoat tight
And you'll go anywhere you want to decide, well, alright
Too many people side by side
Got no place to hide


On my supersonic rocket ship
Nobody has to be hip
Nobody needs to be out of sight, out of sight
Nobody's gonna travel second class
There'll be equality
And no suppression of minorities, well, alright
We'll take this planet, shake it round
And turn it upside down
My supersonic rocket ship

It ain't no magic, ain't no lie
You'll laugh so loud you'll cry
Up and down, round and round
On my supersonic rocket ship

Let me take you on a little trip
My supersonic ship's at your disposal
If you feel so inclined, well, alright
Nobody's gonna travel second class
There'll be equality
And no suppression of minorities, well, alright
Let me take you on a little trip
On my supersonic rocket ship
