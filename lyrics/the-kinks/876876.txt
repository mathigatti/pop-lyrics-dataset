Picture yourself when you're getting old
Sat by the fireside a-pondering on
Picture book, pictures of your mama, taken by your papa a long time ago
Picture book, of people with each other, to prove they love each other a long time ago
Na, na, na, na, na na
Na, na, na, na, na na
Picture book
Picture book


A picture of you in your birthday suit
You sat in the sun on a hot afternoon
Picture book, your mama and your papa, and fat old uncle charlie out cruising with their friends
Picture book, a holiday in august, outside a bed and breakfast in sunny southend
Picture book, when you were just a baby, those days when you were happy, a long time ago
Na, na, na, na, na na
Na, na, na, na, na na
Picture book

Na, na, na, na na
Na, na, na, na na
A-scooby-dooby-doo
Picture book
Na, na, na, na na
Na, na, na, na na
A-scooby-dooby-doo

Picture book, pictures of your mama, taken by your papa a long time ago
Long time ago

Long time ago
Long time ago
Yeah, yeah, yeah
