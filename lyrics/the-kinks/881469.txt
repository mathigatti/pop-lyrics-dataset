Rosemary Rose,
Nature sure gave you such a beautiful nose.
'Though you're not beautiful as someone would know,
That Rosemary Rose,


Has eyes of blue,
And someone is treasuring a picture of you,
Taken on a holiday when you were just three,
My sweet Rosemary.

You look nothing like a child,
Yet you're such a little baby.
Chewing on your liquorish gum, and cigarettes.
Rosemary Rose,

Carefully sewing on your buttons and bows.
Hoping that someone will be wanting to know,
Of Rosemary Rose.
