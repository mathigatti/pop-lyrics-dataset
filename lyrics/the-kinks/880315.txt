Like the last of the good ol' puffer trains
I'm the last of the blood and sweat brigade
And I don't know where I'm going, or why I came
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains


I'm the last of the good old renegades
All my friends are all middle class and grey
But I live in a museum, so I'm okay
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains

Like the last of the good ol' choo-choo trains
Huff and puff 'till I blow this world away
And I'm gonna keep on rollin' till my dying day
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains

Like the last of the good ol' puffer trains
I'm the last of the soot and scum brigade
And all this peaceful living is drivin' me insane
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains
