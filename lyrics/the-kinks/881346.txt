Monday Tuesday Wednesday
Ah, the milkmen came in, and that washing machine
It's drivin' you crazy, to hear the kids scream


Ah, but your life ain't so bad
You feel happy inside, it's a crime
That you're wastin' away each and every precious day
Don't be blind

Every Monday it seems so lazy
It's the time that could drive you crazy

My Monday, My Tuesday, My Wednesday
The paper boy's been, and that news looks so black
There ain't time to read it
'Cause you might get the sack

But your life ain't so bad
You feel happy inside, it's a crime
That you're wastin' away each and every prescious day
Don't be blind

'Cause every Monday it seems so lazy
It's the time that could drive you crazy

La la la, la la la, la la la..........

My Monday, My Tuesday, My Wednesday
Could grab up your money, and run for the gate
You just missed your bus, now you're late for a date

Ah, but your life ain't so bad
You feel happy inside, it's a crime
That you're wastin' away each and every precious day
Don't be blind

'Cause every Monday it seems so lazy
It's the time that could drive you crazy

Monday Tuesday Wednesday Monday Tuesday Wednesday
