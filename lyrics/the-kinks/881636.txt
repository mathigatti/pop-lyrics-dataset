Everybody's working out at the gymnasium,
Pumping iron, getting fit, ready to compete.
Everybody working on their own body heat.
Everybody hustling out on the street.


Julian is out there looking at locations,
Arthur's on the picket line winding up the nation,
Sara Jane's working on her way to a degree,
But back in the gymnasium they're working out and body popping.

It's gotta stop because it's getting too hot.
Cool it down, 'cause it's getting too hot.
It's getting crazy, going over the top.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.

All the kids are working out, they're on their way to fame.
Arthur's on the war path, here he comes again.
The city's like a sauna bath, stinks like a drain.
They're pumping up the nation but it's gonna bust a vein.
Tourists everywhere, blocking up the streets.
My ice cream cone just melted in the heat.
And while I do my best to stop my raspberry from slopping,
Back in the gymnasium they're working out and body popping.

It's gotta stop because it's getting too hot.
Cool it down, 'cause it's getting too hot.
It's getting crazy, going over the top.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.
It's too hot, gotta cool it down.
It's too hot, turn the heating down.
It's too hot, the temperature is up.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.

The city lights start shining at the end of the day,
Taking the place of the big red sun as it slowly sets.
Meanwhile back in commuter city, another kid's packing her bags,
And running away.

To a city that is really too hot,
It's Piccadilly and it's really too hot.
Too hot, too hot, too hot.

Arthur's working out, now he's really got the muscle,
Julian's over budget, now he's really got to hustle,
And Sara Jane's living on bag take-aways,
And working as a stripper on the school holidays.
Sleazy town, gets me down, want some peace and quiet.
The police are everywhere like there's gonna be a riot.
Back in the gymnasium they're training for a war.
Think of all the fun we had in 1984.

It's gotta stop because it's getting too hot.
Cool it down, 'cause it's getting too hot.
It's getting crazy, going over the top.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.
It's too hot, gotta cool it down.
It's too hot, turn the heating down.
It's too hot, the temperature is up.

It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.
(repeat)
