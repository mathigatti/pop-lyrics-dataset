In a world full of jive,
Full of homicide and suicide,
There's no room for love and romance.
In a world full of spite
Full of hatefulness and bitterness,
Sincerity don't stand a chance.
And every night I close my eyes
And ask the stars above,
Oh where, oh where, oh where, oh where is love?


Where is love and romance,
And appreciation of storybooks, fairytales
And the ordinary things people did long ago.
Where did it go?
Where is love?
Where is hope?
Where is sympathy and trust?
Where is faith?
Where is joy in simplicity?
And where is regard and respect?
Oh where, oh where is love?
This world is spinning and turning
And my head is full of learning,
But my thoughts keep on returning
To the things I used to know.
I should be stronger,
But my mind continually wanders
And deep inside
A voice keeps crying
Where, oh where is love?

Where is love and romance,
And appreciation of storybooks, fairytales,
And the ordinary things people did long ago?
Where did it go?
In a world full of jive,
Full of homicide and suicide,
There's no room for love and romance.
In a world full of rape,
Full of hatefulness and bitterness,
Sincerity don't stand a chance.
And every night I close my eyes
And ask the stars above,
Oh where, oh where, oh where, oh where is love?
Where oh where is love?
Where is Love?
Where is hope?
Where is sympathy and trust?
Where is faith?
Where is joy and simplicity
And where is regard and respect?
Oh where, oh where is love?
Oh where oh where is love?
Oh where oh where is love?
