Dandy, Dandy
Where you gonna go now?
Who you gonna run to?
All your little life
You're chasing all the girls
They can't resist your smile
Oh, they long for Dandy, Dandy


Checkin' out the ladies
Tickling their fancy
Pouring out your charm
To meet your own demands
And turn it off at will
Oh, they long for Dandy, Dandy

Knockin' on the back door
Climbing through the window
Hubby's gone away
And while the cat's away
The mice are gonna play
Oh, you low down Dandy, Dandy
Dandy

Dandy, you know you're moving much too fast
And Dandy, you know you can't escape the past
Look around you and see the people settle down
And when you're old and grey you will remember what they said
That two girls are too many, three's a crowd and four you're dead

Oh, Dandy, Dandy
When you gonna give up?
Are you feeling old now?
You always will be free
You need no sympathy
A bachelor you will stay
And, Dandy, you're all right
You're all right
You're all right
You're all right
You're all right
You're all right
