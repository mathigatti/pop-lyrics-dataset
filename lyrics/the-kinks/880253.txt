If a black cat crossed your path, little woman,
Would you walk along with me?
Don't have to worry 'bout a thing, girl,
It's all right, you see.
'Cause I'm a good luck charm,
Honey, don't worry 'bout me.


If you ain't got no money, baby,
That's all right too.
As long as you stick to me,
Some will come to you.
I'm a good luck charm,
Honey, don't you worry 'bout me.
