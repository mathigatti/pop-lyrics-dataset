Old soldiers talk about the battles fought
To build a better world for me and you.
They sacrificed their lives to make a dream come true.
Now they're forgotten men remembered by so few.


But the war is over and the fighting ended many years ago.
The war is over. The battle's won but what is there to show?
Side by side they marched together fighting so their children
Could be free,
To build a better world, a new society
All classes unified to live in harmony

Now the war is over so let's forget and leave the past alone.
The war is over, it's time for all the soldiers to go home.

Rich men, poor men make history,
Fighting for the land of hope and glory
A nation's voice will sing as one,
A battle cry until we've won

The was is over and the patriotic comrades are no more.
The war is over
Now they're going home to live just like before.

Arm in arm we sang our patriotic songs of love and sentiment.
Tears of joy to hide the sorrow,
New tomorrows till we meet again,
With a new world to build we'll say auf weidersein.
What did they do for us?
What did it prove to us?
As we stand beside the silent grave
The unknown soldier can't be saved.

The war is over
The war is over, it's time for all the soldiers to go home.
The war is over.
