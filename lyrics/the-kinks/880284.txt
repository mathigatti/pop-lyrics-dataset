I'll get over, no matter what you do or say.
I'll get over, pretty lady, now you've had your way.


For what it's worth, for what it gives,
Is there a better way for you to live?
In your eyes there is something strange.

Wandering around, a women of the night,
Are you sure that this life is right?
Is it real or are you just afraid?

I'll get over, no matter what you do or say.
Think it over, ooh lady, know you feel this way.

You're shouting loud, it's getting late.
Use your anger to compensate
For all this running's twisted up my sight

But snuggle up, it'll be all right,
Let the world crash, hellbound sight
Use my love to penetrate.

And I'll get over, people when you put me down.
And get over, yeah, I know that you will come around.
All right!

False ideas and your Hollywood expressions
Dragging all of your possessions
And don't listen to the joker 'cause he'll only rob you blind[?].
Oh yeah.

I'll get over, no matter what you do or say.
Think it over, little lady don't you feel that way[?]

I'll get over, no matter what you do to me.
I'll get over

I'll get over.

You bet.
