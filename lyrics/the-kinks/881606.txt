Tell me now so I'll know,
There are so many things that I could do.
If you tell me now that I'd know what to do,
Tell me now so I'll know.


Tell me now so I'll know,
There are so many things for me to say.
Without your love I just couldn't live each day,
Tell me now so I'll know.

People tell me that you'll just drift away,
Oh believe me, I need you more each day.
You are my hope, my everything,
I live just for you.

I love you deeply but I guess it doesn't show,
I ache inside 'cause my lips can't let you know
Oh darling, please tell me the truth,
You know I live just for you.

Tell me now so I'll know,
There are so many things that I could do.
If you tell me now that I'd know what to do,
Tell me now so I'll know.
