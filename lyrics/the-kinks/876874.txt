If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return


Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return
