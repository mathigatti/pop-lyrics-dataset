Time will tell if I will drift eternally,
Through life instead of being someone.
All of my life, you are the one, you're on my mind.
Have a good time, do what you want, but you will find,


Time will tell if I'll survive.
I'd rather be dead than just pretend I'm alive.
Time will tell, it's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.

Time will tell if we will be the same as now,
Or not, if not, then never mind.
All of my life, you are the one, you're on my mind.
Have a good time, do what you want, but you will find,

Time will tell if I'll survive.
I'd rather be dead than just pretend I'm alive.
Time will tell, it's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.

Time will tell if dreams become reality,
For you got me, as long as you want.
All of my life, you are the one, you're on my mind.
Have a good time, do what you want, but you will find,

Time will tell if I'll survive.
I'd rather be dead than just pretend I'm alive.
Time will tell, it's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.
