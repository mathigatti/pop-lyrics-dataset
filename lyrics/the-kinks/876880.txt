The taxman's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everything I've got
All I got's this sunny afternoon
Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mamma trying break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime, in the summertime, in the summertime
My girlfriend's ran off with my car
And gone back to her ma and pa
Tellin' tales of drunkenness and so cruelty
Now I'm sittin' here
Sippin' at my ice-cool beer
Lazin on a sunny afternoon
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well, give me two good reasons why I ougtha stay
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
In summertime
In summertime
In summertime
In summertime
Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mamma trying break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime, in the summertime, in the summertime, in the summertime
