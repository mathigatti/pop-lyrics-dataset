Here's a song for all the little men who get forgotten time and time again
Here's a message for the little guy, don't let this situation pass you by
You're in the middle while the big mouths fight
You get it from the left and the right, ain't it crazy


So get up off your easy chairs, we've got a lot to do out there
Well ain't we?
Good's gone bad, right is wrong, don't know which side I'm on lately

Get up from the down you're in
Come out of your homes and let's see your faces
Get up out of your easy chairs, get up and show 'em that you're there
Get up it's your one salvation
Wise up to the situation

Somebody gotta get up and shout
Somebody gotta give us some clout
You're the ones to make it all work out
It all depends on you

Get up off your arses men
Don't let 'em think you're getting lazy
Get up out of your easy chairs
We gotta lot to do out there, well ain't we
Get up, Get up, Get up,
Get up, Get up, Get up
