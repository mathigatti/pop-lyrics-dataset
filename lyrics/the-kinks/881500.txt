I'll tell you a story to pass on to the end,
as told to me so long ago by my good friend
As we hollowed round the log fire, we laughed the whole night long,
as he told me a tale passed on to him by a wanderin' vagabond
My friend told me the story and I'll pass it on to you
It was handed down this century and he swore that it was true


And in the morning I could see him fade
Was it fact or fiction? Who can say?
(Storyteller) I believe ev'ry word you say
(Storyteller) I bet you told a good tale in your day

He tried to tell the people, but the people wouldn't hear
him spinning yarns and telling tales from yesteryear

Then he smiled and finished his story
He said "Will you pass it on for me?"
(Storyteller) I'll tell that tale for you
(Storyteller) Somehow I'll get your message through

My friend told me the story and I'll pass it on to you
It was handed down this century and I swear that it is true
