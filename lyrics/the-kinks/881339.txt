I've been traveling a long time,
To be just where you are.
In dreams I have seen you,
But you are so very far.


How long must I travel on,
To be just where you are?
How long must I travel on,
To be just where you are?

I was your friend,
I was a fool,
I feel for you, though we're far apart.
I see your face,
Lost without trace,
I see your mind, just an empty space.

Mindless child of motherhood,
You have lost the thing that's good.
Mindless child of motherhood,
You have lost the thing that's good.

I know that it's not fair,
To bear a bastard son,
But why do you hide there,
When we could have shared a love?

How long must I travel on,
To be just where you are?
How long must I travel on,
To be just where you are?

I was your friend,
I was a fool,
I feel for you, though we're far apart.
I see your face,
Lost without trace,
I see your mind, just an empty space.

Mindless child of motherhood,
You have lost the thing that's good.
Mindless child of motherhood,
You have lost the thing that's good.

To me.
