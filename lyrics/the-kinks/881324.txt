Look through any doorway,
Each life will tell it's story.
See the joy and heartbreak,
For all the world to see.


She's on the city streets,
On her face is desolation.
Just a kid from out of town,
In the land of hope and glory.

Look through any doorway,
Each life will tell it's story.
See the joy and heartbreak,
For all the world to see.
Open up your heart.

Open up the highway,
The road will stretch before you,
For there will be a new day,
Where love will show the way.
Only shadows of the world we left behind,
Open up your heart,
Many shadows of the past, so don't look back.

Look at the wars,
A part of greed affects us all
There's a better way, despite what they do or say,
People of the world.

Look through any doorway,
Tell me what you see.
Open up your heartache,
And love will show the way.

Searching for the way,
Through all the doubt and sorrow.
Days turn into years,
But we'll build a new tomorrow.

Look through any doorway,
Each life will bear its treasure.
Open up your heartache,
And love will show the way.

All the shadows of the world we left behind,
Open up your heart.
Many shadows of the past, so don't look back,
Open up your heart.
Open up your heart.
Look through any doorway,
Tell me what you see.
Look through any doorway.
