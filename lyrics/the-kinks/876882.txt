Productivity is getting higher and higher oh, oh, yeh
But profitability is getting tighter and tighter oh, oh, yeh
When you see our face in the market place we gotta clean cut image to keep
(The competition is getting tighter and tighter)
We gotta advertise, we gotta merchandise, ooh, oh, yeh
Flash those teeth
Competition's on the rise
Open those eyes better get computerised
Think visual, think visual, think visual
Think visual, think visual, show your personality
Marketing says we gotta merchandise
But economy says we gotta minimise huh -
We gotta budget to face and the marketplace is full of competition, competition
Think digital, synthisise, computerise, think visual
Productivity, marketability, higher and higher
Flash those teeth, open those eyes
Think visual, think visual
Flash those teeth, competitions on the rise
Open those eyes, better get computerised
Think visual, think visual, think visual
Think visual, think visual, push the button and see
Marketing say we gotta goal to chase
But economy says we gotta budget to face
Get your attitude straight, 'Cos it's all in your mind
And it's never too late to get a new design
And if you wanna compete you gotta visualise


Flash those teeth, come on open those eyes
Think visual
