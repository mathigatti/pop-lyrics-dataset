Ooh la la la, Ooh ...

Hear the voices calling from the future
In our world of lies they tell of change
I pull an energy message from the invisible
Offered with love to ease the pain


Listen to the spirit calling
All that's truth remains
Listen to the spirit calling

I heard an angel talking when out walking
Through the ethers her words clearly came
Use your imagination think a new future
That's made of the dreams that build a new age

Listen to the spirit calling
Never be afraid
Listen to the spirit calling

Look into your heart
See an open doorway
Love will break the spell
Release you from the dark
Lead the children homeward
Never more be lost
Forever found, forever found

Ooh la la la, Ooh la la la ...

Visions of the past are stretched before me
The ancient pyramids, Babylon and Rome
The rise of the tyrants, the falling of empires
But from the dust always people reborn

Listen to the spirit calling
All we see must change
Listen to the spirit calling

Look into your heart
You will find a doorway
Love will break the spell
Release you from the dark
Lead the children homeward
Never more be lost
Forever found, forever found

Look into your heart
You will find a doorway
Love will break the spell
Release you from the dark
Lead the children homeward
Never more be lost
Forever found, forever found

Listen to the spirit calling
Listen to the spirit calling
