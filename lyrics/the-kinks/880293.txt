Voices across all the nation,
Echo in my mind.
In the streets,
In the factories,
In the towns.
Living out what imagination made real.
Got to leave the old world behind,
Use a fantasy,
Imagination is real.


Chorus
I'm so much in love,
I can't explain,
Imaginations real.
Build your dreams,
And make them strong,
lmaginations real.
Imaginations real,
Imaginations real,
Imaginations real,
Imaginations real.

No solution,
Hatred,
Fear of what's to come.
Don't cry,
Can't you feel it inside,
Can't you see it's the only way it can be.
For our past has left us alone,
With a cold reality,
Imagination made real.

Chorus
If you use a dream
To change a mind,
Then imaginations real.
Think with your heart,
And you will see,
Imaginations real,
Imaginations real,
Imaginations real,
Imaginations real.
