All the good times have all been in vain,
It's a shame, such a shame, such a shame.


It's a shame,
'Cause I didn't wanna cause you any pain,
But I know that it wouldn't be the same
All the good times have all been in vain,
It's a shame, such a shame, such a shame.

It's a shame,
'Cause I didn't intend to do you wrong,
I'd come back but it wouldn't last for long.
I would, if I could, but I can't.
It's a shame, such a shame, such a shame.

It's a shame, such a shame,
'Cause I swore I'd never let you down,
But I was the one who was doing wrong,
It's a shame, such a shame, such a shame.

'Cause I didn't intend to do you wrong,
I'd come back but it wouldn't last for long.
I would, if I could, but I can't.
It's a shame, such a shame, such a shame.

It's a shame, such a shame,
'Cause I swore I'd never let you down,
But I was the one who was doing wrong,
It's a shame, such a shame, such a shame.

'Cause I didn't wanna cause you any pain,
But I know that it wouldn't be the same
All the good times have all been in vain,
It's a shame, such a shame, such a shame.
