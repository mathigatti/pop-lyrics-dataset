I know a place not far from here
It's not far away, love, but if you come
I know a place where we'll be alone
And we'll talk of life, the way love used to be


I know a place not far away
And we'll find a way through the city streets
We'll find a way through the mad rushing crowd
And we'll talk about the way love used to be

I know a place not far from here
It's not far away, love, but if you come
I know a place where we'll be alone
And we'll talk about the way love used to be
