All she wrote was a goodbye letter
"It's over for us, to tell you the truth
I've met this person in a disco
He's really special, reminds me of you


"Now you can mix in those swinging circles
Single bars and gay caf√©s
With pickup lines to impress young schoolgirls
And big Australian barmaids"

That's all she wrote
On the back of that old brown envelope
A few killer lines to get my goat
That's all she wrote

All she wrote on that goodbye letter
"It's over for us, to tell you the truth
And my new man is a vegetarian
He laughs a lot, not like you"

Picked up one of her old love letters
"You are such a caring man"
Such a change from that cold, bitter scam
Of what I was, and what I am

That's all she wrote
On the back of an old brown envelope
A few killer lines to get my goat
That's all she wrote

"Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really care?
Now you're free to live your fantasy
And I'm not there
To cramp your style and blow your cover
Now you're free to take your lover
To titty bars and low life clubs"

All she wrote is a goodbye letter
"It's over for us, to tell you the truth
I've met this person in a disco
He's really special, reminds me of you

"So don't pretend to be a new man
Be chauvinistic, that's your way
Now you're free to make your play
For that big Australian barmaid
(Big Australian barmaid)
Big Australian barmaid"

That's all she wrote
On the back of that old brown envelope
A few killer lines in that suicide note
That's all she wrote
