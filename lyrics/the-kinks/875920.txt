This world is big and wild and half insane 
Take me where real animals are playing 
Just a dirty old shack 
Where the hound dogs bark 
That we called our home 
I want to be back there 
Among the cats and dogs 
And the pigs and the goats 
On Animal Farm 
My animal home 
On Animal Farm 
My animal home 


While I lay my head upon my pillow 
Little girl, come play beneath my window 
Though she's far from home 
She is free from harm 
And she need not fear 
She is by my side 
And the sky is wide 
So let the sun shine bright 
On Animal Farm 
My animal home 
On Animal Farm 
My animal home 

Girl, It's a hard, hard world, if it gets you down 
Dreams often fade and die in a bad, bad world 
I'll take you where real animals are playing 
And people are real people not just playing 
It's a quiet, quiet life 
By a dirty old shack 
That we called our home 
I want to be back there 
Among the cats and dogs 
And the pigs and the goats 
On Animal Farm 
My animal home 
On Animal Farm 
My animal home 
On Animal Farm 
Animal Farm
