He gets up early about seven o'clock,
The alarm goes off and then the house starts to rock.
In and out of the bathroom by seven-o-three,
By seven-ten he's downstairs drinking his tea.
So put a shine on your shoes,
Put on your pin-striped suit.
Can't lose those early-morning-can't-stop-yawning,
Push and shoving rush hour blues.


Wife:
Darling are you ready?
You'll be late for the bus!

Star:
Don't rush me baby
While I'm using my brush.

Wife:
Get a move on darling
You're cutting it fine.

Star:
Cool it baby
I've got plenty of time.

So put a shine on your shoes
Put on your pin-striped suit.
Can't lose those early-morning-can't-stop-yawning
Push and shoving rush hour blues.

Soon I'll be just one of the commuters
Waiting for the subway train.
I'll be rushing up the stairs
And in the elevator.
By the time that I get there
I'm gonna feel like a mole in the ground
I'll be caught in the crush
I'll be pushed and be shoved,
And I'll be trying to get the subway train.
I'll be fighting with my brief case
And my umbrella,
Every morning and every night.
Some people do it every day of their lives.

Wife:
Read the paper later
You'll be caught in the queues.

Star:
Don't rush me baby
While I'm reading the news.

Wife:
Darling get a move on
You're cutting it fine.

Star:
Cool it baby
I've got plenty of time.

A quick cup of coffee and a slice of
toast and the Star (or should we say,
Norman?) is off to do battle with the
rush hour queues and traffic jams.

In the rush hour queues
No one gives a damn.
No one knows where I'm going to
No one knows who I am.

I'm sitting in my office
In the metropolis
I'm just part of the scenery,
I'm just part of the machinery.
Chained to my desk on the 22nd floor,
I can't break out through the automatic door,
I'd jump out the window but I can't face the drop
I'm sitting in a cage with an eye on the clock.

I'm ready to start paying my dues,
I've got to lose those early-morning-can't-stop-yawning,
Push and shoving, rush hour blues.

Well I'm ready to start paying my dues,
I've got to lose those early-morning can't-stop-yawning,
Push and shoving rush hour blues.
