You get up in the morning
And every single day
Is just a repetition
It's always been that way
You live alone inside your head
Incommunicado, in the land of living dead


Each day's a repetition
Of the one that went before
Like watching an old movie
You can't sit through anymore
Why don't you kick the habit
And walk right out that door?

From all the repetition
Day after day
All the repetition
It's always been that way

It's in your head, it's in your eyes
You're boring and it's no surprise
With all the repetition
Day after day
All the repetition

They say it's time to start all over
And call it a day
But you go right back where you started
Day after day
You go right back to where you started
Day after day, after day, after day, after day

You look in the mirror
Is anybody there?
It's only a reflection
That doesn't really care
You're a product of your time
Looking hard for something, but you never saw the sign

Lock inside a prison
But that's where you wanna be
Stuck in solitary
And you've thrown away the key
You say you want your freedom
But you don't wanna get away
Then you wake up, it's time for you
To start another day
With all the repetition, day after day, all the repetition
All the repetition day after day
Another chance, another day
You know it's time to get away from all the repetition
Day after day
How long you gonna sit and wait
You're getting on it's getting late

They say it's time to start all over
And call it a day
But you go right back where you started
Day after day
You go right back to where you started
Day after day, after day, after day, after day
