You'll try and you'll try again
But you know you can't win
You'll try and you'll try again
But you know you can't win


What more can i say now?
What more can i do?
No need to feel sad now
'cause times are pretty thin
And you can't win
You can't win
You can't win

Try and do what you can
But you know you can't win
You say you don't understand
But you know you can't win

What more can you say now?
What more can you do?
No need to feel sad now
'cause times are pretty thin
And you can't win
You can't win
You can't win

What more can i say now?
What more can i do?
No need to feel sad now
'cause times are pretty thin
You can't win
You can't win
You can't win
