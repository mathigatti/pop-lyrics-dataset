I believed you
I believed you
Now it's up to me
I believed you
I believed you
Now it's up to me


I believed what you said
The lovin' days were through
But you were fooling around
I found somebody who,

Will never never take your place
Will never give me your embrace
But now that you've shown your face
You've broken her heart too.

I believed you
I believed you
Now it's up to me
I believed you
I believed you
Now it's up to me

Now what am I to do?
Now that you want me so
I just can't leave her blue
Or else I'll be alone

Well I just can't leave her now
It wouldn't be fair somehow
She loved me when my luck was down
Now you've broken her heart too

I believed you
I believed you
Now it's up to me
I believed you
I believed you
Now it's up to me

Now what am I to do?
Now that you want me so
I just can't leave her blue
Or else I'll be alone

Well I just can't leave her now
It wouldn't be fair somehow
She loved me when my luck was down
Now you've broken her heart too

I believed you
I believed you
Now it's up to me
I believed you
I believed you
Now it's up to me
