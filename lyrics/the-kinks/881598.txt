He never will forget at all
The day he played at the Albert Hall.
A million sessions ago it seems.
He is a session man,
A chord progression,
A top musician.


Rock 'n' roll or vocal star [could be "folk group star" or "Vaudeville star"],
A philharmonic orchestra,
Everything comes the same to him.
He is a session man,
A chord progression,
A top musician.

He's not paid to think, just play,
A session man
A session man
A session man
Playing at a different studio every day.

He reads the dots and plays each line,
And always finishes on time.
No overtime nor favors done.
He is a session man,
A chord progression,
A top musician.

He's not paid to think, just play,
A session man
A session man
A session man
