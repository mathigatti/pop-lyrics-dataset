When you passed me by
You didn't look my way
But one thing I know
Our love is here to stay


And you still want me
And you still want me

You wanted the sky
But I couldn't reach so high
I gave you my love
But you found some other guy

And you still want me
And you still want me

I know because the smile that's on your lips
Is for me
They were meant for me to kiss
And you were meant to love me darling

I'll be around
When other guys have gone
I'll tell you once more
How I still love you so

And you still want me
And you still want me

I know because the smile that's on your lips
Is for me
They were meant for me to kiss
And you were meant to love me darling

I'll be around
When other guys have gone
I'll tell you once more
How I still love you so

And you still want me
And you still want me
And you still want me
