You do something to me
For my heart is so true
And I live just for you


Yes, you do something to me
That nobody else
That nobody else
That nobody else can do

You do something to me
For my heart is so true
And I live just for you

Yes, you do something to me
That nobody else
That nobody else
That nobody else can do

Everything you say,
Everything you do,
Makes me want to fall,
Fall in love, fall in love with you

You do something to me
For my heart is so true
And I live just for you

Yes, you do something to me
That nobody else
That nobody else
That nobody else can do

Everything you say,
Everything you do,
Makes me want to fall,
Fall in love, fall in love with you

You do something to me
That nobody else
That nobody else
That nobody else can do
Can do
