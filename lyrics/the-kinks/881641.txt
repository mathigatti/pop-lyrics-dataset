It came out of the sky and into my life
I thought that I was in heaven
Then a voice reached out and touched my heart with a love that lasts forever


And a voice said ...
The love that you give is more than you know but treat each other kindly
And the time will soon come when each of you will know you are all one

It's a true phenomenon the government denies
A true phenomenon they're telling us lies
A true phenomenon

UFO's in the Holy Bible, every stage they come
Lift up your eyes to the skies across the sun
They looked in my mind, my life, giving it meaning
I looked to night, it vanished from sight my soul living believing

And a voice said ...
Show them the world there's reason for change but you can all survive it
But the time will soon come when each and everyone will see his face

It's a true phenomenon the government denies
A true phenomenon they're telling us lies
A true phenomenon we will not be decieved
A true phenomenon a known conspiracy
A true phenomenon
A true phenomenon

UFO's in the Holy Bible, every stage they come
Lift up your eyes to the skies across the sun

It's a true phenomenon ...
A true phenomenon
True phenomenon
A true phenomenon
