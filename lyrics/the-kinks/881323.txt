(Look for me baby)
Well you can search high and low if you want
But you won't find me
(Look for me baby)
Well, you search the mountains
Look in the sea
Look all around the world
But you won't find a love
A love like mine
You'll be low
And cry misery[?]
'Cause you got no love
(Look for me baby)


In your desperation
You're going to look for someone else
Well now, search the mountains
Search the sea
Look around the world
But you won't find me
(Look for me baby)
You'll be looking for me
(Look for me baby)

Well now, I've never felt so sad
I've never had it so bad
You'll search the oceans
But you won't find me no more
You'll be looking for me
(Look for me baby)

Well you can search high and low if you want
But you won't find me
(Look for me baby)
Well you can climb the mountains
And swim in the sea
Look all around the world
But you won't find a love
A love like mine
You'll be low
And cry misery
'Cause you got no love
(Look for me baby)

In your desperation
You're going to look for someone else
Well now, search the mountains
Search the sea
Look around the world
But you won't find me
(Look for me baby)
You'll be looking for me
(Look for me baby)
You'll be looking for me
(Look for me baby)
You'll be looking for me
(Look for me baby)
