Don't be fooled by appearances, 
it only shows what the world already knows 
Don't rely on the physical evidence 
of what the x-ray pictures show 
Because inside every straight upright citizen a tormented 
emotionally impaired psycologically damaged personality resides
And beside every crooked man stands an angel with wings 
and the spirit can do truly wonderous things 


As I watch the hump-backed man hobble down the high street 
I say a silent prayer for myself 
I was taken to the local doctor 
for a consultation about my physical health 
I heard him ask about my family - history 
"You see, Mrs. Davies, it might be hereditary. Yes it might" 
Maybe think about my family, 'cause socially could be 
"You were a physical deformity" 

'Cos the world only sees what it believes and is revealed in thex-ray 
It only knows what it knows, photographs, video and the printedword 
Yes/But there is more in this heaven on earth 
than (what)/(what those scientists now and) is revealed on/in thex-ray 

Ev'ry morning I got up and looked in the mirror to see if thehump had 
appeared on my back. To my disappointment I was not a freak. 
You see, maybe there'd be side benefits to become in a cripple,
side benefits like prioroty seating at football matches. And Ithought 
"If I'm gonna be a cripple, I'll go all the way" 

They could photograph reality, 
but they can't picture your fantasy 
'Cos the world only sees what it believes and is revealed in thex-ray 
It only knows what it knows, photographs, video and the printedword 
Yes/But there is more in this heaven on earth 
than (what)/(what those scientists now and) is revealed on/in thex-ray 

'Cos the world only sees what it believes and is revealed in thex-ray 
It only knows what it knows, photographs, video and the printedword 
Yes/But there is more in this heaven on earth
