The world's goin' crazy and
Nobody gives a damn anymore.
And they're breakin' off relationships and
Leavin' on sailin' ships for far and distant shores.
For them it's all over,
But I'm gonna stay.
I wouldn't leave anyway.
I know that someday we'll find a way.
We'll be O.K.


'Cause I'm your brother,
Though I don't even know your name.
I've discovered that,
Deep down inside, you feel the same.
Our friends are leavin'.
Now they seem so far away.
But we shouldn't feel afraid.
There's so much that we can say.
You're my brother,
Though I didn't know you yesterday.
I'm your brother.
Together we can find a way.

The world's goin' crazy and
Nobody gives a damn anymore.
And they're breakin' off relationships and
Leavin' on sailin' ships for far and distant shores.
The old world's fadin'.
Now it seems so far away.
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.
There's so much that we can share.
I'm your brother.

The world's goin' crazy and
Nobody gives a damn anymore.
And they're breakin' off relationships and
Leavin' on sailin' ships for far and distant shores.
You're my brother,
Though I didn't know you yesterday.
I'm your brother.
Together we can find a way.
