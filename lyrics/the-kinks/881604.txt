Ooh, I don't understand,
In this crazy world we live in,
Just look around, is it true?
No one gives a damn.
Trapped in a world of illusion,
Is it too late for us, ooh?


Baby, we'll never know why we're stranded here,
Lost in this crowded room,
I noticed you the minute you came into view.
But you're so hard to me,
Oh, why do I care for you so?
I never ever doubt, my love,
The time is oh so right for love.

Take one more chance, this is the last dance.
Take one more chance, this is the last romance.

I don't understand,
Been avoiding me all evening.
Each time I looked you just dance,
Again on the floor.
Like life itself had no meaning.
If I could touch you,
But oohooh, deep in my heart I know,
There's a destiny,
Through all this sadness I see.
It's not too late to change, my love,
Tonight the stars are made for love.

Take one more chance, this is the last dance.
Take one more chance, this is the last romance.

[One more chance] Take one more glance and give our life a chance.
[One more chance] Take one more glance and give our life a chance.
[One more chance] Take one more chance, this is the last dance.
