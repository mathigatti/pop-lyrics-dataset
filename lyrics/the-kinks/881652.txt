I've been cryin' all the Winter.
I've been waiting for some good to come my way,
But I'll wait till the Summer comes along.
Dear Lord, have I done so much wrong.


How can I go on,
Wondering what I did wrong,
Can it be too much to ask?
Please, oh please, let it be.

If the Summer'll come my way,
Will I find someone to take the place of [?]?
But I'll wait till the Summer comes along.
Dear Lord, tell me what could I've done wrong.

Can it be that she,
Never wanted to,
Break some poor mother's heart?
Please, oh please, let it be.

I know my Summer'll never come.
I know I'll cry until my dying day has come.
Let the Winter roll along.
I've got nothing left but song.

Oh, oh, what's happened?
Oh, oh, what's happened?
