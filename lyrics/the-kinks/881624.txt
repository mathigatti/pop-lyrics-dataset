I'm just a simple working man
Gettin' by the best I can
In this crazy mixed-up muddled-up world that I live in.


I'm a middle class sort of a guy
I'm not rich but I get by
Pretending that I know just what I'm doin'.

I'm a well bred upper class sort of chap,
I don't care much about this and that
Even when I know there's trouble brewin'.

We think there's a change in the weather
We've got to learn to stick together.
We've seen the thunder clouds in the sky,
I wanna live, I don't wanna die.

I think the weather's changing, I hope the weather is gonna change.
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.
I think there's a change in the weather, I hope good weather is here to stay,
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.

See the holocaust risin' over the horizon,
Gonna see a manifestation, total chaos, devastation,
Anticyclone and tornados brewin',
Gonna feel the lightnin' strikin',
Thunder clap smoke a frightnin',

There's gonna be evil doin',
There's trouble brewin',
Everybody scared,
Too much thunder, too much fightin'.

Heavy storm clouds comin',
Gonna cover up the sun
And gonna terrify everyone,
Better pack up your bags and run.

I think there's a change in the weather, I think the weather is going to change.
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.
I think there's a change in the weather, I hope good weather is here to stay.
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.
