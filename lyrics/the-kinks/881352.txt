Don't want to surrender anymore to the likes
of you,
Don't want a pretender to show me what
to do.
No degree of immunity,
Gonna give you freedom guaranteed.
But it ain't no joke
When there ain't no hope.
There's no political system gonna satisfy me.


Chorus
Move over.
Can't you hear what I say,
Move over,
Move over.
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.
Move over,
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

No man made laws,
No government rule,
Broad concepts are makin' fools of us all,
Answer to yourself,
And let nobody else
Stop you doing what you wanna do.

Chorus
Move over,
Can't you hear what I say.
Move over,
Move over.
Now we've tried it your way.
Move over.

Don't want to remember people as they used
to be,
Just want to see changes,
Whatever is fine by me.
Is all that money gonna free you from sin.
Is all that virtue gonna save your skin.
When the going gets rough,
There'll be no turning back.
Then what of your gold and your shammy
seat backs.

Chorus
Move over,
Can't you hear what I say.
Move over,
Move over.
Now we've tried it your way.
Move over.
Yeah, yeah.
Move over.
