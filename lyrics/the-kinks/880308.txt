Never been anywhere south of the Delaware
Never been through Kalamazoo
Never been to Timbuktu


Living is fantasy, traveling mentally
Making up tunes in hotel rooms
'Bout places I've never been to

Though I've never crooned under a Kentucky moon

I had my dream, Kentucky moon
But it's only moon dreams
From songs, films and TV
But I can visualize what I've never seen
But I had my dream, Kentucky moon

Route 66 to me is still a mystery
And Ohio, too
Went Chicago blue down to St. Louie blues

Never been anywhere south of the Delaware
Never been through Kalamazoo
Never been to Timbuktu

But I can visualize what I've never seen
So I sit and dream, Kentucky moon

As I sit by a stream in the moon
But it's just imagery
From songs, films and TV
But I can visualize what I've never seen
So I sit and dream, Kentucky moon
