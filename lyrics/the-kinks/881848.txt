Can't you see (can't you see)
Can't you see by the look in my eyes
Can't you see (can't you see)
Can't you see I'm in paradise


I feel all right
I feel okay
'Cause I'm in love (I'm in love)
And you shouldn't be sad

People say (people say)
That love can do funny things
But I say (but I say)
I'm gonna take what the future brings

I feel all right
I feel okay
'Cause I'm in love (I'm in love)
And you shouldn't be sad

No, you can't be sad my darling
If you say you love me too
Well, it seems that all the good things I've done
Done it all for you
Done it all, done it all for you

Can't you see (can't you see)
Can't you see by the look in my eyes
Can't you see (can't you see)
Can't you see I'm in paradise

I feel all right
I feel okay
'Cause I'm in love (I'm in love)
And you shouldn't be sad

I'm in love
And I know, and I know,
And I know, and I know
That you shouldn't be sad
