Now I will hammer, and then I will screw it
Then I would wind it, to see how it goes
We'll keep working, painting and binding
Right til the morning, til he starts to close


Toymaker, toymaker, how do you know
Where all the pieces in your jigsaw puzzle go?
Toymaker, toymaker, don't you work fast
Lighting up you candles till the night has gone past
Toymaker

Now I will hammer, and then I will screw it
Then I would wind it, to see how it goes
We'll keep working, painting and binding
Right til the morning, til he starts to close

Toymaker, toymaker, why do you sing?
Does it make you feel happy when you wind up the spring?
Toymaker, toymaker, don't fall asleep
The children are waking and are getting on their feet
Toymaker

Now I will hammer, and then I will screw it
Then I would wind it, to see how it goes
We'll keep working, painting and binding
Right til the morning, til he starts to close

Toymaker, toymaker, how do you know
Where all the pieces in your jigsaw puzzle go?
Toymaker, toymaker, don't you work fast
Lighting up you candles till the night has gone past
Toymaker
