When work is over he likes to hit the bars,
And at the boozer we'll have another jar,
Because drinking can help ease the strain
Of his boring occupation,
Dull conversation,
Living by the book
And the rules and regulations.


Drinking helps us to forget what we are,
We leave the office and walk straight to the bar.
Don't stop to think,
Have another drink!

Drinking helps us to relax with the chaps,
A double scotch and we forget where we're at.
Don't stop to think
Have another drink!

When work is over he likes to hit the bars,
Go down the boozer and have another jar,
Because drinking can help ease the strain

And the rules and regulations.

Boring occupations,
Dull conversations,
Living by the book
And the rules and regulstions.

Drinking helps us to forget what we are,
We leave the office and walk straight to the bar,
Don't stop to think,
Have another drink.
