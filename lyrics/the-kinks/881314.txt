I'm your little man in a little box
You can turn me on, you can switch me off
You can do anything with me, anything you please


I'm your little man in a little box
You can turn me on, you can switch me off
Carry me around, pick me up, put me down
Any time of day, anywhere, anyway

I'm your little man in a little box
You can turn me on, you can switch me off
Whoa....Juliet....Whoa....Juliet

But I don't likely know, and I can't rightly see
How a little man like me can change you so
You know how I need you so
You know how you need me so

You never speak to me, Just look through my screen
You use me as you like, and turn me off at night

I'm your little man in a little box
You can turn me on, you can switch me off
Whoa....Juliet....Whoa....Juliet
