The sky is blue but there are clouds in my head,
With big decisions looming ahead.
The sun is out but the room is so grey,
So much confusion headed my way.
Get positive, try to be gay.


News of the world, tea and biscuits in bed.
The headlines said that Diana is dead.
She couldn't act much but she put on a show.
She always smiled even when she felt low.
I used to fancy her a long time ago.

So today has got to be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day.

Holes in my socks and I can't find my shoes.
It's no surprise that I'm singing the blues.
So many holes in my life still to mend,
And someone just said that the world's gonna end.

So today better be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Today has got to be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day, good day.

If we blow away the past with a bloody great blast,
Make it fast, make it fast.
So have a good day today because it could be your last,
Make it last, make it last.

Will it light up the sky?
Will it blot out the sun?
Well we've waited this long,
So it better be a good one.
Good day, good day, good day.

Yeah, it's gonna be a good day.
Hey baby, if you come back home it'll be a good day today.
They could drop a small atom bomb on the city today,
But if you walk through that door honey, you know it'll be a good day.

And now survival is my only aim.
I call friends and see if any remain.
Who was that girl who used to be my flame?
I'd call her if I could remember her name.

So today is gonna be a good day,
Today has got to be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day, good day.

Hey Diana, I've really got to learn to take a tip from you,
Put on my makeup and try to make the world take notice of you.
Yeah, it's gonna be good day today.

Good day, gonna be a good day.
(repeat)
