I don't wanna leave, Bernadette, 
But I don't wanna live with the jet set. 
I don't wanna leave with you payin' all my debts, 
With that alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get. 


Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive. 
You've never done a day's work in your life, 
You've got no incentive. 
You've made a career out of punting off all of the men you've slept with. 
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive. 

I can't get a job, Bernadette, 
So all that I can offer are a lot of bad debts 
If you marry me, Bernadette, 
You'll lose the alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get. 

Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive. 
You've never done a day's work in your life, 
You've got no incentive. 
You've made a career out of punting off all of the men you've slept with. 
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive. 
Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette. 
Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette. 

[Bernadette's got a house in the country, 
She's really got it made. 
Her lawyers made her filthy rich, 
She's got all expenses paid.] 

Maybe a famous rock star will fly you away, 
Then you'll eat him all up, 
And spit him out, 
With a dash of Perrier. 

And when you've had enough 
You'll throw him away, 
And take him for all you can get. 
Yeah, you like it don't you, Bernadette? 

I don't want to leave Bernadette, 
But I wanna keep a little bit of self respect. 
I don't want to leave with you paying all my debts, 
With that alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get. 
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive. 
You've never done a day's work in your life. 
You've got no incentive. 
Women like you oughta be locked up, 
For giving others a bad name. 
Ohh, Bernadette, you are so expensive. 
Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette. 
Ooh, Bernadette. 

I think you're sad.
