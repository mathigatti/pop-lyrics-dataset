Ooh, Darling, what can I do?
I feel so afraid, and even my friends don't know what to say,
That's why I'm asking you.


I'm so afraid,
I know I should be strong,
But when affection is gone, it's hard to face each day,
Knowing love has drifted away.

Somehow I can't hide the pain,
Is he gonna come back again?

Dear Lonely Heart,
I wish things could be the way that they were at the start,
But you must face the fact,
If he's going to leave there's no way that you'll win him back.

You gotta try to hold back the tears,
Don't give into your fears.

Darling, I'm so afraid,
I can get through the night,
But when affection is gone, it's hard to face each day,
Oh will he please come home.

Dear Lonely Heart, dear Lonely Heart,
Dear Lonely Heart,
I wish things could be the way that they were at the start,
But you must face the fact,
If he's going to leave there's no way that you'll win him back.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Dear Lonely Heart, dear Lonely Heart,
Dear Lonely Heart.

Darling, I'm so afraid,
I can get through the night,
But I can't face the day knowing you are far away,
Oh will you please come home.
