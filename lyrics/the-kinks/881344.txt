By the town of Straight and Narrow,
There's a dark and misty place.
Everything is hazy,
So the people are afraid.


All except Maria's daughters,
Who believe in misty ways.
Everything is lovely,
In a misty morning glaze.

I like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
They like misty water.

I like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
Take a sip of misty water.

Though Maria is not lovely,
She's the lady of my dreams.
'Cause I see my lady,
Through a misty, silky screen.

And seeing is believing,
But I can't believe my eyes.
Everything is lovely,
In a misty paradise.

I like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
They like misty water.

They like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
Take a sip of misty water.

I like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
They like misty water.

They like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
They like misty water.

I like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters...
