Sometimes I think I'm gonna better myself,
Searching for acceptance in this big, wide world.
Sometimes I think I won't make it,
Playing in a rock 'n' roll band.
Sometimes I wanna be a picture director,
And try to make the world understand.


By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies.

All the movie makers of the world would be,
Falling over backwards to have dinner with me.
I'll go down to
Anytime I feel like a game.
Or take a long vacation to San Tropez,
And think of all the money I made.

By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies.

I don't want to be a producer,
I don't want to be a big star.
I just want to be a picture director,
And smoke a big Havana cigar.

By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies.
