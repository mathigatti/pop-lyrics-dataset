Sailing in-between the land, the air and me
Confusion never talks
'Cause frame of mind tells me that I am free
I am free


Doors are open wide
No credits to be seen
Sail with me my friend
I need someone, it's dark and it could get lonely
I am free

I am free

I don't care to be
As similar as machines
To
And convalesce when society doesn't need me
I am free
