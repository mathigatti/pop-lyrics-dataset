Don't know why I'm even bothering.
(Predictable)
Yeah, that's the mood I'm in.
Go out for a walk then I come back in.
(Predictable)
Yeah, the mood that I'm in.
(Predictable)
Every day of my life
Can't even communicate with my wife
(Predictable)
That's the word of the year
(Predictable)
All I see, all I hear.


Go to my office, sit at my desk,
Predictably just like all of the rest.
I sit and I dream about far away places,
Away from the people with frowns on their faces.
All of my life is monotony
I'd go out for a walk but I know it would be
(Predictable)
Sure as the nose on my face
(Predictable)
Same for the whole human race

Once we (once we) had so many options
Once we (once we) had dignity and grace
Now we (now we) have got nothing but our own time to waste.

(Predictable)
Yeah, that's the word of the year
(Predictable)
All I see, all I hear
Why can't it be like never before?
(Predictable)
Yeah, ain't life a bore
(Predictable)
Life gets more and more...
Just like I've heard it all somewhere before.
(Predictable)
Sure as the nose on my face
(Predictable)
Same for the whole human race

One day (one day) it's gonna get better some way (some way)
I wish it would get worse any way (any way)
What can I lose, it might turn into something better.

It gets harder and harder the harder I try
(Predictable)
Feels like a good time to die
I kiss you hello then I kiss you good-bye
(Predictable)
Just like the stain on my tie
(Predictable)
Just like the jacket I wear
(Predictable)
The way that I'm combing my hair
Turn on the TV, just sit and stare
(Predictable)
There's nothing happening there

Yeah, that's the word of the year
(Predictable)
All I see, all I hear.
