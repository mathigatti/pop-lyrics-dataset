I'll sing a song about some people you might know
They made front pages in the news not long ago
But now they're just part of a crowd
And I wonder where they all are now


Where have all the Swinging Londoners gone?
Ossie Clark and Mary Quant
And what of Christine Keeler
John Stephen and Alvaro
Where on earth did they all go?
Mr. Fish and Mr. Chow
Yeah, I wonder where they all are now

Where are all the Teddy Boys now?
Where are all the Teddy Boys now?
The Brill Cream boys with D.A.s
Drainpipes and blue suedes
Beatniks with long pullovers on
And coffee bars and Ban the Bomb
Yeah, where have all the Teddy Boys gone?
I hope that Arthur Seaton is alright
I hope that Charlie Bubbles had a very pleasant flight
And Jimmy Porter's learned to laugh and smile
And Joe Lampton's learned to live a life of style

Where are all the angry young men now?
Where are all the angry young men now?
Barstow and Osborne, Waterhouse and Sillitoe
Where on earth did they all go?
And where are all the protest songs?
Yes, where have all the angry young men gone

I wonder what became of all the Rockers and the Mods
I hope they are making it and they've all got stead jobs
Oh but rock and roll still lives on
Yeah, rock and roll still lives on
