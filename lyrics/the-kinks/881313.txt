See all the people
With hatred in their eyes
I can't help thinking that
It's only a disguise
Cause underneath that core
There's got to be more
Than what we realize


Maybe they're scared
To let the inside out
Maybe they're afraid to
Show what they're all about
So they put on a heavy front and hope that no one else
Can work them out
So they put on all the heaviness
But its only an illusion heaviness
Can't you see
They're scared to
Show a little bit of emotion
A little bit of real emotion
In case a little bit of emotion
Gives them away

Look at that lady dancing around with no clothes
She'll give you all her body
That's if you've got the dough
She'll let you see most
Anything but there's one thing
That she'll never show
And that's a little bit of real emotion
A little bit of true emotion
In case a little bit of emotion
Gives her away
But it's a shame she's acting that way
Somehow she's gotta get through every day
And the only way
Is not to show one little bit of emotion
A little bit of true emotion
In case a little bit of emotion gives her away

People learn their lines
And they act out their part
Then they talk on cue
But it's got no heart
It's all on the surface
And it's all contrived
They're scared to come out
Somehow they've got to survive

Look at that looney
With a smile on his face
He knows no shame
And feels no disgrace
He's got a look in his eyes
That makes it seem that he's from outer space
Maybe that looney knows what it's all about
He's got something to say
But he can't spit it out
He's unco-ordinated so we shut him out
In case he shows a little bit of emotion
A little bit of real emotion
We're afraid to see a bit of emotion
So we walk away
Show a little bit of real emotion
Show a little bit of emotion
We're afraid to see a bit of emotion
So we walk away
