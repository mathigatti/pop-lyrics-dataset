See my friends,
See my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river,


See my friends,
See my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river,

She is gone,
She is gone and now there's no one left
'Cept my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river,

She just went,
She just went,
Went across the river.

Now she's gone,
Now she's gone,
Wish that I'd gone with her.

She is gone,
She is gone and now there's no one left
'Cept my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river,

She is gone and now there's no one else to take her place
She is gone and now there's no one else to love
'Cept my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river,

See my friends,
See my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river,

See my friends,
See my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river,
