I'm too terrified to walk out of my own front door
They're demonstrating outside I think they're gonna start the third world war
I've been to my local head shrinker
To help classify my disease
He said it's one of the cases of acute schizophrenia he sees


Well the milkman's a spy, and the grocer keeps on following me
And the woman next door's an undercover for the KGB
And the man from the social security
Keeps on invading my privacy
Oh, there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease

I've got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose
Acute schizophrenia blues

I'm lost on the river, the river of no return
I can't make decisions, I don't know which way I'm gonna turn
Even my old dad, lost some of the best friends he ever had
Apparently, his was a case of acute schizophrenia too

I got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose

They're watching my house and they're tapping my telephone
I don't trust nobody, but I'm much too scared to be on my own
And the income tax collector's got his beady eye on me
No, there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease

No, there ain't no cure for
Schizophrenia disease
