You've come a long way from the runny-nosed and scruffy kid I knew
You had such good ways
I can remember the little things that always made you smile
They made you happy
Now you think you're wiser because you're older and you think
That money buys everything
And you think you need no one to guide you
But you're still a long way from home.
You've come a long way, you're self-assured and dressed in
Funny clothes, but you don't know me.
I hope you find what you are looking for with your car and handmade overcoats
But your wealth will never make you stronger 'cos you're still a
Long way from home
Yes, you're still a long way from home
