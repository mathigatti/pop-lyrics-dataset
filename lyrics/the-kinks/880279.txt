Well I don't need you honey,
'Cause things just ain't the same.
Since you've been going out with other fellas,
Things have really changed.


Well I needed you once,
But now I'm standing alone.
I don't need you any more.
I don't need you any more.
I don't need you any more.

If I ever lost you,
Then I will surely have died,
That's what I thought.
Things have changed a little, honey,
Now I'm a wiser guy.

Well I needed you once,
But now I'm standing alone.
I don't need you any more.
I don't need you any more.
I don't need you any more.

Well I never thought that I'd love you again,
But my luck has changed, now I'm free.
I don't need you any more.
I don't need you any more.
I don't need you any more.

If I ever lost you,
Then I will surely have died,
That's what I thought.
Things have changed a little, honey,
Now I'm a wiser guy.

Well I needed you once,
But now I'm standing alone.
I don't need you any more.
I don't need you any more.
I don't need you any more.

I never thought that I'd love you again,
But my luck has changed, now I'm free.
I don't need you any more.
I don't need you any more.
I don't need you any more.
I don't need you any more.
