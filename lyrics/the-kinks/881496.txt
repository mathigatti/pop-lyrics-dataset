Open up your eyes, see the world around you
It's not what we thought it was. It's not what we were told.
Flashing signs before us. They're even reading the last rites.
All our systems have failed us. Now they've turned out the lights.


Soothe Sayer. The miracle's just begun. What a cool player.
Love is the only one! Soothe Sayer.

New age, millenium. The coming of the new messiah.
Wall Street, big businesses, pretending it's alright.
Preachers lost in ministry, while the sinners laugh and mock.
Angels watching helplessly the final ticking of the clock!

Soothe Sayer. Got you on the run. What a cool player. Love is the only one!
Soothe Sayer. Got 'em on the run. What a mind blower. Love is the only one!
Soothe Sayer.

When you walk that rocky road, you need food to feed your soul.
I'll help you with that heavy load, until you reach your home!
Your not alone!

Soothe Sayer. The miracle's just begun. What a cool player.
Love is the only one. Soothe Sayer. Soothe Sayer.
The Devils on the run. What a cruel player.
Love is the only one! Soothe Sayer!

Open up your heart. Look up in to the sky.
Feel the energy around you and know that we must try.
Love's the new reality, the true saviour of this world.
We're gonna live through this insanity. You better hold on to me Guru!
Soothe Sayer. Soothe Sayer
