You've been sleeping in a field but you look real rested 
You set out to outrage but you can't get arrested 
You say your image is new, but it looks well tested 
You're lost without a crowd yet you go your own way 


You say your summer has gone 
Now the Winter is crawlin' in 
They say that even in your day 
Somehow you never could quite fit in 
Though it's cold outside 
I know the Summer's gonna come again 
Because you know what they say 
Every dog has his day 

You're a misfit, afraid of yourself, so you run away and hide 
You've been a misfit all your life 
Why don't you join the crowd 
And come inside 
You wander round this town like you've lost your way 
You had your chance in your day 
Yet you threw it all away 
But you know what they say 
Every dog has his day 

Look at all the losers and the mad eyed gazers 
Look at all the looneys and the sad eyed failures 
They're giving up living 'cos they just don't care 
So take a good look around 
The misfits are everywhere 
La la la la la la 

You're a misfit 
Afraid of yourself so you run away and hide 
You've been a misfit all your life 
But why don't you join the crowd and come inside 
You wander round this town 
Like you've lost your way 
You had your chance in your day 
Yet you threw it all away 
Now you're lost in the crowd 
Yet, still go your own way 

This is your chance, this is your time 
So don't throw it away 
You can have your day 
Yes it's true what they say 
Every dog has his day
