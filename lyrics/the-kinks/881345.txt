Come on love
Let's forget about all the things that we've done wrong
Just remember all of the things that we've done right
I'm in no mood to argue and I'm in no mood to fight
So let the tears pass you by
Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry
And I ain't gonna let this big world get me down
I gotta learn to keep a hold of my head and keep my feet on the ground
Moments of ecstatic happiness
And the moments of stress that we had better forget
But love, I gotta feeling that I've said it all before
I said it before
I say I'll never do you wrong but then I go and do the same again
I don't know why, don't know why
Don't know why, don't know why, don't know why
We gotta learn to share these moments in our lives
And never let it get us down, we gotta put up a fight
Moments to remember all our lives
From the first brief hello to the last good-bye


I say I'll never do you wrong but then I go and do the same again
I don't know why, don't know why
Don't know why, don't know why, don't know why
We gotta learn to share these moments in our lives
And never let it get us down, we gotta put up a fight
Moments to remember all our lives
From the first brief hello to the last good-bye
