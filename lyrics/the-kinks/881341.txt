Misery
I know you got troubles but you don't have to spread it about
Misery
You moan and you groan but all of that I can live without
Well
Until you stop worrying about yourself
You'll never get anywhere with me
I'll still be hanging in there but you're still a misery


Until you learn to laugh you'll never come to any parties at my house
My house
And if you go on like this the only house you'll ever visit is the nut house
Nut house

You're such a misery, why don't you learn to laugh
Look in the mirror and
Don't take yourself so seriously

Well
Dollar bills could fall from the sky
But still you wouldn't be satisfied
But I'm not going to let you depress me

Until you learn to laugh you'll never come to any parties at my house
My house
And if you go on like this the only house you'll ever visit is the nut house
Nut house

You're such a misery, why don't you learn to laugh
Look in the mirror and
Don't take yourself so seriously
Ah ah ah ah

Misery
You're only happy when you're feeling totally down
Misery
I only ever see you when your chin's hanging on the ground
Well
Until you learn to laugh at yourself
You'll never get anywhere with me
I'm down but I'm still happy but
You're such a misery, well
You're such a misery, well
You're such a misery
