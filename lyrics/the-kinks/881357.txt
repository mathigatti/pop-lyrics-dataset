Hey, Mr. Reporter
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing
Or is it that you can do nothing else?


Hey, Mr. Reporter
I'll believe all that you put down
I'll believe the sun is going up
Even though it's going down

Hey, Mr. Reporter
Don't you twist my words around
I'll kill you, I won't let you
Distort my simple sound

Hey, Mr. Reporter
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun

The reason I am stupid
Is because I read you every day
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way

Hey, Mr. Reporter
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing
Or is it that you can do nothing else?
