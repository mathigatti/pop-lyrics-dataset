Calling

Hear them calling, calling out your name
How can I get a message through
Hear them calling voices in my brain
How can I get close to you


When I look into your eyes
I see a complicated girl
With all the troubles of the world
Resting on your shoulders no one gives a damn
Can't you understand you gotta keep on trying
You know I'll never let you down
It's not too late for you to turn around

Voices calling, calling to you
Trying hard to get a message through
Holy calling, voices of rage
In your heart do you feel the same

I know somehow that we'll survive
All injustice in the world
All the hate and lying
Little baby let me hold you in my arms
I know the night is dark
But we can't stop trying
God knows the rain keeps beating down
But don't you know I'll never let you down

Hear them calling, calling out your name
How can I get a message through
Hear them calling voices in my brain
How can I get close to you

There's no need to be afraid
It's just an age that slowly cries
A past that's dying
Soon we'll find a better way
So put your hand in mine, we can't stop trying
You know I'll never let you down
The way seems hard but it will turn around

Voices calling, calling to you
Trying hard to get a message through
Holy calling, voices of rage
In your heart is there's room for change

Calling to you
How can I get a message through
Hear them calling, voices in my brain
How can I get close to you

Calling ... Calling ...
