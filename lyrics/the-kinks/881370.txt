This is the end, this is the last time,
Take what you want, why wait a lifetime?
Why wait till tomorrow when you can just take it today,
And it's not far away.


Live all your life according to a plan.
Live by the rules the best way you can.
So the system that fed you and bred you can throw you away,
And it's not far away,
Not far away.

Oh, oh.
The system that fed you and bred you can throw you away,
And it's not far away,
Not far away,
Not far away,
Not far away,

Oh, oh.
The system that breeds you and feeds you will throw you away.
And it's not far away,
Not far away.

Oh, oh.
Total chaos, total destruction.
(Not far away, not far away.)
Social collapse, moral corruption.
(Not far away, not far away.)

I feel it in my bones, it gets closer each day.
The future is here, and it won't go away.

They're gonna segregate the people,
They're gonna put you in your place.
And no one's gonna listen when you try to plead your case.
And those who think they are immune will get slapped in the face.

Chaos will rule,
No one will be safe,
The ending is near,
And it's not far away.

The future is here and it's ours to dictate,
The ending is closer so why hesitate,
Oh, oh.

The ending is near, and it's not far away.
