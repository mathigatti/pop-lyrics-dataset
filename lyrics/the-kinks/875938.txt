Every night, I just can't go sleep
Every night, I have to count sheep
Every night, I just can't go sleep, uh huh
Without you, without you
I just can't go to sleep


Every night, I feel so lonely
Longing for you, one and only
Every night, I just can't go sleep, uh huh
Without you, without you
I just can't go to sleep
(No, no, no, no, no)
Yeah, I just can't go to sleep, now
(No, no, no, no, no)
Yeah, I just can't go to sleep
(No, no, no, no, no)
Yeah, without you, without you
I just can't go to sleep
To sleep

Every day you look my way,
And I want to hold you
But when nighttime comes
You're not around for me to love

Every night, I just can't go sleep
Every night, I have to count sheep
Every night, I just can't go sleep, uh huh
Without you, without you
I just can't go to sleep
(No, no, no, no, no)
Yeah, I just can't go to sleep, now
(No, no, no, no, no)
Oh, I just can't go to sleep
(No, no, no, no, no)
