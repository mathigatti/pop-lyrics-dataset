Have you seen this face?
Does it ring a bell?
Does it strike a chord somewhere in your mind?
And there's a big reward,
If you help us solve this crime,
And if you recognize this face, dial 999.


Have you seen this face?
Dig deep in your mind.
Has anybody seen that little girl of mine?
She was always a rover,
But I'm afraid to say she's strayed
Too far this time.

Now I'm sitting at home, staring at the wall.
Waiting for the missing person to call.
Waiting for the message I'm dreading to hear.
Waiting to confirm my darkest fears.
She's a missing person, I wish I could see
All of the places she might be.
Maybe I stopped her from being free.
Maybe there was something missing in me.

Wherever she is, I hope she's doing fine,
But I wish that she would phone or drop us a line.
Till then I've got nothing to ease my mind,
And I'm thinking about her all the time.
