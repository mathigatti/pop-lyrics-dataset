Hear me brothers, hear me sisters,
Citizens and comrades hear my song.
The old life's dead the order's changing
It's time for all of us to move along.


Got no time to live a life
With old worn-out traditions
Swallowed my pride,
Changed my ways,
And found a new religion.
There you go.

Sick and tired of living on loans,
Driving around in a car that I don't own.
Tired of looking at wealthy faces
Flying off to far out places.
The workers of the world
Shall give the profits to the people.
Class will disappear
And we will live our lives as equals.
There you go.

And we'll all walk along
And we'll all sing a song
And we'll all mark time as we go.
Yes, we'll all walk along
And we'll all sing a song
As we walk down Salvation Road.

Goodbye youth, goodbye dreams,
The good times and the friends I used to know.
Goodbye freedom, hello fear,
A brave new world has suddenly appeared.
Got to be hard,
Don't look back
And no more reminiscing.
Times are rough,
We've got to be tough,
And concentrate on living.
There you go.

And we'll all join hands,
And we'll all march along
And we'll all mark time as we go.
Yes, we'll all walk along,
And we'll sing a song,
As we walk down Salvation Road.

We'll all walk along
And we'll all sing a song
And we'll all mark time as we go.
Yes, we'll all walk along
And we'll all sing a song
As we walk down Salvation Road.
