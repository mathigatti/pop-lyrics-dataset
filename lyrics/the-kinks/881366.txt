Walking along a crowded street
I see thousands of faces before me.
Then I see a face that I used to know
Long ago in my life story.
It starts me thinking about the things you said
For your image is still inside me.
The past is gone but in my head
You're still walking along beside me.
Is it something playing tricks with my eyes
Or just an illusion deceiving me,
Or is it someone in a disguise
Or visions of things that used to be?


But lately I've been going to
All the places that we once knew,
And just when I think that I am free of you
I keep seeing the things that remind me of you,
And just when I think you're out of my head
I hear a song that you sang or see a book that you read.
Then you're in every bar, you're in every café,
You're driving every car, I see you everyday,
But you're not really there 'cos you belong to yesterday.

No more looking back,
No more living in the past,
Yesterday's gone and that's a fact,
Now there's no more looking back.
Got to be hard,
Yeah, look straight ahead.
That s the only way it's going to be,
Yesterday's gone and that's a fact,
Now there's no more looking back,

Perhaps someday I'll stop needing you,
Then maybe one day I'll be free of you.
But lately I've been going to
All the places that remind me of you.
And just when I think you're out of my head
I hear a record you played or see a book that you read.
Then you're in every bar, you're in every café,
You're driving every car, I see you everyday
But you're not really there 'cos you belong to yesterday.

No more looking back,
No more living in the past.
Yesterday's gone, that's a fact,
Now there's no more looking back.
No more looking back.
No more living in the past.
Yesterday's gone, that's a fact.
Now there's no more looking back.
