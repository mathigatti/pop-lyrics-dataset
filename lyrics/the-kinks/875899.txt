Well I met a pretty girl, as pretty as can be
I thought she was my baby till she introduced to me
A great big tall fella, about six foot tall
I shivered and I shook, couldn't do any more


'Cause I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
And I'm really built for speed
Built for speed

Well, some people think I'm lazy but there's one thing they don't know
'Cause when I'm in the mood I can go caddy[?] go

'Cause I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
And I'm really built for speed
Built for speed
Built for speed
Whoa yeah

Well I can roar like a lion, I can sting like a bee
But some times I think, baby, I've got rabbit blood in me

'Cause I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
And I'm really built for speed
Built for speed
Built for speed
Whoa yeah
