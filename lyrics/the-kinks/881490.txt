We're just slum kids, and we know it,
And we never stood a chance.
We were dragged up from the gutter,
From the wrong side of the tracks.


So how dare you criticize,
When you don't know what it's like
To be dragged up from the gutter,
From the wrong side of the tracks.

Why do rich kids get all the breaks,
While the poor slum kids have to work, sweat, struggle and slave?
Why, Lord, there's so much injustice in this world?
Slum kids never stand a chance.

Look at all the slum kids all around you,
Oh, they never stood a chance.
We were dragged up from the gutter,
From the wrong side of the tracks.
