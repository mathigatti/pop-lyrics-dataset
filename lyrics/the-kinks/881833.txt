I've never tried these reason my crest,
I got tired of those administrations caught
with their trousers down,
Yea poor fools just to exercise their intellect,
Power matters rift,
Looking for another kicker, yeah yeah.


You call me a fool when I laugh at you,
But how do you know you won't put me in
the drink,
And sit behind an empty glass.
How long must we show the world,
blah blah blah mumble mumble

Chorus
I'm a Wild Man, don't you know it,
I'm a Wild Man, don't you know it,
blah blah blah mumble mumble
I'm a Wild Man, don't you know it,
They can't capture me.
I'm a Wild Man, don't you know it?

I'm a Wild Man, don't you know it.

I think I'm going soul,
And I think I'm gonna retire,
mumble mumble mumble so terrified to see you.
At least inside mumble mumble mumble
An endless sea of misery,
With every single word of scripture, yeah yeah.

How do you know what to do,
When there's so sickness in the world?
How can you sleep when theres mumble mumble mumble
blah blah blah mumble mumble
blah blah blah mumble mumble
Divisionary policies.

Chorus
I'm a Wild Man, don't you know it,
I'm a Wild Man, don't you know it?
