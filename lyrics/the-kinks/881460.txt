Something's happenin' but I'm just gonna turn a blind eye.
If I see no evil, ask no questions, and I hear no lies.
Can't communicate with minds that are small,
With some people it's like talkin' to the wall
And a fellow who walks away,
lives to battle another day.
And I've really got no appetite
for a fight,
Not tonight.


All I want is a quiet life.
Anything for a quiet life.
No ambition to rock the boat
When I can just stay afloat.

Be content with a quiet life
All I want is a quiet life.
Anything for a quiet life.
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil at all.
Confidentially, between these walls,
I'm on top of it all.

I'd rather have 'em think I'm deaf, dumb, and blind
Than aggravation every time I speak my mind
Keep at a quiet life.
Anything for a quiet life.

I could easily blow my top,
Start a row,
But why start now?

Give your daddy a quiet life.
Give your mother a quiet life.
Anything for a quiet life.

[instrumental section]

Give your daddy a quiet life.
Give your mother a quiet life.
Anything for a quiet life.
Confidentially, between these walls,
I'm on top of it all.
