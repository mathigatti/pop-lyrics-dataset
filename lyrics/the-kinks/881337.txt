You got a mean disposition,
You got no inner vision,
And you're cruel in addition.


I can tell by the way you look,
I can read you like a book.
Oh, you're out there on your own,
Without friends to call your own.

Remember the days,
When we thought they would last for always.
Life full of dreams,
And we really believe that they come true some day.

You got a mean disposition,
But no goal or ambition.
Oh, you're out there on your own,
With no place to call a home.

Remember the days,
When we thought they would last for always.
Life full of dreams,
And we really believe that they come true one day.

Whatever happened to the man
With a future and a plan?

You got a mean disposition
Toodoodoo doodoodoo doodoo
Toodoodoo doodoodoo doodoo

You got a mean disposition,
You got no inner vision,
And you're cruel, oh yes you are!
