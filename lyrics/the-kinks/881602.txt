Oh, Suzannah's bedraggled but she
Still wears the locket 'round her neck.
She's got a picture on the table
Of a man who is young and able.


Oh, Suzannah's gonna cry,
Oh, Suzannah's still alive.
Whiskey or gin, that's alright,
When there's nothing in her bed at night
She sleeps with the covers down,
Hopin' that somebody gets in.
Doesn't matter what she does,
She knows that she can't win.
Oh, Suzannah's gonna cry.

She's got a doll with one eye,
That always cries when she gets some sleep
She's waiting for a soldier to come home,
But she'll cry and never die.

Oh, Suzannah's gonna cry,
Oh, Suzannah's still alive.
Whiskey or gin, that's alright,
When there's nothing in her bed at night
She sleeps with the covers down,
Hopin' that somebody gets in.
Doesn't matter what she does,
She knows that she can't win.
Oh, Suzannah's still alive.

Oh, Suzannah's gonna cry,
Oh, Suzannah's still alive.
Oh, Suzannah's still alive.
