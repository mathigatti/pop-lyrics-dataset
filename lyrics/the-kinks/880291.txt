I've got that feeling, it's her, oh yeah.
I've got that feeling, it's her, oh yeah-ah-ah.


Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know,
I love her, I love her.
When we kiss show,
But I love her, I love her.

She is the sweetest girl I know.
And when she kisses me I know.
Whoa-oh-oh.

I've got that feeling, it's her, oh yeah.
I've got that feeling, it's her, oh yeah-ah-ah.

She's got a crazy way of kissing while we're talking
And I love her, I love her.
She makes my heart start a-bumping and a-jumping
'Cause I love her, I love her.

She is the sweetest girl I know.
And when she kisses me I know.
Whoa-oh-oh.

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know,
I love her, I love her.
When we kiss show,
But I love her, I love her.

She is the sweetest girl I know.
And when she kisses me I know.
Whoa-oh-oh.

I've got that feeling, it's her, oh yeah.
I've got that feeling, it's her, oh yeah.
