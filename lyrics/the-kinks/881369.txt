Dad's stuck in the factory, machines are banging all around.
Momma's in the kitchen, she got the radio on all the time.
My little sister's screaming, and stamping on the ground.
And the radio keeps pumping out the same old boring sound.


All I hear is noise.
Can't get away from the noise.
Can you hear me above the noise?
Can you, can you, can you, can you, can you, can you hear me?

Can you hear the noise? (Noise)
Can't get away from the noise. (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise? (Noise)
Can you, can you, can you, can you, can you, can you hear me?

Banging in my ears, in every direction.
Listen to the roar, hear that city[?], poundin', poundin'.
There oughta be a law, hey buddy, turn that radio down.
Sometimes I get used to it and I forget that it's around.

But all I hear is noise. (Noise)
Can't get away from noise. (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise? (Noise)

All of this confusion is ruining my day.
Let the noise be like the sunset, and slowly fade away.
Fading, fade.

Girl, I want to build a better world for me and you.
I wanna pull out all the plugs before I finally blow my fuse.
Wish all the confusion would slowly fade away.
I'd tell you that I love you, but you don't hear what I way.

All you hear is noise. (Noise)
Can't get away from noise. (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise? (Noise)
Can you, can you, can you, can you, can you, can you hear me?

Noise in the street, they're digging up the pavement.
Noise in the air, those traffic jams are everywhere.
Noise on noise, to cover up the noise.
The pressure's building up because there's no way to avoid,

All the noise. (Noise)
Can't get away from noise. (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise? (Noise)

All of this confusion is ruining my day.
Let the noise be like the sunset, and slowly fade away.
Fading, fading.
