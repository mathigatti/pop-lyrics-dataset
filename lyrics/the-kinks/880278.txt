You say you'll be home today
But I bet you won't stay
I bet you won't stay
You say you'll be coming home
But I bet you won't stay
I bet you won't stay


I bet you won't stay here with me, my darling
I know that you like to be free, my darling
You say what you like, you do what you want
But you don't have to stay with me if you don't want
You don't have to stay with me

You say you'll be coming home
But I bet you won't stay
I bet you won't stay
You say you'll be home today
But I bet you won't stay
I bet you won't stay

I bet you won't stay here with me, my darling
I know that you like to be free, my darling
You say what you like, you do what you want
But you don't have to stay with me if you don't want
You don't have to stay with me

But I bet you won't stay
I bet you won't stay
But I bet you won't stay
I bet you won't stay

I bet you won't stay here with me, my darling
I know that you like to be free, my darling
You say what you like, you do what you want
But you don't have to stay with me if you don't want
You don't have to stay with me
