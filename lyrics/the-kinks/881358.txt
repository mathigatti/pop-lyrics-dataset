Hey, Mr. Shoemaker's daughter,
Hey, Mr. Shoemaker's daughter,
Don't throw my love away.
I'm coming home today.


Hey, Mr. Green Grocer's daughter,
Hey, Mr. Green Grocer's daughter,
Don't turn your head away.
Don't take the sun away.

Every time I see you I wanna say "hey".
But every time you see me you walking away from me.
I've been gone for such a long, long time,
But I'm coming home, gonna make you mine.

Hey, Mr. Cake Baker's daughter,
Hey, Mr. Bread Baker's daughter,
I'm coming home today.
Don't hide the world[?] away.

Every time I see you I wanna say "hey".
But every time you see me you walking away from me.
I've been gone for such a long, long time,
But I'm coming home, gonna make you mine.

How is that fresh morning feeling?
How is the dawn and the evening?
I will be free today.
Hey, Mr. Shoemaker's daughter,
Hey, Mr. Shoemaker's daughter,
I'll see you soon today.

Hey, Mr. Dress Maker's daughter,
Hey, Mr. Green Seller's daughter,
Don't throw my love away.
