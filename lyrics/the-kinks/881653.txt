Standing at the end of the horizon
Looking at another setting sun
Nature gave us all these toys to play with
But we've abused them, each and every one
They stretched the chord, snapped the wire
Lit the fuse but can't retire
We're going to the wall of fire
Tip-toeing on the great high wire
Let's have a real fire


The city slickers built the great illusion
Now they're the first to crumble in the sun
Now we're going through the wall
Let's see the flames before we fall
We're going through the wall of fire
Let's have a real fire
Tip-toeing on the great high wire
Through the wall of fire

We drove on many rocky roads together
Through the storms and hurricanes we rode
Unified so no one could destroy us
We stretched the bounds
But always kept the code
Liberals shout and cause concern
Forget next week while we all burn
Let's run right through the wall of fire
Let's have a real fire
Death-defying while the flames grow higher
Through the wall of fire
Let's go through the wall of fire
Running through the wall of fire
