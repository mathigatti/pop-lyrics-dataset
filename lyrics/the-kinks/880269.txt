Today, when she comes in,
I'll be standing at the door, and I won't say any more.
I know that she's been there.
It's not the way I look at her, it's the way she looks at me.


Yes you can hold my hand any other night,
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.
Hold my hand any other night of the week,
It's all right.

Hold my hand any other night,
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.
Hold my hand any other night of the week,
It's all right.

Hold my hand.
Hold my hand.
Hold my hand.

When she lays on my bed,
It's not me she's thinking of, it's just me that really cares.
My time, I know is out,
And she'll be walking through that door,
And she'll lie again tomorrow night.

Yes you can hold my hand any other night,
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.
Hold my hand any other night of the week,
It's all right.

Hold my hand any other night,
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.
Hold my hand any other night of the week,
It's all right.

Hold my hand.
Hold my hand.
Hold my hand.
Hold my hand.
