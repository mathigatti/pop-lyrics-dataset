They say you're as cold as ice.
All that matters to me,
Is what I see inside you.
You know what people are like,
Talk about you when your back is turned.
But don't you worry about a thing,
Oh, some people, they just never learn.


They just can't understand you, all the things you do,
But I'm glad that I've found you, to share this love so true.

["Do you really wanna stay with him?"] They say.
["Do you really go away with him?"] They say.
["I don't know I'm sure"]

Is it any wonder?
You surely gotta wonder.
(But I love you, honey, I can't let go.)
Is it any wonder?

Sometimes people make me laugh,
With their false morality.
Judging other people's lives,
But I don't care as long as you're with me.
One day when the world has grown,
And we see things as they really are
Please remember two souls,
Struggling hard to reach a star.

There's a life that is planned here just for me and you,
That goes beyond understanding, all the little things we do.

Do you really like the way you live?
Why is it always take, not give?
I don't know I'm sure.

Is it any wonder?
You surely gotta wonder.
Is it any wonder?

Is it any wonder?
(But I love you, honey, and I can't let go.)
Is it any wonder?
(Well, I love you, honey, and I can't let go.)
Is it any wonder?
(Well, I love you, honey, and I can't let go.)
