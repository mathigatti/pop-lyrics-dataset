I won't stay around with you my friend
My life's been empty since I went
Since I went away from home
I'm sick and tired of being alone
There's nothing left for me to do
So I gotta get the first plane home
I gotta get the first plane home


I gotta wing wing fly high over the see
There's a little girl who's waiting for me
Love her till my dying day
And when I die you'll hear me say
I love that girl for eternity
But I gotta get the first plane home
I gotta get the first plane home

Got to wing wing fly high over the see
There's a little girl who's waiting for me
Love her till my dying day
And when I die you'll hear me say
I love that girl for eternity
But I gotta get the first plane home
I gotta get the first plane home
I gotta get the first plane home
I gotta get the first plane home
