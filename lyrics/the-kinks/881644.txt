Another Saturday night and everybody gets together
The pubs are turning out and all the streets are alive
But the people wanna party so they come back to our house
Everybody gonna do the U.K Jive
Dad's got a crate of beer and it's an open invitation
He's ever-so elated and so are his mates.
Everybody's welcome to bring all their dates home
To syncopate and celebrate the U.K. Jive.
Swing your partner to the left, swing he back to the right.
Don't stand in the middle and act cool all night.
Everybody act a fool, jump around, lose your mind
Celebrate and typify the sign of the times.


Do that U.K. Jive
Do that U.K. Jive
U.K. O.K. U.K. O.K. gimme that U.K. Jive
(Repeat)
You gotta swing to the left, then back to the right
You gotta learn to swing both ways.
When you're jiving in the U.K. O.K. U.K.

Mum's all annoyed dad forgot the inflation
He blew all his wages by half past nine.
Now he's bought a gramophone on the never never
And the tally man's gotta have his money on time
But the kids are jumping round
And they're wearing out their leather
Driving all the neighbours out of their minds
Make a noise with boys and girls of the nation
That's the explanation of the U.K. Jive.

Blow in my ear, I like the way you do that.
And that's what I wanna hear.
Is that a fact?
Are you jiving me?
Oh, you bad pussy cat
You'll make papa mad.

Do that U.K. Jive
Do that U.K. Jive
U.K O.K. U.K. O.K.
Do that U.K. Jive
(Repeat)
