This time tomorrow
Where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere
Sailing across an empty sea


This time tomorrow
What will we know
Well we still be here
Watching an in-flight movie show

I'll leave the Sun behind me
And watch the clouds
As they sadly pass me by

Seven miles below me
I can see the world and it
Ain't so big at all

This time tomorrow
What will we see
Field full of houses
Endless rows of crowded streets

I don't know where I'm going
I don't want to see
I feel the world below me
Looking up at me

Leave the Sun behind me
And watch the clouds
As they sadly pass me by

And I'm in perpetual motion
And the world below
Doesn't matter much to me

This time tomorrow
Where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere
Sailing across any empty sea

This time tomorrow, this time tomorrow
