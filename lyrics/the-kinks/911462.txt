Close my eyes
Leave my body
Flying high
Across the universe
Looking down
Strange scenes below me
Can this be?
I am free


No camouflage
Magic carpet ride
Technicolor landscape
Where nobody cries
As I look around
Wondering who am I
Where is this place?
Another nightmare
No longer a dream
Nowhere is reality

I look around
Somebody calls me
Far away

Wondering who am I
Where is this place?
Another nightmare
No longer a dream
Nowhere is reality

Nightmare
No longer a dream
Nowhere is reality

Nightmare
