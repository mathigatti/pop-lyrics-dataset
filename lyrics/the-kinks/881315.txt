Well I met her accidentally,
In a little discotheque.
And she acted oh so friendly
To every fella that she met.
And her hair was hanging down,
Like a bright and silken sheen.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing night and day.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.


Although she looked so happy,
There was sadness in her eyes.
And her curly false eyelashes
Weren't much of a disguise.
And her bright and golden hair,
Was not all that it might seem.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dances sadly on.
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.
'Cause the only boy she had
Went and coolly stepped aside.
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Might as well have died.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.
