All the things you like to do,
Are not easy things to do.
Are you troubled by the bad things in your life?


If you're worrying 'bout a rest,
And you can't get it off your chest,
Just lie down and try to ease your mind.

If your mother comes 'round the bend,
Come to give you a helping hand,
Do you wish to go and bury your head in the sand?

Oh, do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be the one to understand?
Oh, do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be a man?
Oh, do you wish to be a man?

Well the misery is yours,
If you hide behind that door,
If you hide behind the troubles in your life.

You haven't got a friend,
And there's no one to take you in,
Will you come in, stretch and stand up on your own?

When you know that your time has come,
And there'll be no place to run,
There will be no time to bury your head in the sand.

So, do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be the one to understand?
Oh, do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be a man?
Oh, do you wish to be a man?

Do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be a man?
Oh, do you wish to be a man?
