I know a place, 
Not far away where the Sun always shines. 
You will be mine, 
And I'll love you. 


I know a place where the Sun always shines. 
You will be mine, 
And I'll love you. 

Church bells will chime, 
And they will know you are mine. 
All of the time, 
I will love you. 

Church bells will chime so they know you are mine. 
All of the time, 
I will love you. 

The finest moments in my life, 
Is when you say you'll be my wife. 

Church bells will chime, 
And they will know you are mine. 
All of the time, 
I will love you. 

Church bells will chime so they know you are mine. 
All of the time, 
I will love you. 

Yeah, I'm gonna love you. 
I'm gonna love you, 
I'm gonna love you.
