This is how it begins,
Open your heart and let the light shine through.
It's so easy to do,
Just close your eyes,
And feel the love arond you.
You've just got to believe,
What a waste of a life,
What a waste of our time.
Yes, in you I believe.
Oh we're gonna change the world.


Chorus
In you I believe,
In you I believe,
In you I believe,
Oh we're gonna change the world.

There's no way you can hide what's really inside,
And yes it's time we showed it,
Turn your face to the sky,
Open your mind,
And forever know that.
You were born free,
What a waste of a life,
What a waste of our time.
Yes, and you won't believe what a fool I've been.
Oh we're gonna change the world.

Chorus
In you I believe,
In you I believe,
In you I believe,
Oh we're gonna change the world.
