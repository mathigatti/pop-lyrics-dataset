Sitting by my stereo all alone
My baby calls me on the telephone
She says, Baby take me out for a dance
I tell my baby I feel so bad
I can't go out and it's making me sad
But when you see me, I know you will understand


I got hay fever, blocking up my head
Hay fever, I ought to be in bed
How can I dance when I can hardly breathe
Wish I could cure this infernal allergy
I got hay fever blocking up my brain
Hay fever, feel the sinus pains
And all the pills and the powders are in vain
Thought I was cured but here it comes again
It goes ooh-ah

The pollen count's getting higher and higher
My eyes are sore and my nose is on fire
My throat's dry now and I'm starting to perspire
My stuffed up head's killing all of my desire
I got hay fever, you wicked allergy
Hay fever, you put the curse on me
And I've inhaled every know remedy

I can't stay cool 'cos I'm starting to sneeze
I can't make love when I can't hardly breathe
We start to dance and my nose starts to bleed
There must be a cure for this hay fever
Is there a pill or a powder I can take
I must get a cure, my romance is at stake

Hay fever, you tore my image down
Hay fever, I must look like a clown
I must have used every tissue in town
I'm running round sniffin' like a hound
I go ooh-ah

I wanna kiss but I'm sneezin' instead
I can't make love when my head feels like lead
How can I pose when my nose is all red
We should be home, should be tucked up in bed
But I got hay fever
Hay Fever

Hay Fever
Hay Fever
Hay Fever
