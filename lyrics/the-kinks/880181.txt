Sitting in that small cafe
I caught your glance you took my breath away
We talked all night until the dawn
I held you close i knew my heart was lost


Away from you
Seems all i do is dream of you
The whole night through
Caressing you
My heart my soul i'm giving you
Forever and always

Can you wait until the day
When i am free and i can break these chains
We'll ride the seas we'll touch the stars
Time is the key now that we've come this far

Away from you
Seems all i do is dream of you
The whole night through
Caressing you
My heart my soul i'm giving you
Forever and always

Every moment you've been gone
I pray for strength to carry on
I see your picture on the wall
But you're not really there at all
I close my eyes and see you laying here with me

Away from you
Seems all i do is dream of you
The whole night through
Caressing you
My heart my soul i'm giving you
Forever and always

Away from you

Away from you
Seems all i do is dream of you
The whole night through
Caressing you
My heart my soul i'm giving you
Forever and always
