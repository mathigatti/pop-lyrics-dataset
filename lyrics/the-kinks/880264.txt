Growing up isn't easy to do,
Especially for one who always knew,
You would always come up second best.
Is that why you have such bitterness?


The apple of your father's eye,
And always by your brother's side.
Then a little sister came along,
And you found all the affection suddenly gone.

But underneath that cold exterior
I know you've got a heart of gold.
So aloof, so superior,
But you've got a heart of gold.

Watch out, don't get caught in the crossfire.
Watch out, she's still growing up, she's in a rage,
I guess she's reached that difficult age.

Growing up is very hard to do,
Everybody watching your every move.
Your private life always on view,
But jealously never really suited you.
But I know that

Underneath that rude exterior,
There's got to be a heart of gold.
Underneath that hard exterior,
Is a little girl waiting to be told,
You've got a heart of gold.
She's got a heart of gold.

I couldn't understand your attitude.
I only wanted to take a photograph of you,
But I was shocked when I heard what you had to say.
You picked up my camera, threw it away,
I didn't really mean to ruin your day.

Now I see you've got a little girl of your own.
Little princess suddenly grown,
And there's a man, he's smiling at you.
He must have been the one who always knew.
You had a heart of gold.

Underneath that rude exterior,
You've got a heart of gold.
So aloof, so superior,
But you've got a heart of gold.
Underneath that rude exterior,
You've got a heart of gold.
Underneath that hard exterior,
You've got a heart of gold.

Watch her, she'll give you a broadside,
But I know that inside,
She got a heart of gold.
