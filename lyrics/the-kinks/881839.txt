Ooh, you're a mirror,
And all those feelings inside you,
Oh they're not all your own,
Ooh, I see clearer,
All your thoughts are so close,
I can't make it on my own.


I see all you really are,
And it's not so very far,
No need to feel ashamed,
Together we'll rearrange,
A path of our own,
All that's true never dies,
In a world of our own,
Each child a star for his own.

Ooh, my love's getting stronger,
And though we are asleep,
My heart it will not wait,
Ooh, you feel so much closer to me now,
If I could reach out and touch you,
And hold you in my arms.

It's goodbye to yesterday,
No time to run away,
It's getting closer to the day,
And it's not so far away,
No need to run and hide,
Trust what you feel inside.

Chorus: Build a world of our own,
All that's true never dies,
Oh, in a world of our own,
Each child a star for his own,
Oh, in a world of our own,
All that's true will survive,
We'll make a world of our own.
