Just an ordinary fellow, anyone can see....
But I'm no ordinary fellow
When she kisses me............


When I'm with that girl of mine
Feel like a king of the world
Like to be the king of the whole wide world
Then I would give her all that I could

Don't know why I feel this way
Only know that I feel good
Like to be the king of the whole wide world
Then I could give her all that I should

Don't know why I feel this way, when she kisses me
I know why, I feel this way, when she kisses me.....

Don't know why I feel this way
Only know that I feel good
Like to be the king of the whole wide world
Then I could give her all that I should

Don't know why I feel this way, when she kisses me....
I know why, I feel this way, when she kisses me....

Don't know why I feel this way
Only know that I feel good
Like to be the king of the whole wide world
Then I could give her all that I should
Like to be the king of the whole wide world
Then I could give her all that I should
Like to be the king of the whole wide world
Then I could give her all that I should
