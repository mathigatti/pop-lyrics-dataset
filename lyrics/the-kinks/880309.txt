I see so little hope in you,
So much despair,
As I look in your eyes I wonder,
What thoughts linger there.
Life means nothing to you,
At least that's what they say,
But it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.


How were we to know what was going on inside your mind.
You never let it show what was going on behind
Those killer's eyes
Killer's eyes

You've seen your picture in the paper.
You're little sister's pinned it on the wall.
She thinks you're in some kind of movie.
Imagine her surprise when she saw you on the news.
Reporters came around and asked for interviews.
So little compassion, so icy cool.
They say you were a poor boy, you know that life can be cruel.
Hate builds up from childhood, your world was a slum
But you haven't got the right to blow it to kingdom come

How could we know what it was like inside a killer's mind
It never really showed, you kept the secret deep inside
Those killer's eyes
Killer's eyes

You say the world is full of bullshit,
So you kill just as you see fit.
They say that you're a fanatic with a mission.
We all go through hell in some kind of way,
Can you tell me what it's like to be there every day?
When you were young you had a vision
Why'd you go and do a thing like that?
And now we see you on the television.
Imagine our surprise when we saw you on the news,
And reporters came around and asked for interviews.

I see so little hope in you,
So much despair,
As I look in your eyes I wonder,
What thoughts linger there.
Life means nothing to you,
At least that's what they say,
But it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.

When you were just a child
You'd hide away when other children cried
But how were we to know
These tears that flowed were from a killer's eyes

I see so little hope in you,
So much despair,
As I look in your eyes I wonder,
What thoughts linger there.
Life means nothing to you,
At least that's what they say,
But it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.

Those killer's eyes
See the whites of their eyes
Those killer's eyes
See the whites of their eyes
