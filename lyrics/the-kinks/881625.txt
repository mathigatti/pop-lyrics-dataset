Now I know just what I've been doing wrong,
Life seems empty, but it won't last for long.
I shan't go on this way.
There's a new world just opening for me.


Been alive, but it could be lying down.
Just can't tell when the devil's on the prowl.
I can't pretend no more.
There's a new world just opening for me.
There's a new world just opening for me.

Win the battle, but the victory brings you pain.
You make confessions, but you do the same again.
I won't go on this way.
There's a new world just opening for me.
I won't go on this way.
There's a new world just opening for me.
