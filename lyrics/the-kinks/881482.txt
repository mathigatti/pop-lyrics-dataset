I've got a girl who's oh, so good,
She's got everything.
I've got a girl and she is mine,
She's got everything.


Pretty ringlets in her hair,
Pretty clothes that she can wear,
What's she got?
Everything,
Everything.

All other guys just stand and stare,
She's got everything.
I ain't got a dime but she don't care,
I got everything.

I don't need money 'cause I got
Everything that I could want,
What I've got?
Everything,
Everything.

I've got a girl who's oh, so good,
She's got everything.
She's got everything.
She's got everything.

And I can't live without her love,
And I can't live without her kisses.
She is mine forever, now,
She's got everything.
She's got everything.
She's got everything.
She's got everything.

I've got a girl who's oh, so good,
She's got everything.
I've got a girl who's oh, so fine,
She's got everything.
She's got everything.
