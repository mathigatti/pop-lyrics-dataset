Did you see his name in the local paper,
Stole a tin of beans,
From a cut-priced grocery store.
The judge said he must pay,
So he put him on probation,
And the paper gave his name.


Did you see his name in the criminal section,
And the center page.
Gave his name and his address,
They stopped him doing it again,
So they put him to dishonour,
And put the man to shame.

He lost his little job,
His employer was absolved of blame.
His world just crumbled down,
Incidently, did you see his name,
In the obiturary column,
Letters edged in black.
Life was much too hard to live,
So he brought it to an end,
In his gas-filled maisonette.
Because he couldn't stand the strain.

La-la-la-la-la
Life was much too hard to live,
So he brought it to an end,
In his gas-filled maisonette.
Because he couldn't stand the strain.

Did you see his name?
Did you see his name?
Did you see his name?
