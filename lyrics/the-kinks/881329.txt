Love gets you any way, any way it can.
Love gets you any way, any way it can.


Close my eyes and think of you, my love,
This space is full of you, my love,
Oh, hold me tight here in your arms tonight.

Love gets you any way that you want it,
Love gets you any way, it's true.
Love gets you any way that you want it,
Love gets you any way.

Good-bye lonely now my life's begun,
All the nights I used to sit alone.
Oh, promise me you'll need me always.

Love gets you any way that you want it,
Love gets you any way, it's true.
Love gets you any way that you want it,
Love gets you any way.

All I want's your love, keep telling me soft and clear,
There's no other one, love me for ever, dear.
[Ohoh, ohoh, ohoh]

Love gets you any way that you want it,
Love gets you any way, it's true.
Love gets you any way that you want it,
Love gets you any way, it's true.
Love gets you any way that you want it,
Any way it can.
Love gets you any way that you want it,
Any way it can.
Love gets you any way that you want it,
Love gets you any way, it's true.
