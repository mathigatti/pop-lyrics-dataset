While the rich get their kicks with their affluent antics
Mr. Black sits and ponders their fate.
He just sits in the gloom of his dimly-lit room
Waiting for them to swallow the bait.
While the rich run their rackets he sits in his attic
And casually clocks their defeat.
While the politicians cover up mistakes that they've made
And all the promises, the lies and deceits.
A military coup has been long overdue.
Now there's fighting and panic in the streets.
Amid the mass disillusion, disorder and confusion,
He will rise now his plan is complete.
But me, I'm only standing here
Watching it all go on and I'm watching it all go wrong
And it's painfully clear that the battle is near
And I wish I could just disappear.


While Flash and his men drink champagne in their den
And debase life with crude ostentation,
The poor cry for more, but they're reaching the point
Where the people can't stand any more.
But me, I'm only standing here
Watching it all go on, and I'm watching it all go wrong
And it's painfully clear that the battle is near
And I wish I could just disappear.
