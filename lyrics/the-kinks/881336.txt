I'll have some clam chowder, followed by beef steak on rye
Pumpkin pie, whipped cream and coffee,
I wanna green salad on the side,
Don't forget the french fries,
Pizza pie, garlic and anchovie.
I keep burning up calories as fast as I keep putting them down,
Eat food, put it in my mouth,
Chew it up, swallow it down,
I'll have two eggs, over light, home made apple pie
Cole slaw as a side order.
I gotta stay fit, stay alive, eat food to sustain a non-stop high-grade performer.
The pace is continual, sure keeps running me down
Don't you know that you gotta eat food,
Don't you know that you gotta refuel.
I'm a Maximum Consumption, super-grade performer.
High powered machine,
Go steady on my clutch, go easy on the hills
And you'll get a lot of mileage out of me.
I'm so easy to drive, and I'm an excellent ride,
Excessive living sure keeps running me down
You've got to learn to use the Maximum Juice
That's how you get the maximum use.
Life keeps using me, keeps on abusing me, mentally and physically.
I gotta stay fit, stay alive, need fuel inside, eat food to survive
Maximum Consumption sure keeps running me down
Don't you know that you gotta eat food
Don't you know that it's good for you.
I'm a Maximum Consumption,
Non-stop machine
Total automation perpetual motion.
