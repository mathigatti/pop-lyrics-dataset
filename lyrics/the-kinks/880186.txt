Well I don't want no bald headed woman
Gonna make me mean, yes, love, it make me mean
I don't want no bald headed woman
Gonna make me mean, yes, love, it make me mean


Well I don't want no sugar in my coffee
Gonna make me mean, yes, love, it make me mean
I don't want no sugar in my coffee
Gonna make me mean, oh, make me mean

Well I've been driving on bald headed mountain
I've done my time, done my time
I've been driving on a bald headed mountain
I've done my time, oh, done my time
Done my time, done my time, done my time

Well I don't want no sugar in my coffee
Gonna make me mean, yes, love, it make me mean
I don't want no sugar in my coffee
Gonna make me mean, oh, make me mean

I don't want no bald headed woman
Gonna make me mean, yes, love, it make me mean
