You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like it.
You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like it.


You make my world seem right,
You make my darkness bright, oh yes,
You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like it.
And I like it.

And I like the way you kiss me,
Don't know if I should.
But this feeling is love, and I know it,
That's why I feel good.

You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like it.
You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like it.

You make my world seem right,
You make my darkness bright, oh yes,
You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like it.
And I like it.
And I like it.
