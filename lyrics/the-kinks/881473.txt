As I sit by the sea
Drink tequila by the shade of a tree
There's a seniorita sat on my knee
Sprinkling sand all over me


I've got sand on my shoes
I've lost everything that I'm gonna lose
I've got nothing but the sun and the moon
And the sand that's on the beach

I am happy though my shoes are tattered and torn
Because the sea is so shiney
Ba ba-um-ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-um-ba

I've got sand on my shoes

Thought I was civilized
Till I saw the sea and I realized
That the city life was just not for me
Left my troubles behind me
Ba ba-um-ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-um-ba

I've got sand on my shoes
I've got nothing else that I'm gonna lose
I've got nothing but the sun and the moon
And that's plenty for me

I've got sand on my shoes
I've got sand on my shoes
I've got sand on my shoes
Sand on my shoes
Ba ba ba ba-um-ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-um-ba
