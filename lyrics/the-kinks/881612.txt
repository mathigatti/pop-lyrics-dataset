They stripped away my innocence and left me here to die
In this sad, cold realization, there are no more tears to cry
But I still believe in miracles, 'cause that's all I had before
And I ain't gonna take your promises no more


They stretched the Earth's resources and built a funeral pyre
Through the smoke the children wonder, 'neith the stark and shattered[?] sky
There is no hope or reason while the corporations roar[?]
Disregarding truth and sacred law

Can't you see we're living in the lie
I believed without a question why
Can't you see we're living in the lie
I believe, controlling all we think and see and do

We're living a lie
We're living a lie

They'll steal away your brightest dreams, just leaving hollow soles
To wander in this city's grime, without a hope or home
The devil plays is final hand, the battle now begins
But no one without true love will ever win

Can't you see we're living in the lie
I believed without a question why
Can't you see we're living in the lie
I believe, controlling all we think and see and do

Oh can't you see we're living in the lie
I believed without a question why
Oh can't you see we're living in the lie
I believe, controlling all we see and think and do

We're living a lie
We're living a lie
We're living a lie
