You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying


Well, help me, baby, get a message through
You leave my mouth wide open with the things that you do
First you say you love me, then you say that we're through
You know you're so mystifying, can't believe it's true

You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying

You know that every time I see you walking down the street
You got a mystifying wiggle from your head to your feet
You got a shock wave pulsating rhythm through my brain
You know you're so mystifying, you just ain't the same

You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying

You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying

Well, mystify me by the way that you walk
You even mystify me by the way you talk
Go from one day to the next if you'll be mine
Oh, little woman, you are so mystifying

You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying
