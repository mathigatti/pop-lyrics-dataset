Granny's always ravin' and rantin'
And she's always puffin' and pantin'
And she's always screaming and shouting
And she's always brewing up tea


Grandpappy's never late for his dinner
Cos he loves his leg of beef
And he washes it down with a brandy
And a fresh made pot of tea

Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea

If you feel a bit under the weather
If you feel a little bit peeved
Take granny's stand-by potion
For any old cough or wheeze
It's a cure for hepatitis, it's a cure for chronic insomnia
It's a cure for tonsillitis and for water on the knee

Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea

Tea in the morning, tea in the evening, tea at supper time
You get tea when it's raining, tea when it's snowing
Tea when the weather's fine
You get tea as a mid-day stimulant
You get tea with your afternoon tea
For any old ailment or disease
For Christ sake have a cuppa tea

Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea

Whatever the situation, whatever the race or creed
Tea knows no segregation, no class nor pedigree
It knows no motivations, no sect or organisation
It knows no one religion
Nor political belief

Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea
