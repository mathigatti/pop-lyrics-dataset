I miss the soft cold touch of your skin
In the night when
I see your picture smashed to the ground
But my heart begins to pound


I've got your number but you're never at home
I leave a message, please telephone
It's so sad that you're not around
It's bringing me down

In the where we would meet
In a crowd where there's no one around
It's such a sin, this mood I'm in
Now that we got

I bet you're burning up on the town
With every jerk and every clown
I walk the streets, hear your voice in my head
I an empty bed

I've got your number but you're never at home
I leave a message, please telephone
It's so sad that you're not around
It's bringing me down

I know my news leave a lot to be desired
But I thought that we had it made
But I guess that I'm not so smart
You're breakin' my heart

I've got your number but you're never at home
I leave a message, please telephone
It's so sad that you're not around
It's bringing me down

Guess I'll pack up and leave this town
With all its memories of you
There's a New York City
I'll get by without you

I miss the soft cold touch of your skin
...
