I think I'm sophisticated 
'Cos I'm living my life like a good homosapien 
But all around me everybody's multiplying 
Till they're walking round like flies man 
So I'm no better than the animals sitting in their cages 
in the zoo man 
'Cos compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees 
I am an ape man 
I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized 
'Cos I'm a strict vegetarian 
But with the over-population and inflation and starvation 
And the crazy politicians 
I don't feel safe in this world no more 
I don't want to die in a nuclear war 
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an ape man 
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man 
I'm an ape man I'm a King Kong man I'm ape ape man 
I'm an ape man 
'Cos compared to the sun that sits in the sky 
compared to the clouds as they roll by 
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies 
I am an ape man 
In man's evolution he has created the cities and 
the motor traffic rumble, but give me half a chance 
and I'd be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle 
'Cos the only time that I feel at ease 
Is swinging up and down in a coconut tree 
Oh what a life of luxury to be like an ape man 
I'm an ape, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man 
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man 
I'm an ape man 
I look out my window, but I can't see the sky 
'Cos the air pollution is fogging up my eyes 
I want to get out of this city alive 
And make like an ape man 
Come and love me, be my ape man girl 
And we will be so happy in my ape man world 
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man 
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man 
I'm an ape man 
I'll be your Tarzan, you'll be my Jane 
I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane 
and we'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day 
Just like an ape man 
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man 
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man 
I'm an ape man. 
I don't feel safe in this world no more 
I don't want to die in a nuclear war 
I want to sail away to a distant shore 
And make like an ape man.
