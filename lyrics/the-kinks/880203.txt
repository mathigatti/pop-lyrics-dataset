One time I saw you in the street
Thought that I would be that kind you want
Ooh babe, you're the best of them all


I'm trying to tell you how much I love you
Oh baby, please let me climb your wall
Ooh baby, you're the best of them all

Then in the dawn I'll be leavin'
Ooh babe, that's the strength of it all

Come on over, and see
And let me crawl around on your floor
Ooh babe, that's the strength of it all

I'm trying to tell you how much I love you
Oh baby, let me climb your wall
Ooh baby, that's the strength of it all

I see that I lied, neglected you badly
'Cause you are that one light that's me blind

All alone I've tried to see
Then you agree, let me climb your wall
Ooh baby, you're the best of them all

C'mon sweety, come over here
Let me please, let me climb your wall
That's the strength of it all

I'm trying to tell you how much I love you
Oh baby, let me climb your wall
Ooh baby, you're the best of them all
