Look a little on the sunny side
Even when they say you're on the slide,
And for a while they'll say your records never make it,
But in a while they're gonna be showering you with praises.
They'll give you mediocre reviews
And put you in the underground for a while,
But look a little on the funny, sunny side of life,
Look a little on the sunny side.


You sing 'em the blues
And then they ask for a happy tune,
And when you start to smile they'll say gimme dat rhythm and blues,
And when you give 'em dat rhythm and blues they'll simply smile and say
We didn't want to hear you play,
We didn't like you any way.
It's very hard to please the people every single time,
But look a little on the sunny side.

Look a little on the sunny side
Even when you feel you want to hide,
You gotta laugh, don't let your critics ever upset you,
'Cos for a while the cynics will all be out to get you.
You gotta be shrewd, you gotta be strong
You've gotta convince yourself that you are not wrong,
Whistle a tune and think of a catchy, happy, little song
And look a little on the sunny side.

It's very hard to please the people every single time,
But look a little on the sunny side.

They're gonna put you down for a while
You've got to learn to grit your teeth and smile
And look a little on the funny, sunny side of life,
Look a little on the sunny side.
