Why I love you though you treat me bad.
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
Oh the mirror of love and you look alright,
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
You're such a cool lover,
But you're such a cruel lover,
Treat me like I'm a fool,
I hate you but you know I would kill for you.
You're a mean and obscene lover,
But I would have no other,
Even though you treat me bad,
You were the best man I ever had,
'Cos through the mirror of love, mirror of love,
When I see you through the mirror of love,
You're alright and I forget that you're bad,
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.


Why I love you though you treat me bad,
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
The mirror of love you sure look alright.
I see your reflection when I'm looking through the mirror of love.
You're a crude and a rude lover,
But I would have no other,
You slap me down, treat me bad,
You're a two-timing swine and you drive me mad.
You're a mean and obscene lover,
But you are my dream lover,
'Cos even though you treat me bad,
You were the best man I ever had,
'Cos through the mirror of love, mirror of love,
I see your reflection in the mirror of love.
And you're alright though you treat me bad.
When I see you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
Oh the mirror of love, sure look alright
'Cos when I see you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
