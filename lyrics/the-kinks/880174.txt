Sunday afternoon there's something special
It's just like another world
Jogging in the park is my excuse
To look at all the little girls


I'm not a flasher in a rain coat
I'm not a dirty old man
I'm not gonna snatch you from your mother
I'm an art lover
Come to daddy
Ah, come to daddy
Come to daddy

Pretty little legs, I want to draw them
Like a degas ballerina
Pure white skin, like porcelain
She's a work of art and I should know
I'm an art lover
Come to daddy
And I'll give you some spangles

Little girl don't notice me
Watching as she innocently plays
She can't see me staring at her
Because I'm always wearing shades
She feeds the ducks, looks at the flowers
I follow her around for hours and hours
I'd take her home, but that could never be
She's just a substitute
For what's been taken from me
Ah, come to daddy, come on

Sunday afternoon can't last forever
Wish I could take you home
So, come on, give us a smile
Before you vanish out of view
I've learned to appreciate you
The way art lovers do
And I only want to look at you
