Today as I'm sifting through these photographs of you
Never thought I'd feel this way
All these memories keep calling me to you
How I wish they'd go away
All these visions just remind me of better days


And I miss you most of all
When I see Flowers in the Rain

I see you laughing as we run across the fields
Through the thunder and the rain
Finding shelter in each other's arms that day
All the things I didn't say
All these words keep going round and round in my brain

And I miss you most of all
When I see Flowers in the Rain

Wish I could do something about it
Life can be cruel, no doubt about it
In life's many mysteries
It just wasn't meant to be, oh no

I miss you most of all
When I see Flowers in the Rain

As I'm sifting through these photographs of you
Life will never be the same
All these memories keep calling me to you
And it seems so long ago
And in my heart I'll always know

That I'll miss you most of all
When I see Flowers in the Rain

Wish I could do something about it
Life can be cruel, no doubt about it
In life's many mysteries
It just wasn't meant to be, oh no

I miss you most of all
When I see Flowers in the Rain
