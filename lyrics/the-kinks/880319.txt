A friend of mine just had a real bad time
You see, his life was shattered and he lost his mind
His girl ran off along with his best friend
And through emotional stress he brought his life to an end
It was such a tragedy
But that's the way it's got to be
Life goes on


Life goes on
It happens ev'ry day
So appreciate what you got
Before it's taken away
Life will hit you
When you're unprepared
So be grateful and take all
That you can while you're there
Get that frown off your head
'Cause you're a long time dead
Life goes on and on and on
Life goes on and on and on

No use runnin' 'round lookin' scared
Life could get you when you're unaware
One day it's gonna come, so you better accept it
Life will hit you when you least expect it
And one day when you are gone
You know that life will still go on
But no one'll care if you've been good, bad, right or wrong
Life will still go on

My bank went broke and my well ran dry
It was almost enough to contemplate suicide
I turned on the gas, but I soon realized
I hadn't settled my bill so they cut off my supply
No matter how I try, it seems I'm too young to die
Life goes on and on and on
Life goes on and on and on

Tornado, cyclone and hurricane
Can batter the houses with the thunder and rain
Blizzards can blow; the waves hit the shore
But the people recover and come back for more
Somehow the people fight back, even the future looks black
Life goes on and on and on
Life goes on and on and on
