Are you loving him just the way,
That I loved you when you walked away?
Whoa, I'm crying, crying.


Do you need him just the way,
That I needed you when you left that day?
Whoa, I'm crying, crying.
Crying, crying.

Do you think that he's so glad,
Do you think he loves you so?
Do you think that he'd be mad,
If you never come on home?

I'm crying, crying, crying.

Now my days are spent in sin,
Now that you are loving him.
Whoa, I'm crying, crying.

If you suddenly realize,
That he's not the one to spend your life with,
Whoa, I'm crying, crying.
Crying, crying.
