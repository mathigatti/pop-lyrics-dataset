I'm a drifter who has lost his way
And I'm still searching for my dream
A wandering nomad with no home to stay
Just like a gypsy or a refugee
Lookin' at another sign for another town
Wondering if I'm ever gonna settle down
Or am I gonna keep on searchin' till my dying day


Chorus:
Still searching, still searching, still lookin', all alone
Till I find myself a home
Still searching, still searching, just like a rolling stone
Destination still unknown
When all my energy starts letting me down
I get this feeling I'll be still wandering 'round
Still searching, still workin', still lookin'
Until I find a way

This world is full of restless souls
Sleeping rough and living day to day
Drifters who left families wondering why they went away
Perhaps that's how I wanna be
While I'm looking for some peace of mind
How can I find security?
A restless spirit who can't reach his goal
Can't find a home until I've found my soul
Still hitchin' rides and lookin' for a place to go

Chorus

Still searching, still searching, still searching
Until my dying day, oh yeah
Why? yeah
Surprise, surprise
Still searching, still workin', still lookin'
Until I find my way
I'm a drifter who has lost his way
And I'm still searching for my dream
