It's emptiness for me
Since you stepped right out of my life
Without a kiss or a sigh
You just left me alone in my emptiness
Just one more kiss, cause I know
That I can't live without you


It's emptiness for me
Now you're gone, and there's nothing left
It mustn't show, but I know
And I'm feeling sad in my emptiness
Just one more kiss, cause I know
That I can't live without you

I wonder who's world you are steppin' into now....
I wonder how long it will last
If you really love him, if you really love him

It's emptiness for me
Since you stepped right out of my life
Without a kiss or a sigh
You just left me alone in my emptiness
Just one more kiss, cause I know
That I can't live without you

I wonder who's world you are steppin' into now....
I wonder how long it will last
If you really love him, if you really love him

It's emptiness for me
Now you're gone, and there's nothing left
It mustn't show, but I know
And I'm feeling sad in my emptiness
Just one more kiss, cause I know
That I can't live without you

Without you, it's emptiness for me
