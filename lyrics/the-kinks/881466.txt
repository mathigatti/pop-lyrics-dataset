Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself.


Life on earth is so bizarre,
We must find a way to fulfill,
What we really are,
Yes it's true,
I love you,
And there's nothing you do that's wrong,
Find values of your own.

Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
On the living room floor,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Till there isn't anymore.

Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
For there are places even you don't know.
Reveal yourself,
For life is nothing but a movie show,
Or free yourself,
Your heart,
Your mind,
Your soul,
Your sanity,
Just got to see it,
Smell it,
Know that it's reality.

Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Doesn't matter anymore,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Till there isn't anymore.

There are no rules where life is concerned,
Our past must be burned,
For there's nothing we have learned,
And it's true,
I believe that we must all be free,
Immortal you and me.

Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
On the living room floor,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Till there isn't anymore,

Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
And maybe you'll go down in history.
Oh, how much longer must your life remain a mystery,
It doesn't matter if you're thick and fat or thin and long,
You must find out exactly where it is that you belong.
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Doesn't matter anymore,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
On the living room floor,

Reveal yourself,
For there are places even you don't know,
Reveal yourself,
For life is nothing but a movie show,
Reveal yourself,
Your heart,
Your mind,
Your soul,
Your sanity,
Just got to see it,
Smell it,
Know that's it's reality,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
Reveal yourself,
It doesn't matter if the world thinks you're right or wrong,
Reveal yourself.
