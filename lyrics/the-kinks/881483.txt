Never thought that this would happen to you and me
Guess I'll just have to see it through


Every single dress you wear
Never really fits around
A little child with bright brown hair
She always laughs and never really cares

She's My Girl
She's My Girl
She's My Girl
She's My Girl, and I'll meet her all the way
in line she spends her time
A colorful but simple mind
She gets her kicks when
But baby when you ball about it worries me

She's My Girl
She's My Girl
She's My Girl
She's My Girl, and I'll meet her all the way

I never thought that this would happen to you
Guess I'll just have to see it through

She crawls around the floor each night
Staggering but keeping quiet
I've got to have her while I can

She's My Girl
She's My Girl
She's My Girl
She's My Girl, and I'll meet her all the way

She's My Girl
She's My Girl
She's My Girl
She's My Girl
