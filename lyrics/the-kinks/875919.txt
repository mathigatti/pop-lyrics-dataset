Tea time won't be the same without my Donna 
At night I lie awake and dream of Donna 
I think about that small cafe 
That's where we used to meet each day 
And then we used to sit a while 
And drink our afternoon tea 


I'll take afternoon tea (afternoon tea) 
If you take it with me (afternoon tea) 
You take as long as you like 
'Cause I like you, girl 

I take sugar with tea (afternoon tea) 
You take milk if you please (afternoon tea) 
Like you talking to me 
Because you ease my mind 

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea) 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea) 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea) 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea) 

Tea time still ain't the same without my Donna 
At night I lie awake and dream of Donna 
I went to our cafe one day 
They said that Donna walked away 
You'd think at least she might have stayed 
To drink her afternoon tea 

I'll take afternoon tea (afternoon tea) 
If you take it with me (afternoon tea) 
You take as long as you like 
'Cause I like you, girl 

I take afternoon tea (afternoon tea) 
Every day of the week (afternoon tea) 
Please come along if you like 
Because I like you, girl 

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea) 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)
