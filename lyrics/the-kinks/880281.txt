I don't wanna get left behind 
Gonna love my baby all the time 
If I don't wanna get left alone 
I gotta move on down my baby's home 
And if my baby isn't there 
I'm gonna fill my gap and comb my hair 
Gotta move, gotta move 
Gotta move, gotta move 


All my life I've had to move 
Always failed to stay in school 
As I move down this very long road 
Sometimes I wished I'd stayed at home 
Where I'm going no one knows 
Only know I gotta go 
You gotta move, gotta move 
Gotta move, gotta move 

I don't wanna get left behind 
Gonna love my baby all the time 
If I don't wanna get left alone 
I gotta move on down my baby's home 
And if baby isn't there 
I'm gonna brush my boots and comb my hair 
I gotta move, gotta move 
I gotta move, gotta move
