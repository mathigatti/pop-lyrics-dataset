I've been sacrificed in the name of the company,
I've been victimized for the sake of economy.
I had a big house, a big car,
Expense account and credit cards,
But now look what they've done to me.


They're making massive reductions,
It's all mass production and assembly lines.
They're making massive reductions,
Massive reductions.

They're laying me off all because of inflation,
I'm losing my job and my reputation.
Good-bye my big house, my big car.
Now it's all up to welfare,
I hear that everybody's going there.

They're making massive reductions,
Massive reductions to stay alive.
Whoa, they're making massive reductions.

Good-bye my big house, my big car,
Now it's all up to welfare,
I hear that everybody's going there.

They're making massive reductions,
Massive reductions to stay alive.
Whoa, they're making massive reductions.
