Hey! Uh, uh, uh... (2x)

What I like about you,
You hold me tight.
Tell me I'm the only one 
wanna come over tonight, yeah...


Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things I wanna hear
Cuz it's true 
that's what I like about you

What I like about you,
You really know how to dance
When you go up, 
down jump around
Talk about true romance, yeah...

Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things I wanna hear
Cuz it's true 
that's what I like about you (3x)

HEY!

What I like about you,
You give me 1 out of 9.
Never wanna let you go
You know you make me feel alright

Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things I wanna hear
Cuz it's true 
that's what I like about you
that's what I like about you
that's what I like about you
