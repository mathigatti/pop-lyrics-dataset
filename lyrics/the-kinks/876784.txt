I wanna know what is to be
To see what life's cut out for me
I'm waiting for my fate
'Cause I know I've done wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me


I wish I had a crystal ball
To see my rise and see my fall
I've done a lot of right,
But also done some wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And so I'll wait a while
And wait a little longer
I'll just have to wait and see

I think a lot but I'll stop trying
I'll just get old before my time
I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me
I wanna know just what's in store for me
