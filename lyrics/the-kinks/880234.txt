I'm the elevator man,
I take people up and down all day,
Some get out others stay,
Some get off some go all the way.
I'm the eklevator man,
I see lots of different faces,
I see losers going nowhere,
I see winners going places.
I take 'em up and I bring 'em down


Everybody goes up and everybody comes down
Everydody goes up and everybody comes down

Dirty old man with wanderinr eyes,
Lookin' at bums and tits and thighs.
Macho man with rub on tan,
He's the man with wandering hands.
People with dandruff, spots and pimples,
People with warts and scars and dimples,
They push by don't give a damn,
I'm just the elevator man.

I see them go up and I see 'em come down.

Everybody goes up but everybody comes down,
Everybody goes up but everybody comes down.

I see the timid and the insecure,
I see the confident and self assured,
They all get out when they reach their floor,
But I always know I'm gonna see them once more.

'Cos Everybody goes up and everybody goes down,
Everybody goes up but everybody comes down,
Everybody goes up and everybody comes down,
Everybody goes up.

Yeah

I'm the elevator man,
Lots of people pass me by,
No one thinks I give a damn,
I'm just the elevator man,
I hear confessions, watch expressions,
Silent madness and depression.
I hear rumours, conversations, little facts and relevations.
'Cos what goes up, gotta come down

Everybody goes up and everybody comes down,
Everybody goes up but everybody comes down.

Everybody goes up and everybody comes down,
Everybody goes up and everybody comes down


Everybody goes up and everybody comes down
Everybody goes up

Yeah
