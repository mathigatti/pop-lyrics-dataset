What can I do?
How can I show you,
And let you see,
That I am someone,
That you want me to be.


I'm only me,
Not someone better,
Not someone good.
I'd be a soldier,
That's if I only could.

If I were king,
I'd tell my army,
To change the world.
Then I'd be someone,
Like you want me to be.

In my little life,
I know that the world must keep on turning,
Even though it leaves me far behind.
Life is like a school,
But I'm not prepared to keep on learning,
Even though it treats me like a fool.

This is our lot,
To live together,
Not live apart.
Let's stay together,
Until death us do part.

Not just a day,
But till forever,
Just as the stars,
Just as the ending,
Until death us do part.
