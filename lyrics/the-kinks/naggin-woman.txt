You know you keep on naggin' babe
Complaining all men are the same
The reason you keep on naggin'
Is because you found another man


Well keep on naggin' woman
Naggingest woman in this land
Well, the minute you stop your naggin'
You're gonna find another man

You know you got me to the play of the pain (?)
Oh honey, you can treat me just mean
You got me anywhere anyone
You baby just can't be beat

So stop your naggin' woman
Nagging me right off my face
Well baby if you weren't naggin'
Honey you'd be so sweet

You know you keep on naggin' babe
Complaining all men are the same
The reason you keep on naggin'
Is because you want another man

But keep on naggin' woman
Naggingest woman in this land
Well, the minute you stop your naggin'
Baby, you're gonna find another man
All right, for sure
