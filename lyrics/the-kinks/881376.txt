I can see
Oh what a day it's gonna be
There'll never be another like it
As far as I can see


'Cause the world's gonna know
When they see our good times grow
Oh yes, today, girl
Oh what a day it's gonna be

'Cause I can hear
The birds are singing
It seems a better life beginning
And all the mist will clear

'Cause the sun is gonna shine
And keep shining all the time
Oh yes, today, girl
Oh what a day it's gonna be

I can see
Oh what a day it's gonna be
It seems the very air I'm breathing
Is bringing you to me

And then when our days are few
We'll remember things we're doing
Yes, today, girl
Oh what a day it's gonna be
