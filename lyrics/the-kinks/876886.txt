Running to and fro, hard working at the mill,
Never failed at the mill, there come a rotten bill.
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business for me to be involved with you.


Salesman talkin to me 
tryin to run me up a creek,
Says you can buy it, go on try it, you can pay me next week.
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business for me to be involved with you.

Blonde hair, good-looking, trying to get into get me married
Get a home, settle down by the book.
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved with you.

Same thing every day, getting up, going to school,
No need for me complaining, my objections overruled.
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business for me to be involved with you.
Oh!

Pay-phone, somethings wrong, dime gone, will mail,
Oughta sue the operator for telling me a tale.
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business for me to be involved with you.

Been to Yokohama, baby, fighting in the war,
Army bunk, army chow, army clothes, army car.
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business for me to be involved with you.

Working in the filling station, too many checks,
Wipe the windows, check the oil, check the tires, dollar gas?
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved with you.
