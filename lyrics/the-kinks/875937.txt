I won't take all that they hand me down, 
And make out a smile, though I wear a frown, 
And I won't take it all lying down, 
'Cause once I get started I go to town. 


'Cause I'm not like everybody else, 
I'm not like everybody else, 
I'm not like everybody else, 
I'm not like everybody else. 

And I don't want to ball about like everybody else, 
And I don't want to live my life like everybody else, 
And I won't say that I feel fine like everybody else, 
'Cause I'm not like everybody else, 
I'm not like everybody else. 

But darling, you know that I love you true, 
Do anything that you want me to, 
Confess all my sins like you want me to, 
There's one thing that I will say to you, 
I'm not like everybody else, 
I'm not like everybody else. 

I'm not like everybody else, 
I'm not like everybody else 
And I don't want to ball about like everybody else, 
And I don't want to live my life like everybody else, 
And I won't say that I feel fine like everybody else, 
'Cause I'm not like everybody else, 
I'm not like everybody else. 

Like everybody else, 
Like everybody else, 
Like everybody else, 
Like everybody else. 

If you all want me to settle down, 
Slow up and stop all my running 'round, 
Do everything like you want me to, 
There's one thing that I will say to you, 
I'm not like everybody else, 
I'm not like everybody else. 

I'm not like everybody else, 
I'm not like everybody else. 
And I don't want to ball about like everybody else, 
And I don't want to live my life like everybody else, 
And I won't say that I feel fine like everybody else, 
'Cause I'm not like everybody else, 
I'm not like everybody else. 

Like everybody else (like everybody else), 
Like everybody else (like everybody else), 
Like everybody else (like everybody else), 
Like everybody else.
