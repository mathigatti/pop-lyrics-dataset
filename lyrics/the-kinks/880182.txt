Babies being born every day 
In a world where there's so much to discover 
All the babies crying out from the womb 
Not much room, can I come out mother? 


Mama, can you hear me call? 
Don't drop me now 
'Cos it's a long way to fall 
Mama, I can hear all the sounds 
Outside it's like a battleground 
And I'm afraid to fall down 
Into the great big nowhere 
Papa's had a skin full of beer 
Mama, don't let him into here 
Baby, baby 

Babies being born 
Different hormones and genes 
There's so many of us out there 
How was I conceived 
Was it love, was I meant 
Or was I just an accident 

Mama, what I sense from outside 
It's a world full of fear 
And there's nowhere to hide 
Mama, I feel safe between these walls 
And I'm so scared of heights 
And it's a long way to fall 
Into the great big nowhere 
Maybe Papa's getting pressure from his peers 
Are you straight, are you queer 
So he made me, baby 

Babies being born, some are rich, some are poor 
But they're innocent and unprepared 
Little girls and boys, didn't ask to be born 
But they're always popping out there 
falling into the great big nowhere 

Mama, I know that once upon a time 
You and Papa were rich 
When you were both in your prime 
Mama, now you got the pains 
And I know it's nearly time 
But I don't want to join the crowd 
I see standing in line 
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 

Babies being induced, no excuse, what's the use 
So they're always popping out there 
Babies didn't wanna be born 
Ill equipped, running loose 
But they're innocent and unprepared 

Mama, now you are showing all the signs 
But is your world upside-down 
On its head just like mine 
Mama, now your ambition is mine 
Don't make me over 
Achieve too much in my time 
Oh Mama, please don't make me climb 
Mama
