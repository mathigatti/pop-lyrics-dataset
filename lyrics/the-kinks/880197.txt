Time's running out just as fast as it can
She's leaving me cold
I don't understand
Hearts beating hard on the edge of the floor
Gotta kill this pain 'cause I can't take no more


Bright Lights on a cold night
If it feels good then it's alright

Thinking about when we first met
All these memories kill me
Get them out of my head
The flashing lights of the cities roar
Make my mind a blurr
Who's knocking on the door
Nothing's for keeps
Can't get no sleep
My future is late
Guess I'll find it next week

Bright Lights on a cold night
If it feels good then it's alright
She's caught up in the spotlight

See her up there in a New York fashion show
See the freedom in her eyes
Could've chose a better time
For it all to go wrong

Another night and my life is my own
But it scares me half to death
Out in the bars in the village with friends
You can buy me a drink
But please don't mention her name

Bright Lights on a cold night
She's up there in the spotlight
Now it's over and it's goodnight

Bright Lights (x 3)

See her up there in a New York fashion show
See the freedom in her eyes
Could've chose a better time
For it all to go wrong

Bright Lights on a cold night
If it feels good then it's alright

Bright Lights (x 2)
