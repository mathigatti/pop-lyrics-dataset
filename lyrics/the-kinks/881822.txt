When a solution comes,
It's gonna breathe right down on everyone.
When a solution comes
It's gonna cover up the clouds
And eclipse the sun
And black out a pale blue sky,
And everybody's gonna be terrified,
Because they're all going to feel the bite
And there's going to be a revolution
When a solution comes.
It won't take sides with anyone
Regardless of race or creed,
The whole wide world is gonna feel the squeeze.
The red, black, yellow and white
And even the Arabs and the Israelites
They're all going to feel the bite
And there's going to be a revolution.
I've been searching a long, long time,
Looking for a final solution
Searching here, searching there,
Searching everywhere.
Now my day has finally come
It's time to shout to everyone
I have waited a long, long time,
Biding my time and waiting on the sidelines
Watching it all go wrong.
Witnessing the disintegration,
Rubbing my hands in anticipation.
Everybody's searching so desperately,
They've got to run to someone
And that someone's going to be me.
Yeah, I'm gonna change the world,
I'm going to use a little manipulation.
I'm going to build a new civilisation.
