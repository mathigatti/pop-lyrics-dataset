If you run out of luck don't give in to hate
Just find a new direction before it's too late
If you hear them knocking on my door
Just say that I'm not here I can't take it any more
Well I'm leaving town and I won't be 'round
'Til I reach my destination, tell the world I'm underground
And it won't be long now that I've found love
Gonna search the whole world over find a place where I belong


Let me be, let me be for I'm innocent
Can't you see all the good that's inside of me
Let me be, let me be oh I'm innocent, let me go

Gonna walk my walk, talk my talk
Don't need no-one's approval, gonna make it on my own
Gonna have my say, gonna fly away
I'll beat this beurocratic nightmare and social decay, oh yeah
I've found out yeah, I found love
Gonna stick to my dreams, gonna blow this world away

Let me be, let me be for I'm innocent
Can't you see all the good that's inside of me
Let me be, let me be for I'm innocent, let me go

Let me be, let me be for I'm innocent
Can't you see all these feelings inside of me
Let me be, let me be for I'm innocent, let me go

Nobody cares, nobody hears
Living in a vacuum, is anybody there?
Someway, somehow just got to survive
They'll never get my soul, they'll never take me alive

Let me be, let me be for I'm innocent
Can't you see all these feelings inside of me
Let me be, let me be for I'm innocent, let me go

Let me be, let me be for I'm innocent
Can't you see all the good that's inside of me
Let me be, let me be for I'm innocent, I don't know
