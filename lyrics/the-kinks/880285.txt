I'll remember everything you said to me.
I'll remember everything we did.
I'll remember best of all,
The love we shared, the tears that fell now.
I'll remember everything you said to me.


I'll remember every word you said to me.
I'll remember every laugh you made.
I'll remember best of all,
The love we shared, the tears that fell now.
I'll remember everything you said to me.

Thinking 'bout it now, just what might have been.
Thinking 'bout it now, things will never be the same,
But I'll remember everything you said to me.

I'll remember best of all,
The love we shared, the tears that fell now.
I'll remember everything you said to me.
I'll remember everything you said to me.
