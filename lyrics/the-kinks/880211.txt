Ooh, I wrote you a letter,
And you never sent a reply.
It's a shame, always money or power,
And it doesn't really matter what you think.


Oh, I'd give you all I had to give,
Over and over again.
While the government hides its head in the sand,
We live in a danger zone.

We're living in a danger zone.
You're living in the twilight zone.
Watch out, fall out, gonna get ya, check it out.

All the sad politicians
Hold the world in the palm of their hands.
It's a lie, just an old film on the late show,
In the end everybody dies.

Ooh, I'll give you all I have to give,
Over and over again.
Oh, when will we get it into our heads?
We live in a danger zone.

We're living in a danger zone.
You're living in the twilight zone.
Watch out, fall out, gonna get ya, check it out.

We're living in a danger zone,
You're living in the twilight zone.
What's wrong with solar power? (No profit)
Money money money makes me sick,
You can't get enough of it, of it.
We're living in a danger zone,
You're living in the twilight zone.
