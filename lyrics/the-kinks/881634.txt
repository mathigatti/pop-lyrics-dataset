In the back of a record rack
There's a old double pack
Twelve inches and black
With an old crumpled cover
But every track is stacked


And it takes me back
To the one who caused this melancholy mood
And every single groove
Cuts me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone

I took her back to my bachelor flat
While the stereo played for two
She unwrapped her gift
And played me a riff
And said, "this old record was just made for you"

Then we danced to songs of passion and
The singer's velvet tones
On the gramaphone
While the record played
She rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone

Those those rock n' roll romantic songs
Played all summer long
And she rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone.

Yeah, she rocks me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone

In dreams she's smiling in slow motion
Devouring all of my emotion
Angels singing rock 'n' roll
While demons take away my soul

Voices sound, her image fades
Every time that record plays
She rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone

In my back room there's an old 45
That we played all summer long
Shakin the beams so loud it covered up the screams
When lover's harmony went oh so wrong

And in every word emotion is torn
And blood flows down the drain
Like she opened up a vein
And cut me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone

And now i'm just a prisoner
In that stereo Hi-Fi jail
The needle pierced just like a nail
As she rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone

Do do do do do do do
She rocks me to the bone

Yeah, she rocks me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone
