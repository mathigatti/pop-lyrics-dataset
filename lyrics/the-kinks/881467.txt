Shout out, ring the bells
Shout out, tell the world I'm in love
Ring out, I feel fine
This girl said she's mine
So let the bells ring loud and clear
Let the whole know I'm in love


Ring out, I feel fine
This girl said she's mine
So let the bells ring loud and clear

Can you hear those bells are ringing
Everywhere I hear them singing
Hear them, hear them, hear them

Shout out, ring the bells
Shout out, tell the world I'm in love
Ring out, I feel fine
This girl said she's mine
So let the bells ring loud and clear
Bells ring loud and clear
