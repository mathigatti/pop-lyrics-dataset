Everytime we meet
My heart skips a beat
Seems we're Perfect Strangers


I can't understand
What's inside of man
That makes us Perfect Strangers

Through all this time so lonely
All the people with nobody
With lifes misunderstanding
Feel I've known you all my life
There's something quite familiar in your eyes
A soul is calling
Do you ever wonder why?

Everytime we meet
A sympathetic beat
In the heart of strangers
Here the love it calls
But you don't know me at all
Seems we're Perfect Strangers
Just like Perfect Strangers

Ever looked up to the sky
On a night so melancholy
See the angry world around you
Really need someone to talk to
Doesn't mind you feel so crazy
Where's the understanding stranger
Or the understanding lover

I know there'll come a day
When peace will touch the heart of you
Until then I will say

Open up your eyes
You're not hypnotised
We're not really strangers
You don't understand
That in the heart of love
There's no Perfect Strangers
Everytime we meet
A sympathetic beat
In the heart of strangers

Repeats...
