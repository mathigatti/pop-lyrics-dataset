They said this was the last dance
The lights went dim as I looked round the floor
Then I saw you standing there
Then I walked up to you and I asked for this dance


The band had started to play
I held you hand and I sighed
Is this the start of another heart breaker
Or something better beginning
Something better beginning
Something better beginning

I never thought I'd love like this until I met you
I found something I thought I'd never had
The only time I feel all right is when I'm with you
I wonder how long it will last

I walked you home in the night
The moon shone bright as we walked hand in hand
I've known this joy once before
But it came to an end just as it had began

Each step that I took with you
Brought one thing closer to my mind
Is this the start of another heart breaker
Or something better beginning
Something better beginning
Something better beginning
