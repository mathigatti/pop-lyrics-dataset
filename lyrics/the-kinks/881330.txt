Did you ever stop and think about
All the things we should have done
It makes me feel so sad
Looking back, what's done is done
If you can find a place to run
The future's in our hands


Love in the world
Love in the world
Every night, every day
We want love in the world
Trust it girl

Feel the suffering each night
Even in the darkest night
turn away
Faces etched with bitterness
Lives destroyed by evil men
Believe me you will have your day

Love in the world
Love in the world
Any how, any day
We want love in the world
Love in the world

Crying out disparing voices
empty choices
show us anyway

We want love in the world
Trust in it girl
Every night, every day
We want love in the world
Trust in it girl
Any how, any way

We want love in the world
Love in the world
Every night, every day

We want love in the world
Trust in it girl
Make me show us the way
We want love in the world
Love in the world

Every night, every day
We need love in the world
