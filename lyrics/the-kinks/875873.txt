Bide my time,
Everything will be in line,
Mystic rhyme,
Nine and three and five are mine,
Memories,
Past, future, now,
Show me,
Just where man's destiny will lie.

Outa space,
Travellers.

Make a race,
And mutate,
Warriors.

Unify,
Open eye,
Clarity.

Human race,
Outa space,
Travellers.

Magnetize all your actions powerfully,
Energize everything you touch and see,
Change minds,
Rebuild the world,
Unlock
The healing power in you heart.
