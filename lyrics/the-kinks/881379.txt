One fine day now,
My baby's coming back home to me.
One fine day now,
We'll be as happy as happy can be.


Well I saw my baby comin' up across the hill
Well I'm a hootin' and a hollerin' 'cause I love her still
I said whoa yeah, one fine day
I said whoa yeah, one fine day
I said whoa yeah, one fine day

One fine day now,
My baby's arms will hold me tight.
One fine day now,
I know our love's gonna be all right.

Well I saw my baby comin' up across the hill
Well I'm a hootin' and a hollerin' 'cause I love her still
I said whoa yeah, one fine day
I said whoa yeah, one fine day
I said whoa yeah, one fine day

Yeah!

Whoa yeah, one fine day
I said whoa yeah, one fine day
I said whoa yeah, one fine day
I said whoa yeah, one fine day

One fine day now,
My baby's coming back home to me.
One fine day now,
We'll be as happy as happy can be.

Well I saw my baby comin' up across the hill
