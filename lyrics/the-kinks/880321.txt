I've gotta get a train, take me back home again,
See my daddy, momma wants to see me too.
I'm gonna see my momma looking through the window
At the station in the morning, been a few mornings since I've been home.


I've been doing wrong but now I'm going home.
So come on girls, you better put your best boots on.
'Cause when I get home to Lincoln County,
Won't know which way to go, I'm gonna find all those pretty girls.
I'm gonna find them all.
'Cause when I get home to Lincoln County,
Gonna lift the lid off hell, drink some beer, I'm gonna live it swell.
Then I'm gonna shout for more.

Well, I bought a new suit at the best pawn broker's shop,
Bought my ticket from money that I saved in jail.
I got a boot lace tie, I got for my Pa,
I got a head scarf, fair, I got for my momma that she won't wear.

I've been doing wrong but now I'm going home.
So come on girls, you better put your best boots on.
'Cause when I get home to Lincoln County,
Won't know which way to go, I'm gonna find all those pretty girls.
I'm gonna find them all.
'Cause when I get home to Lincoln County,
Gonna lift the lid off hell, drink some beer, I'm gonna live it swell.
Then I'm gonna shout for more.
