One night with you,
Is all that I'm praying for.
These things that we two can plan
To make my dream come true.


Just call my name,
And I'll be right by your side.
Won't need no helping hand
My love's too strong to hide.

I always lived a very quiet life,
I ain't never did no wrong.
Now I know that life without you,
Been too lonely too long.

One night with you,
Is all that I'm praying for.
These things that we two can share,
To make my dream come true.

One night with you,
Is all I've been praying for.
These things that we two can share,
To make my dream come true.
