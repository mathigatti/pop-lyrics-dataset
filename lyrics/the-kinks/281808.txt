I gotta wings
I'm gonna fly
I'm going home
And I know why
To see my baby
That's enough
I'm going home
It's all right


It's all right, yeah
It's all right, yeah
It's all right, yeah

I gotta wing, wing
I'm gonna fly by
I'm going home
And I know why, why
To see my baby
That's enough
I'm going home
It's all right

It's all right, yeah
It's all right, yeah
It's all right, yeah

I jumped on a wagon a-shootin' off down the road
I'm gonna see my baby
My baby's gonna take-a me home

I gotta wing, wing
I'm gonna fly by
I'm going home
And I know why, why
To see my baby
That's enough
I'm going home
It's all right

It's all right, yeah
It's all right, yeah
It's all right, yeah
