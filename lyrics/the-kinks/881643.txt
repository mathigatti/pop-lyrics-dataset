In a sheltered place where I viewed the world
And all that it contained
I would see your face in a misty haze
And wish that you were there
Yes I wished that you were there
Darling Fool, I was with you all the way
Be as the flower that unfolds with each day


Trust your place in time though you have won and lost
How very much like me you are
When you come to me
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, oh truly trust your heart

Why bear malice just let it go
So what of pride it will swallow you whole
Here's to the judge, to the tyrant, and the beast
You keep a knockin' but you can't come in
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, truly trust your heart

The moonlight of your soul, told of memories long ago
Of the days when we were young
Of love that we'd forever hold
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, truly trust your heart
I bring thunder, lightning and rain
For those who administer injustice and pain
Comfort the weak and feed the poor
What on earth do we need government for?
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, oh truly trust your heart
