You can blame it on the government,
The unions,
They use you all you life,
You can take system and make believe
it will be alright,
They've taken the spirit of your life,
And given you a machine.
No wonder you feel so hard done by


Chorus
They're doing the best for you,
Well that's what they say,
I know what you're going through.
You travel alone,
The journey is long,
With only a name,
In search of a song.

You can blame it on the Catholics,
The Jews,
The Blacks,
And the Whites.
You can take any doctrine and surely waste
another life.
Any way that you want it to be,
By popular demand
Any way but the way it should be.

Chorus
They're doing the best for you,
Well that's what they say,
I know what you're going through.
You travel alone,
The journey is long,
With only a name,
In search of a home.

The world is ruled by science and money,
That's all that exists.
How much longer must we live and die
for this.

Chorus
Doing the best for you,
Doing the best for you,
Doing the best for you.
You travel alone,
The journey is long,
From where do you come,
To where do you go.
