Well, lived my life and never stopped to worry 'bout a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to sing
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?


Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And mummy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
