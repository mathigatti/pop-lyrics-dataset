I get the feeling it ain't over
I get the feeling it ain't over 'till it's done
And my heart's beating like a drum


I get the feeling it ain't over
I get the feeling it ain't over 'till it's done
Well my heart's bustin' with this love

I bet you're wondering why I'm here
For the spiritual change, the transformation is clear
This is the time I've waited for all my life
There's a fire in my soul burning deep inside

I get the feeling it ain't over 'till it's done
And my heart's beating like a drum

I close my eyes, what do I see
See thousands of faces staring straight at me
I want to run, I want to hide, but there's no escape
Maybe this is the way that it's supposed to be

I get the feeling it ain't over 'till it's done
And my heart's beating like a drum

Is the cat too fat, is the dude too old?
and the streets were not all gold
Was it all divine inspiration or just some silly hopes
You're looking for solutions but you won't be told

I close my eyes to meditate
Is this all too much, is it all too little, too late
I feel the universe breath inside of me
Telling me this is the way that it's supposed to be

I get the feeling it ain't over 'till it's done
And my heart's beating like a drum

I get the feeling it ain't over
I get the feeling it ain't over 'till it's done
Well my heart's beating like a drum

I get the feeling it ain't over
I get the feeling it ain't over 'till it's done
My heart's beating like a drum

I get the feeling it ain't over
I get the feeling it ain't over 'till it's done
Well my heart's beating like a drum
