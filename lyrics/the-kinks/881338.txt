Well I've tried everything to get along with you
But I'm gonna tell ya what I'm gonna do
I'm sick of all your crying, gonna leave you alone
If you don't believe I'm going
You can count the days I'm gone
I'm gonna leave
Gonna leave you lovin' baby, oh some day
Well if you don't believe I'm going
Watch me leaving you this way


Won't you please, well that sun looks good going down
Won't you please, well that sun looks good going down
But don't that ol' moon look lonesome when your baby's not around

Won't you please, don't that sun look good going down
Won't you please, don't that sun look good going down
But don't that ol' moon look lonesome when your baby's not around
