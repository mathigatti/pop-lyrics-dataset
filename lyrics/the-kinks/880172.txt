Well in this new love that you've found,
Are you positive, are you sure,
And are you ready girl?
Are you ready?


Though it's fun you talk about[?],
It's the night life you explore.
And are you ready girl?
Are you ready?

'cause you're living with a man
Who will find no understanding.
Do you mind if i layed down and cried?
Do you ever know the way,
That i feel for you each day?
So are you ready girl?
Are you ready?

Are you ready girl?
Are you ready?
Are you ready girl?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready girl?
Are you ready?

He'll buy you diamonds, he'll buy you rings,
He'll buy your time, he'll buy you sin.[?]
So are you ready girl?
Are you ready?

He'll keep you laughing for a while,
Then he'll leave you with a smile.
So are you ready girl?
Are you ready?

'cause you're living with a man
Who will find no understanding.
Do you mind if i layed down and cried?
Do you ever know the way,
That i feel for you each day?
So are you ready girl?
Are you ready?

Are you ready girl?
Are you ready?
Are you ready girl?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready girl?
Are you ready?
