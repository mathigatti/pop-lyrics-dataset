By your smile,
I know you think
I'm just a dreamer
And that the way I act seems
Often kind of foolish,
But eyes can lie,
And sometimes words are oh so useless.
Oh you're part of me,
The rest is history.
There is a light that shines above you when
I'm near you
That somehow tells me all the things we
never say.
And in my heart,
I sense a love that lasts for always.
Yes our dreams were true,
It's just we never knew.


Chorus
I love you,
Yes I do,
There is no doubt.
I love you,
And there ain't no doubt about it.

Repeat

In your eyes I see you a visionary dreamer,
And all at once they say you're acting like
a fool.
The world may change,
But it can never really harm you,
For there's a love that's true,
That's deep inside you.
Soon the time will come for us to say
goodbye,
But all the visions of our friendship will
remain.
And every time I see a child look to the sky,
I will remember you.
We shared a love oh so true.

Chorus
I love you,
Yes I do,
There is no doubt.
I love you,
And there ain't no doubt about it.

Now as I gaze out of my window to
the stars,
It seems somehow our little lives are oh
so strange.
I close my eyes and feel the universe within
me.
And you're part of me,
And you will always be.

Chorus
I love you,
Yes I do,
There is no doubt.
I love you,
And there ain't no doubt about it.

Repeat
