I never knew why I loved you so much 
Maybe it's the way you look at me when you get up in the morning 
I didn't need a shove, 
I just fell in love, 
With your little baby face 


Baby face, 
You got the prettiest little baby face 
There isn't another one to take your place 
Baby face 
You got my heart a jumpin' 
You sure have started something 

Baby face, 
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace 
I didn't need a shove, 
I just fell in love 
With your pretty little baby face 

You got my heart a-jumpin' 
You sure have started something 

Baby face, 
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace 
I didn't need a shove, 
I just fell in love 
With your pretty little baby face, 
Pretty little baby face, 
Pretty little baby face.
