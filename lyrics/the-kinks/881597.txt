See the beast,
Got such a hold on you,
Every way you turn,
But don't hang around now,
It's too late for politics to save you.
It's funny can't you see the dream,
Just hold it tenderly in your hand.


Chorus
For you,
For you to see you through the night.
For you,
For you to light your weary path.
Don't let him,
No, no, no,
Tell you that everything is wrong.
Don't let him,
No, no, no,
It's just his way to keep you lost.

See the beast,
Suddenly I noticed we were going nowhere.
But hold on though there is cold around you
brother,
It won't last.
It's funny can't you see the dream,
Just hold it tenderly your hand and let
it go.
Don't let him break your heart,
He'll tear your soul apart,
Believe.

Chorus
For you,
For you to see through the night.
For you,
For you to see the wrong from the right.

See the beast,
Got such a hold on you,
Every way you turn,
But don't hang around now.
It's too late for politics to save you.

Chorus
Don't let him,
No, no, no,
Tell you that everything is wrong.
Don't let him,
No, no, no,
It's just his way to keep you lost.
