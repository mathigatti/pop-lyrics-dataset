I can't think of a place I'd rather be.
The whole wide world doesn't mean so much to me,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.


Tell me now if you want me to stay.
It don't matter, 'cause I'd stay here anyway.
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Well, I ain't gonna wander,
Like the boy I used to know.
He's a real unluckly fella,
And he's got no place to go.

I won't search for a house upon a hill.
Why should I when I'd only miss you still,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.
This is where I belong.
