I gotta go now, gotta go now
I gotta go now, gotta go now


Hey, little girl
I've gotta go now.
Hey, little girl.
I've gotta go now.

Well your mum,
She's so angry
Hey, little girl,
Guess I'd better go now.

Hey, little girl.
What'cha gonna do 'bout it now?
Hey, little girl.
What'cha gonna do 'bout it now?

Well I love you,
But I guess I'd better go now.
Hey, little girl,
Guess I'd better go now.

I gotta go now, gotta go now
I gotta go now, gotta go now

I don't want to leave you
But I guess I'd better go now.
Soon we'll be together all the time
But until then I gotta go, gotta go.

I gotta go now, gotta go now
I gotta go now, gotta go now

Hey, little girl,
I gotta go now, gotta go now
Hey, little girl,
I gotta go now, gotta go now

Well I love you,
But I guess I'd better go now.
Hey, little girl,
Guess I'd better go now.

I gotta go now, gotta go now
I gotta go now, gotta go now
I've gotta go.
