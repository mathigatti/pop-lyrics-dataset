He was just a workin' man
Simple rules and simple plans
Fancy words he didn't understand
He loved with his heart
He worked with his hands


Liberals dream of equal rights
Conservatives live in a world gone by
Socialists preach of a promised land
But old Uncle Son was an ordinary man

Bless you, Uncle Son
They won't forget you when the revolution comes

Unionists tell you when to strike
Generals tell you when to fight
Preachers teach you wrong from right
They'll feed you when you're born
And use you all your life

Bless you, Uncle Son
They won't forget you when the revolution comes
