Voices in the subway,
Looking for the overnight.
Echo in the darkness,
Lonely cries within a sound.


A voice that has no face,
Is lost in time and inner space.
Chasing dreams that got lost in the dark.
Reaching out, always searching,
Lonely voices in the dark.

[This is Surbiton, Surbiton. The train at Platform Two is for Wimblelton and
Waterloo only.]

Lonely voices in the dark.
Lonely voices in the dark.

A voice that has no face,
Is lost in time and inner space.
Chasing dreams that got lost in the dark.
Reaching out, always searching,
Lonely voices in the dark.

Lonely voices in the dark.
Lonely voices in the dark.
