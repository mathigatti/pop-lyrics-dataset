I'm a hog for you baby, can't get enough of your love
I'm a hog for you baby, can't get enough of your love
When I go to sleep at night that's the only thing I'm thinking of


One little piggie ate a pizza (yeah)
One piggie ate potato chips (yeah)
But here's a little piggie comin' over your house
Gonna grab a love of your sweet lips

'Cause I'm a hog for you baby, can't get enough of your love
When I go to sleep at night that's the only thing I'm thinking of
Yeah!

One little piggie went to London (yeah)
One piggie went to Hongkong
This little piggie's comin' over your house
Gonna love ya all night long

'Cause I'm a hog for you baby, can't get enough of your love
When I go to sleep at night that's the only thing I'm thinking of
When I go to sleep at night that's the only thing I'm thinking of
