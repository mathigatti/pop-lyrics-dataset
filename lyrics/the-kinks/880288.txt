The first time that I saw you
You were the lady of my dreams.
The very next time I had to make you mine,
And I treated you like a queen.
The third time that I saw you
You treated me with such distaste,
Now I wish I'd never seen your face.
I'm in disgrace,
I'm in disgrace.
Because I fell for your pretty face,
I'm in disgrace. He's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace. He's in disgrace.
You captured me in your embrace.


There's no use blaming me
And saying I was your ruination
'Cos it was you equally
That got us into this situation.
It wasn't lust, it wasn't rape,
It was just a mistake
I'm in disgrace. He's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace. He's in disgrace.
Because I fell for your pretty face.
I'm in disgrace. She's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace. He's in disgrace.
You captured me in your embrace.

Was your love real or faked?
Or was it only infatuation?
Picture you in my place.
I wish I'd acted with a little less haste.
I'm in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace.
Because I fell for your pretty face.
Oh what a waste. He's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace. He's in disgrace.
Now my name's dirt and I'm disgraced.
I'm in disgrace.
