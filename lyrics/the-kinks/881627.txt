Like the clouds that bring the rain
Like the sun that makes the flowers
Like the soft and gentle breeze
I will blow away the showers


This I know, this I know and I know
I love you for the rest of my life
I can't wait till tomorrow comes
I can't wait to see the sunlight in your eyes
When you know that I am yours

I don't know what makes the stars
Light up the sky when nighttime's falling
But like the stars up in the sky
My love for you is everlasting

This I know, this I know and I know
I love you for the rest of my life
I can't wait till tomorrow comes
I can't wait to see the sunlight in your eyes
When you know that I am yours

When the leaves fall sadly down
When the autumn winds are blowing
They don't feel sad because they know
A new life comes at springtime's dawning

This I know, this I know and I know
I love you for the rest of my life
I love you for the rest of my life
