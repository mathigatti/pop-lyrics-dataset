When I see that girl of mine
Makes me want to sigh
When I see that girl of mine
Makes me want to sigh
I don't care if the sun don't shine
Long as I can see that girl of mine
I know everything'll be fine
When I see that girl of mine
When I see that girl of mine


Getting ready and looking my best
Got to look my best so I'm taking my time
'Cause I need that girl of mine
I know that she'll be mine so I'll keep on trying
I don't care if the sun don't shine
Long as I can see that girl of mine
I know everything'll be fine
When I see that girl of mine
When I see that girl of mine

Can't you see she's the only girl for me
And when people look at me they can see
They can see, they can see, they can see

When I see that girl of mine
Makes me want to sigh
When I see that girl of mine
Makes me want to sigh
I don't care if the sun don't shine
Long as I can see that girl of mine
I know everything'll be fine
When I see that girl of mine
When I see that girl of mine
When I see that girl of mine
