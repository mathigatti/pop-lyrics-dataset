I can remember
The very first time I cried
How I wiped my eyes
And buried the pain inside
All of my memories
Good and bad that's passed
Didn't even take the time to realize


Staring at the cracks in the walls
\'Cause I\'m waiting for it all to come to an end
Still I curl up right under the bed
'Cause it's takin' over my head
All over again

Do you even know who you are?
I'm guess I'm trying to find
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
I want to be a star
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?

Lying awake
Watching the sunlight
How the birds will sing
As I count the rings around my eyes
Constantly pushing
The world I know aside
I don't even feel the pain
I don't even want to try

I'm looking for a way to become
The person that I dreamt up
When I was 16
Oh, nothing is ever enough
Ooh, baby, it ain't enough
For what it may seem

Do you even know who you are?
I'm still trying to find
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
Everybody wants to be
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
No

Sorry, girl
Tell a tale for me
'Cause I'm wondering
How you really feel
I'm a lonely girl
I'll tell a tale for you
'Cause I'm just trying to make
All my dreams come true

Do you even know who you are?
I\'m guess I'm trying to find
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
I want to be a star
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?

I guess not
Oh, I guess not

Do you even know who you are?
I'm guess I'm trying to find
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
I want to be a star
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
Oh, no, no

Do you even know who you are?
A rising dream, or falling star?
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
