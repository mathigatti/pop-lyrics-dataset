Will you make it sound so pretty even when it's not?
Didn't choose, but it's the only one we've got
And sometimes I get so tired
Of getting tied up in my thoughts
You're the only one that ever makes it stop


God, it hurts
To be human
Without you
I'd be losing
Yeah, someday
We'll face the music
God, it hurts
To be human

But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

Like we're buckled in, preparing for the crash
Like we're walking down a road of broken glass
Now if we defeat all odds and it was us against the world
You can count on me, you know I'd have your back

God, it hurts
To be human
Without you
I'd be losing
Yeah, someday
We'll face the music
God, it hurts
To be human

But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

Hope floats away
If you could spend a day in my shoes
Your mind would change
If you knew what I've gone through
We want the same (yeah, we do)
Maybe then you'd understand
How it hurts to be human

God, it hurts
To be human
Without you (without you)
I'd be losing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, someday
We'll face the music
God, it hurts
To be human

But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

Oh God, it hurts
To be human
