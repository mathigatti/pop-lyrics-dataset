LOVE IS SUCH A CRAZY THING

I never thought I'd find someone
But you came along and made me see
That you were the only one for me
Boy, I love you constantly


BRIDGE:
You are my love
My only love
Baby, my heart belongs to you
Be with me
Don't play with me
If you want love just let me know

CHORUS:
Love, love is such a crazy thing
Never understood the way, I was supposed to feel
Is it love for real

Love, love is such a crazy thing
Never understood the way, I was supposed to feel
Is it love for real

I dreamed of someone like you before
But I never thought I'd get the chance
To romance someone as sweet as you
I hope you feel the same as I do

(bridge-chorus)
