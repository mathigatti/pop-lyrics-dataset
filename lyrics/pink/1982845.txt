Just when you think
Hope is lost
And giving up
Is all you got
And blue turns black
Your confidence is cracked
There seems no turning back from here


Sometimes there isn't an obvious explanation
Why the holiest hearts can feel the strongest palpitations?

That's when you can build a bridge of light
That's what turns the wrong so right
That's when you can't give up the fight

That's when love turns night time into day
That's when loneliness goes away
That's why you gotta be strong tonight
Only love can build us a bridge of light

When your feet are made of stone
You're convinced that you're all alone
Look at the stars instead of the dark
You'll find your heart shines like the sun
Let's not let our anger get us lost
And the need to be right comes at way too high a costs

That's when love can build a bridge of light
That's what turns the wrong so right
That's when you know it's worth the fight

That's when love turns nighttime into day
That's when loneliness goes away
That's why you gotta be strong tonight
'cause only love can build us a bridge of light

Deep breath, take it on the chin
But don't forget to let the love back in

That's when love can build a bridge of light
That's what turns the wrong so right
That's when you can't give up the fight

That's when love turns night time into day
That's when loneliness goes away
That's why you gotta be strong tonight
'cause only love can build us a bridge of light

Only love can build us a bridge of light
