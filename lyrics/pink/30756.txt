You make me sick

He was doin 40 on the freeway
In the 6 double 0 bumpin isley
He was gettin kinda close kinda touch-ay
Guess, he had a little too much hennessey
He told me that he wanna go home
Wit me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, "Boo, I don't really know though"
He got close up to me, it started gettin deep
He had me in a huss when he started to show me things
I never saw before
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
I never cool you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick

You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip I'm feeling it I gotta get agrip
And its, driving me crazy baby dont you quit
Cant get enough of it
You got me goin again
Baby, you got me goin again
You make me sick

So hot n the 6 now, so hot
Had to roll all the windows down
Eyes lead and I'm thinkin bout the sheets now
Wonderin should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
Again, how many times have I heard this
Kinda funny, but I wasn't even nervous
Well all his slick-ass lines was kinda workin
I felt my knees get weak, his body was callin me
Just couldn't take the heat
Anyway it was 2 or 3, I had to get off the streets
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
Said, he was too smooth to be screamin my name
Even though we made the best of it
I still told him this

You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip I'm feeling it I gotta get agrip
And its, driving me crazy baby dont you quit
Cant get enough of it
You got me goin again
Baby, you got me goin again
You make me sick

You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip I'm feeling it I gotta get agrip
And its, driving me crazy, baby, dont you quit
Cant get enough of it
You got me goin again
Baby, you got me goin again
You make me sick

You make me sick

And its, driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit
