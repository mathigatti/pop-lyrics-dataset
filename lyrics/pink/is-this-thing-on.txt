Got your voice mail
Can you call me at a hotel?
There's something
That's weighing heavy on my heart
And heavy on my chest
I'm a long night
You're the morning
I annoy you and you bore me
And it's hard enough to make it
Through a world that's already a mess


But in good time we'll be just fine
Either way we need to be happy

Tell me is this thing on?
How do we keep this new?
How do I keep you into me, into me
Without faking it too?
What do we have to try
When everything is to lose?
'Cause it always is just me and you
But it's the hardest thing
The hardest thing to do

And I want you to want me
Like the first time you saw me
I know we're ten years on
But in my head we're still young and dumb
It'd be so hard to let go and replace you
I still love you, I just wanna find a thing
To make me think this was the one

But in good time we'll be just fine
Either way we need to be happy

Tell me is this thing on?
How do we keep this new?
How do I keep you into me, into me
Without faking it too?
What do we have to try
When everything is to lose?
'Cause it always is just me and you
But it's the hardest thing
The hardest thing to do

It's the hardest thing
The hardest thing to do

Tell me is this thing on?
How do we keep this new?
How do I keep you into me, into me
Without faking it too?
What do we have to try
When everything is to lose?
'Cause it always is just me and you
But it's the hardest thing
The hardest thing to do

Tell me is this thing on?
How do we keep this new?
How do I keep you into me, into me
Without faking it too?
What do we have to try
When everything is to lose?
'Cause it always is just me and you
But it's the hardest thing
The hardest thing to do
