Turn up the thermostat
It's only 50 damn degrees
Everybody is so warm and I'm so cold
They're saying "can you believe that?
She's got 17 tattoos
And she sings about the blues and she's suburban"

Everybody is so obsessed with everybody else
I didn't know that so and so broke up
I was busy paying bills
I don't always think I'm right, but I know I'm wrong

I'm trying so hard to get through
I'm trying so hard to hear you
There's so much static in the line,
That I can barely hear the truth
Is it any wonder I'm the fool?
Is it a surprise to be uncool?
It's no wonder, I'm so disconnected

So tell me why you gotta laugh?
I guess I must have missed the joke
The over-caffeinated bullshit's good me tired
I guess you know just where it's at
You gotta have the latest things
To keep your friends impressed another minute longer

I can only imagine how uncomfortable it is inside that skin
Having to stretch and mold to society
And throb on fitting it
Do you always think you're right but you know you're wrong?

I'm trying so hard to get through
I'm trying so hard to hear you
There's so much static in the line,
That I can barely hear the truth
Is it any wonder I'm the fool?
Is it a surprise to be uncool?
It's no wonder, I'm so disconnected

It's no wonder, It's no wonder,
