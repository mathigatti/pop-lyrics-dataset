When the day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough of this life
Hang on


Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts, sometimes
Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (hold on)
If you think you've had too much of this life
To hang on

'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hand, oh, no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much of this life
To hang on

Well, everybody hurts
Sometimes, everybody cries
And everybody hurts, sometimes
But everybody hurts, sometimes
So hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Everybody hurts
You're not alone
