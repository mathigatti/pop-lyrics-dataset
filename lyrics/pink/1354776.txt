I hear my name
I hear the trash you're talking
In your sleep
The secrets that you're keeping
A chick, that's smart
Did you really think that you could keep her in the dark?


Does she purr?
Does she make it hard?
Hard to speak
Does she dress the part?
I'm sure she'll take some getting used to
Darlin, she won't ever be me

I felt the bite
Take a spit
Suck the poison out of me
I'll make you beg
Make you come
To your senses
If you keep up the shit, take the hit, dig the grave
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down

Gonna run
Gonna scream
Gonna crawl round on your knees
When you realize that no one's gonna measure up to me
Doesn't matter cause I'm over it now
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down

I'm gonna rage
Stay out really late
I'm gonna hang with all my friends you hate
I may try that threesome
Better late than never and
Better without you

This is your future as I see it
You will be homeless, poor, and broken
She will have left you when she finds out who you are
You're nothing but an extra, and baby I'm the star

I felt the bite
Take a spit
Suck the poison out of me
I'll make you beg
Make you come
To your senses
If you keep up the shit, take the hit, dig the grave
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down

Gonna run
Gonna scream
Gonna crawl round on your knees
When you realize that no one's gonna measure up to me
Doesn't matter cause I'm over it now
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down

I suppose this is how the story goes, but
Ever since that door closed, I've been going down, down, down, down
The drain and the pain got me nauseous
I should have been more cautious or clever
Whatever, you'll never find a dude with a better headgame, and
You can take that both ways
You laughin like I'm playin wit your fingers up like oh ___
Wish you would have a threesome without me I pull a O. G.
And text you something criminal and pictures from my old days

I felt the bite
Take a spit
Suck the poison out of me
I'll make you beg
Make you come
To your senses
If you keep up the shit, take the hit, dig the grave
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down

Gonna run
Gonna scream
Gonna crawl round on your knees
When you realize that no one's gonna measure up to me
Doesn't matter cause I'm over it now
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down

Somebody doesn't like you
Cause you're not such a bigshot dude
Might wanna rethink it through
Coulda asked me, I woulda told you the truth

Somebody doesn't like you
Cause you're not such a bigshot dude
Might wanna rethink it through
Shoulda asked me, I woulda told you the truth
