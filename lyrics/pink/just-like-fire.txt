I know that I'm running out of time
I want it all, hmm, hmm
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it all, hmm, hmm
And I'm walking on a wire
Trying to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, hmm, hmm


We came here to run it
Run it, run it
We came here to run it
Run it, run it

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire

And people like to laugh at you
'Cause they are all the same, hmm, hmm
See, I would rather we just go a different way
Than play the game
And no matter the weather
We can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry about a thing
About a thing, no

We came here to run it
Run it, run it
We came here to run it
Run it, run it

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire

Run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it
Run it, run it

So look, I came here to run it
Just cause nobody's done it
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I been here, I done it
Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come-a, come on with me

Hey, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Hey, what's a girl to do?
(Yeah, what?)
Aah, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Hmm, what's a girl to do?

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire

Run it, run it, run it
Just like fire
We came here to run it
Run it, run it
