Got a hole in my head and my heart tonight
Well you shot me down, you just ain't right
Comes a time when you know you must let go
I know, I know, we fixed it but it's broken
Got a feeling we gon' get this wrong
And even I can't be this strong
It's a breath that you take right before you die
We lie and lie, can't say we didn't try though


So here we go
Take my body not my soul
Took me high and left me low
I honestly never imagined we'd get this far

There's a road that takes me home
Take me fast or take me slow
Throw my head out the window
Feel the wind
Make me whole
Write my name up in the sky
As we contemplate goodbye
I don't know, we don't know
Where we go

There's not a holy man or prayer in sight
There's not a priest around to read our rights
There's no magic balm to save our lives
I know, I know, we've both always been broken
But you had a way of making me forget
All the sadness rollin' 'round my head
Well, that was until I wished us dead
You had my heart, I wish you would have kept it

This world we know
It takes our bodies not our souls
It takes us high and leaves us low
But they honestly never imagined we'd get this far

There's a road that takes me home
Take me fast or take me slow
Throw my head out the window
Feel the wind
Make me whole
Write my name up in the sky
As we contemplate goodbye
I don't know, we don't know
Where we go

Death is in the air tonight
I can smell the fear inside
We can see when we close our eyes
That's it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright
Promise me you'll stay with me (stay with me)
If just for one more night (one more night)
You can hold me honestly (honestly)
'Cause it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright

There's a road that takes me home
Take me fast or take me slow
Throw my head out the window
Feel the wind
Make me whole
Write my name up in the sky
As we contemplate goodbye
I don't know, we don't know
Where we go

There's a road that takes me home
Take me fast or take me slow
I don't know, we don't know
Take me home
