I have seen the rain
I have felt the pain
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
I don't know where I'm going
I don't even know where I've been
But I know, I'd like to see them again


Spend my days just searching
Spend my nights in dreams
Stop looking over my shoulder, baby
I stopped wondering what it means
Drop out, burn out, soldier home
Oh they said I should've been more
Probably so if I hadn't been in that crazy damn at Vietnam war

I have seen the rain
I survived the pain
Oh I've been home 30 years or so and
I'm just stepping off of the plane

Spend my days just searching
Spend my nights in dreams
Stop looking over my shoulder baby
I stopped wondering what it means
Drop out, burn out, soldier home
Oh they said I should've been more
Probably so if I hadn't been in that crazy damn at Vietnam war

We have seen the rain together
We survived the pain forever
Oh, its good to be home again
Its good to be with my friends
Oh its good to be home again
Its good to feel the rain
