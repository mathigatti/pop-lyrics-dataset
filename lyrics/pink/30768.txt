[Verse 1]
I hide my pain like the rest of them
That's why I'm always laughing
I'm troubled, I'm brilliant and miserable too
That's why I am so funny
I swallow down all my fears
With a bottle made of silver
I've only been here for 27 years
But already my life is over


[Chorus 1]
And I need to unwind, yes,
And I need to unwind, yes,
Want all the time
To be loved, to unwind

[Verse 2]
My life is like a fairytale
That nobody believes in
I can't remember anything
Not the people, not the places I've been
Just one more day you can make it, babe
That's what I tell myself
And everything that I love in life
It is killing me, 'cause it's bad for my health

[Chorus 2]
Somebody comfort me
S...southern comfort me
Somebody comfort me
S...southern comfort me

[Chorus 1(3x)]
[Chorus 2(out)]
