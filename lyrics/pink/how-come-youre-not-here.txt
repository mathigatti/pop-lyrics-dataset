Where have you been?
Where have you gone?
And have I done something wrong
You're the tooth fairy
You're like Santa Claus
You're like white noise
When I want my favorite song


Just come on back
And come on home
It ain't super smart to leave me alone
Light a flare
Pick up the phone
I'm like a stoner babe
Without my bong

Are you hiding in the closet?
Are you underneath the bed?
Did you go for a long walk off a short pier?
How come you're not here?

Should I worry you've been bitten?
Or somebody got you high
Quick come back or I might just die
How come you're not here?

I've heard some rumors
About another girl
I heard she's cute
But she stores nuts like a squirrel
And that's all cool
I'll wait right here
Til you get bored
And she gets carded for beer

I'm the one
I'm just that slick
You won't find better
I'm honey dipped
There ain't a thing
That's fake on me
I miss you, baby
Come home to me

Are you hiding in the closet?
Are you underneath the bed?
Did you go for a long walk off a short pier?
How come you're not here?

Should I worry you've been bitten?
Or somebody got you high
Quick come back or I might just die
How come you're not here?

Has anyone seen?
Has anyone seen?
Has anyone seen?
Why he's hiding from me?

Can anyone see?
Can anyone see?
Can anyone see?
Let's play hide and seek

Are you hiding in the closet?
Are you underneath the bed?
Did you go for a long walk off a short pier?
How come you're not here?

Should I worry you've been bitten?
Or somebody got you high
Quick come back or I might just die
Quick come back or I might just die
