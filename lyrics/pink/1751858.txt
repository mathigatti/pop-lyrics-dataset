Why do you feel so good?
How you make me feel like this
I think I'm hypnotized
It started with a kiss


We shouldn't do this
We both know it's wrong
We both have someone,
to them our hearts belong

Quick, before you go, take off my clothes
and dance with me, yeah

Don't stress me out
Don't talk about
No promises
Your privileges
To love me now

Baby, do not think too much
I'm not asking for love
Let me tell you what I like
Get behind me, hold me tight

Don't be afraid
Take it slow baby
And it's okay
If you forget my name

Quick, before you say goodbye, let's fly
and dance with me, yeah, oh oh oh

Don't stress me out (don't do it)
Don't talk about (don't talk)
No promises (no promises)
Your privileges
To love me now

Don't you wanna dance with me?

Tell me
Why is it so taboo for you to love me like you do?
(You do, baby)
Baby don't talk about it, let's be about it, 'cause I do
(Baby, I do)
Your other girl won't let you do it
Looks like I'm the one for you
(Looks like I'm the one for you)

Don't stress me out (don't do it)
Don't talk about (don't talk about it)
No promises (no no no)
Your privileges
To love me now

Boy, you wanna dance with me?

Don't stress me out (no)
Don't talk about (no)
No promises (making no promises)
Your privileges (uh oh oh)
To love me now
