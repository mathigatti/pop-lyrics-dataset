She looks to the sun
Help her to carry on
Breaking down all the years
Wondering how she got here
She drifts through the sky
Counting the reasons why
How my life turned so fast
Remembering all of the past


All the changes and all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Words that she says

She looks to the stars
Breaking time to follow the heart
Her world is falling apart

And the turning of every new page
A book on the shelf that is there to remain
Breaking the walls as she's tearing them down
As she is starting to drown

She's waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waitied, waited so long

She prays to the gods
Telling how she needs someone
Help me find where i am today
Life is looking very gray

All the changes and all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Everything that she says

Waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love

I'm waiting for a new day to rise
Conversations to make sense to me and my mind
I need someone to lift me right off of my feet
And i want it and i need it and i'll leave it all behind

And all the changes are made
And i'll remember the words that you'll never say

Waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting for love

She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting for love
She's waiting for love
She's waiting for love

Waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love

She looks to the sun
