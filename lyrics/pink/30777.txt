No sleep, no sex for you from your x-girlfriend
I was too deep can´t let you call me just jump in
At times I would push my feelings aside to let you feel
I´m novocaine I´m numb and nothing´s real
Like the coldest winter
I am frozen from you


CHORUS
I was weak before now you´ve made me
So numb I can´t feel much for you anymore
I gave you my all my baby
I´m numb, numb, numb

But the tears were silent inside you see
But the tears were silent inside you see

I laid there quiet
And watched you have your way with me
I might have cried 
But the tears were silent inside you see
You called me names
Made me feel like I was dumb
I didn´t feel a thing
And now I´m gone, gone, gone
Like a battered child
I got used to your pain but you know it´s ´cause  

Repeat CHORUS
