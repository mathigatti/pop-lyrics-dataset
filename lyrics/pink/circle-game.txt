For all my hard talk, I'm still just a daddy's girl
In this hard shell, there's tiny cracks from a big world
And there's still monsters in my closet and they want to come and play
There's still sounds in the dark, I wish they'd go away
I know, I know, I know, I know I'm a big girl now
I know, I know, I know, I know I better work it out


I've got a little girl of my own and she looks at me
Like I'm a badass and you know that I wanna be
And now there's monsters in her closet and they wanna come and play
And I start looking for my dad to come and make 'em go away
I know, I know, I know, I know that it's my job now
I know, I know, I know, I know I better work it out

In the circle game, no one ever stopped to say
Soon it's gonna change, it all just goes away
Count your lucky stars that you had a chance to play
In the circle game, no one ever stops to say
Soon it's gonna change, it all just goes away
Count your lucky stars that you had a chance to play
In the circle game

I had a hard day, and I need to find a hiding place
Can you give me just a second to make it through these growing pains?
And I know that it's just life and I must go through things alone
But I'm feeling kinda small, I want his hand to hold
I know, I know, I know, I know I'm a big girl now
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know we all just work it out

In the circle game, no one ever stopped to say
Soon it's gonna change, it all just goes away
Count your lucky stars that you had a chance to play
In the circle game, no one ever stopped to say
Soon it's gonna change, it all just goes away
Count your lucky stars that you had a chance to play
In the circle game

What is old, can it be new again?
And what goes out, does it come back in?
And we have to say goodbye, can we say hello again?
Oh, where's the book that shows you how to be a big girl now?
Can I fall apart one more time before I work it out?

In the circle game, no one ever stopped to say
Soon it's gonna change, it all just goes away
Count your lucky stars that you got a chance to play
In the circle game, no one ever stopped to say
Soon it's gonna change, it all just goes away
Count your lucky stars that you got a chance to play
In the circle game, in the circle game
In the circle game, in the circle game
In the circle game
