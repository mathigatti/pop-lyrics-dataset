You're drunk, the coffee is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that
Why do I always come back
Oh
What wouldn't I do for you


And I'm starting to think you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh
What wouldn't I do for you

And I'm starting to think you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Starting to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raising the other
You remind me of mother
We drive one another as crazy as each other
And we're both adults so there's no excuse for the games we play with each other
Where you at? At a friends?
No you ain't, motherfucker
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver
When I touch her, cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
Our bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble, she's in hot water
Think I caught her cheating again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimming in that Egyptian River cause I'm in denial
Say I don't need shit, but I have a shit-eating grin when I smile
Making an excuse for us to act it out
She's just acting out, with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
Cause I'd rather believe a lie then breathe a sigh of relieve that I don't believe in
Going to bed mad
I keep on trying to make a bad girl good
But have a nice goodbye, you in good times
In bed, I'm starting to feel like you're god damn dead
Cause I literally feel like you could die of a "should I?"
Leave me for good? You never would
Never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And I think you're a good person, too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep putting my fuckin foot in my mouth
Every time I come to bail you out of the trouble you get yourself in
I miss trouble but I can't leave
I'd never sell you out
I'd never turn my back on you
What the fuck is that?
I'm co-dependant
I'm just now noticing it
But how every time I go to end it I don't have the cahoney's to do it
Nor the heart, uh, department store
You're using my heart for a dart board
But God must've had a non-stop score cause somebody paired us up
But people say he ain't capable of making a mistake
But this one's perfect

And I'm starting to think you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
