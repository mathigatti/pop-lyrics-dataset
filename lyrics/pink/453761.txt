Stupid girl, stupid girls, stupid girl
Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl


Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughing loud so all the little people stare
Looking for a daddy to pay for the champagne
(Drop a name)
What happened to the dreams of a girl president
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees
Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh, where, oh, where could they be?

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Maybe if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

(Break it down now)
Disease's growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take any more
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see
Disasters all around
World despaired
Their only concern
Will they fuck up my hair

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Maybe if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

(Do ya thing, do ya thing, do ya thing)
(I like this, like this, like this)
Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly as a lucky girl
Pull my head and suck it girl, stupid girl!
Pretty would u fuck me girl, silly as a lucky girl
Pull my head and suck it girl, stupid girl!

Maybe if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that, stupid girl!

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Maybe if I act like that, flipping my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
