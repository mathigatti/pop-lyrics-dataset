Ah Yeah yeah... ahh

I need some time
To make up my mind (mind)
You've got the key to my heart (key to my heart)
Baby don't you ever go away (go away)


Sitting here thinking about the time we first met
It brings a smile to my face
No one else could ever take your place
Yet I'm afraid of falling in love
The joy the pain that love can bring
Promise me you'll never leave my side

Your kind of love (kind of love)
Is very special (very special)
Our love sent from heaven above (heaven above)

Chorus :
I need some time (i need some time)
To make up my mind
You've got the key to my heart (key to my heart)
Baby don't you ever go away too far
I need you safe in my arms (safe in my arms)
You've got the key to my heart
Baby please don't you ever leave my side

So we've touched
I don't wanna rush this feeling
Relax your mind it's all that goes
I know you ever felt this way before
Love is to control
And I'm the one you want to hold
I know that you want me
And boy you know I really want you too

Your kind of love (kind of love)
Is very special (very special)
Our love sent from heaven above (heaven above

Chorus

I need some time (i want you to stay, i want you to say)
To make up my mind (i want to hold you)
You've got the key to my heart (key to my heart)
Baby don't you walk away too times (promise me we'll never part)
I need you safe in my arms (safe in my arms)
You've got the key to my heart
Baby please don't you ever leave my side
