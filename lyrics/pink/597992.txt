Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
whole world's come undone
lookin' straight at the sun


what did her daddy do
what did he put you through
they say when Janie was arrested
they found him underneath a train
but man he had it comin'
now that Janie's got a gun
she ain't never gonna be the same

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
dog days just begun
now everybody is on the run

tell me now it's untrue
what did her daddy do
he jacked a little bitty baby
the man has got to be insane
they say the spell that he was under
the lightning and the thunder
knew that someone had to stop the rain

run away, run away from the pain
run away, run away from the pain
run away... run away
run... run away

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
dog days just begun
now everybody is on the run

what did her daddy do
it's Janie's last I - O - U
she had to take him down easy
and put a bullet in his brain (she left him in the pouring
rain)
she said 'cause nobody believes me
the man was such a sleaze
he ain't never gonna be the same

run away, run away from the pain
run away, run away from the pain
run away... run away
run... run away


Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
now everybody is on the run
Janie got a gun
dog days just begun 
now everybody is on the run (honey honey, what's the problem)
Janie got a gun (tell me it ain't right)
Janie got a gun (was it your daddy's cradle-robbin' that)
dog days just begun (made you scream at night)
now everybody is on the run
Janie got a gun
