You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh huh, that's right


I took your words and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah, huh, that's right

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong
I know better, 'cause you said forever
And ever - who knew?

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh, no, no, no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

When someone said: Count your blessings now
'Fore they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
But they knew better, still you said forever
And ever - who knew?

Yeah, yeah

I'll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we
Until we meet again
And I won't forget you, my friend
What happened?

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong and

That last kiss, I'll cherish
Until we meet again
And time makes it harder
I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory
You visit me in my sleep

My darling, who knew?
My darling, my darling
Who knew? My darling
I miss you, my darling
Who knew? Who knew?
