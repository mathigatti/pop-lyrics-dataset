The truth about love comes at 3 a.m.
You wake up fucked up and you grab a pen
And you say to yourself
I'm gonna figure it out, I'm gonna crack that code
Gonna break it break it down
I'm tired of all these questions
And, now it's just annoying
'Cause, no one has the answer
So I guess it's up to me
To find


The truth about love is
It comes, and it goes
A strange fascination with it is lips on toes
Morning breath, bedroom eyes on a smiling face
Sheet marks rug burn, and a sugar glaze
The shock and the awe that can eat your raw
Is this the truth about love (the truth about love)

I think you just may be perfect
You're the person of my dreams
I've never ever ever ever been this happy
But now something has changed
And the truth about love is it's all a lie
I thought you were the one, and I hate goodbyes

Oh, you want the truth?

The truth about love it's nasty and salty
It's the regret in the morning, it's the smelling of armpits
It's wings, and songs
And trees, and birds
It's all the poetry that you ever heard
Terror coup d'Ã©tat life line forget-me-nots
It's the hunt and the kill
The schemes and the plots
The truth about love is it's blood, and it's guts
Purebreads, and mutts
Sandwiches without the crust
It takes your breath, 'cause it leaves a scar
But those untouched never got never got very far
It's rage and it's hate
And a sick twist of fate
And that's the truth about love
The truth about love

I think you just may be perfect
You're the person of my dreams
I've never ever ever ever been this happy
But now something has changed
And the truth about love is it's all a lie
I thought you were the one, and I hate goodbyes

Oh, you can lose your breath and
Oh, you can shoot a gun and
Convinced you're the only one that's ever felt this way before
It hurts inside the hurt within and
It folds together pocket thin and
It's whispered by the angels' lips and
It can turn you into a son-of-a-bitch, man!

The truth, the truth, the truth about love is
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is
Truth about love
