What is this? I heard that you have got a new miss
Just broke up so you know that I am pissed
They say you are faithful
I do not believe that shh, Oh no Oh no


Oh I have tried to act like I do not care
But it does not seem fair you are so good to her
And I have tried to pretend I do not see
All those things that you do you could not do for me

I was in love with you but to hell with you
Because you did not want to treat me right
I was in love with you but to hell with you
Because you did not want to treat me right

Now you got to another girl in your life
Giving her love all day, all night
I was in love with you but to hell with you
Because you did not want to treat me right

So I hear, I have met the winch before
(Yeah, I remember that time we went to Pizza Hut
You told me she was your cousin)
I hear you learned to open doors
(When did you become such a damn gentleman?)

Oh I have tried to act like I do not care
But it does not seem fair you are so good to her
And I have tried to pretend I do not see
All those things that you do you could not do for me

I was in love with you but to hell with you
Because you did not want to treat me right
I was in love with you but to hell with you
Because you did not want to treat me right

Now you got to another girl in your life
Giving her love all day, all night
I was in love with you but to hell with you
Because you did not want to treat me right

What does she do to you?
To make you give her everything
Like you never did for me
Call it jealousy but it is killing me
Because all the time that you were mine
You did not treat me right
No you did not treat me right, no, no
Whoa

I was in love with you but to hell with you
Because you did not want to treat me right
I was in love with you but to hell with you
Because you did not want to treat me right

Now you got to another girl in your life
Giving her love all day, all night
I was in love with you but to hell with you
Because you did not want to treat me right

All day, all night
Love with you but to hell with you
Because you did not want to treat me right
Did not want to treat me right
