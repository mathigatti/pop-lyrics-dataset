I'm lying here on the floor where you left me
I think I took too much
I'm crying here, what have you done?
I thought it would be fun


I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said, I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here

Where I can run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills they were different
Maybe I should get some help

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said, I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here

Where I can run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
(Just like a pill)
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
(Just like a pill)
I said, I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
(Just like a pill)
I think I'll get outta here

Where I can run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
(Frustrated fears)
And I swear, you're just like a pill
(Just like a pill)
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
(Making me, making me ill)
You keep making me ill

Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
(Oh, you keep making me ill)
