I'm coming up
So you better get this party started
I'm coming up
So you better get this party started


Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waiting for me to arrive
Sending out messages to all of my friends
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz
I got lots of style, check my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean

I'm coming up
So you better get this party started
I'm coming up, I'm coming
I'm coming up
So you better get this party started

Pumpin' up the volume, breakin' down to the beat
Cruisin' through the west side we'll be checkin the scene
Boulevard is freakin' as I'm comin' up fast
I'll be burnin' rubber, you'll be kissin' my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car
Licence plate says " Stunner #1 Superstar"

I'm coming up
So you better get this party started
I'm Coming up, so you better
I'm coming up
So you better get this party started
Get this party started

Makin' my connection as I enter the room
Everybody's chillin' as I set up the groove
Pumpin' up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody's dancin' and they're dancin' for me
I'm your operator you can call anytime
I'll be your connection to the party line

I'm coming up
So you better get this party started
I'm Coming up, I'm coming
So you better get this party started
I'm Coming up, I'm coming
I'm coming up
So you better get this party started
I'm Coming up, so you better
I'm coming up
So you better get this party started

Get this party started, ooh
Get this party started right now
Get this party started
Get this party started
Get this party started right now
