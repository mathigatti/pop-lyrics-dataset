Check it out, going out
On the late night
Looking tight, feeling nice
It's a cock fight
I can tell, I just know
That it's going down tonight


At the door we don't wait 'cause we know them
At the bar six shots, just beginning
That's when dick head put his hands on me
But you see

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

Midnight, I'm drunk
I don't give a fuck
Wanna dance by myself
Guess you're outta luck
Don't touch, back up
I'm not the one, b-bye

Listen up, it's just not happening
You can say what you want
To your boy friends
Just let me have my fun tonight

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

Break, break, break it down

In the corner with your boys
You bet up five bucks
To get at the girl that just walked in
But she thinks you suck
We didn't get all dressed up just for you to see
So quit spilling your drinks on me, yeah

You know who you are
High fiving, talking shit
But you're going home alone, aren't ya?

'Cause I'm not here for your entertainment, no
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second, just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over, know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight
It's just you and your hand

I'm not here for your entertainment, no, no, no
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second, just take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight
