[Verse 1]
How many times have you sat across from me?
And how many times have you told me you were leavin'?
I'm no tryin' to listen, 'cause it's all the same
And why, why are you constantly believing
That I, I could ever give you what you're needing?
Baby, baby, please don't put your faith in me
I don't know what to say
'Cause it's all a dream to me anyway


[Chorus]
You can catch me while
I'm sleepin', darlin'
While I'm dreamin', too
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely place
for me baby
It must get lonely for you, too

[Verse 2]
People always fallin'
In and out of love and
It can be pretty painful, too
And maybe, Oh maybe I'm just not strong enough
Sad but true
So tell me what's the use?

Oh, Oh You can catch me while
I'm sleepin', darlin'
Maybe While I'm dreamin', too
'Cause It's a lonely, lonely, lonely place
for me baby
It must get lonely for you, too

[Chorus (Out)]
