I love myself, I want you to love me
When I'm feeling down, I want you above me
I search myself, I want you to find me
I forget myself, I want you to remind me


I don't want anybody else
When I think about you I touch myself
Ooh, I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no

You're the one who makes me come running
You're the sun who makes me shine
When you're around I'm always laughing
I wanna make you mine

I close my eyes and see you before me
Think I would die if you were to ignore me
A fool could see just how much I adore you
I get down on my knees, I do anything for you

I don't want anybody else
When I think about you I touch myself
Ooh I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no

I love myself, I want you to love me
When I'm feeling down, I want you above me
I search myself, I want you to find me
I forget myself, I want you to remind me

I don't want anybody else
When I think about you I touch myself
Ooh, I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no

I want you, I don't want anybody else
And when I think about you I touch myself
Ooh, ooh, oo, ahh

I don't want anybody else
When I think about you I touch myself
Ooh, I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no
