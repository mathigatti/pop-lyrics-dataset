You said you lost yourself
Somewhere along away
You needed time to figure it out
You must’ve known that I would
Kindly let you go
I always knew how to take a bow


It’s sad that I can’t be there
Cause I know that you’re sinking
If only I could be there
And if you think you’re happy
Then I know that you’re crazy
Cause if it makes you happy
Then I’m halfway gone

You had all these plans
You made your great escape
And now you struggle just to breathe
I had a plan, remember?
But it got thrown away
I wish you still needed me

It’s sad that I can’t be there
Cause I know that you’re sinking
If only I could be there
And if you think you’re happy
Then I know that you’re crazy
Cause if it makes you happy
Then I’m halfway gone

I watch you suffer
Drowning in the water
But I, I know I can’t come save you this time
So I keep reaching and I can’t seem to find you
I know if I hold on I’ll be drowning by your side

But if it makes you happy
Really makes you happy
If it makes you happy
Then I’m halfway gone

It’s sad that I can’t be there
Cause I know that you’re sinking
If only I could be there
And if you think you’re happy
Then I know that you’re crazy
Cause if it makes you happy

It’s sad that I can’t be there
Cause I know that you’re sinking
If only I could be there
And if you think you’re happy
Then I know that you’re crazy
Cause if it makes you happy
Then I’m halfway gone
