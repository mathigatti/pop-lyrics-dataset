Heaven's sake everyone
For standin' in my way
For ruinning all my fun
You say your doing it 
For my sake


I thought I did my best
It was nearly good enough
But all that effort I guess
It didn't add up to very much
It hurts me when you call
I hate the way your thinkin'
I could have so easily 
Had it all
I could've had everything,
I could've had everything
This perfect life I'm in,
Screwin' myself over
I could've had everything

I should have had everything 
You almost got me thinking
I'm screwing myself over
Screwin' myself over

They say that madness is
Doing a thing the same way
You hope 
It's gonna turn out different
But ya doing it anyway
I guess it's what I did with you
But at least I have a reason
So my apologies, wont go to anyone
It hurts me when you say, 
That all my close mates hate me
I really thought I had it all
I could've had everything
I could've had everything
It's the perfect life for men, 
screwing myself over, 
Screwing myself over
I could've had everything
I should've had everything
You almost got me thinking
I'm screwing myself over

I coulda, I coulda, I coulda
I coulda, I coulda, 
I coulda had everything
I coulda, I coulda, I coulda
I coulda 
I coulda had everything

I came so near to thinking
I had something
I could've had everything
It's the perfect life for men
Screwing myself over
Could've had everything
I should've had everything
You almost got me thinking
I'm screwing myself over
Could've had everything
I should've had everything
It's the perfect life for men
Screwing myself over
Could've had everything
I should've had everything
You almost got me thinking
I'm screwing myself over
