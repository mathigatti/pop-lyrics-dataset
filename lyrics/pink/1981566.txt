Um boom ba bay
Um boom ba bay
Um boom ba ba bay


Pressure!
Pushing down on me, pressing down on you
No man ask for....Under pressure
That tears a nation down,
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Um ba ba bay
Um ba ba bay
Dee day duh
Ee day duh

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Scream! (Let me out)
Pray tomorrow (pray tomorrow)
Take me higher (higher high)
Pray tomorrow (higher high, high)
Take me higher...!

Why...?
Oh! why...?
Tell me why, tell me why (4x)

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
(one more chance)
Why can't we give ourselves, one more chance?
(one more chance)

Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Everyday, every night, every hour..
(Give love 12x)

'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And loves dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves,
This is our last dance

(This is our last dance) This is ourselves......

(Creatures of the world unite, strength in numbers we can get it right- one time!)
