1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years go by
I don't really know why, I don't really know why
7, 8, 9, 11 years go by
I don't really know why, I don't really know why
I still feel the same way I did when I was 17
I still look over my shoulder, waiting for the world to change


But these are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days and I think I'd like to stay
Oh, I'd like to stay
Oh, I'd like to stay

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago
I didn't see a belly with a child on the inside
6, 7, 8, 10 years ago
I thought I knew about love, I only knew about the fight
I look back and I realise all those times I was lonely
Praying for some day to hurry up and come and save me

But these are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days and I wish that I could stay
I wish that I could stay
I wish I could stay

(These are the good old days)
That I could stay
(These are the good old days)
And I know that you like all the faster the time goes
The darker the night is the lighter the moon brights
(These are the good old days)
(These are the good old days)

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years
From now I hope I'm still gettin' down, hope I'm still around
But 6, 7, 8, 10 beers ago
I had a revelation all for right now
It's all good right now
It's all good right now
It's all good right now

But these are the good old days (good old days)
These are the good old days (these are the good old days)
These are the good old days (good old days)
And I wish that I could stay

These are the good old days (good old days)
These are the good old days (these are the good old days)
These are the good old days (good old days)
I wish that I could stay

These are the good old days (good old days)
These are the good old days (these are the good old days)
These are the good old days (good old days)
And I wish that I could stay
I wish that I could stay
And I wish that I could stay

(These are the good old days) and I wish that I could stay
(These are the good old days) these are the good old days
(These are the good old days) these are the good old days
(These are the good old days) these are the good old days...
