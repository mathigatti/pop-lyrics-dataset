That's me

I might be the way everybody likes to say
I know what you're thinkin' about me
There might be a day, you might have a certain way
But you don't have my luxeries
And it's me, I know, I know my name
'Cause I say it proud
Everything I want I always do

Looking for the right track
Always on the wrong track
But are you catching all these tracks
That I'm layin' down for you?

There's a song I was listenin' to up all night
There's a voice I am hearin' saying "it's alright"
When I'm happy and I'm sad but everything's good
It's not that complicated I'm just missundaztood

There might be a day everything, it goes my way
Can't you think I know I'm super fly?
I might see a world, in a world inside of you
Then I just might say "goodbye"
And it's my name, I know
I say it loud, 'cause I'm really proud
Of all the things I used to do

'Cause it's the wrong track
Looking for the right track
And are you catching all these tracks
That I'm layin' down for you?

There's a song I was listenin' to up all night
There's a voice I am hearin' saying "it's alright"
When I'm happy and I'm sad but everything's good
It's not that complicated I'm just missundaztood

Na-na na na-na-na-na-na

Looking for the right track
Always on the wrong track
But are you catching all these tracks
That I'm layin' down for you?

There's a song I was listenin' to up all night
There's a voice I am hearin' saying "it's alright"
I was taken for granted but it's all good
'Cause I'll do it again, I'm just missundaztood

I said I'll do it again, I'm just missundaztood

Ugh!!!
Bring it back... Ugh!!!

Damon: - you shootin' an exlax commercial?
P!nk: - what? No this ain't damn exlax commercial, this is my first single man!!!
