Oh oh oh oh
Ba da ba bum (oh oh oh oh)
Ba da ba bum
Ba da ba bum (oh oh oh oh)


I can hear planes flyin' over my head
Just hours before you occupied my bed
In our darkness we conjured up sunlight
In our haste, our need, our thirst we lost our sight
But I was inspired tracing the lines on your face
To the poetry the first time I heard your name
When I trip from your lips my heart was like a kick drum
And it silenced the guilt I wasn't raised to hurt anyone

Uh oh does he know
That I'm lying in the afterglow
That I'm lying but I can't go
Can't say no
Make him think he's crazy
While his paranoia grows
What he should be askin'
Is where did our love go
Then I wouldn't be baskin'
In another man's afterglow
Where did the beat go?
Where is the beat?
Where did the beat go?

So how do I justify to the judge and the jury
The voices in my head that caused this fury
Never had to play with matches to start a fire
But it got so cold and I thought I'd forgotten desire
I was your concubine and then your Madonna
You couldn't see anything beyond your baby's mama
How long is lonely supposed to last?
I was naked and waiting for you to come back

Uh oh does he know
That I'm lying in the afterglow
That I'm lying but I can't go
Can't say no
Make him think he's crazy
While his paranoia grows
What he should be askin'
Is where did our love go
Then I wouldn't be baskin'
In another man's afterglow
Where did the beat go?
Where is the beat?
Where did the beat go?

(In another man's afterglow)
Oh oh oh oh

There's a cause and effect although I took the steps
I dove off of the bridge 'cause I had nothin' left
All I ever wanted was you
And in the absence of you
I fell through

Uh oh does he know
That I'm lying in the afterglow
That I'm lying but I can't go
Can't say no
Make him think he's crazy
While his paranoia grows
What he should be askin'
Is where did our love go
Then I wouldn't be baskin'
In another man's afterglow
Where did the beat go?
Where is the beat?
Where did the beat go?
Where did the love go?
Where did the beat go?
Where did the love go?
