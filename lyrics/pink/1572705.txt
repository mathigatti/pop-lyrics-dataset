Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'll leave you when the summertime
Leave you when the summer comes a rollin'
Leave you when the summer comes along


Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe,
Baby, baby, I won't wanna leave you
I ain't jokin' woman, I got to ramble

Oh yeah, baby, baby,
I won't be there, really got to ramble
I can hear it callin' me the way it used to do
I can hear it callin' me back home

Babe oh baby, I won't leave you know
Oh baby, you know
I can hear it callin' me you know
Oh I can hear it callin' me
I can hear it callin' me the way it used to do,

I know, I know, I know
I never, never, never, never, never,
I'm gonna leave you baby
But I got to go away from this place,
I've got to quit
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby,
Baby, baby, baby oh
Can you hear it calling' me?

Woman, woman, I know, I know
It's good to have you back again
And I know that one day baby,
It's gonna really grow, yes it is
We gonna go walkin' through the park every day
What I say, every day, it's really growin'

It used to really, really good
You made me happy at the simple day
But now I have got to go away
Baby, baby, baby
That's when it's callin' me
Oh that's when it's callin' me back home
