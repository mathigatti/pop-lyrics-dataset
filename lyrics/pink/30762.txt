Some people like the summer when it's hot
Some people like the winter cold
Some people speak their minds when they want to
And some other people aren't so bold


Whatever it is that you do, you should do
You should do it with your head held high
So when you're doing your thing it's cause you want to
And they never can ask you why

I say do what you do, say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
Because it's your life, gotta make your own rules
And you got to do it your way

I say do what you do, say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
Because it's your life, gotta make your own rules
And you got to do it your way

Some, they like it easy
When others, they like it rough
But have nobody's gotta like it but you
Girl, boy, boy, girl, girl, girl, boy, boy
Whatever, you should do what you do

How could they tell you that you coulda-shoulda-woulda?
When you ask them, can they walk in your shoes?
Because it's your life and you do what you want to
And remember baby, it's all about you

I say do what you do, say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
Because it's your life, gotta make your own rules
And you got to do it your way

I say do what you do, say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
Because it's your life, gotta make your own rules
And you got to do it your way

So if it's on your mind
Then you should speak your peace
And say what you say
And if you want it done
Then you should get it done
And do it your way

So if it's on your mind
Then you should speak your piece
And say what you say
And if you want it done
Then you should get it done
And do it your way

I say do what you do, say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
Because it's your life, gotta make your own rules
And you got to do it your way

I say do what you do, say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
Because it's your life, gotta make your own rules
And you got to do it your way

I say do what you do, say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
Because it's your life, gotta make your own rules
And you got to do it your way

I say do what you do, say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
Because it's your life, gotta make your own rules
And you got to do it your way
