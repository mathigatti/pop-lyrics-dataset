Summertime,
And the living's easy now.
Fish are jumping out
And the Cotton's high,
So high.
Daddy's rich
And your mama is so good-looking now.
Hush, litle baby,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't you cry.
No, no, baby baby no, don't you cry!


Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for a train
When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
He rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon
Out of my dirty red bandana
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang blues
Windshield wipers slappin' time
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', I mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free
Yeah, feelin' good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
Yeah, feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby Mcgee

Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man - yeah!
Didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can?
Honey, you know I did!
And each time I tell myself that I, well I think I've had enough,
But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough.
I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and 
Take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Break it!
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, darling, yeah, 
Have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, hey
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good.
Oh, yes indeed.
