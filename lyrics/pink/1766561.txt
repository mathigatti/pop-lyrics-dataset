Made a wrong turn once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss No Way It's All Good
It didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated, look, I'm still around


Pretty, pretty please don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fucking perfect
Pretty, pretty please if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fucking perfect to me

You're so mean when you talk
About yourself, you are wrong
Change the voices in your head
Make them like you instead
So complicated, look how big we all make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh, oh

Pretty, pretty please don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fucking perfect
Pretty, pretty please if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fucking perfect to me

The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Estrange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that?
Why do I do that?
Why do I do that?

Yeah
Oh, oh pretty, pretty please
Pretty, pretty please don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fucking perfect
Pretty, pretty please if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fucking perfect to me, yeah
You're perfect, you're perfect to me
Pretty, pretty please if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fucking perfect to me
