I don't wanna be the girl who laughs the loudest
Or the girl who never wants to be alone
I don't wanna be there call at 4 o'clock in the morning
Cause I'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home


Aah, the sun is blinding
I stayed up again
Oh, I am finding
That that's not the way I want my story to end

I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain
Inside
You're my protection
So how do I feel this good sober?

I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me, cause it screams the truth
Please, don't tell me that we had that conversation (I know we did)
I won't remember, save your breath, 'cos what's the use?

Aah, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly: Come and play
I, I am falling
And If I let myself go I'm the only one to blame!

I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
Why do I feel this party's over?
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh
No pain
Inside
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober?

Coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
I'm looking for myself
Sober

Coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
Looking for myself
Sober

When it's good, then it's good, it's so good till it goes bad
Till you're trying to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, never again
Broken down in agony, just trying to find a friend, oh
Oh, whoa

I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me (nothing can touch me)
Why do I feel this party's over? (Why do I feel this party's over?)
No pain (no)
Inside (no)
You're like perfection
How do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)

I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
Why do I feel this party's over?
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh
No pain
Inside
You're like perfection
How do I feel this good sober?
How do I feel this good sober?
