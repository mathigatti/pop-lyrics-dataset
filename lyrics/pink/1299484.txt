Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeahhh la la la la la la

I love you so much I want to light you on fire, show you so hot you are.
I want you so bad, I want to punch you in your face, hit you till you see stars
I'm a passionate one and you're my masterpiece, but baby you must be warned
I'm a passionate one and I will break you to pieces, trust me I've done it before


I can't help it (I can't help it)
I'll put you on your knees
I can't help it (yeah yeah yeah)
I'll walk over you
Just to show you how I feel
- I'm in love with you

I love you so much I wanna slash your tyres to stop you from driving drunk
Come over here I want you to taste my poison, to stop you from eating drunk
I know you're the one 'cause you're not afraid. You're not afraid of me.
Let's give it some time, see if you get scared 'cause maybe you should be!

A little pain &amp; pleasure never hurt no-one
I promise to try to be better 'cause you're the only one

I can't help it (no, no, no)
I'll put you on your knees
I can't help it (yeah yeah yeah)
And I'll walk over you
Just to show you how I feel
- I'm in love with you

I can't help it (Can't help it)
I'll take you like a whore
And when I am done with you
I'll feel no remorse
- I'm in love with you

A little pain &amp; pleasure never hurt no-one
Yeah Yeah Yeah, I can't help it. No No No!

I can't help it (no, no, no)
I'll put you on your knees (I'll put you on your knees!)
I can't help it (yeah yeah yeah)
And I'll walk over you
Just to show you how I feel
- I'm in love with you

I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it. I'm in love with you.
