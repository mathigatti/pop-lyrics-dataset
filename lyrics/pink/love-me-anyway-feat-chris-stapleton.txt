Even if you see my scars
Even if I break your heart
If we're a million miles apart
Do you think you would walk away?
If I get lost in all the noise
Even if I lose my voice
Flirt with all the other boys
What would you say?


Could you?
Could you?
Could you?
Love me anyway?

Is it for better or for worse?
Or am I just your good time girl?
Can you still hold me when it hurts?
Or would you walk away?
Even if I scandalize you
Cut you down and criticize you
Tell a million lies about you
What would you say?

Could you? (You)
Could you? (You)
Could you? (You)
Could you love me anyway?

Could you? (Could you)
Could you? (Could you)
Could you?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you?

Could you? (Could you still love me?)
Could you? (Pick up the pieces of me)
Could you? (Could you still love me?)
Could you love me anyway?

Could you? (Could you still love me?)
Could you? (Pick up the pieces of me)
Could you? (Could you still love me?)
Could love me anyway?

Could you? (Could you catch me when I fall?)
Could you? (And we rise above it all)
Could you? (And hold me when it hurts)
Like it's the end of the world

Could you?
Could you?
Could you?
