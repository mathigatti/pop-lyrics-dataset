Motorcycles in the parking lot
Revving their engines and it just won't stop
Matches and noise screaming in my head
Houston I think we got a problem


Where does everybody go when they go?
They go so fast, I don't think they know
We hate so fast and we love too slow
London I think we got a problem

And when I think about it
I just can't think about it
I try to drink about it
I keep spinning

Ave Mary A
Where did you go? Where did you go?
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad?
Help me let go
Of the chaos around me, the devil that hounds me
I need you to tell me
Child, be still
Child be still

Broken hearts all around the spot
I can't help thinkin that we lost the plot
Suicide bomber and a student shot
Tokyo I think we got a problem

But for that they got a pill
If that don't kill you, then the side effects will
If we don't kill each other, then the side effects will
Cape Town I think we got a problem

Ave Mary A
Where did you go? Where did you go?
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad?
Help me let go
Of the chaos around me, the devil that hounds me
I need you to tell me
Child, be still

If the darkest hour comes before the light…
Where is the light?
Where is the light?
If the darkest hour comes before the light…
Where is the light?
Where is the light?
Where is the light?
Yeah

Ave Mary A
Where did you go? Where did you go?
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad?
Help me help me let go
Of the chaos around me, the devil that hounds me
I need you to tell me
Child, be still
Child, be still
Child, be still
