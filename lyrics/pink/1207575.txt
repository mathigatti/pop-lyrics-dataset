Unidentified flying object in space
If I were identified you couldn't make me erase
You never understood me and I'd have to applaud
It's lonely out here alone
But I can't be what I'm not


You can be all the writing
On the wall
That you want
I'll be the line across it
But I'll blow your mind
I'll blow your mind

And all the others can shine
But not like I can shine
You could have set me free
If you'd eased up on the line
It's supposed to be quiet
But it's loud in this sky
I'll take care of the vultures with a glass of wine

You can be all the writing
On the wall
That you want
I'll be the line across it
But I'll blow your mind
I'll blow your mind
