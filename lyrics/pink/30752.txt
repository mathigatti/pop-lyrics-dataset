I do not trust, so I cannot love
(Cannot no man be trusted)
Oh, no, no, no
And I would not dare to open up
(This life of yours is dusted Pink)


Well my rent is past due
And now my car would not start
I hate the bus
(Well are not you glad you have somebody to talk to?)
Tell me what do they see
When they look at me
Do they see my many personalities?

Can you help me?
Does anybody hear me?
Can they even see me?
This is my reality, oh, oh

(Can it be my turn now, is it my turn Pink)
Said I will say it again
You are my only friend
(I protect you from the world)
(I basically protect you from yourself)
Though I cannot go on
I am not satisfied with this being the end
(This is just the beginning)

Tell me why cannot I just reach up and simply touch the sky
Tell me why I cannot spread my arms and fly and fly and fly
Tell me why cannot I say this, why cannot I do that
Tell me what they want from me, tell me how to act

Can you help me?
Does anybody hear me?
Can they even see me?
This is my reality, oh, oh

Can you help me?
Does anybody hear me?
Can they even see me?
This is my reality, oh, oh

So I am putting it all on the table (Tell them Pink)
You do not know me well enough to label me, sick, or even disturbed
When you break it down I am just two girls
Trying to blend, trying to vibe (Trying)
Trying to live just one life (So hard)
Everybody is got insanities
I got a split personality

Tell me why cannot I just reach up and simply touch the sky
(Why cannot you)
Tell me why I cannot spread my arms and fly and fly and fly
(You can)
Tell me why cannot I say this, why cannot I do that
(Just do it)
Tell me what do they want from me, tell me how to act
(I cannot, I cannot)

Can you help me?
Does anybody hear me?
Can they even see me?
This is my reality, oh, oh

Can you help me?
Does anybody hear me?
Can they even see me?
This is my reality, oh, oh

Can you help me?
Does anybody hear me?
Can they even see me?
This is my reality, oh, oh

Can you help me
(Talk to me, talk to me, do not ignore me, I cannot take it)
Do you hear me?
Do you see me every time?

(Oh calm down, it is not that serious, we will be just fine without them)
It is all mine
It is my reality it is just too much for me
(You are my friend, you are my friend, Pink! Pink!)
