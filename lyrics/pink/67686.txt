Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.....
[laughs]


We go where we like
We got over time
We get paid to rattle our chains

We go in the back
Paint our money black
Spend it on the enemy

Sleeping in the church
Riding in the dirt
Put a banner over my grave

Make a body work
Make a begger hurt
Sell me something big and untamed

CHORUS:
Now our time! Real good time!
(doo doo doo doo doo doo..)
Now our time! A real good time!
(doo doo doo doo doo doo..)
Now our time ("Said now our time!")
A real good time ("It's a really good time!")

Ba-a-a-a-by of mine!

We know how to pray
Party everyday
Make our desolation look plain

Riding in a rut
'Till the powers cut
We don't even have a good name

Sleeping in the church
Riding in the dirt
Put a banner over my grave

Make a body work
Make a begger hurt
Sell me something big and untamed

CHORUS:
Now our time! Real good time!
(doo doo doo doo doo doo..)
Now our time! A real good time!
(doo doo doo doo doo doo..)
Now our time! ("Now our really good time!")
A real good time!

Ba-a-a-a-by of mine!

Doo doo doo doo .... Baby .... I can fly...yeah
(Sell me something big and untamed)

CHORUS:
Now are time! Real good time ... Oh,
(doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Now our time! ("I said now our time")
(doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Real good time ("It's a really good time")
Now are time! Real good time!

Feel good! Real good!
It's the same old saying
Real good! Feel good!
Don't got no more brains

Feel good! Real good!
It's the same old saying....yeah
Feel good! Real good!
I don't got no more brain!

Ba-a-a-a-by of mine
