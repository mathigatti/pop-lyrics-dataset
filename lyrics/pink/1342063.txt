Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da-da da


I don't know if I can yell any louder
How many times have I kicked you outta here
Or said something insulting?
Da da da da-da

I can be so mean when I wanna be
I am capable of really anything
I can cut you into pieces
When my heart is... Broken

Da da da-da da
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me

How did I become so obnoxious?
What is it with you that makes me act like this?
I've never been this nasty
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest
But, baby, I don't mean it
I mean it, I promise

Da da da-da da
Please, don't leave me
Da da da-da da
Please, don't leave me
Da da da-da da
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me

I forgot to say out loud how beautiful you really are to me
I can't be without you, you're my perfect little punching bag
And I need you, I'm sorry

Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da-da da
Please, please, don't leave me

Baby, please, don't leave me
No, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this

Please, don't leave me
Baby, please, please, don't leave me
