[Sia]
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall


[P!nk]
Oh, I'm in the jungle now
You've been seeking, I've been hiding out
Use your love, it scares me so deep down
You may find me, cause my heart beats loud, so loud
It beats fast
In the places where you touched me last
I can feel the burn my skin, it has
But the return of your beloved hands, hands

[Sia]
I've lost control
I paddle, but you're too strong
But I gotta trust your flow
Cause boy, I'm in your waterfall
Oh, I've lost control
And babe, it's a relief to know
I got you keeping me afloat
When I'm in your waterfall

[Sia &amp; P!nk]
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall

I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall

[Sia]
Baby, you're my oxygen
When I cannot find my way on Earth
You know I can be when I hold on
Even when the rapid's strong

[P!nk]
I've lost control
I paddle, but you're too strong
But I gotta trust your flow
Cause babe, I'm in your waterfall
But I've lost control
And babe, it's a relief to know
I got you keeping me afloat
When I'm in your waterfall

[Sia &amp; P!nk]
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall

[Sia &amp; P!nk]
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh
Waterfall
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh
Waterfall

[Sia &amp; P!nk]
I've lost control
I paddle, but you're too strong
But I gotta trust your flow
Cause boy, I'm in your waterfall (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, I've lost control
And babe, it's a relief to know
I got you keeping me afloat
When I'm in your waterfall

[Sia &amp; P!nk]
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall (yeah, yeah)
I'm in your waterfall (I'm in your waterfall)
I'm in your waterfall (I'm in your waterfall)

I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall
