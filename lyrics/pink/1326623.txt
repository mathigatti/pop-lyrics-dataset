So many rights you have, 
leave your girl
But I'm here 
to hear all your problems, 
and tell you I understand
Falling in 
and out of love with her now 
As I watched all I can see 
is you being with me 
I know you feel like a fool
Being used, paying dues, 
afraid of your love, 
then its taken advantage of 
You don't have to live 
a life full of strife 
Take my hand 
and I'll be the leader
You can depend on 


Chorus: 
You could be living in my world 
Sharin' my time, being the one 
You stare in the face of love 
long enough to see
You can be living in my world
You'll never shed another tear 
And I'll never stop the love
I'll give you all of me 

With open eyes and ears 
I can hear your cries 
Come from the inside, 
but baby its alright
You can just let it go 
I'm your friend 
Sitting here 
willing to listen
oh baby see that 
You don't have to live 
like you do come with me, 
be my king, 
I'll be by your side 
just let me know what to do 
Only one goal in mind: 
take your heart, share with mine 
Make you believe so you can see that 

Chorus 

Only takes one look to see 
That she's a fool and you should just 
Come with me and I will be all that you need 
There's no dreams we can't make real
And there's no feeling we can't feel I'm just 
Wanting you, needing you, dont you know?
