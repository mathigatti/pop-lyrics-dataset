I like to think that i'm a pretty good kisser
I like to think I maybe broke a few hearts
But since I met you I'm a victim of disaster
I like to think I got it down to an art


So here's where the problem starts
You're shittin' on my heart
Oh I can't take it again and again and again

All I wanted from you
Was a night maybe two
You beat me at my own game
Now It's not okay
I'm the one that's missing out
All i needed to do
Was get just a taste of you
And now I'm sick all in my head
You poisened me instead
Trust me, trust me, I think I got heartbreak down

I like to wake and go to bed around whenever
I like to maybe come and go when I choose
But now I'm waiting for a text, call, whatever (Oh, fucking call me, fuck!)
What's gotten into me, besides you? (Oops!)
You're like a rush, you're like a drug, it's just the sight of you
I like to think that I could kick you but it's what you do
You knew we could be
What's the lord think of me
But you're so fuckin' weak I find it hard for me to breathe

So here's where my story ends
I got to make amends
I let me down
again and again and again and again

All I wanted from you
Was a night maybe two
You beat me at my own game
Now It's not okay
I'm the one that's missing out
All i needed to do
Was get just a taste of you
And now I'm sick all in my head
You poisened me instead
Trust me, trust me, I think I got heartbreak down

Here's what we have to do
Say it again and keep it true
Can't be strong too late for cool
I won't live without you
You are not rid of me

All I wanted from you
Was a night maybe two
You beat me at my own game
Now It's not okay
I'm the one that's missing out
All i needed to do
Was get just a taste of you
And now I'm sick all in my head
You poisened me instead
Trust me, trust me, I think I got heartbreak down
