Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren
Eh oh eh oh
We don't want no problems
We don't like them, keep it movin


Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh

I just wanna play
Big city holiday
So get out of my way
If you know what's better for you

I'm tearin' up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not lookin' for a fight, no
Eh oh eh oh

High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb, about to blow
Eh oh eh oh

Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren
Eh oh eh oh
We don't look for trouble
Just enough to
Seeing double

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh

Drink some Pink champagne
I don't know you yet
But we'll forget, so
Fuck what they say
Let's run the floor until it breaks

I'm tearin' up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not lookin' for a fight, no
Eh oh eh oh

High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb, about to blow
Eh oh eh oh

Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren
Eh oh eh oh
We don't look for trouble
Just enough to
Seeing double
Eh oh eh oh

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh

(Eminem)
Yep, yep
Nothin' high class in my glass, only bottles I pop
Are bottles of pop so when I pop up in the spot
Im prob-ably not gonna be wantin' to pop bubbly
Or Ciroc, I'm not Puffy, but I'mma run this city tonight
When I hit it, I might act like a frickin' idiot
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight
Big city lights, little indignity, hot diggity
This Biggie is gettin' me hype.
I don't get some liquor, I'll hurt you!
I'll knock your dick in the dirt, bickerin' worse
Than that bitch in that Snickers commercial
A mixture of Stifler and Urkel
Hangin' from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this buildin'
Cuz we're tearin' it down, security get out
The frickin' way, Jesus Christ, son the blaring is loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens goin' eeeeehhr, cause

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh
