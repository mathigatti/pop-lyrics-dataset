Am I sweating
Or are these tears on my face?
Should I be hungry?
I can't remember the last time that I ate
Call someone
I need a friend to talk me down


But one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, somebody gets it?
Put one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, somebody gets it?

All the lights are on, but I'm in the dark
Who's gonna find me, who's gonna find me?
Just one foot wrong
You'll have to love me when I'm gone

Does anyone see this?
Lucky me, I guess I'm the chosen one
Color in madness
First in line I put my money down
Some freedom
It's the tiniest cell, it's hell

But one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, somebody gets it?
Put one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, somebody gets it?

All the lights are on, but I'm in the dark
Who's gonna find me, who's gonna find me?
Just one foot wrong
You'll have to love me when I'm gone

Some people find the beauty in all of this
I go straight to the dark side, the abyss
If it's bad, is it always my fault?
Or did somebody bring me down?
Did somebody bring me down?
Did somebody bring me down?

One foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
I put one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall

But one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, somebody gets it?
Just one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, somebody gets it?

All the lights are on, but I'm in the dark
Who's gonna find me, who's gonna find me?
Just one foot wrong
You'll love me when I'm gone

Have to love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone
You'll have to love me when I'm gone
You'll have to love me when I'm gone
