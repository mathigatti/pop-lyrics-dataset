I'm so sad, I'm so sad...everything is just bad, just bad. It's just bad.
Yeah, thanks..thank you, yeah thank you


Uh…F**K IT (laughs)

I've been moping around I can't get outta my bed
I'm so damn tired I can't get outta my head
The only time I smile is when I brush my teeth
The sex last night sucked I woulda rather been asleep

It's been a bad, bad day but who gives a s**t (Huh?)
I could be sad all day but I don't feel like it (No!)
I feel like "Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh"
I feel like "Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh"
I feel like "Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh"
I feel like "EH EH EH..EH EH EH EH EH"

It's two in the mornin' someone tell me why's there's traffic
I wish I had a bumper car, I'd road-rage your *** with it
I guess I have a choice I don't have to be this grumpy
'Cause there's plenty of other losers got it way worse than me

It's been a bad, bad day but who gives a s**t (Huh?)
I could be sad all day but I don't feel like it (No!)

I feel like "Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh"
I feel like "Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh"
I feel like "Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh"
I feel like "EH EH EH..EH EH EH EH EH EHHH OWWW"

Coupla deep breaths *breaths*
There I feel better already *breaths*
Couple more *breaths*
Damn what could it be *breaths*
See we should all be happy *breaths*
50 Cent said we could all lick his lollipop,
He's gonna take us to the candy shop

I feel like "Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh"
I feel like "Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh"
I feel like "Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh"
I feel like "Eh eh eh..eh eh eh eh eh"

Come with me
Take my hand
Let's climb some trees
Throw me in the air
Laugh with me (we'll have so much fun)
Smile with me (yay)
Play with me
Can't we all just get along?
Yeah, yeah
