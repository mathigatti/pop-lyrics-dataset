This bed is just an island where it doesn't have you
Roll over seven times and there will still be tons of room
Alarm is going off choking coughing spit the reasons why you won't call me back
I got a Clue
This shit is crazy did I just get lazy?
Figured it was fine, finally hear you say "I'm out, see you later"
Blows my mind
I need a shrink just to tell me what I think (but I already know the answer to that one)


[CHORUS]
I won't know just when you faded
Count the times how long I waited for this moment to arrive
I push you away
I push you away
I push you away
Now You're gone
You're Gone
You're Gone
I push you away
I push you away
I push you away
For so long
So Long
So Long

You're looking better more than ever
oh, How can it be?
I'm feelin *****ty from the pity I've been giving me.
I'm getting emails from my friends
all saying "What's the deal? You can't just act normal like it never happened"
I took your toothbrush off the sink and then I put it back
I rearranged the closets manics swinging from the racks??
I've always hated that your shoes smell like tennis balls
but now I kinda really miss it...

I won't know just when you faded
Count the times how long I waited for this moment to arrive
I push you away
I push you away
I push you away
Now You're gone
You're Gone
You're Gone
I push you away
I push you away
I push you away
For so long
So Long
So Long
I thought I could do this
I thought I was strong
To pick up the pieces of where we belong
I push You away
I push you away
Now You're gone

I know I said, "That you don't own me, just leave me alone (I'm lonely)"
I wish you'd never listen to meâ€¦.

(Yeah!)
Yeahhhh!

[CHORUS]
I push you away
I push you away
I push you away
Now You're gone
You're Gone
You're Gone
I push you away
I push you away
I push you away
For so long
So Long
So Long
I thought I could do this
I thought I was strong
To pick up the pieces of where we belong
I push You away
I push you away
Now You're gone
