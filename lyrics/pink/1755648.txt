Right right, turn off the lights
We gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the deal, yo?


I love when it's all too much
Five a.m. Turn the radio up
Where's the rock and roll?

Party crasher
Panty snatcher
Call me up if you want a gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs
We will never be never be, anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass

Slam slam, oh hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out (freak out already)
Can't stop, comin' in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now (so fuckin' on right now)

Party crasher
Panty snatcher
Call me up if you want a gangsta

And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass
Won't you come on and come on and raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass

(Oh shit my glass is empty, that sucks)
So if you're too school for cool
And you're treated like a fool
(Treated like a fool)
You can choose to let it go
We can always, we can always
Party on our own

(So raise your, ah fuck)

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs
We will never be never be, anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks

We will never be never be, anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass
Won't you come on and come on and raise your glass (for me)
Just come on and come on and raise your glass (for me)
