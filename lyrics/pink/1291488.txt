Hahaha
We're gonna rock and roll
Ra Ra
Alright I drink more than you
I party harder than you do
And my car's faster than yours too


P I N K
P I M P
I'm back again
I know ya'll missed me
I'm so so sick
Can't handle it
Yeah I talk ****
Just deal with it

My rims are 23 inch
And they're black on black
No they're not his
Diamonds all over my teefs
You can try and try you can't be me

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm ***ked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cuz I can
[ice cream, ice cream, we all want ice cream]

You know I'm rare
You stop and stare
You think I care
I don't
You talk real loud
But you aint saying nothing cool
I could fit your whole house in my swimming pool

My life's a fantasy
That you're not smart enough to even dream
My ice is making me freeze
You can try and try you can't be me

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm ***ked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cuz I can
[ice cream, ice cream, we all want ice cream]
Yeah

Uh
Break it down
It's tough times out here ya know what I'm sayin mmhmm
Yeah I'm super thick
People say I'm much too chic
Come and kiss the ring
You just might learn a couple things
I'm trying to school you dog
Roof roof roof roof roof roof roof
I'm your worst nightmare
Bring it we can take it
What are you scared

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm ***ked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cuz I can
[ice cream, ice cream, we all want ice cream]
Yeah

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm ***ked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules I make my own
Tonight
I'll do what I want
Cuz I can
[ice cream, ice cream, we all want ice cream]
Yeah!
