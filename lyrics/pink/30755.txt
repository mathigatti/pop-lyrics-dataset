Please don't come around talkin' bout that you love me
Cause that love shit just ain't for me
I don't wanna hear that you adore me
And I know that all you're doing is running your mind games
Don't you know that game beats game?
So your best bet is to be straight with me


So you say you wanna talk, let's talk
If you won't talk I'll walk, yeah, it's like that
Got a new man, he's waiting out back
Now what, whatcha' think about that?
Now when I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically I'm through with you
Whatcha' wanna say?
Had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay

There you go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talkin' about you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talkin' bout you miss me so
That you love me so, why I let you go?
Yeah you know, cause your lies got old
Look at you, there you go

Please don't come around talkin' bout how you changed
How you said goodbye to what's her name
All it sounds like to me is new game
And I was right when I thought I'd be much better off withoutyou
Had to get myself from round you,
Cause my life was all about you

So you say you wanna talk, I don't
Say you wanna change, I won't
Yeah it's like that
Had your chance, won't take you back
Now what, whatcha' think about that?
And when I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically I'm through with you
Whatcha' wanna say?
Had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay

There you go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talkin' about you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talkin' bout you miss me so
That you love me so, why I let you go?
Yeah you know, 'cause your lies got old
Look at you, there you go

Oooh, don't you wish you could turn the hands of time?
Don't you wish that you still were mine?
Don't you wish I'd take you back?
Don't you wish that things were simple like that?
Didn't miss a good thing til' it's gone
But I knew it wouldn't be long
Til' you came running back, missing my love there you go

There you go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talkin' about you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talkin' bout you miss me so
That you love me so, why I let you go?
Yeah you know, 'cause your lies got old
Look at you, there you go
