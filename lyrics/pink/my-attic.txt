My attic is full of pages, full of crazy
Cluttered spaces that you could not cross
My attic is full of bones and full of hopeless
Young emotions that just won't grow up


I keep hiding the keys in all these
Places even I can't find
Hoping, one day, you'll find them all
And I wanna let you see inside my attic

Inside this olive skin are paper thin
Illusions that I'm tougher than I am
And I'm guarded, castle walls from all the falls
And break up calls and never should have beens

But don't go pushing too hard
I'm not so easy to manipulate
I will give you all of my secrets
If you promise you can brave my attic

And I swear, not tryna be vindictive
I'm just terrified that you might see me different
You'll change your mind, tell me that I'm crazy
Tell me that I'm okay, tell me that you'll stay

'Cause my attic is silver plans and one night stands
That numbers can't begin to calculate
My attic is up the stairs and waiting there
Are lonely nights, they keep me wide awake

I keep hiding the keys in all these
Places even I can't find
Hoping, one day, you'll find them all
'Cause I wanna let you see inside my attic

My attic, my attic, my attic
My attic, my attic
