Have you ever fed a lover
With just your hands?
Closed your eyes and trusted
Just trusted?
Have you ever thrown a fist
Full of glitter in the air?
Have you ever looked fear in the face
And said, "I just don't care?"


It's only half past
The point of no return
The tip of the iceberg
The sun before the burn
The thunder before the lightning
The breath before the phrase
Have you ever felt this way?

Have you ever hated yourself
For staring at the phone?
Your whole life waiting on the ring
To prove you're not alone
Have you ever been touched
So gently you had to cry?
Have you ever invited
A stranger to come inside?

It's only half past
The point of oblivion
The hourglass on the table
The walk before the run
The breath before the kiss
And the fear before the flames
Have you ever felt this way?

There you are
Sitting in the garden
Clutching my coffee
Calling me sugar
You called me sugar

Have you ever wished
For an endless night?
Lassoed the moon and the stars
And pulled that rope tight?
Have you ever held your breath and asked yourself
"Will it ever get better than tonight?"
Tonight
