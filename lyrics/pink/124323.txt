I gave you three years of my life
You always said I'd be your wife
Whatever happened to the days when
Life was simple? (So simple)
Everyone knows my name
I haven't changed, I'm the same girl
I was from the start
Everything's rearranged, you came
And changed it and gave me a broken heart
You don't wanna work it out, no
You wanna take the easy route



Chorus:
You throw your hands up and walk away
When times get hard you always walk away
You get mad and say you're leavin'
Why is it so damn hard for you to talk to me?
When it's so easy for you to walk away


So here I am, driving down the street
Lookin' for a sign, when will I meet
The man of my dreams?
When will he come to me?
When will he come to me?
'Cause I'm sick of trying.
I'm goin' home back
To PA where I come from
And you can stay here and spend your
Whole life running, but baby I'm
Gonna move on
You didn't wanna work it out, no
You wanna take the easy route


Chorus:
You throw your hands up and walk away
When times get hard you always walk away
But sorry baby, but I'm leaving
It was just too hard for you to talk to me?
And now it's my turn, I'm gonna do the same


So there I go, I'm leavin' you alone
What will you do, now all your fears
Came true
You had my heart, you had my soul
You had it all - didn't you
But I'm sick of tryin' I'm goin' home
Back to Philly where I come from
And you can stay here and spend your
Whole life running, but baby it's
Time to move on
You don't wanna work it out, no
You wanna take the easy route

Chorus (Out)
