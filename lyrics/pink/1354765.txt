I'd conjure up the thought of being gone
But I'd probably even do that wrong
I try to think about which way
Would I be able to and would I be afraid


Cause, oh, I'm bleeding out inside
And, oh, I don't even mind

It's all your fault
You called me beautiful
You turned me out and now I can't turn back
I hold my breath
Because you were perfect
But I'm running out of air, and it's not
Fair

Dadadadadadadadada
Dadadadadadadadadadadadada

I'm trying to figure out what else to say
(what else could I say?)
To make you turn around and come back this way
(would you just come back this way?)
I feel like we could be really awesome together
So make up your mind, cause it's now or never, oh

It's all your fault
You called me beautiful
You turned me out and now I can't turn back
I hold my breath
Because you were perfect
But I'm running out of air, and it's not
Fair

I would never pull the trigger
But I've cried wolf a thousand times
I wish you could feel as bad as I do
I have lost my mind

It's all your fault
You called me beautiful
You turned me out and now I can't turn back
I hold my breath
Because you were perfect
But I'm running out of air, and it's not
Fair

Oh yeah
It's all your fault
I hold my breath
Because you were perfect
But I'm running out of air, and it's not
Fair
