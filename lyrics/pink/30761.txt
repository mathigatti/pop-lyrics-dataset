Chorus
I ain't looking for a steady thing
I ain't looking for what love brings
I'm still young and I ain't ready babe
I'm still looking for some better days
I don't want to give you everything
I just want to make you feel things
If you ain't down to give me everything
Just throw it away


Verse1
Don't assume cause I'm a woman and I'll fall in love
Don't expect a million needs to be took care of
Don't wanna hear you've got what I need
Cause how would you know before we speak
You've got to understand my side
I had a crazy, crazy life
Nobody came along to open up my eyes
You better take what you can get
Don't even bother with my heart
If I get a feeling I won't let it start

Chorus

Verse 2
Please believe me I've been down this road and back again
Learned a lesson and it was that love is not a friend
The day I put my trust in you
Will be the day I'll say,  "I do"
Don't expect me just to open up,
Maybe I'm just a little scared
Please don't tell me what you think I wanna hear
Oh baby save it, I've heard it all before
There aint nothing you could say
Thats gonna make me change my ways

Chorus

Bridge
So stop falling. Stop falling
You know you're falling, for me.
Stop falling. Stop falling.
Stop falling, for me

Verse 3
You've got to understand my side
I've had a crazy, crazy life
Nobody came along to open up my eyes
Oh baby, take what you can get
Don't even bother with my heart
If I get a feeling I won't let it start

Chorus

Stop falling
