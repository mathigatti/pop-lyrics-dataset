There's a whole n'other conversation going on
In a parralell universe
Where nothig breaks and nothing hurts
There's a waltz playing frozen in time
Blades of grass on tiny bare feet
I look at you and you're looking at me


Could you beam me up?
Give me a minute, I don't know what I'd say in it
Probably just stare, happy just to be there holding your face
Beam me up
Let me be lighter, tired of being a fighter
I think, a minute's enough
Just beam me up

Some black birds soaring in the sky
Barely a breath, I caught one last sight
Tell me that was you, saying goodbye
There are times I feel the shiver and cold
It only happens when I'm on my own
I tell ya, tell me, I'm not alone

Could you beam me up?
Give me a minute, I don't know what I'd say in it
I'd probably just stare, happy just to be there, holding your face
Beam me up
Let me be lighter, tired of being a fighter
I think, a minute's enough
Just beam me up

In my head I see your baby blues
I hear your voice and I, I break in two and now there's
One of me, with you

So when I need you can i send you a sign
I'll burn a candle and turn off the lights
I'll pick a star and watch you shine

Just beam me up
Give me a minute, I don't know what I'd say in it
Probably just stare, happy just to be there, holding your face
Beam me up
Let me be lighter, tired of being a fighter
I think, a minute's enough
Beam me up (x3)
Could you beam me up?
