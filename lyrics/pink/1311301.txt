Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

I guess I just lost my husband
I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money
I'm not gonna pay his rent (nope!)
I got a brand new attitude
And I'm gonna wear it tonight
I wanna get in trouble
I wanna start a fight

Na na na na na na na
I wanna start a fight
Na na na na na na na
I wanna start a fight

So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you

And guess what?
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool

So, so what?
I am a rockstar
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

Uh, check my flow, uh

The waiter just checked my table
And gave to Jessica Simp (shit!)
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy
At least he'll know how to hit
What if this song's on the radio
Then somebody's gonna die
I'm gonna get in trouble
My ex will start a fight

Na na na na na na na
He's gonna start a fight
Na na na na na na na
We're all gonna get in a fight!

So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you

And guess what?
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool

So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

You weren't there
You never were
You wanted all
But thats not fair
I gave you life
I gave my all
You weren't there
You let me fall

So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you

And guess what?
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done (we're done)
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright (I'm alright), I'm just fine (I'm just fine)
And you're a tool

So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight
(I don't want you tonight)

No no, no no
I don't want you tonight
You weren't fair
(I'm gonna show)
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool

So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
(And I don't want)
I don't want you tonight

Ba da da da da da
