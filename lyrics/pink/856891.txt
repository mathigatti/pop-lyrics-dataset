Take Y
Take the letter
Take it out on the alphabet
Dont ask me why
No more questions
Just accept it for the way it is


Words are just words
They get in my way

I can never say what I wanna say
Who will understand it anyway?
It's just a waste

Take M
Mmm mmm
It's so lovely, so delicious, it says it all
I don't like X
Ex-boyfriends, ex-girlfriends
Exactly what I don't need
Twisting my words so easily

Words are just words
They get in my way

See like right now, I wanna tell you that I love you
but I don't know how..
Put the H with the A with the T-E,
give it power, you could destroy me
Put the L, with the O with the V-E,
Give that power and you don't have to say anything

Words are just words
They get in my way
Bla bla bla bla
Blaaaa

Words are just words
They get in my way
Words are just words
They get in my way

Take B,
and just let it be, B...
