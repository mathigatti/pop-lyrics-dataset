Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I your willing victim


I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)

Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happening)

Now you've been having real bad dreams, oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Our love, our love, love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

I've never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough

You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

We can learn to love again
We can learn to love again
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
