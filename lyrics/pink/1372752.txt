Show me, show me, show me
How you do that trick
"The one that makes me scream," she said
"The one that makes me laugh," she said
And threw her arms around my neck
Show me how you do it
And I promise you, I promise that
I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you


Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face, I kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
"Why are you so far away," she said
"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you,
That I'm in love with you?"

You... soft and only
You... lost and lonely
You... strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water, you're just like a dream
Just like I have a dream

Daylight whipped me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I open up my eyes
I find myself alone, alone, alone
Above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me.

You... soft and only
You... lost and lonely
You... just like heaven
