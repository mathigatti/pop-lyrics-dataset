One step, two steps
Counting tiles on the floor
Three steps, four steps
Guess this means that I'm a whore
Uh oh, hell no
How long 'til I reach the door?
Fuck me, my feet are sore


I'm wearing last night's dress
And I look like a hot ass mess
Although my hair looks good
'Cause I haven't slept yet

Make the elevator come a little faster
I'm pushing all the buttons
But nothing's happenin'
Please, God, don't let anybody see me
Please, God, I'll do anything you ask of me
I promise no more walks of shame

So walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
Walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)

Last night's bubble gum
No more bubbles, no more yum
Where'd I get the wristband?
Tell me there's no tramp stamp

One, two, three, shoot
No I know that shit ain't cute
But damn the man it sure is fun
Party 'til the sun wakes up

Ok now raise two hands if
You've ever been guilty
And clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
It out if you've walked with me

Make the elevator come a little faster
I'm pushing all the buttons
But nothing's happenin'
Please, God, don't let anybody see me
Please, God, I'll do anything you ask of me
I promise no more walks of shame

So walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
Walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)

I shouldn't have let
Them take my keys, take my keys
They left me here with too much beer
My friends they hung me out to dry
It's not my fault and that's why
I'm doin' the walk of shame

Make the elevator come a little faster
I'm pushing all the buttons
But nothing's happening
Please, God, don't let anybody see me
Please, God, I'll do anything you ask of me
I promise no more walks of shame

So walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
Walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
So walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
Walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
