I am recovering
The faith of a child
By a part of my heart
I was reckless and wild
I am recovering
The hope that I lost
The part of my soul
That paid the cost


Little by little, day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil, oh
Take back my piece of mind

I am recovering
Anxiety addict
A broken perfectionist
Somewhat erratic
I am recovering
A constant regretter
Hold it against her
At least till forever

Little by little, day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil, oh
Take back my piece of mind

Hold me
As I fall apart, baby
Hold me
Here in the dark
Cause the old me
Run just as far as I could from my heart
Well, I'm going back to the start

Little by little, day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil, oh
Take back my piece of mind
Tell him I love him, yeah
Take back my piece of mind
