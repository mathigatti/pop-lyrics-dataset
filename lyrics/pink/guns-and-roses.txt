Aye have you ever loved somebody so much you can’t stand it but can’t do without him?
Do anything for him cuz you truly do adore him
Like dedicate songs, write poems
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore him
But you feel like they feel like you ain’t right for him
Therefore your heart’s torn
Between being with him forever, leaving him never
But it seem like you argue and fighting over whatever
Maybe we can leave, find someone better
Even though you will, you never know none better
My heart says nah, she can’t leave me never
Been head over heels since the very day i met er
Feel so deep in love i ain’t been able to get up
Sometimes i want some peace of mind cause she don’t shut up
Love her to death, don’t know whether to kiss er or kill er


Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
Now we’re just too dumb to notice
Every paper
Even love couldn’t save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

And we don’t know which one to choose
But either way, we’re gonna lose
Stupid paper
Even love couldn’t save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

Hah, i guess i’d rather suffer with her than be miserable without er
I ball out of prada, gucci, and belinciaga
They keep her content, you keep down the nonsense
With every corner we turn, around the conflict
Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with?
Where the fuck have you been? your pants – they don’t fit
Really, honestly speaking, some things i don’t get
No matter how much she try she can’t make it make more sense
Therefore, here we go again
Screaming, yelling at the top of our lungs, she going in
Seeing the kind of shit i be like if you was a man
I would go in your shit, real, no shit
But i love her so much that i can’t forget
That the feel of a kiss, it could heal when i’m sick
Still, i don’t like to feel like this
If i wouldn’t miss er, i would try to get a kill right there

Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
Now we’re just too dumb to notice
Every paper
Even love couldn’t save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

And we don’t know which one to choose
But either way, we’re gonna lose
Stupid paper
Even love couldn’t save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

Every time we say our goodbyes
A little piece of my heart breaks off inside
I don’t really ever know why
If i could live without you i’d try

Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
Now we’re just too dumb to notice
Every paper
Even love couldn’t save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

And we don’t know which one to choose
But either way, we’re gonna lose
Stupid paper
Even love couldn’t save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
