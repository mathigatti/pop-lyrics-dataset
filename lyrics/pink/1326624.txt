I never thought that it would be,
Not in my wildest dream,
I've realised that your not the one for me,
So why can't you see,that,
I gave my all to you,
But you proved my love untrue,
So tell me boy what am I supposed to do,
About you,about you you you oh o


(Chorus)

I gave you what you wanted,
I gave you what you need, I walked the fire for ya,
But now I'm gonna leave,
I'm leaving for the last time (I said I'm leaving for the last time),
And now my eyes are open,
Won't be a fool no more,
I built my world around ya,
And now I'm out the door,
I'm leaving for the last time.

(Verse 2)

Days! and night would pass me by,
And all I did was cry,
Cause all the promises you told me where lies,
So why did you deceive me?
Now there's nothing left to do,
But get away from you,
I wish the way that I felt was so untrue,
About you,
About you you you oh o

(Chorus)

I gave you what you wanted,

I gave you what you need,
I walked the fire for you,
But now I'm gonna leave,
I'm leaving for the last time (I said I'm leaving for the last time)
And now my eyes are open,
Won't be a fool no more,
I built my world around ya,
And now I'm out the door (I'm leaving for the last time)

(Bridge)

I never thought that you would treat me this way,
Turn around and think that it is ok,
Boy you know that you hurt me,
And I just cannot stay,
You did me wrong,
For so long,
I'm moving on,
I'm moving on,
I'm leaving for the last time,
Leaving for the last time, No babe

(Chorus)

I gave you what you wanted,
I gave you what you need (Yes I did)
I walked the fire for ya (I, I , I'm)
I'm leaving for the last time (I said I'm leaving for the last time babe)
And now my eyes are open,
Won't be a fool no more,
I built my world around ya,
And now I'm out the door,
I'm leaving for the last time (I said I'm leaving for the last time baby)
