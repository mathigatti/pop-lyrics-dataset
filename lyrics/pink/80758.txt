i kinda noticed in one nightit's kinda wierd to me 
since your so fine
if it's up to me your face will change 
if you smile then that
should set the tone
just remember
and if you let go the music
should move your bones
just remember
(sing this song with me)can't nobody love ya like i love ya
you're a good girl and that's 
what makes me trust ya
late at night i talk to you
you will know the difference 
when i touch yasome people are so phony
nosey 'cause they lonely
aren't you sick of the same thing?
they say so and so is dating
love you or they hatin'
and it doesn't even matter anyway
'cause were here tonight
if you smile thne that
should set the tone
just remember baby
and if you let go the music should
move your bones
just remember
(sing this song with me)can't nobody love ya like i love ya
you're a good girl and that's 
what makes me trust ya
late at night i talk to you
you will know the difference 
when i touch yaif you give that chance 
to be your man(x2)maybe we'll fly the night away
(i just wanna love ya baby, girl) (x2)maybe we'll fly the night away
(i just wanna love ya baby, girl)can't nobody love ya like i love ya
you're a good girl and that's 
what makes me trust ya
late at night i talk to you
you will know the difference 
when i touch ya
