There was a 5.8 earthquake today
And it kinda got me thinking
I'd still have all my hate for you intact
Even if I lost everything


What did I say?
Why are you shaking your head?
You know you done me wrong
I may be crazy, it's all in my head
But I want you done and gone

Why did I ever like you?
What did I see?
Whatever it was must have been some kind of illusion
A magic trick on me

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

It's hard to believe I ever laughed at anything you said
Cos you're just not funny
Who would believe I'd let you do all those things?
Oh I guess the joke was on me

I tried to be zane, I've even asked all my friends
To help my let it slide but all I see is your face
In my favourite place
And I can't help but wonder why

Why did I ever like you?
What did I see?
Whatever it was must have been some kind of illusion
A magic trick on me

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Yeah, eh
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!

I tried to be zane, I've even asked all my friends
To help my let it slide but all I see is your face
In my favourite place
And I can't help but wonder why

Why did I ever like you?
What did I see?
Whatever it was must have been some kind of illusion
A magic trick on me, yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Tell me why did I
Why did I ever like you?
What did I see?
Whatever it was must have been some kind of illusion
A magic trick on me
