I wish i could live my life on an aeroplane
I'd have free drinks all day
And my stewardess would say


If you're under pressure
There's a mask above your head
Make sure yours is secure
Before you try to help your friend

Look out the window and see the sunshine
No more construction, destruction &amp; dying
I could float through the clouds with my cell phone turned off
as high as i can go and i never belong

CHORUS:
Recline my seat back
Kick off my shoes
Lay down my worries
I never crash &amp; burn
I'll never crash &amp; burn

If i lived my life on an aeroplane
I'd pick up all my friends and we'd drift away
Citizens of nowhere with no red &amp; blue divide
We'd leave the world where greed and propaganda multiplies

Everywhere is love
Everyone is love
Everwhere is love

CHORUS:
Recline my seat back
Kick off my shoes
Lay down my worries
I never crash &amp; burn
I'll never crash &amp; burn

No complications
No starring roles
We'd all have plenty
We'll never crash and burn
We'll never crash and burn

Everyone is love
Everywhere is love

RAPS

CHORUS:
Recline my seat back
Kick off my shoes
Lay down my worries
I never crash &amp; burn
I'll never crash &amp; burn
