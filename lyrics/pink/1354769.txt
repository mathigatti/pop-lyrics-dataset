Alright, sir
Sure, I'll have another one, it's early
3 olives, shake it up, I like it dirty
Tequila for my friend, it makes her flirty
Trust me


I'm the instigator of underwear
Showing up here and there
Uh oh (Oh no)
I'm always on a mission from the get-go (get-go)
So what if it's only 1:00 in the afternoon?
It's never too soon to send out all the invitations to the last night of your life

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party
It's genetic
It's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops, nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you

Alright, ma'am
Calm down, I know your son said he was at my house
He was the captain of the football team but I turned him out
He wasn't the first and he won't be the last, so tone it down
This happens all the time

I'm the story they tell, the alibi
They wanna go home, I ask them (why?)
It's daylight, (not night)
They might need a break from all the real life (get a life)
It gets to be too much sometimes
It's never too late to send out all the invitations to the last night of your life

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party
It's genetic
It's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops, nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you

I'm off to see the doctor
I hope she has a cure
I hope she makes me better
What does that even mean?
(We don't know!)

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party
It's genetic
It's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops, nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party
It's genetic
It's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops, nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party
It's genetic
It's electrifying
You can wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops, nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you

I'm a good excuse
To be a bad influence
On you, and you, and you

You're too tired
You're not too tired
