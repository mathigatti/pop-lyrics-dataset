I'm not a slut
I just love love


Tell me somethin' new
'Cause I've heard this
Okay I'll fuck you
A little taste test

You'll be my little friend
You'll be my little friend
You'll be my little friend

And they think we fall in love
But that's not it
Just want to get some
Ain't that some shit

You'll be my little friend
You'll be my little friend
You'll be my little friend
Yeaaaah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got a little piece of you-hoo
And it's just like woohoo
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am, woohoo
I'm a slut like you

You say you're lookin' for a foo-ood
And I'm just like: Me too
I'm gonna let ya know the truth
I'm a slut like you

Sitting with my friends
And we're picking
Who we might let in (that one?)
Them boys are starving

They're just our little friend (what?!)
They're just our little friend (huh!)
They're just our little friend
(Listen, you little fucker!)

You think you call the shots (no)
I just bought you some
Drink up your ride's gone
This might be fun

You're now my little friend
You're now my little friend
You're now my little friend
Yeaaaah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got a little piece of you-hoo
And it's just like woo-hoo
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am, woohoo
I'm a slut like you (I'm a slut like you)

You say you're lookin' for a foo-ood
And I'm just like: Me too
I'm gonna let ya know the truth
I'm a slut like you

You don't win a prize with your googly eyes
I'm not a cracker jack
You can't go inside
Unless I let ya Jack, or Sam
Fuck what's your name again?

You male come now
You caveman sit down
You shhh don't ruin it wow

And it's just like woo (is he still talking?)
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am, boo-hoo
I'm a slut like you

Woo-hoo
Looks like the joke's on you-hoo
So go home and cry like boo-hoo
I'm a slut like you

I got a little piece of you-hoo
And it's just like woo-hoo
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am, woohoo
I'm a slut like you

You say you're lookin' for a foo-ood
And I'm just like: Me too
I'm gonna let ya know the truth
I'm a slut like you (I'm a slut like you)
