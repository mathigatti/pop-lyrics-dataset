Silly you, silly me
To let you in and put a move on me
(Put a move on me)
Never once asked for love
Always took it for what it's worth, a memory


But I don't wanna meet on a lonely street
Where the talk is cheap
And the price is sweet
I'm not that girl
I'm not that girl
And you don't wanna see the other side of me
So I'mma hit ya off and I'mma set you free
Before you fall too deep
Don't fall too deep

He don't know
I'm gon be the one who's gonna let him go
Even if he wants to stay
I'll let him go
Cause all he wants from me is a private show, whoa

He's all talk
He thinks he knows
How this game is supposed to go for everyone
Still it seems he can't see
Thinks he's just using me, using me

But I don't wanna meet on a lonely street
Where the talk is cheap
And the price is sweet
I'm not that girl
I'm not that girl
And you don't wanna see the other side of me
So I'mma hit ya off and I'mma set you free
Before you fall too deep
Don't fall too deep

He don't know
I'm gon be the one who's gonna let him go
Even if he wants to stay
I'll let him go
Cause all he wants from me is a private show, whoa

He don't know
Maybe if he wasn't such a gigolo
I would let him stay
Instead I let him go
All he wants from me is a private show, whoa

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, he don't know

He don't know
I'm gon be the one who's gonna let him go
Even if he wants to stay
I'll let him go
Cause all he wants from me is a private show, whoa

He don't know
Maybe if he wasn't such a gigolo
I would let him stay
Instead I let him go
All he wants from me is a private show, whoa

(He don't know)
He don't know
Let him go
(Even if he wants to stay)
I'll let him go
Cause all he wants from me is a private show, oh

Oh he don't know, oh, oh
He don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah
