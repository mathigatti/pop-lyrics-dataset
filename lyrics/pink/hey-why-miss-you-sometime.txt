Ayy
Ah, haha


Big time like, oh, I need your love
Like, oh, I need your love
Baby boy, I'm falling in your love
We dominate this love
Big time Jack Daniels type of love
Titanic with your love
Waking up in Florida kind of love
We dominate this love
Big time like

Give it a minute
I know it's shit, but I love you
We're high, we're way above it
I need you out my head now
Give it a minute
We'll soon be gone, we'll forget it
We're high, so high above it
I need you out my life now

Hey, why you fucked up my life?
So hey, why do I miss you sometimes?
Thousand nights I've said goodbye, almost lost my mind
So hey, why do I miss you sometimes?

Big time like, oh, I need your love
Like, only need your love
Baby boy, I'd die without your love
You dominate me love
Big time Johnny Cash kind of love
McDonald's type of love
Can't find my clothes kind of love
We dominate this love
Big time like

Give it a minute
I know it's shit, but I love you
We're high, we're way above it
I need you out my head now
Give it a minute
We'll soon be gone, we'll forget it
We're high, so high above it
I need you out my life now

Hey, why you fucked up my life?
So hey, why do I miss you sometimes?
Thousand nights I've said goodbye, almost lost my mind
So hey, why do I miss you sometimes?

Oh damn, it's a shame
Everything that I want, you ain't really with it
Oh damn, it's a shame
It's a game that we play when we say we're in it
Oh damn, it's a pain
When you say that my heart ain't in it
Oh damn

I miss you sometimes, oh
We're high, we're way above it
I need you out my head now
Give it a minute
We'll soon be gone, we'll forget it
We're high, so high above it
I need you out my life now

(Hey, why)
Hey, why you fucked up my life?
So hey, why do I miss you sometimes?
Thousand nights I've said goodbye, almost lost my mind
So hey, why do I miss you sometimes?
