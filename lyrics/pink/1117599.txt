All right sunday night where are you?
Just kicking back from the things that you do
You want the big game, we want it too!


Hey jack it's a fact, the best show in town,
Sunday night football we ain't messing around
Al and john will make you crank up the sound...

Theo NFL best have come to play
For every fan there's just one thing left to say, ay, ay, ay...

I've been waiting all day for sunday night
The tough get rough in a primetime fight
The last one standing gets to turn out the lights
Cause I been waiting all day for sunday night

Sunday night football on NBC
The only game that you have to see
Don't need a ticket, all you need's a tv
Cause the nfl rocks on NBC
