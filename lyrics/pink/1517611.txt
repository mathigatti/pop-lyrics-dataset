Our gum's are black our teeth are falling out
We got spots on our backs so give it up and shout
We got Scurvy we need some vitamin C
We got Scurvy we need a lemon tree
We got Scurvy we just chillin' on the sea
Lets get this Scurvy started
A pirate ain't worthy
Till he got some Scurvy
Since you've got Scurvy on your nervy when you sing that song
Scurvy (Scurvy)
We got Scurvy (scurvy)
We got Scurvy (scurvy)
We got Scurvy (scurvy)
