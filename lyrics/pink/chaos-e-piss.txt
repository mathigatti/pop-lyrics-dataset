I thought that you were drivin' but you've given me the wheel,
there's rain clouds out there that you don't wanna feel,
Your anger's like a razor blade that's just too bloody real,
I thought that you would be here,
no, I just don't get it.


Hey I also feel things more than I should,
I don't relax very often, as often as I could.
I worry how the whole thing looks, it doesn't look good,
but I thought that you would be here,
no, I just don't get it.

And being clear gets too much for me, just like it does for you,
even though I want to, I want to, I don't

I don't feel like comin' down, no I don't
I don't feel like hidin' out, so I won't
I can't turn the volume down,
so I sit here in this chaos &amp; piss,
watchin' the storm passing.
Storms are beautiful,
right here is beautiful

I came all this way to be with you and you're already gone
If I was a good friend, I could write this wrong,
I'd kick away your crutches and make you walk on your own,
I really thought you'd be here
I just don't get it

Though it looks warm in the rabbit hole,
and I could go down with you,
even though I want to, I want to,
I won't.

I don't feel like comin' down, no I don't
I don't feel like hidin' out, so I won't
I can't turn the volume down,
so I sit here in this chaos &amp; piss,
watchin' the storm passing.
It's beautiful.

I'm a willow tree and you can't blow me over,
and my roots go deep in anger
and I don't wanna feel the way it still keeps me like a prisoner,
I wanna be here,
I wanna be here

No I don't feel like comin' down, no I don't
I don't feel like hidin' out, so I won't
I can't turn the volume down,
so I sit here in this chaos &amp; piss,
watchin' the storm passing.
Storms are beautiful,
this life is beautiful,
it is.
