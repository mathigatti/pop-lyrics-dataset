I'm walking uphill both ways, it hurts
I bury my heart here in this dirt
I hope it's a seed, I hope it works
I need to grow, here I could be
Closer to light, closer to me
I don't have to do this perfectly, yeah


Rain, it pours, rain, it pours
It's pouring on me
The rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Sowing the seeds of love and hope, love and hope
We don't have to stay, stuck in the way

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)

(Have I the courage to change?)
I'm walking uphill both ways, it hurts
(Have I the courage to change?)
I bury my heart here in this dirt
(Have I the courage to change today? Oh)
I hope it's a seed, I hope it works
(Have I the courage to change?)
I need to grow, here I could be
(Have I the courage to change?)
Closer to light, closer to me
(Have I the courage to change today? Oh)
I don't have to do this perfectly, yeah

See, I let the light in the darkest places
Let the sun shine, pain goes away
Nothing is permanent for me, yeah
Flowers, they bloom and fade away
The beauty, it happened inside me
Even if it's a memory, yeah

Rain, it pours, rain, it pours
It's pouring on me
The rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Sowing the seeds of love and hope, love and hope
We don't have to stay, stuck in the way

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)

(Have I the courage to change?)
I'm walking uphill both ways, it hurts
(Have I the courage to change?)
I bury my heart here in this dirt
(Have I the courage to change today? Oh)
I hope it's a seed, I hope it works
(Have I the courage to change?)
I need to grow, here I could be
(Have I the courage to change?)
Closer to light, closer to me
(Have I the courage to change today? Oh)
I don't have to do this perfectly, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)

I bury my heart here in this dirt (have I)
(Have I the courage to change today? Oh)
I hope it's a seed, I hope it works (have I, have I)
(Have I the courage to change?)
I need to grow, here I could be (ooh)
(Have I the courage to change?)
Closer to light, closer to me (ooh-ah)
(Have I the courage to change today? Oh)
I don't have to do this perfectly, yeah (have I)
Today, today
