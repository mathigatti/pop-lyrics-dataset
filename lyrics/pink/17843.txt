Shadows are fallin' all over town
Another night these blues got me down
Oh, misery, I sure could use some company


Since he's been gone I ain't been the same
I carry the weight like an ol' ball and chain
Guess it's all meant to be... For love to cause me misery

Oh, misery... Oh, misery...
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool out of me?
Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause me misery

Oh, I've been down this road before
Where the passion turns into pain
And each time I saw love walk out the door
I swore I'd never get caught again

But ain't it true... It takes what it takes
And sometimes, we get too smart too late

One more heartache for me

Another night in misery

Misery... Misery...
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool out of me?
Misery... Misery...
Tell me, why, why, why, why does my heart make a fool of me?

Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause misery
Guess it's all meant to be
For love to cause me misery... Misery...
