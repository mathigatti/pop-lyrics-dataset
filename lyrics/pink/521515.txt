I keep thinking 'bout that little sparkle in your eye
Is it a light from the angels or your devil demon inside?
And what about the way you say you love me all the time
Are you lifting me up to heaven just to drawn me down the line?


There's a ring around my finger
But will you change your mind?
And you tell me that I'm beautiful
But that could be a lie

Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
What if I'm falling for a heartbreaker
And everything is just a lie?
I won't be leaving here alive

I won't be leaving here alive, no

Temporary happiness is like waiting for the knife
That's why I'm always watching for someone to show their darker side
So maybe I'll seat back and just enjoy all this for now
Wash it out, play out, see if you really stick around

There's always this one question
That keeps me up at night
Are you my greatest love
Or disappointment in my life?

Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
What if I'm falling for a heartbreaker
And everything is just a lie?
I won't be leaving here alive

I might as well lay down and die

I'm holding on
With both hands and both feet
Oh, promise that you won't pull the rug out from under me

Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
I pray to God you're not a heartbreaker
This time around I won't survive
'Cause if I'm falling for a heartbreaker
And everything is just a lie
I won't be leaving here alive
I might as well lay down and die, oh

I won't be leaving here alive
