It didn't happen for you.
No one wants to hear the truth
Coming from three political queers
Plucking the punk rock groove.


So you break up the band
And leave us all in toe
And now we gotta figure out where to go.

I caught it at a rave
(Did it give you a vaccination?)
I saw it on my tv
(Did it lighten up your load?)
And every fucking dj
(Did you feel affiliated?)
Was telling me I'm free
(Like you really had a home?)

I'm free to be a loser
(Were the ticket prices too high?)
I'm free to be a trend
(Were the lights too bright?)
I'm free to be a backlash over and over
And over again
(Was it all a bunch of hype?)

You said I'm losing inspiration one band at a time
Cos I gotta know there's someone somewhere out there
Singing for our side.

I come up - share the mortar and the glue.
What we build together - we share that too.
And the wind may come, and the rain may fall,
But we stand together or we don't stand at all.

And I said, where are you going to now
Now that the going is gone?

Where are you going to now?

And it's a race to your survival
Swimming up the stream,
Crossing over one dam after another
Until we get to rock and roll heaven's gate.

I caught it at a rave
(Did it give you a vaccination?)
I saw it on the tv
(Did it lighten up your load?)
And every fucking dj
(Did you feel affiliated?)
Was telling me I'm free
(Like you really had a home?)

I'm free to be a loser (were the ticket prices too high?)
I'm free to be a trend (were the lights too bright?)
I'm free to be a backlash over and over

Until I get to rock and roll heaven's gate.
