I remember conversations
We were dancing up on tables
Taking pictures when we had nowhere to post
You were laughin', I was cryin'
We were dancin', we were dyin'
Sometimes I don't know how we walked away


If I'm honest what I liked
Were the things we didn't know
Every morning, every night
I'll be beating down your door
Just to tell you what I'm thinking, but you already know
Screw this, I don't wanna let it go

So can we pretend
That I'm twenty-two today
Dancin' on the tables with you?
Oh yeah
Can we pretend
That we all end up okay?
I just wanna forget with you
Oh yeah
Can we pretend
That we both like the president?
Can we pretend
That I really like your shoes?
Hell yeah
Can we pretend?
'Cause honestly reality, it bores me
Let's pretend
Oh, let's make believe
Can we
Can we pretend?
Can we pretend?

I remember what we wanted
What we'd never take for granted
How our daddy issues took us to LA

If I'm honest what I miss
Is not knowin' what to say
And the feeling of your lips
And it haunts me every day
When you'd tell me what you're thinking, but I'd already know
Screw this, I don't wanna let it go
Oh yeah

So can we pretend
That I'm twenty-two today
Dancin' on the tables with you?
Oh yeah
Can we pretend
That we all end up okay?
I just wanna forget with you
Oh yeah
Can we pretend
We both like the way it is?
Hell yeah
Can we pretend
That we like these fake-ass dudes?
Oh yeah
Can we pretend?
Cause honestly reality, it bores me
Let's pretend
Oh, let's make believe
Can we
Can we pretend?
Can we pretend

If I'm honest what I liked
Were the things we didn't know
Every morning, every night
I'll be beating down your door
Just to tell you what I'm thinking, but you'd already know
Screw this, I don't wanna let it go

Can we pretend
That we both like the president?
Can we pretend
That you like my fake-ass shoes?
Oh yeah
Can we pretend?
Cause honestly reality, it bores me
Let's pretend
Oh, let's make believe
Can we
Can we pretend?
Can we pretend?

Can we pretend?
Can we?
Let's make believe
Can we
Can we
Can we pretend?
Cause honestly reality, it bores me
Let's pretend
Oh, let's make believe
Can we
Can we pretend?
Honestly
