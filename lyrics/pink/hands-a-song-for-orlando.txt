Could hold a gun and hold your heart
Could put out fires or make 'em start
Skin and bones and flesh and blood
With all this nerve, how did we get this numb?


They can hurt, they can heal
They can give back or they can steal
They can break the world or they can change it too

Oh, hands, hands, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, hands, hands
They can love or they can take
They can fight up until they save
They can break the world or they can change it too
Oh, hands, your hands, change the world, mmm

Doesn't matter who you love
All that matters is your love
I've been watching news
Seeing all this hate
Tell me is it wrong?
To want a little change?

They can hurt, they can heal
They can give back or they can steal
They can break the world or they can change it too

Oh, hands, hands, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, hands, hands
They can love or they can take
They can fight up until they save
They can break the world or they can change it too
Oh, hands...

A million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down, oh
A million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down, oh
A million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Could hold a gun and hold your heart
Can put out fires and make 'em start
I've been watching news
And seeing all this hate
Tell me is it wrong?
To want a little change?

Oh, hands, hands, oh-on-oh, hands, hands
They can love or they can take
They can fight up until they save
They can break the world or they can change it too
Oh, hands

A million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down, oh
A million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down, oh
A million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Just take my hand baby
Everybody's in love
(All that matters is your love)
(Change it or break it)
(They can love or they can take it, take it all)

If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down, hands
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
