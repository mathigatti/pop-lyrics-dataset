If you had one song left inside your soul
What would you sing tonight?
If you had one chance left before we're old
The last song of your life
What is it you wait for? Tell me who you are
Not what you've rehearsed, all the other parts


It is of no interest at all to me
What you have or who you know
Can you tell me just where you have been?
And what you've learned from it all
Tell me what you dance for
How you've been a fool
I don't want the headlines, I just want the truth

It would be so good to see the real you again
It's been a long time, my friend
If this is the last song of your life
Then I'm inviting you to get it right

When you're authentic, you're incredible
I like the view behind your eyes
There was no one else who could break it down
And cut right through to the heart
I just wanna lie underneath this tree
While you whisper secrets on a melody

It would be so good to see the real you again
It's been a long time, my friend
If this is the last song of your life
Then I'm inviting you to get it right
