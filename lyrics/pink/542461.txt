Conversations with my thirteen year old self


You're angry, I know this
The world couldn't care less
You're lonely, I feel this
And you wish you were the best
No teachers or guidance
And you always walk alone
You're crying at night when
Nobody else is home

Come over here and let me hold your hand and hug you darling
I promise you that it won't always feel this bad
There are so many things I want to say to you
You're the girl I used to be
You little heartbroken thirteen year old me

You're laughing, but you're hiding
God I know that trick too well
You forget, that I've been you
And now I'm just the shell
I promise, I love you and
Everything will work out fine
Don't try to grow up yet
Oh just give it some time

The pain you feel is real you're not asleep but it's a nightmare
But you can wake up anytime
Don't lose your passion or the fighter that's inside of you
You're the girl I used to be
The pissed off complicated thirteen year old me

Conversations with my thirteen year old self

Until we meet again, oh I wish you well
Oh I wish you well, little girl until we meet again
Oh I wish you well, little girl
I wish you well until we meet again
My little thirteen year old me
