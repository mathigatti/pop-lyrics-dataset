I'm alone now, staring at the ceiling
I'm kinda bored now, I can't sleep
And you and me can't make my life complete
When you come you slip into a dream


When it's late at night and you're fast asleep
I let my fingers do the walking
I press record, I become a friend
And no one else is watching
I let my fingers do the walking

I'm starving for some attention
I'm begging, pleading, bleeding for a suggestion
I bite my tongue because I wanna scream
I'm almost there and you turn and look at me

When it's late at night and you're fast asleep
I let my fingers do the walking
I press record, I become a fiend
And no one else is watching
I let my fingers do the walking

Rewind and you will see
Why in the morning I'm happy
Right there on the tv screen
Me vengo, me vengooo

I'm restless, you need some caffeine
But I'm wasted, if you could only see
'Cause I need more than you are gonna give

When it's late at night and you're fast asleep
I let my fingers do the walking
I press record, I become a fiend
And no one else is watching

When it's late at night and you're fast asleep
I let my fingers do the walking
I press record, I become a fiend
And no one else is watching
I let my fingers do the walking
