I'm an opportunity
And I knock so sofly
Sometimes I get loud
When I wish everybody'd just get off me
So many players
You'd think I was a board game
It's every man for themselves
There are no teammates
This life gets lonely
When everybody wants something
They'll smile up in your face
But they'll get theirs eventually
And I hope I'm there


Surrounded by familiar faces with no name
None of them know me
Or want to share my pain
They only wish to bask in my light
Then fade away
To win my love, to them a game
To watch me live my life in vain
When all is done and the glitter fades, fades away
They'll get theirs eventually
And I hope I'm there

I drank your poison
'Cause you told me it's wine
Shame on you if you fooled me once
Shame on me if you fooled me twice
I didn't know the price
You'll get yours eventually

So what good am I to you
If I can't be broken
You'll get yours, yes
You'll get yours eventually :*
