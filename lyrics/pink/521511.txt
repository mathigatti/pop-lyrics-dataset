Can you turn it up, just a tiny bit? That'd be awesome.

I'm on the rebound
I get it where I want to
I'm on the way down
I'm getting fixed without you
You gave me a band-aid
I put it on my heartbreak
And all you got is pictures in your hand


Don't you wish you could hold
The angel in the centerfold
The fantasy you couldn't control
Who walked away from you
Don't you wish that you could hold
The pretty little paper doll
The one you couldn't quite control
Who walked away from you

Flip to me, I'm the centerfold
I'm gonna charm you
All night
Stick to me, I'm the centerfold
We're gonna go, oh
Hold tight

I'm gonna hate you
Tell I forget you
So here's a keepsake
I left it in the bathroom
Just a little something
Something to remind you
The joy you'll never get this close again

Don't you wish you could hold
The angel in the centerfold
The fantasy you couldn't control
Who walked away from you
Don't you wish that you could hold
The pretty little paper doll
The one you couldn't quite control
Who walked away from you

Flip to me, I'm the centerfold
I'm gonna charm you
All night
Stick to me, I'm the centerfold
We're gonna go, oh
Hold tight

Flip to me, I'm the centerfold
I'm gonna charm you
All night
Stick to me, I'm the centerfold
We're gonna go, oh
Hold tight

Now it's him but it could've been you
Tell me why it's him when it should've been you
Its crazy how this makes you wanna change
Here's an image you won't forget
All your life I'll tease, I'll torment
I'll be gone as soon as you turn the page

Don't you wish you could hold
The angel in the centerfold
The fantasy you couldn't control
Who walked away from you
Don't you wish that you could hold
The pretty little paper doll
The one you couldn't quite control
Who walked away from you

Flip to me, I'm the centerfold
I'm gonna charm you
All night
Stick to me, I'm the centerfold
We're gonna go, oh
Hold tight
