She's back on drugs again
Even though she knows it ain't right
She can't even call up her friends 
And say "Help me save my life"
She's so ashamed of herself
That she's come full circle 
Nobody understands what it's like to be this girl


So she, she disappeared, and she
She wasn't clear, and she
She didn't say where she was going 

Save my life, won't you help me
Save my life, won't you help me
Save my life, can you hear me
Save my life, won't you help me

She had the man of her dreams
And some success
And she was so happy and looking well
It was this one dark night
That she slipped
And then the next morning
That she felt like a piece of sh-t

So she's, she's hanging out, and she's
She's with the crowd, and she's
She's travellin where the wind is blowing

Save my life, won't you help me
Save my life, won't you help me
Save my life, can you hear me
Save my life, won't you help me

And he's, a real good guy, and he
He wants to save her cause he's
He's more then been there all before
And she's, she's so confused, and his
His heart is breakin, and he 
He dreams she's knockin on his door

Save my life

Save my life, won't you help me
Save my life, won't you help me
Save my life, can you hear me
Save my life, won't you help me

Save my life, won't you help me
Save my life, won't you help me
Save my life, can you hear me
Save my life, won't you help me
