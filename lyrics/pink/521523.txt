Mmmm mm yeah
Oh oh
I stood by the exit door of the hotel cafe
He was playing with his band
I've always been a sucker had a weakness for a boy with a guitar and a drink in his hand
His words were like heaven in my hurricane
My knees buckled under
I thought everyone was watching me
Watching you save my life with the song


You were mine
In the back of my mind
Oh just for one night
Just for a while

There's always one that gets away
The one that sneaks up on you that slips away

Two weeks later I was sitting in his apartment
He was making cappuchino
I said what kind of man makes cappuchino
We laughed
We laughed
We laughed
We laughed til tears ran down my face

Oh but my man you're someone elses man
And that aint the man that I want
But you keep drawing me in with those big brown liyn' eyes

You'll always be mine
In the back of my mind
Oh we had a night
Just a little while

There's always one that gets away
The one that sneaks up on you that slips away

In a closed off corner of my heart yes
I'll always see your face
The one that got away
One that got away
The one that got away
The one that got away
Oh the one that got away
The one that got away
Oh the one that got away
The one that got away
Oh the one that got away
Yeah yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
Oh

I'm not a victim of cliches
I don't believe in soul mates
Happy endings only one
Oh and I met you and all that changed
I had a taste and you're still sitting on the tip of my tongue

You were mine
Somewhere in time
I'll look for you first
In my next life

There's always one that gets away
The one that sneaks up on you that slips away
Slips away
In a closed off corner of my heart yeah yeah yeah yeah
I I'll always see your face
The one that got away
The one that got away
The one that got away
The one that got away
Oh the one that got away
The one that got away
Oh the one that got away
The one that got away
The one that got away
Yeah yeah
Oh oh yeah
The one that got away
