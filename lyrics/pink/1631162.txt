There comes a time when we hear a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know, love is all we need


We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice were making
Were saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
Send them your heart
So they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
And so we all must lend a helping hand

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice were making
Were saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
When youre down and out, there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Well, well, well, well let us realize that a change can only come
When we
stand together as one

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice were making
Were saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
