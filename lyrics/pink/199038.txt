Put me on the table
Make me say your name
If I can't remember
Then give me all your pain
I can sit and listen
Or I can make you scream
Kiss it and make it better
Just put your trust in me


Oh my God, go a little slower
Oh my God, what was that again
La da da, let me fell you baby
Let me in, 'cause I understand
Let me fell you baby
'Cause I understand

I understand all
Now climb my sugar walls
Problem solved it's dissolved with the solvent now as spit
Lickity lick not too quick is a
Slick ride make my mink slide
'cause we're all pink inside

This can be realy easy
It doesn't have to be hard
Here baby let me show you
I'll have ya, climbing up the walls
You got all the problems
I think that I can solve
Why don't you come in here baby
Why don't we sit and talk

Oh my God, go a little slower
Oh my God, what was that again
La da da, let me fell you baby
Let me in, 'cause I understand
Let me fell you baby
'Cause I understand

You like the top and the bottom
You make a drop and them caught'em
And when you rock then you've got'em
Hh my God'em oh my God'em
