Preston: 
I'm not going through this again 
Pink: 
I swear to God. 
I'm wiping the last tear away. 
That's it 
Preston: Look at me. 
Pink: 
I'm not gonna be here no more 
Preston: 
I'm gone...and this time 
Pink: 
It's over 


(Pink) 
I'll be damned 
if I'm gon' cry over you 
Boy we're through 
There's nothing else to say to you 
I'll be damned if I'm gon cry over you 
Boy we're through 
And I don't ever want 
to have to see you, again 

(Pink) 
Another night, going to sleep restless 
But I'm gonna wake up feeling blessed 
Cause you ain't gonna be here no more, 
to cause me no stress 
The way I loved you never made much sense 
But you ain't gonna be here no more, baby 
To cause me no stress 

(Pink) 
I'll be damned if I'm gon' cry over you 
Boy we're through 
There's nothing else to say to you 
I'll be damned if I'm gon cry over you 
Boy we're through 
And I don't ever want 
to have to see you, again 

(Preston) 
I was walking down the street 
just the other day 
I seen this angel, this beautiful angel 
I thought it was you, 
she was walking and talking the same way 
I can feel inside, 
it was hurting and I started to cry 
I had to be strong about it 
I had to take a sip 
and swallow it down with my proud 

(Preston) 
I'll be damned 
if I'm gon' cry over you 
Girl we're through 
There's nothing else to say to you 
I'll be damned 
if I'm gon cry over you 
Girl we're through 
And I don't ever want 
to have to see you, again 

(Preston) 
I've got no more tears in me 
And you're not crying for me, no 
It's a lonely lonely place to be 
(Pink) 
I'm not crying 
I'm not staying home 
I'm not thinking 

(Pink and Preston) 
I'll be damned 
if I'm gon' cry over you 
Boy/girl we're through 
(I know we're through) 
There's nothing else 
to say to you 

I'll be damned 
if I'm gon cry over you 
I don't have the time 
to carry on with you 
We're thru, we're thru,

I don't wanna see your face no more 
I just don't wanna cry no more 
It's over babe 
It's over babe 
I don't wanna cry no more 
You won't be in my world, no no no
