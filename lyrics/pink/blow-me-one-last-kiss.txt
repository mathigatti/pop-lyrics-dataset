White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight


Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you

Tie a knot in the rope
Trying to hold, trying to hold
But there's nothing to grasp so
I let go

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day?
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left

No more sick, Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
Cause you no longer sleep

I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day?
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe
I won't worry at all

You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the why's
Will be crystal clear

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day?
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day?
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss
