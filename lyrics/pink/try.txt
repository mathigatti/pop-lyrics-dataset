Ever wonder ‘bout what he’s doing?
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think that it’s better to never ask why


Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone’s bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn’t mean you’re gonna die
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy?
Even when it’s not right

Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone’s bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn’t mean you’re gonna die
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try

Ever worry that it might be ruined?
Does it make you wanna cry?
When you’re out there doin’ what you’re doin’
Are you just getting by?
Tell me are you just getting by, by, by

Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone’s bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn’t mean you’re gonna die
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
