Ok
(So)


Running like a dog
Fighting like a bitch too much
And you just can't stand it, baby
Even when I fall, you don't seem to give two shits
'Cause you're just too cool, baby
We could have it all
But neither one of us would budge
'Cause we can't be wrong, baby
Folding up your arms, closing up your heart

I know, I know, I know, you think it's me
'Cause I want it all
No, I know, I know, I know, I know you see
That we gotta talk
You know, you know, you know, we must believe or fall apart

I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough for me to try
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Even if I say that it's over now
Even if we want to move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want (ah)
Whatever you need (yeah)
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah

Trying to get a breath
Thinkin' 'bout the time you said that I was your heart, baby
Trying to understand how a grown man goes on without a body part, baby
I could walk away
I could always cash my chips and I'd be ok, baby
I would be ok, and you might be ok

Oh, I know, I know, I know you think it's me
But ya want it all
I know, I know, I know, I know you see
That we gotta talk
No, you know, you know, you must believe
You're enough for me

I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough for me to try
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (ah)
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Even if I say that it's over now
Even if we want to move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (ah)
Whatever you do

Whoever said that love was sweet
(Drank a little too much whiskey, baby)
Whoever said that life was easy
(Never lived anywhere near me)
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause you're the one I wanna sink with

I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough
Even if I say that it's over now (it's over now)
Even if we want to (if we want to move on somehow)
Move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (ah)
Whatever you do, oh-oh-oh
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (oh)
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, oh-oh-oh
