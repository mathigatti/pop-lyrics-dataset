Living easy, livin' free
Season ticket, on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too


I'm on the highway to hell
I'm a highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

And I'm going down, down, down...

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Dont stop me!

Yeah, I'm going down anyway
I'm on the highway to hell
