Don't know where we will go
Cold feet, hot headed
If you care to know what's real, I've said it
I’m tired of taking time
Tired of wasting daylight
While you are sleeping tight
If you won’t wake up, forget it


Give me something more
More than just words
More than making my heart hurt
More than all the madness
If you can imagine
All that I am asking
Give me something more
Give me something more

In between all of this
Stuck under pressure
If you never look back, remember
It's such a long way down
Trying to chase these doubts
Can you erase them now and
Come make this bitter better?

Give me something more
More than just words
More than making my heart hurt
More than all the madness
If you can imagine
All that I am asking
Give me something more
Give me something more

Make it all or make it nothing
Take the wrong and make it right
Gotta show me what you're thinking
Show me forever, show me tonight

Give me something more
More than just pain
More than making my heart ache
More than all your logic
Show me that we've got it
That we never lost it
Give me something more
More than just words
Something that will make my heart burn
More than all the madness
All that I am asking
Give me something more
Give me something more
