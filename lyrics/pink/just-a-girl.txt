No Doubt:
Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed
And it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know
Exactly where I stand
This world is forcing me
To hold your hand
'Cause I'm just a girl, little 'ol me
Don't let me out of your sight
I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights


Oh, I've had it up to here!

Pink:
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons
For me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all the little things
That I fear

No Doubt:
'Cause I'm just a girl I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive
Late at night

Pink:
Oh, I'm just a girl
Guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare
With their eyes

No Doubt:
I'm just a girl
Take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype, here we go!
Oh...I've had it up to here!
Oh...am I making myself clear?
Las Vegas, am I making myself clear?
I'm just a girl

Pink:
I'm just a girl in the world

Pink/No Doubt:
That's all that you'll let me be!

No Doubt:
I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb
Makes me worry some

Pink:
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to Is making me numb

No Doubt:
I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome

Pink:
I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum there's no comparison

Pink/No Doubt:
Oh, I've had it up to!
Oh, I've had it up to!!
Oh, I've had it up to here!
