You follow every line, you wear your perfect patch and style
you're
You're like a satellite and your drifting through the sky
You can't make up your mind about this or that, or anything at
all
You go with the flow and hope to God that no one knows it


Everything you are, everything you say
Everything you do is not for you
Everything you feel, everything you know
You found it on your favorite TV show

And it's people like you that make me sick
I'm surrounded by you everywhere I look

You're telling everyone how different that you really are
But it's been said before, so maybe you're not special after
all
You put the same amount of effort into letting go
Just act yourself and you might like it, you never know

Cause everything you want, everything you do
You try to so hard to be everyone but you
Everywhere you turn, you just gotta learn
It's easier if you don't try so hard

And it's people like you that make me sick
I'm surrounded by you everywhere I look
Is there somewhere I can go to get away
Where there's truth and people mean just what they say

You try too hard
You just try too hard
You try too hard

And it's people like us that make me sick
I'm surrounded by it everywhere I look
Is there somewhere we can go to get away
Where there's truth and people mean just what they say

You try too hard
You just try too hard
