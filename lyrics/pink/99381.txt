So she thinks she's got a new boyfriend
But the two of them have never met
She's already got his name tattooed
In a heart across her chest


With his pictures plastered on her wall
But he has never called
And even all her friends
They say you're livin a delirium

Badadadadadadadadadada babe
You're living in deliri 
Badadadadadadadadadada um

Secretly she's stalking him on the street
Making sure she's one step behind
They even went to the movies together
Or atleast they stood in the same line

She tells everyone he sends her flowers
And all them letters he sends her too
And they talk on the phone for hours
It's obvious she's come unglued

Badadadadadadadadadada babe
You're living in delirium 
Badadadadadadadadadada babe
You're living in delirium 
Badadadadadadadadadada babe
You're living in delirium 
Badadadadadadadadadada um

Every night you'll find her all alone
Fantasizing about the brand new home
And she's waiting
For the bells to ring a-ding a-ling

Oh God she's lost her mind
And her friends tell her all the time
That it's make believe, this guy she sees
It's her disease, she's living a delirium

She's so happy that she found someone
But she's still living in delirium
She's so happy that she found someone
But she's still living in delirium

Badadadadadadadadadada babe
You're living in delirium 
Badadadadadadadadadada babe
You're living in deliri

She's so happy that she found someone
But she's still living in delirium
She's so happy that she found someone
But she's still living in delirium

Badadadadadadadadadada babe
You're living in delirium
Badadadadadadadadadada babe
You're living in deliri
