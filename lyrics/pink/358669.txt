Came home today 
Just another day 
Been workin´ hard 
Just to pay our rent 
Walked up the stairs 
Into our room 
To my surprise 
Someone´s with you 


I told you once 
I told you twice 
Don´t wanna hear 
Your tired lies 
So pack your bags…´cause 

(Chorus) 
I don´t want u coming back no more 
I don´t want u coming back no more 
So pack your bags 
Get out that door 
Don´t wanna see 
your face no more 
´Cause I don't want u, I don´t want u NO! 

Don´t you come back no more
