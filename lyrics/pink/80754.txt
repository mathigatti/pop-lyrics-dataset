Since the first time I saw ya
I knew I was attracted, reacted to the fact, on how you made me act
Shy, but sexy at the same time,
Always on my mind was a little bump and grind
Usually I don't play it that close
You got's to kick it with me
Before I serve you up with an overdose of that bomb ass Punane'
Make you my man
Ain't got no love for nobody else but you
Cuz you's my boo
I prove to you, my love be true
So do you know where ya goin' to
Through thick and thin baby
You all in, time will reveal
That my love for you will never end
My heart keeps tickin'
No time for trickin'
You who I'm pickin'
So lay me down
Just give it a good lickin'
I'll treat ya like my king cuz you're royal
And only give my love to you because I'm loyal
Escape with me, come ova to my place
I'll teach you a few things in lovin' makin'
Now I can't wait, I won't wait
So take me by my arms and rock me, baby

After our first night
You dicovered, who's the bombest mammi
LA's finest, with my top dogz all around me
Down to ride
Harder to Bonnie and Clyde
With sexual heala's, you feel us
Baby, check my vibe
There'll neva be
A love like me
That got yo back in this industry
That got yo back in these streets
So you don't have to worry bout me on the creep
And I don't want ya ever try to play me cheep
Cuz I don't sleep around
Because it's sleazy
Good lesson taught by my big homie Eazy
I gotz to compliment ya on how you please me
Touch me but don't tease me
Now put it in nice 'n' easy
And rub my body down I'm feelin' weasy
And cuddle up to me
Cuz now I'm gettin' sleepy
But I'mma be dedicated to this relation
So stay away from all them cowards
So we can not be playa hatin'
Cuz if you wit me, boo den
Keep it real
And if I catch you sleeping around
Then I'm gone have to chill
When you find good love
You best to keep it
Im puttin' all my sistas up on gangs
So won't you peep it
