The king is dead but the queen is alive
Off with his head, I am done with his lies
A fair win, I have fought for my life
A clean slate after all this time


A revolution and now I am in charge
My evolution is to shoot for the stars
His first mistake he underestimates
He didn’t bother to appreciate

So ra ra ra
Sis boom fucking bah
There’s a party in your honor
But you won’t be there, whatever, so
Three cheers for the one that got away (hey, hey, hey)
You were just blah blah blah
I was: Oh my god
And unlike your anatomy I'm glad I had it in me
Now the king, the king, the king, the king is dead
But the queen is alive (but the queen is alive)

I guess the village didn’t raise you right
Don’t think nobody's gonna mourn you tonight
No more licks to wet your appetite
You make me sick I didn’t wanna fight (I didn't, I didn't wanna fight)
I thought we ruled the heavens in the Earth
I really thought I was the only girl
Your secrets have all been revealed to me
You’ve been dethroned, there goes your legacy

So ra ra ra
Sis boom fucking bah
There’s a party in your honor
But you won’t be there, whatever, so
Three cheers for the one that got away (hey, hey, hey)
You were just blah blah blah
I was: Oh my god
And unlike your anatomy I'm glad I had it in me
Now the king, the king, the king, the king is dead
But the queen is alive (but the queen is alive)

There are consequences in this life
A punishment that fits the crime
Your last words, I heard: I’m sorry
Now look at me in all my glory

The king is dead but the queen is alive
I wear your crown and I look quite nice
I almost let you get the best of me
But no one's ever gonna get the queen
No

Hey yeah
Soooo ra ra ra
Sis boom fucking bah
There’s a party in your honor
But you won’t be there, whatever, so
Three cheers for the one that got away (hey, hey, hey)
You were just blah blah blah
I was: Oh my god
And unlike your anatomy I'm glad I had it in me
Now the king, the king, the king, the king is dead (oh)
The king, the king, the king, the king is dead
But the queen is alive
