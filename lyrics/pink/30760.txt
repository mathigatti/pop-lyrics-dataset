Can't take me home to mama
'Cause she wouldn't think I'm proper
Shoulda thought about that before you fucked with me


Don't say you're fallin' for me
Don't tell me you adore me
'Cause all you are thinking about is fuck me

Can't take me home to mama
'Cause she wouldn't think I'm proper
Shoulda thought about that before you fucked with me

Don't say you're fallin' for me
Don't tell me you adore me
'Cause all you're thinking about is fuck me

Why would you even talk to me
Baby, were you curious?
You knew you never had a love like this
My love was serious
Had you delirious
Don't front, I felt it in every kiss

You try and play me
Like I ain't your lady
When you just told me that you love me
And you want me as your baby
Understand me, cause I know we can be
Just as happy as anybody
Let your heart feel me baby

Can't take me home to mama
'Cause she wouldn't think I'm proper
Shoulda thought about that before you fucked with me

Don't say you're fallin' for me
Don't tell me you adore me
'Cause all you are thinking about is fuck me

Can't take me home to mama
'Cause she wouldn't think I'm proper
Shoulda thought about that before you fucked with me

Don't say you're fallin' for me
Don't tell me you adore me
'Cause all you're thinking about is fuck me

What the hell was on your mind?
You thought I had the time
To be your little undercover thing
But see, I can't deal with that
So you better just split with that
Come at me real
Quit playing these silly games

How can you love me
And then just leave me?
Because you see somebody looking
And you think they disagree
Well they don't feed you
So why you care, boo?
Because the best love you ever had
Is right here with you

Can't take me home to mama
'Cause she wouldn't think I'm proper
Shoulda thought about that before you fucked with me

Don't say you're fallin' for me
Don't tell me you adore me
'Cause all you are thinking about is fuck me

Can't take me home to mama
'Cause she wouldn't think I'm proper
Shoulda thought about that before you fucked with me

Don't say you're fallin' for me
Don't tell me you adore me
'Cause all you're thinking about is fuck me

I don't want nobody else but you (no, no, no)
But if you keep playing
Then I'll make you the fool
Because it's a P!nk thang
If you're a man who would wanna get with me
Oh, it's a P!nk thang
Tell you, your mama
You're just going to have to see

Can't take me home to mama
'Cause she wouldn't think I'm proper
Shoulda thought about that before you fucked with me

Don't say you're fallin' for me
Don't tell me you adore me
'Cause all you are thinking about is fuck me

Can't take me home to mama
'Cause she wouldn't think I'm proper
Shoulda thought about that before you fucked with me

Don't say you're fallin' for me
Don't tell me you adore me
'Cause all you're thinking about is fuck me
