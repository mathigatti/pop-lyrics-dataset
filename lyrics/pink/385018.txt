Hahaha
Ooh, rock and roll
Rock, rock
Alright, I drink more than you
I party harder than you do
And my car's faster than yours too, ugh!


P. I. N. K. P. I. M. P.
I'm back again I know y'all missed me
I'm so so sick can't handle it
Yeah I talk shit just deal with it
My rims are 23 inch, and they're black on black
No they're not his
Diamonds all over my teefs
You can try and try you can't be me

So I cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright, I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight I'll do what I want
'Cuz I can

I know I'm rare, you stop and stare
You think I care, I don't
You talk real loud
But you ain't saying' nothing cool
I can fit your whole house in my swimming pool
My life's a fantasy
That you're not smart enough to even dream
My ice is making me freeze
You can try and try you can't beat me

So I cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright, I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight I'll do what I want
'Cuz I can

Uh, break it down
It's tough times out here ya know what I'm sayin

Yeah I'm super thick
People say I'm much too chic
Come and kiss the ring
You just might learn a couple things
I'm tryin' to school ya dogs
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff
I'm your worst nightmare
Bring it we can take it there
What are you scared?

So I cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright, I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight I'll do what I want (what I want)
'Cuz I can ('cuz I can)

So I cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright, I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight I'll do what I want
'Cuz I can
