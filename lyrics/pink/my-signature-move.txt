I've got a way of making everything a confrontation
And you've got a way of bringing out the worst in me
You say it's just if I'm bored I found a way to make an accusation
I've got a problem with more so give me give me everything


Stop
No more fuck, not at all
I can't help you what you want
Get in line take a number
Get you when my song is over
If you leave it up to me
I'll make alot of tune it's true
And then I'll break it up
Make it bleed
Tell you about it you know me
Make a scene out of show
Just because the wind blows
Shoot myself in the foot
To make a point I can't prove
To get back to you
That's just my signature move

You call me craaaa-zy, and I think it's mean I just don't like it
I'm just a sensitive babe and you need to please me right
You know I said I would change I did I went and tried a different outfit
And if that's not enough you won't be riding dirty tonight

Stop
No more fuck, not at all
I can't help you what you want
Get in line take a number
Get you when my song is over
If you leave it up to me
I'll make alot of tune it's true
And then I'll break it up
Make it bleed
Tell you about it you know me
Make a scene out of show
Just because the wind blows
Shoot myself in the foot
To make a point I can't prove
To get back to you
That's just my signature move

That's just my signature move
That's just my signature move

I still fight to my dreams I kick off the shins
I don't apologize you wouldn't see it in my eyes
I not a good best friend you,there's a rule I would bend
Now make some trouble for you it's all I know what to do
I'm not responsible

Stop
No more fuck, not at all
I can't help you what you want
Get in line take a number
Get you when my song is over
If you leave it up to me
I'll make alot of tune it's true
And then I'll break it up
Make it bleed
Tell you about it you know me
Make a scene out of show
Just because the wind blows
Shoot myself in the foot
To make a point I can't prove
To get back to you
That's just my signature move
