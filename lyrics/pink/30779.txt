Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
'Cause you're the only one
That I know who'll keep them
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
I know you'll keep them
This is what I've done


I've been a bad, bad girl
For so long
I don't know how to change,
What went wrong
Daddy's little girl
When he went away
What did it teach me? That love leaves..

Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
'Cause you're the only one
That I know who'll keep them
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
I know you'll keep them
So This is what I've done

I've been down every road you could go
I've made some bad choices, as you know
Seems I've got this whole world cradled in my hands
But it's just like me not to understand, yeah

Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
'Cause you're the only one
That I know who'll keep them
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
I've been a bad, bad girl

I've learned my lessons
I turned myself around
I've got a guardian angel tattooed on my shoulder
She's been watching over me.

Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
'Cause you're the only one
That I know who'll keep them
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
I know you'll keep them
This is what I've done
