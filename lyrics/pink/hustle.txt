I gave you soft, I gave you sweet
Just like a lion, you came for a sheep
Oh no, don't try to hustle me
You took my love, mistook it for weakness
I guarantee I won't repeat this
No, don't try to hustle me (don't try to hustle me)


I live my life like a bullet in a gun
Give you all my love 'til my patience is done
Oh no, don't try to hustle me

So don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't fuck with me (whoop, whoop)
And don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)

So don't hustle me, no (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't fuck with me (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)

A boy like you, you think you know it all
Build it up and you're bound to fall
Oh no-oh-oh, don't try to hustle me (don't try to hustle me)
I spend my days tryna do you right
But you've been blind, you can't see the light
Oh no-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't try to hustle me

'Cause I live my life like a bullet in a gun
Give you all my love 'til my patience is done
Oh no, don't try to hustle me

So don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't fuck with me (whoop, whoop)
And don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)

So don't hustle me, no (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't fuck with me (whoop, whoop)
Yeah, don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)

'Cause it won't do no good at all to say you're sorry now
Your words, they are falling on deaf ears
And it won't do no good at all to try to work it out
How can you replace all these years?
'Cause now you've gone and thrown away the very thing you need
Bitch, please, don't try to hustle me

Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't fuck with me (hey) (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (yeah) (whoop, whoop)

Don't hustle me (don't hustle me) (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (hey) (whoop, whoop)
Don't fuck with me (whoop, whoop)
Oh, don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)

Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't fuck with me (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)

So don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
Don't fuck with me (whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (whoop, whoop)
