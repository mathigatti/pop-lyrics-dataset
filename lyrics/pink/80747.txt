Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to P!nk airlines
We hope your flight is enjoyable and our flight attendants are here to
Ensure your ride is as pleasant as possible
Seat backs and tray tables must be in the upright and lock position
During take-off and landing
All carry-on luggange must be stowed in an over-head compartment
Or under the seat in front of you


Waiting on a ticket
'Cause you're looking for the ride
You're feeling on top
'Cause you're flying through the sky
You wanna have your cake
And you wanna eat it too
Everybody's always pointing fingers at you
You're damned if you do
You're damned if you don't
We're always doing all the things
That we say we won't

Here we go
Riding on a whim
Connecting with the rendezvous
Here we go
We're jumping off the wings
We're going round in circles - it's a Catch22
Yes we're flying round in circles - it's a Catch22
Yes we're rocking round in circles - it's a Catch22

If you are seated in an emergency exit aisle and feel as though you
Are unable or unwilling to assist in the case of an emergency
Please notify a flight attendant immediately
All electrical equipment, including cell-phones, 2-way pagers
Portable CD players, laptops etc should remain in the off position
Until the pilot notifies us that we are at a safe flying altitude of 10, 000ft

Looking from the outside, you're always looking in
You think you fix the problem, until it comes right back again
And life seems like a trap, you're trying to get out
You're searching for your cheese because you feel like Mighty Mouse
You're damned if you don't - you're damned if you do
You've seen all the signs, but you haven't got a clue

Yes we're flying round in circles - it's a Catch22

You are in, you are in, you are in, you are in
You are in for the ride of your life

Here we go

We realize you have many choices and behalf of all of us at P!nk
Airlines, we'd like to thankyou for flying with us
We hope you have a wonderful stay wherever you're destination
May be
And remember, be careful retrieving your items, as during the flight
They may have shifted, and might fall on you or your neighbours head
And knock you the fuck out
