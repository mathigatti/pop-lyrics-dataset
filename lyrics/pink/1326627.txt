[Hook: Pink] 
Every time you come to town you pick me up, 
Every time you come around you lit me up, 
Even though you're not around 
you know you want me 
[you know]
All I want to do is kick it from tonight
All I ask is that you stay just one more night
All I want is to here you say you want me


[Benzino] 
See ain't nobody liver
Like DC3 I'm a survivor
I stay candid 
Four seat branded
Front standard
Dirt bandit with two cannons [bleow!] 
Here's what the plans is
A good life for me and my mans's
In the studio paid off stanzas
So in the long run 
Every song done gotta be bananas
From city streets to corporate suits
From these gritty beats 
All heat and nothing sweet
Get a good look, I'm here to stay 
Benzino gonna show you how the big dogs play 

[Hook: Pink]
Every time you come to town you pick me up, 
Every time you come around you lit me up,
Even though you're not around you know you want me [you know] 
All I want to do is kick it from tonight
All I ask is that you stay just one more night 
All I want is to here you say you want me 

[Benzino]
Black ice on the neck and wrist [that's Benzino] 
Most hated at the top of the list [that's Benzino] 
Hangman with the gangsta hits [that's Benzino]
Top dog that you never forget [that's Benzino] 
Watch me turn up the thermostat I burn it black
I want the platinum plaque, y'all can have the game back 
Price of fame
More friends more foes new Benz new clothes no sleep no doe
Hate to see me doin it, love the chance to ruin it
