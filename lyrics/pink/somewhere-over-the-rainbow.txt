When all the world is a hopeless jumble
And the raindrops tumble all around
Heaven opens a magic lane


When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found,
Leading from your window pane
To a place behind the sun, just a step beyond the rain

Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday, I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh, why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why, can't I?
