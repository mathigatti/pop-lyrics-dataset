Screw fear, it's contagious
infecting everything
It makes me do such stupid, stupid stuff
I say things I never mean


What exactly do I think?
Who am I protecting?
If I fall, will it blow up in my face?
That's just crazy

I'm delicate, I'm sensitive
Please try to be more careful
You're mean, you're a lunatic
Let's try to make this fun again

It's only love, give it away (it's only love)
You'll probably get it back again (it's only love)
It's simple, it's a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
It's only love, not a timebomb

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I'm tired from last night's fight
I wish I hadn't started it
I hate when my fear speaks for me
It makes me nasty

I thought we could start again
Go back to the days when we felt like friends
It's all too serious for me
And I know I'm guilty

Matchsticks and poison
That's what I add to the fire
My dear, I'm frozen
Turned from a saint to a liar

It's only love, give it away (it's only love)
You'll probably get it back again (it's only love)
It's simple, it's a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
It's only love, not a timebomb

Oh, oh, oh

I wanna be precious
I don't wanna feel stress
Life is for the living
but not a living hell

So take it, take this
oh you can have all of me
Take it, take this
here, you can have everything
I don't wanna be flawless
When I go I want the cuts to show

So take it, take this
oh you can have all of me
Take it, take this
oh ***king have everything.

It's only love, give it away (it's only love)
You'll probably get it back again (it's only love)
It's simple, it's a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
It's only love, not a timebomb

Ah, ah (it's only love)
Ah, ah (it's only love)
It's simple, it's a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
It's only love, not a timebomb
