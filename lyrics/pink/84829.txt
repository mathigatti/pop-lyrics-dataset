why was I the last to know 
that you weren't comin to my show
you could'a called me up to say good luck 
you could'a called me back you stupid fuck
why was I the last to know?


first date we ate sushi and
it went well I was funny and
you said I was a cutie
thats the last thing I heard from you 
I left tickets at the door for you 
I had to tell my mum that there was no more room
you didn't show that was so uncool
you could'a called me back

so I guess this means that we're not friends anymore
I heard it's me your asking for 
I thought I'd see you the show
you said you'd go

CHORUS:
why was I the last to know 
that you weren't comin' to my show
you could'a called me up to say good luck 
you could'a called me back you stupid fuck
why was I the last to know?
why was I the last to know?

after the date I wouldn't go home with you
I wouldn't put my heels in the air for you
tried to get me to do things I just won't do
the last I heard from you 
heres how I guess the story goes 
you would'a came if I was a hoe
fuck for parts thats just not how I role 
move it on down the road

so I guess we shouldn't be friends anymore
im sick of hearing that it's me your asking for 
'cause I thought I'd see you the show
you said you'd go

CHORUS
why was I the last to know 
that you weren't comin to my show
you could'a called me up to say good luck 
you could'a called me back you stupid fuck
why was I the last to know?
why was I the last to know?

you thought you knew me
I guess you didn't
you thought you had me 
I think you didn't 
you thought you knew me
I guess you didn't

CHORUS:
why was I the last to know 
that you weren't comin to my show
you could'a called me up to say good luck 
you could'a called me back you stupid fuck
why was I the last to know?
why was I the last to know?
why was I the last to know?
