Bang Bang, you're the one
 
(Five) Five seconds for me to fall under your spell
(Bang bang goes my heart again, bang bang here we go again)
(Four) Forever your secrets I'll keep to myself
(Bang bang goes my heart again, bang bang here we go again)
(Three) Three wishes could never bring more to my heart
(Bang bang goes my heart again, bang bang here we go again) 
My two eyes tell me five, four, three, two, you're the one
My head's spinning around, I'm about to explode
(Bang bang goes my heart again, bang bang here we go again)
I'm falling fast into your world
(Bang bang goes my heart again, bang bang here we go again)
I'm falling into your world
(Five) Five seconds for me to fall under your spell
(Bang bang goes my heart again, bang bang here we go again)
(Four) Forever your secrets I'll keep to myself
(Bang bang goes my heart again, bang bang here we go again)
(Three) Three wishes could never bring more to my heart
(Bang bang goes my heart again, bang bang here we go again)
My two eyes tell me five, four, three, two, you're the one
My dream's still driving you wild, I'm losing my mind
(Bang bang goes my heart again, bang bang here we go again)
It's too late now, we're out of time
(Bang bang goes my heart again, bang bang here we go again)
It's too late, we're out of time
Five, four, three, two, you are the one!
