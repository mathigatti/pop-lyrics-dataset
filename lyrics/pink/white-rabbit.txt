One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all


Go ask Alice
When she's ten feet tall
And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall

Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
Call Alice
When she was just small

When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low

Go ask Alice
I think she'll know
When logic and proportion
Have fallen sloppy dead

And the white knight is talking backwards
And the red queen's "off with her head!"
Remember what the dormouse said
"Feed your head. Feed your head"
