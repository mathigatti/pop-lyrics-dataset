Daddy was a soldier
He taught me about freedom
Peace and all the great things
That we take advantage of


Once I fed the homeless
I'll never forget
I look upon their faces as I
Treated them with respect
And

This is my Vietnam
I'm at war
Life keeps on dropping bombs
And I keep score

Momma was a lunatic
She liked to push my buttons
She said I wasn't good enough
But I guess I wasn't trying

Never like school that much (School that much)
They tried to teach me better
But I just wasn't hearing it because
I thought I was already pretty clever
And

This is my Vietnam
I'm at war
Life keeps on dropping bombs
And I keep score

This is my Vietnam
I'm at war
Life keeps on dropping bombs
And I keep score

What do you expect from me?
What am I not giving you?
What could I do for you
To make me OK in your eyes?

This is my Vietnam
I'm at war
Life keeps on dropping bombs
And I keep score

This is my Vietnam
I'm at war
Life keeps on dropping bombs
And I keep score

This is my Vietnam
This is my Vietnam
