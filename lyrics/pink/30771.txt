This is my rap song
1-2-3-4


I get really sick and tired off
of boys up in my face
Pick-up lines like, what's your sign?
won't get you anyplace

When me and all my girls
go walking down the street,
seems we can't go anywhere
without a car that goes beep-beep

Cause this body is a priceless piece
of lovin' unconditionally, yes
So Mr. Bigstuff, who you think you are?
You was thinkin' you's gon' git it for free?

CHORUS:
Hey ladies
(Yeah?)
Let 'em know it ain't easy
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Let's come together
Sistas
(Yeah?)
It's time to be greedy
Nothin' good comes for free

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Damn, I sure look fine
I can't blame those horny boys
I would make me mine

When I pass you in a club
"Ooh la la," you gasp
Back up boy, I ain't your toy,
or you piece of ass

Cause this body is a priceless piece
of lovin' unconditionally, yes
So Mr. Bigstuff, who you think you are?
You was thinkin' you's gon' git it for free?

CHORUS

No jealousy, no envy, girls
Come on, let's work it out
No freebies in the limousine
That's not what it's about

Let him know there's work to do
Give it up, he won't call you
Respect is just a minimum
Go on girl, and get you some

1-2-3-4

CHORUS

Come on girls, let's work it out
Let's come together
Let's show 'em what it's all about
Let's come together
Come on girls, let's work it out
Let's come together
You gotta let 'em know
that it ain't easy street, no
