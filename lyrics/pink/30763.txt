Chorus (x2)
why everytime i try to tell
you how i feel
it's like a hiccup cup-cup
it just won't come, come
soon as i think i'm 'bout to
share my loving
that's when the hiccups come in


verse 1
you're like a cough on a rainy day
you know the kind
that gives
you chest pains, yeah
and just as things start to feel ok
then here you come
to bring the rain
you hold me hard and
you squeeze me tight
you let me go then you pick a fight
you make me wanna scream, cry,
and shout out loud
boy you got me spinning
round and round

chorus (x2)

verse 2
my thoughts,
they're kinda shaky
everytime i get around you,
sweet baby
sometimes, i don't know
what i'm trying to say
just tell me baby,
tell me things are gonna be ok

chorus (X2)

brisge
i get all choked up inside,
and i don't know what to say
sometimes i wanna
just run and hide
but you just stand in my way

chorus (x2)

vamp (x2)
why everytime i tell you
how i feel it's like a
hiccup-cup-cup,
and you know the deal
pink don't think before she speaks,
but you go tme
feelin', feelin', feelin', kinda weak

chorus (x4)
