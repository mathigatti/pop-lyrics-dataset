I've been the girl with her skirt pulled high
Been the outcast never running with mascara eyes
I see the world as a candy store
With a cigarette smile saying things you can't ignore


Like Mommy I love you
Daddy I hate you
Brother I need you
Lover, hey, fuck you

I can see everything
Here with my third eye
Like the blue in the sky

If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm
You are the music

If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it

I've been the girl middle finger in the air
Unaffected by rumors
The truth: I don't care
So open your mouth stick out your tongue
Might as well let go, you can't take back what you've done

So find a new lifestyle
A reason to smile
Look for nirvana

Under the strobe lights
Sequence and sex dreams
You whisper to me
There's no reason to cry

If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm
You are the music

If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it

Take what you get and you get what you give
I said don't run from yourself, man, that's no way to live
(no no)
I've got a record in my bag you should give it a spin
(you should give it a spin)
Lift your hands in the air so that life can begin
(life can begin)

If God is a DJ
If God
(uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh)
Say if God
(uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh)
Is a DJ

If God
(God is a DJ)
Then life is a dance floor
(God is a DJ)
Get your ass on the dance floor now

If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm
You are the music

If God is a DJ
(if God is a DJ)
Life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it

If God is a DJ
(if God is a DJ)
Life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm
(then you are music)
You are the music

If God is a DJ
(if God)
Life is a dance floor
(if God is)
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it

If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm
(Then God wants you to shake your ass)
You are the music

If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
(Then get your ass on the dance floor)
It's all how you use it
