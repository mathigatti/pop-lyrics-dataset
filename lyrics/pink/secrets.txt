What do we conceal?
What do we reveal?
Make that decision every day
What is wrong with me
It's what's wrong with you
There's just so much I wanna say


I like to make-believe with you
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
That we always speak the truth (ish)
I like how we pretend the same
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Play this silly little game
(Hey)

I've got some things to say
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know
It's written on my face
It's gonna be hard to swallow
(Everybody's got a secret)
I got some things to say
(Everybody's got a secret)
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know
(Everybody's got a secret)
It's written on my face
(Everybody's got a secret)

I let the walls come down
I let the monster out
And it's coming after me (after me)
Do you feel exposed
Where it hurts the most?
Can you wear it on your sleeve?

I like to make-believe with you
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
That we always speak the truth (ish)
I like how we pretend the same
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Play this silly little game
(Hey)

I've got some things to say
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know (know, know)
It's written on my face
It's gonna be hard to swallow
(Everybody's got a secret)
I got some things to say
(Everybody's got a secret)
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know
(Everybody's got a secret)
It's written on my face
(Everybody's got a secret)

Put it in the closet
Lock the doors
I'm wondering which one is worse
Is it mine or is it yours? (yours)
Put it in the closet
Lock the doors
Wondering which one is worse
I'll show mine if you show yours (yours)
I'll show mine if you show yours, oh
He-he-hey

(Everybody's got a secret)
I got some things to say
(Everybody's got a secret)
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know
(Everybody's got a secret)
It's written on my face
(Everybody's got a secret)
It's gonna be hard to swallow

Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
(Everybody's got a secret)
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
(Everybody's got a secret)
