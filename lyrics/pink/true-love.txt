Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say
Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face
There's no one quite like you
You push all my buttons down
I know life would suck without you


At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself

Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like

True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you

Just once try to wrap your little brain around my feelings
Just once please try not to be so mean
Repeat after me now: R-O-M-A-N-C-E-E-E
Come on, I'll say it slowly (Romance)
You can do it babe!

At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself

Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like

True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you

I think it must be love
I think it must be love

Why do you rub me up the wrong way?
Why do you say the things that you say?
Sometimes I wonder how we ever came to be
But without you I'm incomplete

I think it must be
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like

True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you
No one else can break my heart like you
No one else can break my heart like you
