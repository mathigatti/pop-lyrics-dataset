I've spent enough time alone
Up in my bedroom at home
Been kinda bored lately
I hate on all I see
It's all mundane to me
This box I painted pains me
But you could watch me
You could help me down the rabbit hole with you
I could go with you
You could lead the way I'd go hand in hand with you


Oh oh oh
Today's the day I've been waiting for
Tomorrow won't come after all
Yesterday is so far away
And today is the only day
Somebody please stop the clock
Oh oh oh
Don't ever let this day stop
Oh oh oh
I never wanna go home
No no no oh oh oh
No no no
No no no no no
Oh oh oh

I used to want to grow up
I thought that I could be free
But now I'm realizing
It's cool, it ain't for me
It's cool, cause all my dreams
Are more than possibilities
I get so vicious
When I don't feel delicious
I just need a friend
So much to carry
These days are kinda scary I don't want the fun to end

Oh oh oh
Today's the day I've been waiting for
Tomorrow won't come after all
Yesterday is so far away
And today is the only day
Somebody please stop the clock
Oh oh oh
Don't ever let this day stop
Oh oh oh
I never wanna go home
No no no
No no no
No no no no no no no
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say it's gonna go my way

I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say it's gonna go my way

Oh oh oh
Today's the day I've been waiting for
Tomorrow won't come after all
Yesterday is so far away
And today is the only day
Somebody please stop the clock
Oh oh oh
Don't ever let this day stop
Oh oh oh
I never wanna go home
No no no oh oh oh

I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say it's gonna go my way
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say it's gonna go my way
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say it's gonna go my way
