Ya'll need some rock 'n' roll in your life
Hahaha ... Yeah, Yeah
It's Pink ... feeling Naughty


Chorus:
I like the way you rock
I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound
The way you put it down
No way that I can fight it
I got my eye on you
You got me so excited
So what you gonna do

VERSE 1:
I dig deep like the ship sunk
Saw Pink cutie wink onced
Had on fitted jeans, thong showing, pink pumps
Puppy named F**ker (F**ker) back to her body, boom bow
Escalation push had ribs like oh child
Taking you to lunch, what you gonna do
She said I'm picking up the check and handing it to you
Fine and witty, oh so pretty
Drop the Gucci prop that coochie
Oops I lost my train of thought watching her walk,
You know I'm looking at that *ss, it ain't my fault
Get drinks, get laugh, get talk, get long,
Got Pink, got hash, got smoke, got blunts
Rhinestones spiffy, she's more than pretty
Lovin my thuggin rubbin my fifty nine fifty
Bullets in your bra or your nipples hey
We laughed talked s**t then next she said

Chorus

VERSE 2:
Ha, check it
First met her at the Fox Hill mall getting out of her car
She had a homie with her stood about six feet tall
Both swing couldn't help but think manajatwa
So where you from we represent Crenshaw
Where they bang by law, slip your jack in your car
Oh and I'm Kelly and her name is Sherry
And she likes to sip yeagermister from her belly
We'll show you if you wanna we can go hit the deli
Man, I don't think you're ready for this jelly
Huh, all pre-trick, a major erection
Before we go pull over at a 7-11
Protection is a must to survive and in ghetto heaven
You gotta wrap it up before you go and put your head in
We pulled up and jumped right in bed
While caressing my head they looked up and said

Chorus

That's the way, mmkay mmkay
Naughty likes it, mmkay mmkay

VERSE 3:
What I wanna do you had to pick that question
Kiss it, lick it, extra friction, flex it
Love the kitty, tongue and tittie, till you sweat it
Toss you round my room like boom I'll press it
I like, I like, back forth, heave ho
Round and round baby round we go
And I aint here to taste the poom poom for hours
I'm here to make your poom poom hours
In the shower, in the sauna, in the deli
Boom macavelly, ky jelly, *ss to belly
Get peace with it, slap it, slap it
Treat the mattress like a human magnet, grab it
I like the way you slide it, ride it, don't hide it, divide it
I'm two steps behind it

Chorus

Oh tell me baby Oh Yeah

Chous
I like the way you rock
I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound
The way you put it down
No way that I can fight it
I got my eye on you
You got me so excited
So what you gonna do

So what you gonna do
I can't fight it babe
You know I gotta get it babe
You gotta give it to me babe
Oh what you gonna do
