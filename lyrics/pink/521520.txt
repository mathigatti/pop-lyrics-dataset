Nobody knows
Nobody knows but me that I sometimes cry
If I could pretend that I'm asleep
When my tears start to fall
I peak out from behind these walls
I think nobody knows
Nobody knows, no


Nobody likes
Nobody likes to lose their inner voice
The one I used to hear before my life
Made a choice
But I think nobody knows
No, no
Nobody knows, no

Baby
Oh, the secret's safe with me
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be
And baby, don't it feel like I'm all alone
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown
And I've lost my way back home
I think nobody knows, no
I said nobody knows

Nobody cares
It's win or lose, not how you play the game
And the road to darkness has a way
Of always knowing my name
But I think nobody knows
No, no
Nobody knows, no, no, no, no

Baby
Oh, the secret's safe with me
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be
And baby, don't it feel like I'm all alone
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown
And I've lost my way back home
And no, no, no, no, no
Nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, no

Tomorrow I'll be there, my friend
I'll wake up and start all over again
When everybody else is gone
No, no, no

Nobody knows
Nobody knows the rhythm of my heart
The way I do when I'm lying in the dark
And the world is asleep
I think nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows but me
Me
