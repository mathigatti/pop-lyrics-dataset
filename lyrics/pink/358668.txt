Well tonight's the night I'm gonna get right
Gonna hit the scene with my friends
Tonight's the night Imma feel alright, feel alright again
Tonight's the night Imma do what I gotta do to get out of here
Tonight's the night Imma feel alright, feel alright again


Bought myself a quick, cheap ticket
I'm looking for a brand new scene
Gotta get the hell outta Hollwyood
Cause everything is halloween
Hit the town brass knuckles
Make all the good people stare
I hope I don't end up in jail
But then again I don't realy care

Tonight's the night I'm going to get right
Gonna hit the scene with my friends
Tonight's the night Imma feel alright, feel alright again
Tonight's the night Imma do what I gotta do to get out of here
Tonight's the night Imma feel alright, feel alright again

Think it's time to have some fun
But what am I gonna wear
And where are we gonna go
And who's gonna do my hair
Got these hot-*** boots
But ain't got nothin to do
Somebody better give me some gas money
We're sitting here like fools

Tonight's the night I'm gonna get right
Gonna hit the scene with my friends
Tonight's the night Imma feel alright, feel alright again
Tonight's the night Imma do what I gotta do to get outta here
Tonight's the night Imma feel alright, feel alright again

I'm leaving today, I'm going far, far, far away
Got no reason to stay cause I wanna play
So can you hang, it's gonna be all night

Tonight's the night I'm gonna get right
Gonna hit the scene with my friends
Tonight's the night Imma feel alright, feel alright again
Tonight's the night Imma do what I gotta do to get outta here
Tonight's the night Imma feel alright, feel alright again

Bought myself a quick, cheap ticket, lookin for a brand new
scene
Gotta get the hell outta Hollywood cause every day is halloween
Hit the town with brass knuckles, all the good people stare
I hope I don't end up in jail, but then again I don't really
care

Tonight's the night I'm gonna get right
Gonna hit the scene with my friends
Tonight's the night Imma feel alright, feel alright again
Tonight's the night Imma do what I gotta do to get outta here
Tonight's the night Imma feel alright, feel alright again
