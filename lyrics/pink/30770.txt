Never win in first place
I don't support the team
I can't take direction
And my socks are never clean


Teachers dated me
My parents hated me
I was always in a fight
'Cause I can't do nothing right

Everyday I fight a war against the mirror
I can't take the person staring back at me

I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself,
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else

I wanna be somebody else

L.A. Told me
You'll be a pop star
All you have to change
Is everything you are

Tired of being compared
To damn Britney Spears
She's so pretty
That just ain't me

So doctor, doctor
Won't you please prescribe me something?
A day in the life of someone else

'Cause I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get me (no)
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
(Don't want) don't want to be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else
Yeah

Don't let me get me (don't let me)
I'm my own worst enemy (no)
Its bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else

So doctor, doctor
Won't you please prescribe me something?
A day in the life of someone else
Don't let me get me

Oh, I'm a hazard to myself, yeah
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
Its bad when you annoy yourself
Yourself
So irritating
(So irritating)
Don't wanna be my friend no more
Don't don't
Wanna be somebody else

Don't let me get me (don't let) (don't let)
I'm my own worst enemy (don't let me get me)
Its bad when you annoy yourself (its bad its so bad)
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more (how)
I wanna be somebody else
(Don't let me get me)
(Don't let me get me)
