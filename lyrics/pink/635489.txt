Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for a train
When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
He rode us all the way to New Orleans


I pulled my harpoon
Out of my dirty red bandana
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang blues
Windshield wipers slappin' time
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', I mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free
Yeah, feelin' good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
Yeah, feelin'  good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby Mcgee

From the Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather
Through everything that we done
Hey, Bobby baby kept me from the cold

One day up near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
Well, I'd trade all o' my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', an' that's all that Bobby left me, la da
Oh, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Yeah, feelin' good was good enough for me, oo oo
Good enough for me and my Bobby Mcgee
