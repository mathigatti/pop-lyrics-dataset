OOhh
OOhh
Are we all we are
Are we all we are


Cut to now, holy wow
When did everything become such a hell of a mess?
Maybe now, maybe now
Can somebody come and take this off my chest?

I know you think it's not your problem
I know you think that God will solve them
But if your shit is not together
It'll never be you and me, plant the seed
Open up and let it be

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
OOhh
We've had our fill, we've had enough, we've had it up to here
Are we all we are
Are we all we are

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
OOhh
Just sing it loud until the kids will sing it right back
Are we all we are
Are we all we are

OOhh
OOhh

Are we all we are
Are we all we are

Seven seconds, seven seconds
That is all the time you got to make your point

My attention, my attention's
Like an infant tryin' to crawl around this joint
I know we're better than the masses
But we're all followin' our asses
And if our shit is not together
It'll never be you and me, plant the seed
Open up and let it be

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
OOhh
We've had our fill, we've had enough, we've had it up to here
Are we all we are
Are we all we are

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
OOhh
Just sing it loud until the kids will sing it right back
Are we all we are
Are we all we are

Four, that's how many years it took me to get through the lesson
That I had to do it all on my own
Three, that's how many Hail Marys they would pray for me
Thinkin' I was gonna end up all alone
Two for the second chances that you've given me
Can it be, lucky me, lucky me, now let's go
One it's what we are, it's what we are
Are we all we are
Are we all we are

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
OOhh
We've had our fill, we've had enough, we've had it up to here
Are we all we are
Are we all we are

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
OOhh
Just sing it loud until the kids will sing it right back
Are we all we are
Are we all we are

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
OOhh
We've had our fill, we've had enough, we've had it up to here
Are we all we are
Are we all we are

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
OOhh
Cut to the future, sing it loud and take the power back
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
