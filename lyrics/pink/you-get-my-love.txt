While you were sleeping, I decided to lay it out
Every bad reason
All of my pointless doubts
Where I went wrong
I whispered the ways that I'm ashamed of myself
While you were dreaming, I handed you all my fears
My thoughtless decisions, turned into thoughtful tears
What have I done for the first time
I blame myself


But you get my love, baby
You get my love
If there's only one thing about me that you can trust
You get my love, baby
You get my love
Don't let my mistakes take that away from us
You get my love

I'm no longer hiding
Though you're not awake to leave
I can tell by your breathing
It's no longer a fantasy
I'm still not prepared
For when you wake up and turn to me

But you get my love, baby
You get my love
If there's only one thing about me that you can trust
You get my love, baby
You get my love
Don't let my mistakes take that away from us
You get my love

The light comes in
The dawn is rising down
You opened up your eyes
Once again I have to risk it all
The time is now

But you get my love, baby
You get my love
If there's only one thing about me that you can trust
You get my love, baby
You get my love
Don't let my mistakes take that away from us
You get my love, baby
You get my love
If there's only one thing about me that you can trust
You get my love, baby
You get my love
Don't let my mistakes take that away from us
You get my love
