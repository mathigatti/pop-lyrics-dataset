Drinkin wine and thinkin bliss is on the other side of this
I just need a compass and a willing accomplice
All my doubts that fill my head cascading up and down again
Up and down around again, down and up and down again


Oh I've had my chances and I've taken them all
Just to end up right back here on the floor
To end up right back here on the floor

Pennies in a well
A million dollars in the fountain of a hotel
Fortune teller says maybe you won't go to hell
But I'm not scared at all
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
The cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball

Sometimes you think everything's wrapped up inside a diamond ring
Love just needs a witness, and a little forgiveness
And a halo of patience, and a less sporadic pace, and
I'm learnin to be brave in my beautiful mistakes

Oh, I've felt that fire, and I, I've been burned,
But I wouldn't trade the pain for what I've learned
I wouldn't trade the pain for what I've learned

Pennies in a well
A million dollars in the fountain of a hotel
Fortune teller that says maybe you won't go to hell
But I'm not scared at all
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
The cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball

Irony, irony is hating love, hating love
For what it does to me, what it's done to me
What it's done, done

Pennies in a well
A million dollars in the fountain of a hotel
Broken mirrors and a black cat's cold stare
Walk under ladders on my way to hell
I'll meet you there
But I'm not scared at all
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
No, I'm not scared at all
Of the cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball
