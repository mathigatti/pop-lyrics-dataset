When I was a young buck
I tried to be liked by
Everyone
Everyone
I tried so hard to be funny and nice
I tried so hard to be sugar and spice
Didn't work for me
Got old quickly
But now I'm not losing sleep at night
No one's calling me on the telephone
To see if I'm at home
Cause now I've got everything that I have ever wanted or so it seems
Yeah so it seems yeah


You don't
Have to
Like me
Anymore
I've got money now
I don't care
What you say
About me
Anymore
I've got money now

When I got a little older
I realized
It's all lies
There is no prize
There is no prize
There is no heartache if you can afford
Everything delivered right to your door
Responsibilities
This life is easy
So now girl with everything
How could she complain
Cause she's got it made
Yeah she's got it made
I don't need to be tucked in at night
Told that everything is gonna be alright
Is gonna be alright
Cause I don't have to fight

You don't
Have to
Like me
Anymore
I've got money now
I don't care
What you say
About me
Anymore
I've got money now

I wouldn't trade a dollar for some sense
I wouldn't trade a lifetime for some friends
I've got everything
And all is what it seems
I worked so hard all of my life
Just to have things I could call me
I don't need no love
Cause I have got enough
So now I don't mind being alone all the time
It's alright
I've got money now
That's what it's all about
And I'm so busy buying things and traveling the world
I don't have time for friends
Or family
And that's fine with me
So it seems

You don't
Have to
Like me
Anymore
I've got money now
I don't care
What you say
About me
Anymore
I've got money now

You don't
Have to
Like me
Anymore
I've got money now
I don't care
What you say
About me
Anymore
Cause I've got money now
