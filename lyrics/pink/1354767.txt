I don't mind it
I don't mind at all
It's like you're a swingset, and I'm the kid that falls
It's like the way we fight, the times I cry, we come to blows
And every night, the passion's there, so it's gotta be right, right?


No, I don't believe you
When you say don't come around here no more
I won't remind you
You said we wouldn't be apart
No, I don't believe you
When you say you don't need me anymore
So don't pretend to
Not love me at all

I don't mind it
I still don't mind at all
It's like one of those bad dreams
When you can't wake up
Looks like You've given up, you've had enough
But I want more, no I won't stop
Cause I just know you'll come around, right?

No, I don't believe you
When you say don't come around here no more
I won't remind you
You said we wouldn't be apart
No, I don't believe you
When you say you don't need me anymore
So don't pretend to
Not love me at all

Just don't stand there and watch me fall
Cause I, cause I still don't mind it at all

It's like the way we fight, the times I cry, we come to blows
And every night, the passion's there, so it's gotta be right, right?

No, I don't believe you
When you say don't come around here no more
I won't remind you
You said we wouldn't be apart
No, I don't believe you
When you say you don't need me anymore
So don't pretend to
Not love me at all
Cause I don't believe you
