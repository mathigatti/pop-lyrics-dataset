Everything's broken, but nothing really needs to be fixed
Everything I always say I've always contradict
Don't keep pushing me 
Don't keep egging me on
I know you love me baby 
But I don't want to know how
Cause I want to be free but there're some things I need
And I want to be free oh baby 
Why is it so hard to understand me
I speak clearly 
Just give me what I need
Just give me what I need


I'm tired of strangers always coming round
I'm tired of all these favours
Cause I don't know what there about
I got to get away from these conditions 

Why just cant I just love myself enough
Instead of looking outside what I should have inside
I want to live in a world with no mirrors 
No sizes, no consequences, no prizes
No past, no future
No anger, no losers
No pain, no desire, no faith

These shackles that I tie myself down with 
They're weighing me down
I want to fly away
Fly away from here so far
Farther just give me wings yeah
Oh god
Why is it so hard to be free
Just wanna
Just wanna be free
And I wish
I wish I didn't depend on your love
I wish I loved myself enough 
Somebody once told me 
You cant take nothing 
Nothing but your deeds
I'm not proud of most of mine
But I still have along way to fight
And I'm going down that road 
Fast 
I wanna be free yeah 
Just
Just give me a ticket baby
Oh its what I need 
Take it away from me 
I wanna be 
I wanna be free 
And what if I gave up all those things that I did
That I think
Make me who i am
I'm so much love to give 
But I'm killing myself
