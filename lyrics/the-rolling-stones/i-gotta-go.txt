I ain't seen my baby
And the evening sun is goin' down
I ain't seen my baby
And the evening sun is goin' down


I've got the blues
And my baby don't be found

Leavin' in the mornin'
Baby, you know I got to go
Leavin' in the mornin'
You know I got to go

You say you don't love me
I can't live here no more

The moon is risin'
And the sun is done goin' down
The moon is risin'
And the sun is done goin' down

I've got to leave
Can't stay in your town
