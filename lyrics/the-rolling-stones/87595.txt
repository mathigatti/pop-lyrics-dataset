Hot stuff, yeah 

Hot stuff
Can't get enough 
Hot stuff, hot stuff, can't get enough 


The music is mighty, mighty fine 
Hot stuff 
Play it rough 

Cause music is want I want 
To keep my body always moving 
Yeah, shake it up, hot stuff 

Everyday I get another dose 
I can't stand it when the music stops 
Hot stuff 

Everybody on the dance floor 
You know what I'm talking about 
Music make you forget all your trouble 
Make you sing and make you tell the whole wide world 
So what? Hot stuff 

I want to tell all my friends in London 
There ain't nothing wrong with you 
But you'd better shape up 
Shake it up, your hot stuff 

All the people in New York City 
I know you all going broke 
But I know your tough, yeah you're hot stuff 

To everybody in Jamaica 
That's working in the sun 
Your hot, your hot stuff 
Shake it up, hot stuff
