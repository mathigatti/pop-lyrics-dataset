I tried to talk her into it
And I tried...
I tried to talk her into it
And I tried to talk her into it
One, one sweet night of love
One, one sweet night of love
I tried to say what to him
My love for her was heaven sent
Even led me by the hand
Now come and love a to a man
Even led my cookie choir
I love for you is gonna fire
I tried to talk into it
And I tried to talk her into it... 


And I tried to mess her into it
And I tried to drink her into it
One, one sweet night of love
One, one sweet night of love 

Don't think I don't understand
Don't think I don't all know why
Don't think I lovin' your water
Don't think I take every night... 

And I tried to sing what to extent
My love for her was heaven sent
She might my lay me by the hand
Now come out and sing pile a man
I tried to talk her into it
And I tried to mix her into it...
Whoo 

Now she will remember
And she will love
And I will, be my, be my, love
She will lead by the hand
Come on baby, I wanna dance
She to talk her out of it
Tried to talk her into it 

She would too much do it
Tried to talk her into it
Just one, one sweet night of love
One, one sweet night of love 

And don't think I don't want your purse
Don't think I'm big in my mouth
I'm hungry, yes I am thirsty
Don't let me go on south 

And I tried to say what to extent
My love for her was heaven sent
I will talked her into it
I tried to talk her into it
I gave her money, she refused
What would you do? 

Whoo
I tried to talk her into it...
Tried to talk her into it...
Ba ba ba love a man
Lovin' to a dance
And I don't know what to do
