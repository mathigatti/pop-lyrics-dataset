Baby, baby been a long, long time, been a long, long time
Been a long, long time, I was wrong girl and you were right
Baby, bay, took a long, long while, took a long, long while
Took a long, long while, but I found out you were right 


Still you have those happy eyes. I will try and apologize
Baby, baby, still the same old smile
Still the same old smile
Still the same old smile, I was so wrong
Babe and you were right
Still you have those happy eyes
Yes! I, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna try and apologize 

Oh baby, baby been a long, long time
Been a long, long time, been a long, long time
I was wrong girl and you were right 

Oh Baby, baby, won't you change your mind
Won't you change your mind
Won't you change your mind?
I was wrong girl, but not this, no, I, I said
Baby, baby, been a long, long time 

It's been such a long lonely time
It's been such a long, a long, long time
I was wrong, but I admit, I admit you were right
Oh baby, baby I just want to change your mind
I wanted to change your mind
