Coming down again, coming down again 
Coming down again, coming down again 


Share your thoughts, there's nothing you can hide 
She was dying to survive 
I was caught, oh, taken for a ride 
She was showing no surprise 

Coming down again, coming down again 
Where are all my friends, coming down again 

Coming down again, coming down again 
On the ground again, coming down again 

Slipped my tongue in someone else's pie 
Tasting better ev'ry time 
He turned green and tried to make me cry 
Being hungry it ain't no crime 

Coming down again, coming down again 
All my time's been spent, coming down again
