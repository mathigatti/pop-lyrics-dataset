Too bad she's got you by the balls 
You can't get free at all 
She's got your name 
She's got your number 
You're screamin' 
Like thunder 
And you can't get away from it all 


It's too bad, she's got you by the balls 
You can't break loose at all 
She's got your name 
She's got your number 
You're screamin' like thunder 
And you're trapped like a rat in a hole 

It's too bad, she's got you by the balls 
She's nailed you to the wall 
Oh, it's a shame 
Ah but it's funny 
She crashed your car 
She spend your money 
And you can't get away from it all 

It's too bad, she's grabbed a handful 
And you can't get away from it all 
It's too bad, oo, and it's painful 
And you can't break away from this stall 
And you can't get away from it all 

It's too bad 
She's got you by the balls 
She's got your name 
She's got your number 
You're screamin' blue murder 
And you can't get away from it all 

It's too bad, she's got you by the balls 
It's too bad, she's got you by the balls 
It's too bad, she's got you by the balls 
She's got you by the... 

It's too bad, it's too bad 
It's too bad, it's too bad 
So sad, so sad
