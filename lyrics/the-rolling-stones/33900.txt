She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished
On the breeze
Trying to hold on to that
Was just impossible


She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of
Down to earth flavor

Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I realize
That she's really
Gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
Love has gone
And made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost
In the crowd

I was flippin' magazines
In that place on Mercer Street
When I thought I spotted her

Getting on a motor bike
Looking rather lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?

Salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared
Is she really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
If I just as close my eyes
I reach out
And touch the prize
Anybody seen her around

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
If I just as close my eyes
I reach out
And touch the prize
Anybody seen her around

Lost, lost and never found
I must have called her
A thousand times
Sometimes I think
She's just in my imagination

Lost in the crowd
