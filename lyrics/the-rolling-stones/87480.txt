Back to zero 
So you wanna blow us all to pieces 
Go meet your maker, head hung down 
And give him all your explanations 
Go ahead, throw down 
Back to zero, back to nothing 
Straight to meltdown, back to zero 
That's where we're heading 


It's a monkey living on my back 
I can feel my spine begin to crack 
I'm looking to the future 
I keep on glancing back 
I prefer to rot 
I don't want to pop 

I think I'll head back to the jungle, alright 
Don't want to see no big bad rumble, too fright 
Back to zero, that's where we're going 
Back to nothing, right now, right now 
No heroes? No more heroes 
Back to meltdown 
That's where I'm going, back to zero 

My whole life is hanging on a thread 
I'm the fly inside the spider's web 
I'm looking to the future 
I keep on glancing back 
I prefer to rot 
I don't want to pop 

I worry about my great grandchildren 
Living ten miles beneath the ground 
I worry about their whole existence 
The whole damn thing's in doubt 
Back to zero, that's where we're going 
Back to nothing, that's where we're heading 
Straight to meltdown, that's where we're going 
Back to zero, right now, right now 

We're going nowhere 
Right now, right now 
Back to zero, that's where we're heading 
Back to zero
