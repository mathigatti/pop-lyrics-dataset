You need some money in a hurry 
But things ain't right 
You try to beg and borrow maybe start a fight 
Your friends don't wanna know you they just pass you by 
So they couldn't be your friends because they wouldn't lie 


Sit down shut up don't dare to cry 
Things will get better if you really try 
So don't ya panic don't ya panic 
Give it one more try 
Don't ya panic don't ya panic 
Give it one more try 

You gotta girl that doesn't bring you all she cries 
The day turns into night to try to satisfy 
You buy her all the things she want she don't improve 
You think you'd give her up if you could make that move 

Sit down shut up don't dare to cry 
Things will get better if you really try 
So don't ya panic don't ya panic 
Give it one more try 
Don't ya panic don't ya panic 
Give it one more try 

The things that don't matter easy come and go 
And the things that satisfy only come real slow 
You gotta know and watch it all in your mind 
'Cause it's better when you get it if you really try 

Sit down shut up don't dare to cry 
Things will get better if you really try 
So don't ya panic don't ya panic 
Give it one more try 
Don't ya panic don't ya panic 
Give it one more try 

Keep on trying 
Keep on trying 
Keep on trying 
Keep on trying 
Keep on trying 
You gotta keep trying
