The queen of the Nile 
She laid on her throne 
And she was drifting downstream 
On a barge that was burnished with gold 
Royal purple the sails 
So sweetly perfumed 
And poor Mark Antony's 
Senses were drowned 
And his future was doomed 


He was blinded by love 
He was blinded by love 

The Philistines paid 
For Samson's blind rage 
The secrets that two lovers share 
Should never have been betrayed 

He was blinded by love 
He was blinded by love 

Now it's no use crying or weeping 
You better lock up your soul for safe keeping 
Promise me 

The poor Prince of Wales 
He gave up his crown 
All for the trivial pursuit of 
A parvenu second-hand lady 
So lovers beware 
If you lose your heart 
Careful now, don't lose your mind 
Don't mortgage your soul to a stranger 

Don't be blinded by love 
Don't be blinded by love 

Blinded by love 
Blinded by love
