Honey, is there any place that you would like to eat? 
I know a coffee shop down on Fifty-Second Street 
And I don't need no fancy food and I don't need no fancy wine 
And I sure don't need the tears you cry 
Till the next time we say goodbye 
Till the next time we say goodbye 
Till the next time we say goodbye 
I'll be thinking of you 
I'll be thinking of you 


Yeah, a movie house on Forty-Second Street 
Ain't a very likely place for you and I to meet 
Watching the snow swirl around your hair and around your feet 
And I'm thinking to myself she surely looks a treat 
Till the next time we say goodbye 
Till the next time we say goodbye 
Till the next time that we kiss goodnight 
I'll be thinking of you 
I'll be thinking of you 

I can't go on like this, can ya? Can ya? 
I can't go on like this, can ya? 

You give me a cure all from New Orleans 
Now that's a recipe I sure do need 
Some cider vinegar and some elderberry wine 
May cure all your ills, but it can't cure mine 
Your Lou'siana recipes have let me down 
Your Lou'siana recipes have surely let me down 
Till the next time we say goodbye 
Drink to it 
Till the next time we say goodbye 
Till the next time that we kiss goodnight 
Till the next time we say goodbye 
Till the next time we say goodbye 
Till the next time that we kiss goodnight 
I'll be thinking of you 
I'll be thinking of you
