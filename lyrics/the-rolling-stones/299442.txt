You look a little dressed up 
You're acting way too smart 
Your face a little bit flushed 
For a walk in the park 


And you're clutching your phone 
As you walk in the dark 
And your smile's got a twist 
You're looking so hardcore 

If you've something to say 
Don't be too direct 
'Cause I feel a little fragile 
Don't hit the nail on the head 

I said, baby, baby, let me down real slow 
Oh no no no 
I said, baby, baby, let me down real slow 
No no no

There's a swish in your step 
There's a gleam in your eye 
Are you coloring your hair 
With some new kind of dye

But the first one to blink 
Is the first one to fall 
I don't want a confrontation 
I've got my back to the wall 

I said baby, baby, let me down real slow 
Oh no no no 
I said, baby, baby, let me down real slow 
Oh na na no

I said baby, baby, let me down real slow
Let me strech out in the afterglow
