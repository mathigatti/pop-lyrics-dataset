I can't feel, feel a thing
I can't shout, I can't scream
Breathe it out, breathe it in
All this love from within


I won't cry when you say goodbye
I'm out of tears
I won't die when you wave goodbye
I'm out of tears, out of tears

I won't drink, I won't eat
I can't hear, I won't speak
Let it out, let it in

All this pain from within
And I just can't pour my heart out
To another living thing
I'm a whisper, I'm a shadow
But I'm standing up to sing

I won't cry when you say goodbye
I'm out of tears (out of tears)
I won't cry when a woman tells why
I'm out of tears, out of tears, out of tears

Let it out, from within
Some you lose, some you win
I can drift, I can dream
?Til I float off your screen
And I just can't pore my heart out
To another living thing
I'm a whisper, I'm a shadow
But I'm standing up to sing

I won't cry when you say goodbye
I'm out of tears (out of tears)
I won't cry when a woman tells why
I'm out of tears, out of tears, out of tears
