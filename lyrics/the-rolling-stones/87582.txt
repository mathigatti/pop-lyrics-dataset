Smell of you baby, my senses, my senses be praised 
Smell of you baby, my senses, my senses be praised 


Kissing and running, kissing and running away 
Kissing and running, kissing and running away 
Senses be praised 
Senses be praised 

Your my saving grace, saving grace 
Nothing will harm you 
Nothing will stand in your way 
Nothing, Nothing 
Nothing will stop you 
And nothing will stand in your way 
No one will harm you 
No one will stand in your way 
No one will bar you 
Nothing will stand in your way 
Nothing 
There's nothing
