Sun turnin' 'round with graceful motion 
We're setting off with soft explosion 
Bound for a star with fiery oceans 
It's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home 


Freezing red deserts turn to dark 
Energy here in every part 
It's so very lonely, you're six hundred light years from home 

It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home 
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home 

Bell flight fourteen you now can land 
See you on Aldebaran, safe on the green desert sand 
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home 
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home
