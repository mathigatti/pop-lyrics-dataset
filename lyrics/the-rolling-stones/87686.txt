It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It's just the nearness of you 


It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you
