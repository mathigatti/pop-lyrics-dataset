Please go home
Please go home 


Well maybe I'm talkin to fast
But I won't be the first or the last
In the sea of the thousand you cast
C'mon please go home 

I don't have to ask what you do
I just have to look to get you
Means nothing to me to get through
Please go home 

I don't want to be on my own
Cause I can't talk much better alone
But I don't have to ring like a phone
Won't you please go home 

Please go home
In some early part of your days
You were told of the devious ways
That you thought you could get without pay
Won't you please go home 

You reach a state of your mind
Where it's madness to look and to find
Your false affections so kind
Please go home
Won't you please go home
