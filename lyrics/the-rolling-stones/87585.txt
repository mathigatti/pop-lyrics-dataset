Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
Sometimes I'm fallin' on the ground
How do you hide, how do you hide your love?


Now look here, baby, it sure looks sweet
In the sleep time, out in the street
Why do you hide, why do you hide your love?
Why do you hide, baby, why do you hide your love?

Oh, been a sick man, I wanna cry
Lord, I'm a drunk man, but now I'm dry
Why do you hide, why do you hide your love?

Now look here, baby, you sure look cheap
I make money seven days a week
Why do you hide, why do you hide your love?
Why do you hide, baby, hide from the man that you love?

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Oh, babe, I'm reachin', reachin' high
Oh, yeah, I'm fallin' out of the sky
Why do you hide, hide from the man that you love?
Why do you hide, baby, why do you hide your love?

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Why do you hide, why do you hide your love?
Why do you hide it, baby, hide from the man that you love
That you love? Well, well, well, well
