Gonna go downtown 
Gonna get my gun 
Gonna dress real sharp 
Gonna beat my drum 
I ain't gonna lie 


Gonna walk so slow 
Gonna talk just right 
And my diamond ring 
Gonna shine so bright 
I ain't gonna lie 

I've got a debt to repay 
I ain't gonna cry 
I put a gun in your face 
You'll pay with your life 

And I got my ears 
And I got my eyes 
And I got my narks 
And my alibis 
I won't waste your time 

You made one false move 
You made one mistake 
When the juice is squeezed 
That's the way it breaks 
You'll pay for your crime 

Your tongue lickin' way out of place 
I'll rip it out 
I'll stick a gun in your face 
You'll pay with your life 

I taught her everything I taught her how to dream 
I taught her everything 
I'm gonna teach her how to scream 
I taught her all she knows 
I taught her how to lie 
I taught her everything 
I'm gonna teach her how to cry 

And you cause me hurt 
And you cause me pain 
And you turned the tap 
On my burning rage 
And I can't put it out 

Gonna leave no sign 
Gonna leave no trace 
Gonna leave this town 
In a state of grace 
Give me the power 

I got a debt to repay 
I ain't gonna lie 
I put a gun in your face 
You'll pay for the crime 

I taught her everything 
I taught her how to speak 
I taught her all she knows 
I taught her how to eat 
I half invented her 
And now she acts so chic 
I taught her everything 
But now she's obselete 

I taught her everything 
How to read and write 
I taught her all she knows 
She was a neophyte 
I taught her everything 
I loved to watch her grow 
I taught her everything 
And now I want to see her go 

I taught her everything 
I got a debt to repay 
I ain't gonna cry 
I'll put a gun in your face 
You're playing with your life 

I taught her everything 
I taught her how to cheat 
I taught her all she knows 
She was so indiscreet 
I taught her everything 
I taught her how to lie 
I taught her everything 
I'm gonna teach her how to cry
