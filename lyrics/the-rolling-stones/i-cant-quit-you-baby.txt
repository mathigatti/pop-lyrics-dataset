I can't quit you, baby
So i'm gonna put you down for awhile
I said i can't quit you, baby
I guess i gotta put you down for awhile
Said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child
Yessir, you did!
Said you know i love you, baby
My love for you i could never hide
Oh, you know i love you, baby
My love for you i could never hide
Oh, when i feel you near me little girl
I know you are my one desire
When you hear me moaning and groaning, baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside
When you hear me moaning and groaning, baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me, honey, baby
You know you're my one desire
Yes, you are
