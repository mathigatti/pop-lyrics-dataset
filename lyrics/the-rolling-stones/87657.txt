I am the little red rooster 
Too lazy to crow for day 
I am the little red rooster 
Too lazy to crow for day 


Keep everything in the farm yard upset in every way 

The dogs begin to bark and hounds begin to howl 
Dogs begin to bark and hounds begin to howl 
Watch out strange cat people 
Little red rooster's on the prowl 

If you see my little red rooster 
Please drive him home 
If you see my little red rooster 
Please drive him home 
Ain't had no peace in the farm yard 
Since my little red rooster's been gone
