Here I am 
All alone and all dressed up to kill 
Cause I'd much rather be with the boys 
Than be with you 


Here I am 
With the gang, I don't care where you are 
Cause I'd much rather be with the boys 
Than be with you 

I hold up my head up high when I walk down the street 
Now I'm a man I'm standing on my own two feet 
Don't try to call me cause now I know the score 
And now I know that I don't need you anymore 

Don't put me on 
It's over now, it's no good looking back 
Cause I'd much rather be with the boys, then be with you

Who's fooling who 
It's over and you've had all your getting from me 
Cause I'd much rather be with the boys 
Yes I'd much rather be with the boys 
Yes I'd much rather be with the boys 
Yes I'd much rather be with the boys
And the boys they would much rather be with the boys than with girls like you 

Girls like you 
Girls like you......
