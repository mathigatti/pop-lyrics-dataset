I can almost hear you sigh 
I can almost hear you cry 
On every crowded street 
All the places we would meet 


What will I do without you 
They say that life goes on 
I'm feeling sorry for myself 
I can't belive you're gone 

You acted much too calm 
You turned on all the charm 
You had a cold look in your eyes 

I can feel your tongue on mine 
Silky smooth like wine 
I'm living with those memories 
That's all that's left of you and me 

I can almost hear you sigh 
Almost hear you cry 
When you made sweet love to me 
And you turned on all the charm 
Acted much too calm 
You had a cold look in your eyes 

Did it mean nothng 
Was it all in vain 
Was I just your fool 
Or was the pleasure pain 
Have you set me free 
Or will I wake up 
In the morning 
And find out it's been a bad dream 

Come on, I beg you 
I want to be your main man 

I can almost hear you sigh 
Almost hear you cry 
When you make sweet love to me 
Almost see your smile 
It stretched half a mile 
You had a stone cold look in your eyes
