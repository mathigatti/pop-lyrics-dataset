I said, "Oh no, doncha follow me no more." 
I said, "Oh no, doncha follow me no more." 
Well I'm looking for my face 
And I got no place to go 


I said, "Oh no, doncha follow me no more." 
I said, "Oh no, doncha follow me no more." 
Well, pick your own mind 
And don't you touch mine no more 

Still waiting here for a single idea 
In your clothes and your hair 
I wore it last year 
Oh no, doncha follow me no more 

I said, "Oh no, doncha copy me no more." 
I said, "Oh no, doncha copy me no more." 
Well, the lines around my eyes 
are protected by a copyright law 

Well, all the clubs and the bars 
And the little red cars 
Not knowing why, but trying to get high 
Oh no, doncha follow me no more 

Doncha follow 
Doncha follow
