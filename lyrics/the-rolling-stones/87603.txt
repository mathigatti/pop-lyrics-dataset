I can see it, see it, see it, oh yeah
I can see it, see it, see it, oh yeah
You've got yourself together, hum
You're walkin' on my path
And you're knockin' on my kitchen door
I'm glad I know your name
But you don't look the way as before
You look a whole lot better
I can see it, see it, see it, see it, see it
You've got yourself together


Well I see your information
About the time that you left before
I guess you were away
It must have been a year or more
Well you look a whole lot better
I can see it, see it, see it, see it, see it
You've got yourself together, yes you have
Cha-cha, hold her, hold her

Now I see that you're on your own
I guess you went and broke your heart
If you try my way, we'd go my way
If you treat me kind
Ah come on, come on, gotta, gotta, gotta

I can't believe my eyes
And I can't believe my ears at all
I can't believe your standing there
All over by the home back door

But I feel a whole lot better
I can see it, see it, see it, see it, see 
You've got yourself together
Yes you have, oh come on! Woo!

I see we both could change
But look what we both just do
We change in both directions
But we beam up close to soon
I feel a whole lot better
I can see it, see it, see it, see it, see it
Yes I can see it, see it, mama,
I can can see it, see it, see it, see it
You went and got yourself together
You went and got, got, got yourself together
You got, got, got, yourself together
