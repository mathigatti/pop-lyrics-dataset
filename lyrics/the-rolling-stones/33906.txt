Something happened to me yesterday
Something I can't speak of right away
Something happened to me
Something oh so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday
He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law
Something
Something very strange I hear you say
You're talking in a most peculiar way
But something really threw me
Something oh so groovy
Something happend to me yesterday
(Yesterday)
He don't know just where it's gone
He don't really care at all
No one's sure just what it was
Or the meaning and the cause
Something
- Take your partners.
He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law
Something
Someone says there's something more to pay
For sins that you committed yesterday
It's really rather drippy
But something oh so trippy
Something happened to me yesterday
He don't know just where it's gone
He don't really care at all
No one's sure just what it was
Or the meaning and the cause
Something
Someone's singing loud across the bay
Sittin on a mat about to pray
Isn't half as looney
As something oh so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday
(Right)
He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law
Something
- Well, thank you very much, and now
I think it's time for us all to go.
So from all of us to all of you, not
forgetting the boys in the band and
our producer, Redge Thorpe, we'd like
to say "God Bless".
So, if you're out tonight, don't forget,
if you're on your bike, wear white.
Evening all.
