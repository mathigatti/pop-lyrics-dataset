I was out in the city
I was out in the rain
I was feeling down hearted
I was drinking again


I was standing by the bridges
Where the dark water flows
I was talking to a stranger
About times long ago

I was young
I was foolish
I was angry
I was vain
I was charming
I was lucky
Tell me how have I changed

Now I'm out
Oh out of control
Now I'm out
Oh out of control
Oh help me now

And the girls in the doorway
And the boys on the game
And the drunks and the homeless
They all know me

And the police on the corner
Give a nod and a wave
And they point me
To my final destination

I was young
I was foolish
I was angry
I was vain
I was charming
Feeling lucky
Tell me how have I changed

Now I'm out
Oh out of control
Now I'm out
Oh out of control
Oh help me now

In the hotel I'm excited
By the smile on her face
But I wondered
How was time
Gonna change her

I was young
I was foolish
I was angry
I was vain
I was charming
I was out there
Tell me how have I changed

Now I'm out
Oh out of control
Oh I'm out
Oh out of control
