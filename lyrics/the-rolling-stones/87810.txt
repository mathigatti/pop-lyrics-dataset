Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love? 


I walked 47 miles on barb wire,
Use a cobra-snake for a necktie.
Got a brand new house on the roadside,
Made from rattlesnake hide.
I got a brand new chimney on top,
Made from a human skulls.
Now come on baby, let's take a little walk
And tell me, who do you love? 

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love? 

I got a Tombstone head and a graveyard mind,
I lived long enough, and I ain't scared of dying 

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love? 

The sky was black and the sky was blue,
Down the alley an ice wagon flew.
Somebody bumped and somebody screamed,
You should've heard just what I seen. 

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love? 

Arlene took me by the hand
She said: "Oo - ee, Daddy, I understand" 

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
