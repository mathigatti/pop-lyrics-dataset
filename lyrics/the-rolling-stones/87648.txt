Who's that woman on your arm all dressed up to do you harm
And I'm hip to what she'll do, give her just about a month or two
Bit off more than I can chew and I knew what it was leading to
Some things, well, I can't refuse
One of them, one of them the bedroom blues
She delivers right on time, I can't resist a corny line
But take the shine right off you shoes
Carryin', carryin' the bedroom blues
Ooh


In the bar you're getting drunk, I ain't in love, I ain't in luck
Hide the switch and shut the light, let it all come down tonight
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
Some face you'll never see no more

Let it all come down tonight
Keep those tears hid out of sight, let it loose, let it all come down
