I got a brand new car 
And I like to drive real hard 
I got a brand new car 
And I'm feeling good so far 


Take her on the highway for a little spin 
I want to see the kind of shape she's in 
And I got a brand new star 
Jack her up baby, go on, open the hood 
I want to check if her oil smells good 
Mmmm...smells like caviar 

Give her some stick 
Push her too far 
Right to the brink 

Hear the motor running 
Yeah, she's right in sink 
Tell me if she's thirsty 
Would she like a drink 
And I'm stopping at this bar 

Slinky like a panther 
You can hear her purr 
Touch her on the seat 
Go on, feel the fur 
And I got a brand new star 

Feel the juice 
Foot to the floor 
Take some abuse 

I got a brand new car 
And I drive her in the dark 
And I got a brand new car 
I think I'll stop and park
