Yeah. . .and I went down town
Everybody said I was foolin' around
Pick me out from all the rest
And I love that...I gotta see it
And I seen it all, shinny cars 


Now baby...and it's all the same
Everybody told me, that...you are the same
I love that girl with all my heart
And I love my girl
I seen the world... shinny cars...again
I seen the world...shinny cars 

And I wish to hell, I never fell in love at all...again
I wish to hell, I never fell in love at all 

Gangster's Moll
Gangster's Moll...one more time 

Gangster's Moll
Gangster's Moll 

(repeat second verse)

Ya gonna be safe
Movie stars, their all the same
They will take your money and steal your name
I ani't one of those marring kind, that will rip your body, still

I've seen it all
I've seen the world from shinny cars
I've seen the world from shinny cars

I wish to hell I never fell in love at all
I wish to hell, I never fell in love, I never fell in love at all

Gangster's Moll

Yeah, I've seen it all
I've seen the world from shinny cars

Yeah,Gangster's Moll
I've seen it all...........
