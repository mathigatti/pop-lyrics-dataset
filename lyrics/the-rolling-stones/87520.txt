You're always hollerin' bout where I've been
You're always screamin' bout the money I spend
What's wrong with you, oh yeah
You're crackin up 


I caught you, woman, a long time ago
Keep your hand out of my pocket keep your foot out my
door
That wrong with you, oh yeah,
You're crackin up 

I used to do your cookin', your laundry too
Now what more for a woman could a man like me do
I feel, oh yeah
You're bugging me
