I'm givin' you a piece of my mind
There no charge of any kind
Try a very simple test
You should just retrace your steps


And think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back alright

Think, think, think back baby
Think, think back a bit girl
Think, think, think back baby
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?

Think about a year ago
How we lived I'll never know
Connin' people for a dime
Here's another piece of my mind

And think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back alright

Think, think, think back baby
Think, think back a bit girl
Think, think, think back baby
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?

Take a look inside yourself
You're not really someone else
Still, I am the same old me
You say I lack maturity

But think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back, alright!

We're not children anymore
We don't need to play with toys
Take a look and you will find
you're gettin' old before your time

But think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back alright

Think, think, think back baby
Think, think I said back a bit girl
Think, think, think back baby
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?

I said think
You'd better think back a little bit
I said think
What about last year and the year before?
I said think
You promised me so much
I said think
Doncha 'member what you said?
