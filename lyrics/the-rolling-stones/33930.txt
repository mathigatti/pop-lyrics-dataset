Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow
Have you had another, baby, standing in the shadow?
I'm glad I opened your eyes
The have-nots have tried to freeze you in ice


Have you seen your brother, baby, standing in the shadow
Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow
I was just passing the time
I'm all alone, won't you give all your sympathy to mine

Tell me a story about how you adore me
Live in the shadow, see through the shadow,
Live through the shadow, tear at the shadow
Hate in the shadow, and love in your shadowy  life

Have you seen your lover, baby, standing in the shadow
Has he had another baby, standing in the shadow
Baby, where have you been all your life
Talking about all the people who should try anything twice

Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow
Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow
You take your choice at this time
The brave old world or the slide to the depths of decline
