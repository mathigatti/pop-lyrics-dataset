Fling you out into orbit 
No one's going to hear you shout 
And fools aren't going to follow 
You don't send the sleaze about 


Now you're sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
But you're gonna be fine 

The elephant's in the bedroom 
Throwing all his weight about 
And I'm locked in the bathroom 
Your screaams are gonna drown me out 

Now you're sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
But you're gonna be fine 

I got a cold chill 
I get a cool thrill 
Are you ready for the gilded cage 
Are you ready for the tears of rage 
Come on baby, don't let them drown you out 

Now you're sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
Sad sad sad 
But you're gonna be fine 

You're gonna be fine 
You're gonna be fine.....
