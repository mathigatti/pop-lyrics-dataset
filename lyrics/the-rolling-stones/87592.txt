Hold on to your head 
Hold on to your hat 
You're screaming down the alley 
And never coming back 
Get out of my bod 
Get out of the sack 
Don't give me no lip 
Don't give me no crap 
No way 


Get out the madhouse 
Tear it all down 
Get out the madhouse 
Burn it to the ground 
Got to, got to get out 

Get out of my face 
Get out of my shack 
Now you've had a fair share 
You had a fair whack 
Hold on to your butt 
Hold on to your hat 
You're heading out of here 
And never coming back 

Get out the madhouse 
Tear it all down 
Get out the madhouse 
Burn it to the ground 
We'll never make it 
Don't you fake it 
You're getting loaded 
I'm getting goaded 
Got to, got to get out 

Hold on to your heart 
Hold on to your hat 
Don't give me no shit 
Don't give me no crap 
Hold on to your head 
Don't give me no rap 
I've had it up to here 
With your yackety-yak 

You're getting loaded 
I'm getting goaded 
We'll never make it 
Don't fake it 
Get out the madhouse 
Tear it all down 
Get out the madhouse 
Burn it to the ground 
Got to, got to get out 
Got to, got to get out 

Come on baby 
Come on baby 
Burn it all down 
I'm over with ya baby 

I'm over with ya baby 
Get up--get out
