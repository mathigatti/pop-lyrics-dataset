Hey, what am I doing standing here on the corner of 
West 8th Street and 6th Avenue and... 


Ah, skip it. 

Nothing. Keith! Watcha, watcha doing? (whistle) 
Oh, I think the time has come to get out, get out 

Get up, get out, get into something new 
Get up, get out, into something new 

Ooh! And it's got me moving (Got me moving honey!) 
Ooh! And it's got me moving 
Ooh! And it's got me moving 
Ooh! And it's got me moving 

My my my, my my my, my my my, my my my, my 

Poor man eyes a rich man 
Denigrates his property 
A rich man eyes a poor man 
And envies his simplicity. 

Get up, get up, into something new 
Get up, get out, down into something new 

Ooh! and it's got me moving 
Ooh! and it's got me moving 
Ooh! and it's got me moving 
Ooh! and it's got me moving 
Ooh! and it's got me moving 

Yeah, get up, get up, get out 
Into something new 
Yeah, all, woncha all, woncha all, woncha all 
Don't stand accused....
