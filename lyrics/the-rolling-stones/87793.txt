Grabbed hold of your coat tail but it come off in my hand, 
I reached for your lapel but it weren't sewn on so grand. 
Begged, promised anything if only you would stay, 
Well, I lost a lot of love over you. 
Fell down to my knees and I hung onto your pants, 
But you just kept on runnin' while they ripped off in my hands. 
Di'mond rings, vaseline, you give me disease, 
Well, I lost a lot of lover over you. 
I boogied in the ballroom, I boogied in the dark; 
Tie you hands, tie you feet, throw you to the sharks. 
Make you sweat, make you scream, make you wish you'd never been, 
I lost a lot of love over you.
