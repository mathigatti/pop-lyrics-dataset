When love comes so late 
It´ll really hit hard
It slams through the gate
It´ll catch you off guard
Everyone saidw what a perfect love match
Cause she is so smart, she´s a hell of a catch


I was drinking in love
Gulping it down
Drifting for months on a billowing cloud
But after a while I stopped to rebel
I´m back in the past and I´m raising up hell

But I think I just made the biggest mistake of my life
And I think I just made the biggest mistake of my life

We´d been living together for over a year
The harmony´s perfect, it rang loud and clear
But then very slowly
My nerves start to fray
The little things big 
That´s what they say

I acted impatient, I acted unkind
I took her for granted
I played with her mind
She didn´t deserve it but it was too late
I walked out the door and left her to her fate

But I think I just made the biggest mistake of my life
And I think I just made the biggest mistake of my life

Now I´m down in a slump and I´m eating alone
I ruined the day with some friends on the phone
I never go out, I´m becoming a grouch
I just watch the TV and I drink on the couch

But if love comes again
I´ll be really surprised
I´ll grab it real fast
Keep it right in my sights

Cause I think I just made the biggest mistake of my life
Well I think I just made the biggest mistake of my life
