Hello, baaaaby!
Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speakin'
Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, you sweet thing!
Do I what? Will I what?
Oh baby, you knoooow what I like! 


Chantilly Lace had a pretty face and a ponytail hangin' down
A wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk
Make the world go 'round
Ain't nothing in the world like a big eyed girl
To make me act so funny, make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose like a long necked goose
Like a--oh baby, that's a-what I like! 

What's that, baby?
But... but... but... oh, honey!
Oh baby, you know what I like!
