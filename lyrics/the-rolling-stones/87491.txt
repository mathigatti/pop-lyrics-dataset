Well, hey hey
When I first came to town, people
I was walking down Hastings Street
I heard everybody talking about
Henry's Swing Club
I dropped in there that night
I did the boogie
I did the boogie, boogie
I did the boogie
Yeah, hey hey
One night I was laying down
Well I heard,
My mama and papa talking
About the boogie.
Do you wanna boogie
Do you wanna boogie
Do the boogie now
Hey hey hey hey
I'm gonna tell you something
One night when I was laying down
I heard, I heard, I heard..
Do the boogie...
Feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good...
Feel.. feel.. feel.. feel.. feel..
Thank you...
