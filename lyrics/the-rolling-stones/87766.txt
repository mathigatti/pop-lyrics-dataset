Last night I needed you so bad
I was alone and feeling sad
But now that I recall, you left me after all
The only girl I've ever had


I never ever made you cry
No no, I didn't even try
You promised you'd be true, you said you'd love me too
My only girl told me a lie

Maybe there'll come a day, when I can smile and say
She used to be my girl

But now there's nothing left to say
She only wanted me for play
I learned my lesson fast, but now I know at last
That girl belongs to yesterday
