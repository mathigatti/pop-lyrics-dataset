I just can't be seen with you 
I admit it anyway 


I just got obscene with you 
I don't stand a chance with you 
I never did anyway 

I can't even sleep with you 
I'd always be awake 
I just can't be seen with you 
It's for your own sake 
You're better off anyway 
It's too dangerous baby 
It's too dangerous 
It's too dangerous 
I just can't be seen with you 

They set us up so they can shoot us down 
Put us six feet underground 
It's just too deep for me baby 

I just can't be seen with you 
Although it hurts me to say 
Yeah it was just a dream with you 
Yeah because you're married anyway 

Oh shit 

Babe I don't stand a chance with you 
Oh you're better off this way 
It's hit and run away 
It's just too dangerous baby 

I just can't be, yes I got to chill this thing with you 
I just can't be 
It's just too dangerous baby 
Baby, it's just too much for me 
I just can't be 
I just can't be seen nowhere around you baby 
I just can't be 
It's too dangerous--it's just too dangerous baby 
Even in the dark 
I just can't be 
Yeah I got to chill with you 
I just can't be
