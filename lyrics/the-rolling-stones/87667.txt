I want a real fine car, fly Miami too 
All the rum, I want to drink it, all the whiskey too 
My woman need a new dress, my daughter got to go to school 
I'm working so hard, I'm working for the company 
I'm working so hard to keep you in the luxury 


You can't call me lazy on a seven day a week 
Make a million for the Texans, twenty dollar me 
Yes, I want a gold ring, riding in a limousine 
I'm working so hard, I'm working for the company 
I'm working so hard to keep you in the luxury 

Now listen, I'm a proud man, not a beggar walking on the street 
I'm working so hard, to keep you from the poverty 
I'm working so hard to keep you in the luxury, oh yeah 
I'm working so hard, I'm working so hard 
Harder, harder, working, working, working 

I think it's such a strange thing, giving me concern 
Half the world it got nothing the other half got money to burn 
My woman need a new dress, my daughter got to go to school 
I'm working so hard, I'm working for the company, oh, yeah 
I'm working so hard, oh, yeah 

Working on a Sunday in refinery 
Make a million for the Texans, twenty dollar me 
All the rum, I want to drink it, I got responsibility 
I'm working so hard to keep you from the poverty, oh, yeah 
I'm working so hard, I'm working for the company, oh, yeah 
I'm working so hard, oh, yeah 
Harder, harder, working, working...
