Hey Negrita, hey now 
Move your body, move your mouth 
Shake lady, way down south 
Shake baby, in your home town 


Come si chiama, what's you game 
I'm just a poor man, what's your name 
Shake your body, do it up now 
Shake body, move it up now 

Hey Negrita, hey now 
Hey conchita, shake it up now 
Bate las caderas, do it up now 

Flash of gold in your ears, child 
Flash of gold in your eyes 
Saw the gleam in your mouth 
Saw the steel in your thighs 
Do it up now 

Bate las caderas, do it up now 
Just a momentita, not so fast 
I need money, my sweet ass 
Listen I'm a poor man 
My pay is low 
Here's one last dollar, then we go 
"One last dollar," she say "I got my pride" 
Going to get your boss, boy 
Going to tan your hide 

Hey Negrita, hey now 
Hey Negrita, do it right now
