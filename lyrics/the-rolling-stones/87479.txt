Hey, hey, baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Hey, now baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Well, now don't treat me, baby, like you used to do. 


Well you got me running baby, got me hiding too
Tell me, tell me baby, what we gonna do?
Now baby, honey what's wrong with you
Well now, don't treat me baby, like you used to do 

Well you got me running baby, got me hiding too
Tell me, tell me baby, what we gonna do?
Now baby, honey what's wrong with you
Well now, don't treat me baby, like you used to do 

Well now I can't help it, baby, if I'm feeling strange.
I'm just hoping, baby, I'm not going insane.
Now baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Well now, don't treat me, baby, like you used to do.
