Well if you call this a life 
Why must I spend it with you? 
If the show must go on 
Let it go on without you 
So sick and tired hanging around with jerks like you 


Who'll tell me those lies 
And let me think they're true? 
What am I to do 
You want it, I got it too 

Though the lies might be true 
That's just cause the joke's about you 
I'm so sick and tired hanging around with dogs like you 
You're the first to get blamed, always the last bitch to get paid 

Oh, tell me those lies 
Let me think they're true 
I heard one or two 
They weren't about me, they weren't about her 
They were all about you 

I may miss you 
But missing me just isn't you 
I'm so sick and tired hanging around with dogs like you 

Tell me those lies 
Let me think they're true 
I heard one or two, and they weren't about me, they weren't about her 
They're all about you 
I'm so sick and tired 
What should I do 
You want it, you get it... 
So how come I'm still in love with you?
