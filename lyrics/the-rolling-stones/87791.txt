Do, do, do doot, do doo n' do doot
Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder

Girl really wants you man
Don't you see you gotta give her all the lovin' that she needs,
gotta try
Try it one more time
Gotta try, try it one more time 


Don't you worry try a little harder
Don't you worry try a little harder
Give her lovin' that's a little stronger

If you with your baby when the day turns to night, you gotta
give
her lovin' make her feel all right, it's all right
It's all right. Try one more time. It's all right 

Don't you worry try a little harder

Say goodnight and stay a little longer
Say goodnight and stay a little longer
Have to keep her from cryin' then you got to try to work
pretty
hard to keep her satisfied
Just try, try it one more time. Try it one more time. Gotta try
Try a little harder. Try a little harder. Try a little harder
Try a little harder. try a little harder
If you with your baby when the day turns to night, you gotta
give
her lovin' make her feel all right, gotta try
