Ain't no use in crying 
Stay away from me 


Standing in the kitchen 
Looking way out cross the fields 
You see a face in the window 
It not real, it not real 

Ain't no use in crying 
Stay away from me 
Ain't no use 

Standing at the station 
Gazing down the track 
There ain't no train coming baby 
I ain't never, never coming back 

Standing in the balcony 
Looking way towards cross the sea 
If you see your ship come a sailing 
It not me, it not me 
It's not me 
Stay away from me 
Hey you 

Ain't no use, ain't no use 
Stay away from me 
Ain't no use in crying 
Stay away from me
