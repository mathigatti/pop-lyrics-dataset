Well, my name is a number 
A piece of plastic film 
And I'm growin' funny flowers 
In my little window sill 


Dont you know I'm a 2000 man 
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all 

Well my wife still respects me 
I really misused her 
I am having an affair 
With the random computer 

Don't you know I'm a 2000 man 
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all 

Oh daddy, proud of your planet 
Oh mummy, proud of your sun 
Oh daddy, proud of your planet 
Oh mummy. proud of your sun 
Oh daddy, your brain's still flashin' 
Like it did when you were young 
Or do you come down crashin' 
Seeing all the things you'd done 
All was a big put on 

Oh daddy, proud of your planet 
Oh mummy. proud of your son 
Oh daddy, proud of your planet 
Oh mummy. proud of your sun 

Oh daddy, proud of your planet 
Oh mummy. proud of your sun 
Oh daddy, proud of your planet 
Oh mummy. proud of your sun 

And you know who's the 2000 man 
And your kids they just won't understand you at all
