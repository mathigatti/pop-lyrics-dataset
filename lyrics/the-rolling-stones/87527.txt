Down in the graveyard where we have our tryst 
The air smells sweet, the air smells sick 
He never smiles, his mouth merely twists 
The breath in my lungs feels clinging and thick 
But I know his name, he's called Mr. D. 
And one of these days he's gonna set you free 
Human skulls is hangin' right 'round his neck 
The palms of my hands is clammy and wet 


Lord, I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free 
Dancin', dancin', dancin' so free 
Dancin', Lord, keep your hand off me 
Dancin' with Mr. D., with Mr. D., with Mr. D. 

Will it be poison put in my glass 
Will it be slow or will it be fast? 
The bite of a snake, the sting of a spider 
A drink of Belladonna on a Toussaint night 
Hiding in a corner in New York City 
Lookin' down a fourty-four in West Virginia 

I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free 
Dancin', dancin', dancin' so free 
Dancin', Lord, keep your hand off me 
Dancin' with Mr. D., with Mr. D., with Mr. D. 

One night I was dancin' with a lady in black 
Wearin' black silk gloves and a black silk hat 
She looked at me longin' with black velvet eyes 
She gazed at me strange all cunning and wise 
Then I saw the flesh just fall off her bones 
The eyes in her skull was burning like coals 
Lord, have mercy, fire and brimstone 
I was dancin' with Mrs. D. 

Lord, I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free 
I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free 
Dancin', dancin', dancin' so free 

Dancin', dancin'
