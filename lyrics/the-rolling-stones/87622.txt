I'm Yours And I'm Hers
You know I'm yours and I'm hers
Somebody else's too, oh yeah


You know I'm yours and I'm hers
Somebody else's too

You know I'm two-times seven mamas, ah
Do just what I wanna do
Let me, baby, let me squeeze her
Well man, I'm lost uptown
Let me, let me squeeze her

Well man, I'm lost uptown
(I wanna squeeze my baby)
'Cause you know I'm a stranger
I wanna know what's going down
Want to take you with me

Want you-all to understand
Ah, this mama, gonna tell ya, mama
Want you-all to understand
You know I can love you, mama
Better than your steady man
