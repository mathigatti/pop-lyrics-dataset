Sittin' thinkin' sinkin' drinkin' 
Wondering what I'd do when I'm through tonight 
Smoking moping, maybe just hopin' 
Some little girl will pass on by 
Don't wanna be alone but I love my girl at home 
I remember what she said 
She said, "My, my, my don't tell lies, keep fidelity in your head 
My my my, don't tell lies. When you're done you should go to bed 
Don't say hi, like a spider to a fly 
Jump right ahead and you're dead" 


Sit up, fed up, low down go round 
Down to the bar at the place I'm at 
Sitting drinking, supereficially thinking 
About the rinsed-out blonde on my left 
Then I said, "hi" like a spider to a fly 
Remebering what my little girl said 

She was common, flirty, she looked about thirty 
I would have run away but I was on my own 
She told me later she's a machine operator 
She said she liked the way I held the microphone 
I said my, my, like the spider to the fly 
Jump right ahead in my web
