Well let's talk it over baby before we start
I heard about the way you do your part
Don't lie to me don't you lie to me
Don't you make me mad I'll get evil as a man can be 


Well all kinds of people that I just can't stand
That's a lying woman and a cheating man
Don't lie to me don't you lie to me
Don't you make me mad I'll get evil as a man can be
Yeah 

Well I will love you baby and it ain't no lie
For every winter till the well runs dry
Don't lie to me don't you lie to me
Don't you make me mad I'm as shook up as a man can be 

Well let's talk it over baby before we start
I heard about the way you used to do your part
Don't lie to me don't you lie to me
Don't you make me mad I'm as shook up as a man 

Well well
Well let's talk it over babe before we start
I heard about the way you used to do your part
Don't lie to me don't you lie to me
Cuz it make me mad I'll get evil as a man can be
