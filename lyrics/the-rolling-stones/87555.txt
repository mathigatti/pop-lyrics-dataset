Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 


When I travel coast to coast 
You're the hook up I miss the most 
In the motel you're the ghost 
Other women don't come close 

Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 

From the first time such a crush 
Such excitement, such a rush 
In the kitchen, in the car 
In the ditch, on the dirty floor 

Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 

Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 
Feel on baby 

Wanderlust and love disease 
Taken over and strangled me 
Cure my body, make me whole 
Feed my body, feed my soul 

Feel on baby 
Got to feel on 
Got to feel on 
Feel on, feel on 
Got to feel on 
Got to feel on 
Got to feel on 

Got to feel on 
Got to feel on 
Feel on baby 
Baby baby baby baby....
