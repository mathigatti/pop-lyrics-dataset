You can turn off and on more times
than a flashin' neon sign.
When you want you're bad
but you can be so kind 


Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
just what you're gonna do now
You take it or leave it, it's just my life 

There've been times when you tried
makin' eyes at all my so called friends
Then you go, now you're back
but you can be so kind 

Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
just what you're gonna do now
You take it or leave it, it's just my life 

Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la 

I'm sick and tired of the smile that you give
when you don't come home at night
You said you'd call, that's a lie
but you could be so kind 

Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
just what you're gonna do now
You take it or leave it, it's just my life 

Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la 

Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la
