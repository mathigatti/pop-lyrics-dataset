Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head 


I'd tried to tell the woman but she doesn't believe a word I
said
Go light pretty baby... gonna need my help some day
It's all right pretty baby...gonna need my help some day 

You're gonna wish you listened to some of those things I said

Go ahead pretty baby
Oh, honey knock yourself out
Go ahead pretty baby
Oh honey knock yourself out 

I still love you baby cause you don't know what it's all about 

Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
