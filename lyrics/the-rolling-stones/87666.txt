I'm the man on the mountain, come on up. 
I'm the plowman in the valley with a face full of mud. 
Yes, I'm fumbling and I know my car don't start. 
Yes, I'm stumbling and I know I play a bad guitar. 


Give me little drink from your loving cup. 
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk. 

I'm the man who walks the hillside in the sweet summer sun. 
I'm the man that brings you roses when you ain't got none. 
Well I can run and jump and fish, but I won't fight 
You if you want to push and pull with me all night. 

Give me little drink from you loving cup. 
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk. 

I feel so humble with you tonight, 
Just sitting in front of the fire. 
See your face dancing in the flame, 
Feel your mouth kissing me again, 
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz, 
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz. 
Oh, what a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz. 

Yes, I am nitty gritty and my shirt's all torn, 
But I would love to spill the beans with you till dawn. 

Give me little drink from your loving cup. 
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk.
