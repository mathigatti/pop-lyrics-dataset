Now, when your woman start actin' funny
And begin to run aroun'
You better get you somebody
'cause she's fittin' to put you down
Better let her go
Just as quick as you can
You know  that hoodoo girl
Is going to hoodoo the hoodoo man


You know my woman got me on a wonder
At somethin' I can't understan'
How I look at her runnin' with some other man
After all I did, all in this world I can
You know that that hoodoo girl
She done hoodoo the hoodoo man

She take all my money and spend it all over town
And when I want to love her
Now, she ain't can be foun'
Now I walk and cry
Dryin' tears away with my hand
You know that hoodoo girl
She done hoodoo the hoodoo man
