Pain in my heart 
Treatin' me poor 
Where can my baby be 
Lord, no one knows 


Pain in my heart 
Won't let me sleep 
Where can my baby be 
Lord, where is she 

And one day 
My days are gettin' tough 
Won't you come back, come back, come back, baby 
Lord 

Pain in my heart 
Won't let me be 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I wake up restless night in misery 
Lord 

Won't somebody stop this pain 

Lord, one day 
My days are gettin' tough 
Won't you love me, love me, love me, baby 

Pain in my heart 
Pain in my heart 
Somebody stop this 
Pain in my heart 
It's killin' me baby 
This pain in my heart 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Pain in my heart 
This pain in my heart
