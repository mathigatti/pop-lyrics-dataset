Living high, sitting in the sun
Sit on your ass till your work is done
You lazy mother, your hands are clean
You pull the strings and you got the clout
There's something filthy living in your mouth
Pushing your buttons you get away free


You let somebody do the dirty work
Find some loser, find some jerk
Find some dumb ass do it all for free
Let somebody do the dirty work
Find some loser, find some jerk
Find some greaseball, yeah

It's beginning to make me angry
I'm beginning to hate it
You're a user, you're a user
I'm gonna shake you

Let somebody do the dirty work
I never see no grease on you baby
Never roll your sleeves up, do you, never baby
Let somebody do the dirty work
Find some fucker, find some jerk
Do it all, do it all for free

While you're out having all the fun
They'll take the blame when the trouble comes
Let somebody do it, do it

It's beginning to make me angry
I'm beginning to hate you
You're a user, I hate you
When you push you make me crazy

Let somebody do it all for free
Let somebody do the dirty work
Let somebody do it all for free
Let somebody do the dirty work
Let somebody do the dirty work
Pushing it harder, pushing it harder
