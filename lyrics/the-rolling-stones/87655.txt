Tried to trail you last night, baby, trail you in my car 
But I was afraid of what I was looking for 
And little by little I'm losin' my love for you 
Yeah, little by little I've found out you was untrue 


Alright, Keith, come on, now
My turn

Well I try not to bear a grudge, a girl's gonna hitch a ride 
Things ain't been the same since my mother died 
Yeah, little by little, I'm losin' my love for you 
Yeah, little by little I've found out you was untrue
