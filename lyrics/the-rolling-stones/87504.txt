Men are armed shout who goes there 
We have journeyed far from here 
Armed with bibles make us swear 


Candy and Taffy, hope we both are well 
Please come see me in the citadel 

Flags are flying, dollar bills 
Round the heights of concrete hills 
You can see the pinnacles 

Candy and taffy, hope we both are well 
Please come see me in the citadel 

In the streets are many walls 
Hear the peasants come and crawl 
You can hear their lovers call 

Candy and Taffy, hope we both are well 
Please come see me in the citadel 

Screaming people fly so fast 
In their shiny metal cars 
Throug the woods of steel and glass 

Candy and Taffy, hope we both are well 
Please come see me in the citadel
