A empty heart is like an empty life 
I said a empty heart is like a empty life 
Well, it makes you feel like you wanna cry 
Like you wanna cry 
Like you wanna cry 


Well you've been my lover for a long long time 
Well you've been my lover for a long long time 
Well you left me all alone, and end my time 
I want my lover again 
I want my lover again 
I want my lover again 
I want it back again 

Yeah, a little stick 
Yeah, a little bit darling 
Take it down 
Take it down 
Yeah, take it down 

Come on back to me, baby 
Come on back to me, baby 
Come on 
Come on back to me 
And I'll show ya 
I'll show ya 

That a empty heart means a empty life 
Yeah an empty heart like a empty life 
Oh, it makes you feel like you wanna die 
Like you wanna die 
Like you wanna die 
(I wanna die)
