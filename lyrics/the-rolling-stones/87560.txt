A scrap of flesh 
And a heap of bones 
One deep high 
And a desperate moan 


Three black eyes 
And a busted nose 
I said oh yeah, oh yeah 

Take me up 
Baby I'm ready to go 
Shake me up 
Baby I'm ready to go, yeah 
Take me up 
Baby I'm ready 
Baby, baby I'm ready to go 
(Chill me, freeze me, It's in my blood) 

I'm not going to burn in hell 
I cased the joint 
And I know it well 
Maybe my carcass 
Would feed the worms 
But I'm working 
For the other firm 

Take me up 
Baby I'm ready to go 
Fix me up 
Baby I'm ready to roll, yeah 
Set me up 
Baby, baby, baby I'm ready to go 
(Chill me, freeze me, It's in my blood) 
Flip the switch 

I got my money, my ticke 
All that shit 
I even got myself 
A little shaving kit 
What would it take 
To bury me 
I can't wait 
I can't wait to see 

I got toothbrush, mouthwash 
All that shit 
I'm looking down 
In the filthy pit 
I had the turkey 
And the stuffing too 
I even saved 
A little bit for you 

Lethal injection is a luxury 
I wanna give it 
To the whole jury 
I'm just dying 
For one more squeeze 
Oh yeah 
Oh yeah 

Pick me up 
Baby I'm ready to go 
Take me up 
Baby I'm ready to blow 
Take me up 
Baby if you're ready to go 
Baby I got nowhere to go 
Baby I'm ready to go 
(Chill me, freeze me, to my bones) 
Flip the switch
