Lookin' tired babe, sittin' there on the side 
You're gettin' tired babe, sittin' there on the side 
Ain't in the right place, to try and change the tide 


You sit and read, but all you do is moan 
You sit and read, but all you do is moan 
Ain't no wonder, you're sittin' there on your own 

You're readin' the cover of a pseudo paperback 
You're readin' the cover of a pseudo paperback 
Displays about writers, Chaucer to Steinbeck 

You're lookin' tired babe, sittin' there on the side 
You're lookin' tired babe, sittin' there on the side 
It's only yourself, you're takin' for a ride 

You say you won't change, but do you really care 
You say you won't change, but do you really care 
You can't do much just sittin' there in your chair 

I said, hey babe, hey where you been all night? 
I said, hey babe, hey where you been all night? 
Your clothes all tangled, sure ain't talkin' right 

You're lookin' tired babe, sittin' there on the side 
You're lookin' tired babe, sittin' there on the side 
You ain't in the right place, to try and change the tide
