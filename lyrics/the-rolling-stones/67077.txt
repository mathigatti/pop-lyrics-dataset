Well you bit my lip and drew first blood
And wore my cold, cold heart
And your wrote your name right on my back
Boy your nails were sharp


Don't stop
Honey don't stop
Don't stop
Baby don't stop

Well I love your screams of passion
In the long hot summer night
But you pepper me with poison darts
And twisted in your knife

Don't stop
Honey don't stop
Don't stop
Baby don't stop

Well the only thing I ask of you
Is to hand me back some pride
Don't you dump me on some dusty street
And hang me out to dry

Don't stop
Honey don't stop
Baby don't stop
Baby don't stop
Honey

I'm losing you
I know your heart is miles away
There's a whisper there where once there was a storm
And all that's left is that image that I'll find a way
And some memories have tattered as they've torn

Don't stop
Don't stop
Baby don't stop
Baby don't stop
Honey baby don't stop
Honey honey
Baby don't stop
Baby don't stop
Come on honey honey don't stop
Well baby
Baby don't stop
Baby baby don't stop
My honey don't stop
Don't ya stop
Don't stop...
