I don't know why I love you babe 
I don't know why I love you 
I don't know why I love you, baby 
But I love you darlin yes I do 
You always treat me like a fool 
You kick me when i'm down that's you're rule 
I don't know why I love you baby 
But I love you 
When are you gonna stop your cheatin ways 
With another guy you laugh in my face 
Just how long must i be disgraced 
Cause I love you baby 


I don't know  I don't know why babe 
I don't know  I don't know why baby now 
I don't know why I love you baby 
But I love you
