I met her in a movie house, she was playin' the arcades
And posing with her hang hair down, lookin' a little bit unmade
She spoke in broken English, I replied in broken French
'Come and share my popcorn, it's not a federal offense 


She's so young, God help me, she's so young 

Her skin was kind of pudgy, got spots all on her face
From wearin' too much makeup, and she wasn't walkin' straight
She drove her daddy's car, she got a genuine teenage drag
She always find a popper, to be hidden in her stash 

She's so young, God help me, she's so young
So young, so young
So young, so young 

She ain't never gonna steal my heart away
I might not get it back!
She's so young 

Well I took her down to Barney's, bought her a brand new set of boots
She tried 'em in my arms, and's lookin' terminally cute
I tried to take it easy, put my dick back on a leash
If I see big trouble comin', I'm gonna beat a quick retreat 

She's so young, God help me, she's so young
So young, so young
So young, so young 

She ain't never gonna steal my heart away
I might not get it back
She's so young, yeah
So young, so young
So young, so young
She ain't never gonna steal my heart away
I might not get it back
Yeah, she's so young 

So young, so young
So young
I ain't never gonna give my heart away
I might not get it back
She's so young, so young
So young
I ain't never gonna give my heart away
I might not get it back
