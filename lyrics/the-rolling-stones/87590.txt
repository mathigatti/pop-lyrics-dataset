I'm going to Chicago that's the last place my baby stayed
I'm packing up my bags I'm gonna leave this town right away
I'm gonna find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world


Chicago City, that's what the sign on the freeway read
I'm gonna keep on going 'til I get to that street's called 6th and Main
I've gotta find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world

C'mon hitch hike
Hitch hike children
Hitch hike
Hitch hike baby
Hitch hike
Hitch hike baby
C'mon hitch hike
Hitch hike darling

I'm going to St. Louis but my next stop just might be L. A., that's what I say
I got no money in my pocket so I'm going to have to hitch hike all the way
I'm gonna find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world

C'mon hitch hike
Hitch hike children
Hitch hike
Hitch hike baby
Hitch hike
Hitch hike baby
C'mon hitch hike
Hitch hike children

Now c'mon c'mon hitch hike
Hitch hike children
Hitch hike
Hitch hike darling
C'mon hitch hike
Hitch hike children
Hitch hike hitch hike
Hitch hike baby
Mmmmm
