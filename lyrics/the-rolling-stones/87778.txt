Through the lonely nights I think of you
Through the lonely hours I dream of you
I don't no why I do it, but I do
Why do you take it, what's wrong with you?


Through the lonely weekends I'm far from you
Why you're coming on, like you're supposed to do, yes
Oh, but you know me so well,
And your time ain't so hard to sell.

Every time I see ya
Every time I see ya
Every time I see ya
Every time I see you

In your cherry dresses and your shiny shoes
In a doorway on some neon avenue
Making the lonely pay for me
Why don't we set each other free.

When did I mislead ya
When did I misread ya
When did I mistreat ya
When did I deceive ya

Oh, I'm stuck out want to cry, cry, cry
Sleep in the doorway, Lord, making a rendezvous
Lord, I'm stuck out baby, want to cry cry cry cry cry cry cry
Lord, babe, I li, li, li, li, li Lord...
