Baby you excite me
But you talk too much
Won’t stand on a corner
Love you more
Oh, yeah


Scarlet, why you wearing my heart, on your sleeve
Where it ain’t supposed to be
Scarlet, why you tearing my heart, all to pieces
It ain’t the way it’s supposed to be
Scarlet, why are you keeping my heart, to yourself
It ain’t the way it’s supposed to be

Scarlet
Scarlet
Oh yeah

You don’t have to change your mind
And leave this neighbourhood so far behind
Honey you don’t have to cry no more
When I come a knocking, right at your front door

Scarlet
Scarlet
Scarlet

Scarlet, why you wearing my heart, on your sleeve
Where it ain’t supposed to be
Scarlet
Scarlet, oh

Scarlet
Scarlet
Scarlet
Why you wearing my heart

Scarlet
Why you wearing my heart
Scarlet
Why you wearing my heart
Scarlet
Why you wearing my heart

Scarlet
