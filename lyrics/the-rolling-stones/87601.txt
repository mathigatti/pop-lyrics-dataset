Well I'm going away to live
Won't be back no more
Going back down south, child
Lord now don't you worry ma


Woman, I'm trouble
Trouble and all worried mind
Well I just can't be satisfied
Just can't keep on crying

Well I feel like snapping
Pistol in your face
Going to let some graveyard
Lord be your resting place

Woman I'm trouble
Trouble and all worried mind
Yeah I just can't be satisfied
Just can't keep on crying
Yeah

Yeah I'm all in my sleep
Hear my doorbell ring
Looking for my baby
Lord seen a doggone thing

Woman I'm trouble
Trouble and all worried mind
Yeah I just can't be satisfied
Just can't keep on crying

Yeah I know my little old babe
She gonna jump and shout
That old train be late, man
Lord I come walkin out

Woman I'm trouble
Trouble and all worried mind
Yeah I just can't be satisfied
Just can't keep on crying
Well
