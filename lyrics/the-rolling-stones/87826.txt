I've been looking out baby for a girl for me.
When I saw you baby, I knew that I could see


You must be the one
You must be the one
You must be the one
You must be the one

When I saw your brown eyes and your teeth like pearls
You stood by your limousine lookin' like a proper girl

(Repeat Chorus)

I know that I love you, It don't sound like it's true
I would do my very best to get right thru' to you.

(Repeat Chorus)
