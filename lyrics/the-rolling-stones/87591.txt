Hear the voice of experience 
A word from the wise 
Grab opportunity 
While you're alive 
'Cos if you follow the crowd 
'Cos if you act like a coward 
You'll end up yelling out loud 


Hold back 
You'll regret it someday 
Choke on that 
Don't let it pass you by 
Hold back 
You better seize the hour 

You look in your history books 
You delve in the past 
Stalin and Roosevelt 
Both took their chances 
And George grasped the nettle 
It's do or dare 
From the banks of the Delaware 

Yeah don't hold back 
Trust your gut reaction 
Be bold, be bold baby 
If you don't take chances 
You won't make advances 
Hold back yeah 

Don't matter if you ain't so good looking 
If you ain't sharp as a blade 
Don't be afraid 
Don't hold back 
Life is passing you by 
Choke on that 
Keep on moving, keep on moving 
Gotta run with the crowd 
You'll end up in the madhouse 
Shouting the cold walls down 
Yeah don't hold back 

Hold back 
You're messing with your life 
Hold back 
Yeah life goes by fast sometimes 
Be bold be bold be bold be bold baby 
You're wasting your time 
I want your attention 
So pin back your ears 

I've been climbing this tree of promises 
For over forty years 
Your vision get broken 
And bust on the ground 
So watch me, watch me rebound 

Yeah don't hold back 
You're wrecking your life 
Choke on that 
Don't hold back 
No don't hold back 
You're messing with your life
