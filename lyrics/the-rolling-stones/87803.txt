I caught a glimpse of waving hair
And we're feel better standing there
My feet just left the floor
She realized I'm sure
That we were falling in love


She looked around and smiled by me 
I tried to think of words to say
He never realized
Under his very eyes
That we were falling in love

Is he so blind that he can't see (ah ah ah ah)
That his girl had fallen for me (oh oh oh oh)

To take his love would take his heart
I knew I could not tear them apart
So as I turned to go
Still he did not know
That we had fallen in love, in love, in love
