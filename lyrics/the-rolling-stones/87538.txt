Well now meet me in the bottom,
Bring me my running shoes.
Yeah now, meet me in the bottom,
Bring me my running shoes.
When I come out the window,
I'm gonna have time to lose. 


When you see me streakin' by,
Please don't believe.
When you see me streakin' by,
Please don't believe.
When you see me coming baby
You know my life is at stake. 

Yeah now I hope you'll see me
When I come streakin' by.
Well I hope you'll see me,
When I come streakin' by.
She' got a bad old man, you know
And I'm too young to die.
