Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl 
Her eyes were hazel 
And her nose were slightly curved 
We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel 
It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well 
It took a starry to steal my breath away 
Down on the water front 
Her hair all drenched in spray 


Hannah baby was a honey of a girl 
Her eyes were hazel 
And her teeth were slightly curved 
She took my guitar and she began to play 
She sang a song to me 
Stuck right in my brain 

You're just a memory of a love 
That used to be 
You're just a memory of a love 
That used to mean so much to me 

She got a mind of her own 
And she use it well 
Well she's one of a kind 
She's got a mind 
She got a mind of her own 
And she use it mighty fine 

She drove a pick-up truck 
Painted green and blue 
The tires were wearing thin 
She turned a mile or two 
When I asked her where she headed for 
"Back up to Boston I'm singing in a bar" 
I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge 
My nerves are shot already 
The road ain't all that smooth 
Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone 
I keep on a feeling that's gnawing in my bones 

You're just a memory of a love 
That used to mean so much to me 
You're just a memory girl 
You're just a sweet memory 
And it used to mean so much to me 
Sha la la la la 

She got a mind of her own 
And she use it well 
Mighty fine, she's one of a kind 

On the seventh day my eyes were all a glaze 
We've been ten thousand miles 
Been in fifteen states 
Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind 
I hit the bottle and hit the sack and cried 
What's all this laughter on the 22nd floor 
It's just some friends of mine 
And they're busting down the door 
Been a lonely night at the Memory Motel
