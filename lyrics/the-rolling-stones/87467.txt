I know you wanna leave me, but I refuse to let you go 
If I have to beg, plead for sympathy 
I don't mind, 'cause it means that much to me 


Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin' 
Please don't leave me, don't you go 
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby 
Please don't leave me, don't you go 

Well I heard a quiet man is half a man, with no sense of pride 
If I have to cry to keep ya I don't mind weepin' 
If weepin' gonna keep ya by my side 

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin' 
Please don't leave me, don't you go 
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby 
Please don't leave me, don't you go 

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day 
Just to keep you from walkin' away 
Let my friends laugh, for this I can stand 
'Cause I wanna I keep ya, yeah, yeah, I can 

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin' 
Please don't leave me, don't you go 
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby 
Please don't leave me, don't you go 

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin' 
Please don't leave me, don't you go 
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby 
Please don't leave me, don't you go 

I got a love so deep in the pit of my heart 
Ev'ry day it grows more and more 
I'm not ashamed to come and plead with you, baby 
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out the door 

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin' 
Please don't leave me, don't you go 
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby 
Please don't leave me, don't you go 

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin' 
Please don't leave me, don't you go 
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby 
Please don't leave me, don't you go
