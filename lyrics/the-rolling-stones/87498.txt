Can you hear the music, can you hear the music? 
Can you feel the magic hangin' in the air? 
Can you feel the magic? Oh, yeah 


Love is a mystery I can't demystify, oh, no 
Sometimes I wonder why we're here 
But I don't care, I don't care 

Can you hear the music, can you hear the music? 
Can you feel the magic dancin' in the air? 
Can you feel the magic? Oh, yeah 

Love is a mystery I can't demystify, oh, no 
Sometimes I I'm dancin' on air 
But I get scared, I get scared 

When I hear the drummer, get me in the groove 
When I hear the guitar, makes me wanna move 
Can you feel the magic, floatin' in the air? 
Can you feel the magic? Oh, yeah 

Sometimes you're feelin' you've been pushed around 
And your rainbow just ain't here 
Don't you fear, don't you fear 

When you hear the music trouble disappear 
When you hear the music ringin' in your ears 
Can you feel the magic floatin' in the air? 
Can you hear the magic? Oh, yeah, yeah 

When you hear the music ringin' in my ear 
Can you hear the music? Oh, yeah 
Can you hear the drummer? Gets you in the groove 
Can you hear the guitar? Make you wanna move? Yeah 

Can you hear the music? Oh, yeah 
Can you hear the music ringin' in my ear? 
Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
