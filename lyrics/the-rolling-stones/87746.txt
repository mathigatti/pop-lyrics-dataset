Now there's two, there's two trains running
And it never runs my way
Now then one is running at midnight
The other one is running in just four days
Running in just four days,
Running in just four days 


Somebody help me with my blues
Now that she's the one, I've been loving
I do hate to lose, I do hate to lose
I do hate to lose 

I've been crazy, Yes, I've been a fool
I've been crazy all my life
Well I fell in love with another man's wife
With another man's wife
With another man's wife
With another man's wife 

Oh, she's long, she's so long and tall
And she weep like a willow tree
And it's said that she's no good
It's all right
She's alright
She's all right with me
She's all right with me
She's alright, she's alright
She's alright, she's alright
She's alright, she's alright
She's alright with me
She's alright with me
