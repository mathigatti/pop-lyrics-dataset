Anyway you look at it
From any point of view
You must admit I'm lucky
To be in love with you 


And people say I'm cynical
They never want the truth
But life will have more twists and turns
Then found in any book
Mmm, mmm, mmm 

And I may travel far away
Across the seas of doom
To undiscovered countries
But I'll come back to you 

Anyway you look at it
Any point of view
Ooh babe, babe
Anyway 

Anyway you look at it
When the camera shoots
Seen from any angle
I'm still in love with you
Mmm, mmm, mmm 

Anyway you look at it
Anyway you will
Like a beacon shining out
I'll be there for you
Mmm, mmm, mmm
