I got a bird what whistles
Baby got a bird
Honey got a bird - it would sing
Baby got a bird
Honey got a bird - it would sing
Without my Corinna, sure don't mean
Sure don't mean a natural thing 


I learned to love you baby
Honey for I call
Baby for I call your name
Baby for I call
Honey for I call your name
I love you Corinna
It sure don't mean
It sure don't mean a natural thing 

Have mercy, have mercy
Baby on my hard luck
Honey on my hard luck soul
Baby on my hard luck
Honey on my hard luck soul 

I got a raimbow round my shoulder
Looks like silver
Shines like klondike gold 

Well I love you honey
Honey tell the world
Baby tell the world I do
Honey tell the world I do
Baby tell the world I do
Ain't no woman in fourteen counties
Love me baby like the way I do 

I got a bird what whistles
Baby got a bird
Honey got a bird - it would sing
Baby got a bird
Honey got a bird - it would sing
Without my Corinna, sure don't mean
Sure don't mean a natural thing
