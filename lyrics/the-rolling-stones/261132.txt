You're awful bright, you're awful smart
I must admit you broke my heart
The awful truth is really sad
I must admit I was awful bad


While lovers laughed and music plays
I stumbled by and I hide my pain
The lamps are lit the moon is gone
I think I've crossed the Rubicon

Ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh
Walked the streets of love
And they're full of tears
Ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh
Walked the streets of love
And they're full of fears

While music pumps from passing cars
A couple watched me from above
A band just played the wedding march
and the cornerstore mends broken hearts
The woman ends if for her debts
It's free of charge just one more chance

Ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh
Walked the streets of love
And they're full of tears
Ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh
Walked the streets of love
For a thousand years

...

You had the moves, you had the cards
I must admit you were awful smart
The awful truth is awful sad
I must admit I was awful bad

Ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh
Walked the streets of love
For a thousand years
Ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh
Walked the streets of love
And they're drenched in tears
Ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh
Walked the streets of love
And they're drenched in tears

Ahh ahh ahh Ahh ahh ahh...
