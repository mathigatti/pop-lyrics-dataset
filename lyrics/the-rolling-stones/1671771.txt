Can you believe it?
I won no medals
In this love game
I've been resting on my laurels
I'm a bad loser
I'm a yard off my pace
I smell rubber
And I soon discover
That you're gone for good
My indiscretions made a bad impression
Guess I was misunderstood


I thought you needed my lovin'
But its my heart that you stole
I thought you wanted my money
But you plundered my soul

I started asking around
But your friend's pretty lips were sealed
I wrote a letter full of trite confessions about wounds that heal
I heard some gossip
You become an alcoholic
You were dryin' out
So I phoned every clinic
In the yellow pages
Not a trace I found

I thought you needed my lovin'
But its my heart that you stole
I thought you wanted my money
But you plundered my soul

I hate quittin'
But I'm close to admittin'
I'm a sorry case
But on quiet reflection
My sad rejections not total disgrace
But I do miss your quick repartee
And the smile that lights up your face
But you'll be a hard act to follow
A bitter pill to swallow
You'll be tough, you'll be tough to replace

I thought you wanted my lovin'
But its my heart that you stole
You're the one trick up my sleeve
My ace in the hole
I thought you wanted my money
But you plundered my soul
