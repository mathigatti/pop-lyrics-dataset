Well now we're respected in society 
We don't worry about the things that we used to be 
We're talking heroin with the president 
Well it's a problem, sir, but it can't be bent 
Uh yes! 


Well now you're a pillar of society 
You don't worry about the things that you used to be 
You're a rag-trade girl, you're the queen of porn 
You're the easiest lay on the White House lawn 
Get out of my life, don't come back 
Get out of my life, don't come back 

She's so respectable 
She's so respectable 
She's so delectable 
She's so respectable 
Get out of my life 
Don't take my wife 
Don't come back 
Get out of my life 
Don't take my wife 
Don't come back 
What I say! 

She's so respectable 
She's so respectable 
She's so respectable 
She's so respectable 
Get out of my life 
Don't take my wife 
Don't come back 
Oh get out of my life 
Don't take my wife 
Don't come back 

She's so respectable 
She's so respectable 
She's so delectable 
She's so respectable 
Get out of my life 
Don't take my wife 
Don't come back...woo! 
Get out of life 
Don't take my wife 
Don't come back 
Get out of my life 
Don't take my wife 
Don't come back, come back, hey
