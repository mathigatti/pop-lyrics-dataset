Will all your money 
Buy you forgiveness 
Keep you from sickness 
Or keep you from cold? 


Will all your money 
Keep you from madness 
Keep you from sadness 
When you're down in the hole? 

'Cause you'll be down in the gutter 
You'll be bummin' for cigarettes 
Bummin' for nylons 
In the American Zone 

You'll be down in the hole 
Yeah, down in the hole 
No escape from trouble 
Nowhere to go 

Down in the gutter 
Beggin' for cigarettes 
Beggin' forgiveness 
All that you know 

Down in the hole 
After diggin' the trenches 
Looking for cover and findin' out there ain't nowhere nowhere to go 
Nowhere nowhere nowhere to go 

None of your money 
Will buy you forgiveness 
None of your jewelry 
None of your gold 

Your black market cigarettes 
Your American nightclubs 
Ah, they've got nowhere left 

Something for nothing 
All of your friends gone 
Something for nothing 
That's all that you know 

There's something down in the hole 
Down down down in the hole 
There's something down down down down in the hole
