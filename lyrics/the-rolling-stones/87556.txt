Yeah man 

Gonna pulp you to a mess of bruises 
'Cos that's what you're looking for 
There's a hole where your nose used to be 
Gonna kick you out of my door 


Gotta get into a fight 
Can't get out of it 
Gotta get into a fight 

Gonna blow you to a million pieces 
Blow you sky high, I don't care 
Splatter matter on the bloody ceiling 
Blow the building right into the air 

Gotta get into a fight 
Can't get out of it 
Gotta get into a fight 
Gonna put the boot right in 
Gotta get into a fight 
Yeah watch me now 

What I want is power, more power 
What I need is an innocent life 
Wanna do it in the broad daylight 
I'm the truck, I'm the suicide 

Gotta get into a fight 
Can't get out of it 
Wanna get into a fight 
Gonna get away with it 
Gotta get into a fight 
Watch me, watch me now 

Yeah gotta get into a fight 
Wanna caught the bullet 
Wanna get into a fight 
Gonna get away with it 

It's all for the greater glory 
It's all for a Saturday night 
There's a hole where your face used to be 
I got you in my telescope sight 

Gotta get into a fight 
Gonna shoot the bullet 
Can't get out of it 
Wanna get into a fight 
Gonna get away with it
