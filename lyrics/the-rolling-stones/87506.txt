Well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight
I got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it
right
Been a-doin' my homework all week long
now the house is empty the folks are gone
Ooo C'mon everybody 


Well my baby's number one but I'm gonna dance with three or
four
And the house'll be shakin' from my bare feet slapping the
floor
When you hear that music you can't sit still
If your brother won't rock then your sister will
Ooo C'mon everybody 

Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside
If the folks come home I'm afraid they gonna have my hide
There'll be no more movies for a week or two
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew
Who cares C'mon everybody
