A little rain fallin'
A little clock keep away the time
A little rain fallin'
The little clock keep away the time
Well now, a little rain keep a-fallin'
On this little love of mine


Little flowers bloomin'
The little birds keep a-singin' tune
The little flowers bloomin'
Little birds keep-a singin' tune

I would like to love ya baby
Underneath the shinin' moon
