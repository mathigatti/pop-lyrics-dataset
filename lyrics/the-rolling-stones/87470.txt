All I want is my baby woah woah, woah woah woah woah 

Every place I go, always reminds me 
All the times we had, are now behind me 


All I want is my baby woah woah, woah woah woah woah 

So you told me, I didn't believe you, 
I thought I had it made, but now you're leavin' 

All I want is my baby woah woah, woah woah woah woah 

People ask me, "Where are you going?" 
I'm always astounded, have no way of knowin' 

All I want is my baby woah woah, woah woah woah woah
