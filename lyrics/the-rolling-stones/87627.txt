We've got trouble, that's for sure 
We got millions unemployed 
Some kids can't write 
Some kids can't read 
Some kids are hungry 
Some overeat 


Our TV leader boldy speaks 
The words of Christ he tries to preach 
We need more power to hold the line 
The strength of darkness still abides 

Must be hell living in the world 
Living in the world like you 
Must be hell living in the world 
Suffering in the world like you 

Keep in a straight line, stay in tune 
No need to worry, only fools 
End up in prison of conscience cells 
Or in asylums they help to build 

Must be hell living in the world 
Suffering in the world like you you you you 
Must be hell living in the world 
Suffering in the world like you 
Must be hell 
Suffering in the world like you 

We're free to worship, we're free to speak 
We're free to kill, that's guaranteed 
We got our problems, that's for sure 
Clean up the backyard, don't lock the door 

Must be hell living in the world 
Suffering in the world like you 
Must be hell living in the world 
Suffering in the world like you 

I say we we are heaven bound 
I say we we are heaven bound 
I say we we are heaven bound 

I say we we are heaven bound 
I say we we are heaven bound.........
