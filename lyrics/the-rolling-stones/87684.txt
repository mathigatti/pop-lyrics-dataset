I got sunshine, on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I got the month of May


I guess, you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl) my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

I go so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song, baby, than the birds in the trees

I guess, you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl) my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey (oooh)

I don't need no money, or count my pay
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can take

I guess, you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl) my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

I got sunshine, on a cloudy day
I even got the month of May
(My girl) my girl
I'm talkin' 'bout my girl
