If I send for my baby
And she don't come
If I send for my baby
Man, and she don't come
All the doctors in hot springs
Sure can't help her none


And if she gets unruly
Thinks she don't wan do
If she gets unruly
Thinks she don't wan do
Take my 32-20 now
And cut her half in two

She got a 38 special,
But I believe its much too light
She got a 38 special,
But I believe its much too light
I got a 32-20,
Got to make the camps alright

If I send for my baby
And she don't come
If I send for my baby
Man, and she don't come
All the doctors in hot springs
Sure can't help her none

I'm gonna shoot my pistol,
Gonna shoot my Gatlin gun
I'm gonna shoot my pistol,
Gotta shoot my Gatlin gun
You made me love you
Now your man has come

Ah-ah, baby where you stay last night
Ah-ah, baby where you stayed last night
You got your hair all tangled
And you ain't talkin right
Got a 38 special boys,
It do very well
