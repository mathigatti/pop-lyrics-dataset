Do I miss her kiss at night time
Arms around me till the light time
Yes, I do, yes, I do, yes, I do, yes, I do
Each and ev'ry day of the year


I still see her on the corner
Do I park and still wait for her
Yes, I do, yes, I do, yes, I do, yes, I do
Each and ev'ry day of the year

Never get around any more
Don't know what my friends are for
No fun sitting all alone
When I cry, cry, cry on my own

Each and ev'ry day of the year
Now that she has gone for ever
Do I wonder what my life's for
Yes, I do, yes, I do, yes, I do, yes, I do
Each and ev'ry day of the year
