Yeah, mama and papa told me 
I was crazy to stay 
I was gay in New York 
A fag in L.A. 
So I saved my money 
And I took a plane 
Wherever I go they treat me the same 


When the whip comes down 
When the whip comes down 
When the whip comes down 
When the whip comes down 

I'm going down fifty-third street 
And they're spitting in my face 
I'm learning the ropes 
Yeah I'm learning a trade 
The east river truckers 
Are churning with trash 
I make so much money 
That I'm spending so fast 

When the whip comes down 
When the whip comes down 
When the whip comes down 
When the whip comes down 
When the shit hits the fan 
I'll be sitting on the can 
When the whip comes down 

Yeah, some called me garbage 
When I was sleeping on the street 
I never roll 
And I never cheat 
I'm filling a need 
I'm plugging a hole 
My mama's so glad 
I ain't on the dole 

When the whip comes down 
When the whip comes down 
When the whip comes down 
When the whip comes down 
(Yeah, go ahead check it out) 

Yeah, baby, when the whip comes down 
When the whip comes down 
(I'll be running this town, I'll tell you) 
When the shit hits the fan 
I'll be sittin on the can
