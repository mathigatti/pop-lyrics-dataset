Well you're crazy Mama 
With your ball and chain 
And your sawn off shotgun 
Blown out brains, yeah 


You can scandalize me 
Scorn my name 
You can steal my money 
And that don't mean a doggone thing 

Cause if you really think you can push it 
I'm going to bust your knees with a bullet 
Your crazy mama, ah yeah 

Well your old time religion 
Is just a superstition 
You going to pay high prices 
For your sacrificises 

Well your blood and thunder 
Sure can't faze me none 
If your going to keep on coming 
I'm gonna take it all head on 

If you don't believe I'm going to do it 
Just wait till you get hit by that bullet 

Don't think I ain't thought about it 
But it sure makes my shackles rise 
And cold blood murder 
Make me want to draw the line 

Well your crazy mama 
With your ball and chain 
Plain psychotic 
Plain insane 

If you don't think I'm gonna do it 
Just wait for the thud of the bullet
