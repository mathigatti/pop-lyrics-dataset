Well, we all need someone we can lean on 
And if you want it, you can lean on me 
Yeah, we all need someone we can lean on 
And if you want it, you can lean on me 


She said, "My breasts, they will always be open 
Baby, you can rest your weary head right on me 
And there will always be a space in my parking lot 
When you need a little coke and sympathy" 

Yeah, we all need someone we can dream on 
And if you want it, baby, well you can dream on me 
Yeah, we all need someone we can cream on 
And if you want to, well you can cream on me 

I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement 
When you drunk my health in scented jasmine tea 
But you knifed me in my dirty filthy basement 
With that jaded, faded, junky nurse 
Oh what pleasant company 

We all need someone we can feed on 
And if you want it, well you can feed on me 
Take my arm, take my leg, oh baby don't you take my head 

Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on 
Yeah, and if you want it, baby, well you can bleed on me 
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on 
Yeah, yeah, and if you want it, baby, why don'cha bleed on me 
All over 

Yeah..

Ahh, get it on rider, get it on rider, get it on rider 
You can bleed all over me, yeah!
Get it on rider, get it on rider, yeah!
You can cream all over, you can cum all over me, oh!
Get it on rider, get it on rider, get it on rider  
You can cum all over me 

Yeah!

Get it on rider, baby cum all over me

Yeah,  yeah
Get it on rider....
