Day after day, I'm more confused
Yet I look for the light
Through the pourin' rain
You know, that's a game that I hate to lose
And I'm feeling the strain
Ain't it a shame


Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away

Beginning to think that I'm wasting time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
Now I'm counting on you
To carry me through

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feeling blue
The guitar's coming through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy that you're given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Your rythm and rhyme and harmony
You've helped me along
Makin' me strong

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away
Na, na, now won't ya
Won't ya take, oh, ha, take me
