Hey girls, you better listen to me
I'm getting starved for your company
All day Monday, and all day Tuesday
I played football, there's nothing on the telly


Ever since I was just 13 years old
Well, I always felt shy but I acted so bold
I never had the money and I never had the class
But I always seemed to get myself a Saturday night piece of ass

Where the boys go, Saturday night
Where the boys all go, hold me tight
Where the boys go, Saturday night
Where the boys all go

Saturday morning and you can see me at the pub
And I'm pissing away me money and I can't stand up
Cab fare, pop, you look silly in the road
Get in everybody, where the boys all go

Hey! Never keep a secret from me
Never keep a secret from me
Never keep a secret from you

Where the boys go, Saturday night
Where the boys all go, hold me tight
Where the boys go, stand around and grope
Where the boys all go, showing off their clothes

Where the boys go, down the disco
Where the boys all go, where the boys all go

Hey girls, what you doin' tonight?
Now do you want to dance, or do you want to bite?
Look here, darlin', I know the score
Paint your face, dye your hair, I'll see you round the back

Hey! Never keep a secret from you
Never keep a secret from me
Never keep a secret from you

Where the boys go, Saturday night
Where the boys all go, hold me tight
Where the boys go, Saturday night
Where the boys all go

Where the boys go, Saturday night
Where the boys all go, hold me tight
Where the boys go, for a giggle and a laugh
Where the boys go, and a little piece of ass
Where the boys all go, for a little piece of this
Where the boys all go, for a little piece of that
Where the boys all go, for a little piece of stick
Where the boys all go, for a little piece of cunt
Where the boys all go, where the girls are now
Where the girls are now, where the boys all go
Where the girls are now, where the boys all go
Where the girls are now, where the boys all go
Where the girls are now, where the boys all go
Where the boys all go, where the boys all go
Where the girls are now, where the boys all go
Where the boys all go, where the boys all go
Where the girls are now, where the boys all go
