I musta been foolish, I musta been blind
I musta been crazy, And out of my mind
For so long 


Minutes turn to hours, And hours turn into days
The storm started howlin', I'm out of my brain
I'm out of my brain
For so long 

The fall turned into winter, The winter turned into rain
The storm started howlin', I'm out of my brain
I'm out of my brain, I'm out of my mind
For so long
So long
So long
So long
So long
Out of my mind for so long 

Felt a mighty rumble, Comin' from the ground
The house it started shakin', And tumblin' down
Tumblin' down
For so long
For so long 

Musta been crazy, I musta been blind
Musta been foolish, And out of my mind
Out of my mind
For so long
So long
So long
So long
So long
Mmmh mmmh
Uh uhh
So many days
Uh uhh
So many damn days
