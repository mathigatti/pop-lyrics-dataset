Been keeping cool 
Been lying low 
Been dancing smooth 
And dancing slow 
Keeping myself to myself 
My nose is clean 
But I'm a man 
Not a machine 


All get together and feel alright 
All get together and rock all night 
All get together and feel alright 
Okay 

Get ready 
For sure 
Okay 
Let's go 
Suck on the jugular 

Love to change my shape 
And change my name 
Want to get out of myself for a while 
Don't feel no shame 
I love men to be men 
And women women 
On special occasions 
Diving and dipping 

All get together and feel alright 
All get together and fuck all night 
Alright 

Give me 
For sure 
Okay 
Let's go 
Suck on the jugular 

Okay 
Let's go 
Alright 
Oh, no 
Aha 
Alright 

Let's live lasciviously 
Down in the muck 
And when tonight's over 
You going to watch me blow 
And self-destruct 

All get together and feel alright 
All get together and feel all night 
All get together and feel alright 
Get together 
All get together and rock 
All get together and rock 
All get together and rock all night
