Guess it's just another dream 
That's slipping away 
Each time I fall asleep 
It seems I'm just drifting away 
Just as yo have touched my heart 
Babe I wake and we're apart 
Yeah and it's slipping away 


Here comes just another day 
That's drifting away 
Every time I draw a breath 
It's dying away 
First the sun and then the moon 
One of them will be around soon 
Slipping away 
Slipping away 

Drifting away 
Slipping away 

Just as you have touched my heart 
I wake up babe and we're apart 
It seems we're slipping away 
Slipping away 
Slipping away 

All I want is ecstasy 
But I ain't getting much 
Just getting off on misery 
It seems I've lost my touch 

Well it's just another song 
But it's slipping away 
We we didn't sing it long 
'Cos it's fading away 
First the sun and then the moon 
One of them will be round soon 
Slipping away 
Slipping away 
Slipping away
