Neighbors, neighbors, neighbors 
Have I got neighbors? 
Have I got neighbors? 
All day and all night 


Neighbors 
Have I got neighbors? 
Ringing my doorbells 
All day and all night 

Ladies, have I got crazies? 
Screaming young babies 
No piece and no quiet 
I got T.V.'s, saxophone playing 
Groaning and straining 
With the trouble and strife 

Is it any wonder 
Is it any wonder 
Is it any wonder 
That we fuss and fight 

Neighbors, do unto strangers 
Do unto neighbors 
What you do to yourself, yourself, yourself 

Is it any wonder 
Is it any wonder 
Is it any wonder 
That we fuss and fight 

Neighbors do unto strangers 
Do onto neighbors what you do to yourself 
Yourself, yourself, yourself 
Neighbors, neighbors, neighbors 

Neighbors, neighbors, neighbors 
Do yourself a favour 
Don't you mess with my baby 
When I'm working all night 
You know that neighbors 
Steal off my table 
Steal off my table 
And doing alright, alright, alright 

Neighbors do unto strangers 
Do unto strangers 
What you do to yourself
