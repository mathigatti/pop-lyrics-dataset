I can hear the wind a blowin' in my mind
Just the way it used to sound, through the Georgia pines
You were there to answer when I called, yeah
You and me we had it all 


Remember how I used to touch your hands
While reachin' for the feeling that was always there
You're the best thing in my life I can recall, oh
You and me we had it all 

I know that we can never lives these times again
So I'll let these dreams take me back to where we've been
Then I stay there with you just as long as I can
Oh, it was so good, yeah, it was so good
Oh, it was so good, when I was your man 

And I never stop believin' your smile
Even though it didn't stay, it was all worthwhile
Yes, you're the best thing in my life I can recall, oh
You and me we had it all
You and me we had it all
