I'm waitin' for you, I'm makin' town
I'm walkin' for you, over ground
I won't see you walkin' away
I can't stand you actin' this way ... I want 


I wanna see you, all the way at all
I play hidin' the whole way all the place at all
Ahhh... 

Mmmm me I'm, soakin' there, ahhh now over around
I won't see you walkin' away, I won't see you every night
And, I'm not the same, oh
Going away you
Runnin', runnin' away you
All the way, at all
I think, runnin' to hear you
I'm glad, I don't hear you
All the way at all 

I'm thinkin'
I soakin' down
I'm lookin' for you
Up town
I'm livin' with you, and zip your gone
Everybody hittin' bottom
Yeah, I won't see you walkin' my way
I won't catch you to me every day
I won't see you you walkin' away, at all
eeehhh
I won't cry
I won't lie
I know everybody's going there to cry
I won't cry
