Someone woke me up this mornin' and I lit a cigarette
Found myself when I stopped yawnin', started
getting myself dressed
Then I felt I had a dream, I remembered the
things I'd seen
I could still hear the things you said with that bad
dream in my head
It was a sad day, bad day, sad day, bad day


So I called you on the phone and your friend said
"she's not home"
So I told her where I'd be at and that you should
call me back
Then I looked at the morning mail, I was not even
expecting a bill
Your letter a-started "Dear", and it left me
with these tears.
It was a sad day, bad day, sad day, bad day 

Think of the times that we had rows, but we
patched them up somehow
Think of the times I tried to go, but you screamed
and told me no
There is only one thing in this world that I can't
understand, that's a girl
I keep a-readin' the things you said, like a bad
dream in my head
It was a sad day, bad day, sad day, bad day 

Oh, what a sad, sad, old day - a sad, old day
It was a sad, old day
A sad, old day. It was a bad, old day,
sad old day a bad old day
If there is one awful thing in this world that I can't
understand, that's a girl
It was a sad, sad old day, sad old day
It was a sad, old day
