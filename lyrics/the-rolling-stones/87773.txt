Well I'm waiting at the bus stop in downtown L.A. 
Well I'm waiting at the bus stop in downtown L.A. 
But I'd much rather be on a boardwalk on Broadway 


Well I'm sitting here thinkin' just how sharp I am 
Well I'm sitting here thinkin' just how sharp I am 
I'm an under assistant west coast promo man 

Well I promo groups when they come into town 
Well I promo groups when they come into town 
Well they laugh at my toupee, they're sure to put me down 

Well I'm sitting here thinking just how sharp I am 
Yeah I'm sitting here thinking just how sharp I am 
I'm a necessary talent behind every rock and roll band 

Yeah, I'm sharp 
I'm really, really sharp 
I sure do earn my pay 
Sitting on the beach every day, yeah 
I'm real real sharp, yes I am 
I got a Corvette and a seersucker suit 
Yes I have 

Here comes the bus, uh oh 
I thought I had a dime 
Where's my dime 
I know I have a dime somewhere 
I'm pretty sure........ 

[Extra lyrics which were removed]

....I have two clerks
I break my ass every day
Here comes the bus
I know I have a dime somewhere
I'm so sharp
You won't believe how sharp I am
Don't laugh at me
