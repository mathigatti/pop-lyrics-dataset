No use in cryin' now, you'll get by somehow
You thought that you had me, just where I ought to be


You thought I was so much in love with you, yeah

Think you'd better find someone who's more your mind
Someone who be your clown
Someone who'll push you around

You thought I was so much in love with you, yeah

Do what you want to do, but now you know I've changed my mind
Did you believe I was a fool, that I never saw thru the wool you pull'd  over my eyes
You can't send me away
Then we've never been the same, since you play'd your game
You 'll ask me back to stay

You thought I was so much in love with you, yeah
