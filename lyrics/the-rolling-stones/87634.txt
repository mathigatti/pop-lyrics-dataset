The spark (stars) in your eyes sets
my soul on fire
Your voice is like an angels above
The touch of your hand drives me insane
But baby, I want to be loved 


I'm crazy 'bout ev'ry little thing you do
I cherish the way you hug (me)
Your kiss is so sweet, honey, it can't be beat
But baby, I want to be loved 

Ev'ry time I ask you for a date
You don't come at all, or you're mighty late
I ask you to dance, (take) a little spin
You say "Wait a minute, daddy,
here comes my friend" 

I love the way you walk when you pass me by
Even when you try to snub (me)
You kill (kiss) me, baby when
you give me the eye
But baby, I want to be loved
