And I think I'm going mad 

Life goes by so fast 
Time whirls by so fast 
You think I whine so 
All the women come and go 


Think I'm going mad 
Think I'm going crazy 

All the highs and lows don't mean a thing to me 
Don't give a damn 

This season that'll pass 
Think will be my last 
I know my mind's afloat 
Sometimes I feel so young and sometimes I feel so old 

Yeah you want to see, you want to see all the things  
And I'm thinking, they say that your crazy 
They say that your insane 
I think.... and I think I'm going crazy 
And I think I'm going mad 

You ought to see my shaking hands 
I think I've been drinking lots of cups of coffee 
I think I've lost my head 
I think I should be sacrificed 
I think I should be put to rest 
Save yourself
And I think I'm going mad 
Think I'm going now 
Think I'm going crazy
