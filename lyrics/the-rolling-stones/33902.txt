I see a red door and
I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black


I see the girls walk by dressed
In their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back

I see people turn their heads
And quickly look away
Like a new born baby
It just happens every day

I look inside myself
And see my heart is black
I see my red door
And must have it painted black

Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up
When your whole world is black

No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you

If I look hard enough
Into the settin' Sun
My love will laugh with me
Before the mornin' comes

I see a red door and
I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed
In their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes

I want see your face
Painted black
Black as night
Black as coal

Don't wanna see the Sun
Flying high in the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted
Painted black
Yeah!
