Yeah well your woman get crazy
And she tries to preach you out 
Yeah your woman get crazy, ain't she


I will haunt you baby 
Hope you know the reason why 
I Love you baby and I don't know the reason why 
Coming back to where I won 
Won't you give me one more try 
All right 

Yeah I'm in love with my baby 
I don't know the reason why 

Yeah darling, I'm in love with you baby 
And I don't know the reason why 

The way you mistreat me baby 
I won't be that surprised 

Went out on a hilltop 
And I dive my head down and cried 

Yes I was tripped out on a hillside 
I broke down my head and I cried 
You don't love me now baby I 
Just don't know my own lies


I'm tripped out on a hillside, baby 
and I blown out my head until I cried 

Yes I was tripped out on a hillside 
Tilt my head and I cried 
You won't need me now baby I swear 

Yeah I will take you out on the hand boat 
Tell you about a rope deep down inside 
Well I will take you out on the river walking by the railroad side 
You can go back to a poor man, you can't be satisfied.
