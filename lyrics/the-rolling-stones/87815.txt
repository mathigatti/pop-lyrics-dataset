And it sure been a cold, cold winter 
And the wind ain't been blowin' from the south 
It's sure been a cold, cold winter 
And a lotta love is all burned out 


It sure been a hard, hard winter 
My feet been draggin' 'cross the ground 
And I hope it's gonna be a long, hot summer 
And a lotta love will be burnin' bright 

And I wish I been out in California 
When the lights on all the Christmas trees went out 
But I been burnin' my bell, book and candle 
And the restoration plays have all gone 'round 

It sure been a cold, cold winter, lord
My feet been draggin' cross the ground 
And the fields has all been brown and fallow 
And the springtime take a long way around 

Yeah, and I wish I been out in Stone Canyon 
When the lights on all the Christmas trees went out 
But I been burnin' my bell, book and candle 
And the restoration plays have all gone round 
All right, well, well, well

Sometimes I think about ya baby, oh well
Oh, sometimes I cry about ya, lord 
Well, well, well, well, well

Yeah and I'll wrap my coat around you, woman
Yeah and I'll wrap my coat around you, woman
Oh lord I'm talkin'

Yes, I'll wrap my coat around 
Well, well, well,
Baby sometimes I wanna, keep you woman
Baby sometimes I wanna wrap my coat around ya
Sometimes I wanna burn a candle for ya
Sometimes I wanna wrap my coat around ya lord
Sometimes I wanna burn a candle for ya
Yes I wanna keep ya, wa wa wa
Sometimes I wanna wrap my coat around ya lord I'm crying
Sometimes it feels like...
