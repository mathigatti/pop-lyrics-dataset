What a shame 
Nothing seems to be going right 
What a shame 
Nothing seems to be going right 
It seems easy to me that everything can be alright 


What a shame 
They always wanna start a fight 
What a shame 
They always wanna start a fight 
Well it scares me so 
I could sleep in the shelter all night 
Well alright 

What a shame 
You all heard what I said 
What a shame 
Y'all heard what I said 
You might wake up in the morning 
And find your poor self dead
