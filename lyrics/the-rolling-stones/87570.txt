Spendin' too much time away 
I can't stand another day 
Maybe you think I've seen the world 
But I'd rather see my girl 


I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome-bome-bome, 
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home 
Yes, I am 

All those letters ev'ry day 
Maybe alright in their way 
But I'd love to see your face 
When I get home in their place 

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome-bome-bome, 
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home 
Yes, I am 
Alright 

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome-bome-bome, 
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home 
Yes, I will 

When you're three thousand miles away 
I just never sleep the same 
If I packed my things right now 
I could be home in seven hours 

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home 
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome-bome-bome, 
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home 

Yes, I will 
Yes, I will 
See my baby, see my baby 
I wanna see my girl 
I just can't wait, I just can't wait 
I just can't wait, I just can't wait 

I just can't wait, I just can't wait 
I just can't wait, I just can't wait 

I just can't wait 
I'll see my baby 
She'll make me feel alright 

Gotta see my baby 
She'll make me feel so good 
She'll make me feel allright 
Yes she does 
In the middle of the night 
So good ti ti tight 

Feel allright, come on baby 
I'm gonna get home babe 
I feel allright 
I'm lookin' for my baby 
I'm gonna go in the early morning 
I'm gonna catch that plane 
Now it won't be long, I say 
Listen to me 

Long time since I've seen my baby 
Yes it is 
It's such a long long time 
Yes it is, I feel allright 
I'm gonna see my baby, one more time 
I get home, I gotta get home 
I wanna see my darling 

I wanna make sweet sweet love 
In the middle of the night 
Early in the morning 
In the midnight hour 
She'll make me feel so good 
She'll make me feel allright 

When she touch my hands 
And that's all I gotta say 
Cause I'm gonna pack my bags 
I wanna see you baby 
See your face 
Your pretty little smile 
Your pretty clothes 
Hear you talk 
Come on 

I'm comin' home 
I'll see my baby 
I'm goin' home 
I'm gettin' out 
To see your face 
Makin' love to you baby 
Yes it makes me feel so good 
Inside 
I feel so good inside 

Touch me one more time 
Come on little girl 
You may look sweet 
But I know you ain't 
I know you ain't
