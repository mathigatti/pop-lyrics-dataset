Goodbye Girl 
It's time to part
When you leave me, you take my heart
Better get a start
And get back, get back to the one you love 


No one told me, I just knew
But nothing I can do
To make her stay true
Well it's time that you do
Get back, get back to the one you love 

Well I've know her daddy since the first time we met
Seems like there's talk that I would regret

Goodbye girl, this might sound strange
But I told you when I met you, that you'd change
Better get that train and make it home
Get back, get back to the one you love
