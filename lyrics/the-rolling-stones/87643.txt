That's all right, that's all right, that's all right. 
Sometimes you feel like trouble, sometimes you feel down. 
Let this music relax you mind, let this music relax you mind. 
Stand up and be counted, can I get a witness. 
Sometimes you need somebody, if you have somebody to love. 
Sometimes you ain't got nobody and you want somebody to love. 
Then you don't want to walk and talk about Jesus, 
You just want to see his face. 
You don't want to walk and talk about Jesus, 
You just want to see his face.
