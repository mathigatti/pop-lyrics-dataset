I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield 
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station 
And the preacher said, "You know you always have the 
Lord by your side" 


And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran 
Twenty red lights in his honor 
Thank you Jesus, thank you lord 

I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late 
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off 
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find 
Much to my surprise, there she was sittin in the corner 
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear 
Was a girl with far away eyes 

So if you're down on your luck 
And you can't harmonize 
Find a girl with far away 
And if you're downright disgusted 
And life ain't worth a dime 
Get a girl with far away eyes 

Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do was send 
Ten dollars to the church of the sacred bleeding heart of Jesus 
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California 
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio 
And all my dreams would come true 
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl 
Well, you know what kind of eyes she got 

So if you're down on your luck 
I know you all sympathize 
Find a girl with far away eyes 
And if you're downright disgusted 
And life ain't worth a dime 
Get a girl with far away eyes
