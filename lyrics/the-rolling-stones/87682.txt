Moon is up 
The sun is down 
You can't have it both ways round 
Ooh babe, won't you listen to me 
We are worlds apart, you see 
Where are you now 
Crying out loud 
Where did you go 
When I needed you 


The sun sinks behind the clouds 
And hides his tears without a sound 
The moon looks on reflectively 
So spare a thought for you and me 
Where are you now 
Dark are the clouds 
Where did you go 
When I needed you 

The moon is up 
The sky is black 
I'll sail away and won't come back 
The sun goes down 
The stars will rise 
And dance across 
The darkened skies 

The sun goes down 
The moon comes up 

The moon is up 
The sun goes down 
And you can't have it both ways round 
So come on baby and listen to me 
'Cause we are worlds apart, you see 

The sun goes down 
The moon comes up
