Well it's been a long time since I've seen you,
You're looking good
Can't begin to tell how much I've missed you
I wish I could
But I like what you're wearing for me
And I could do things for a little bit of your sympathy


Don't expect for it to last forever
It never does
But it sure beats talking 'bout the weather
It surely does
And I like what you're singing to me
But it's better with a little bit of harmony

We should try to get our love together
Once in a while, put ourselves together
It's looking good, let's get our shit together
Sure won't hurt you now (sure won't hurt you now )
Sure won't hurt you now to try

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Well it's been a long time since I've seen you,
You're looking good
Can't begin to tell how much I've missed you
I wish I could
But I like what you're wearing for me
And I could/can do things for a little bit of your sympathy

We should try to get our love together
Once in a while, put ourselves together
It's looking good, let's get our shit together
Sure won't hurt you now (sure won't hurt you now )
Sure won't hurt you now to try

Why don't we try to get our love together
Once in a while, let's get our act together
Why don't we try to get our love together
Once in a while, get our shit together
(once in a while, once in a while, together, together)

Why don't you try (why don't we try, why don't we try) together
Once in a while (once in a while, once in a while) together, together
Why don't we try (why don't we try, why don't we try)
Together together
Once in a while let's get our shit together
Why don't we try
