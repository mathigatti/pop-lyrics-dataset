Fanny Mae,
Baby won't you please come home,
Fanny Mae
Baby won't you please come home.
I'm in so much misery, baby
Since that girls been gone. 


Well I can hear her singing
Way all down the line
Well I can hear her singing
Way all down the line
(I wanna know do you love me
Or am I wasting my time)
When I hear you singing
I know you're not far behind 

Well I want somebody to tell me
Tell me what's wrong with me
Well I want somebody to tell me
Tell me what's wrong with me
Since Fanny been gone
My life has been misery 

Fanny Mae,
Baby won't you please come home,
Fanny Mae,
Baby won't you please come home
I'm in so much misery,
Since that girls been gone.
