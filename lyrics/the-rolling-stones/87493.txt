In the winter when the cold comes 
And the wind blows with a scornful spite 
And the hard ground feels barren 
And the forest is deathly quiet 
And the whole world lies sleeping 
There's a gypsy all dressed in white 
Put my hand out, ask the question 
Here's the silver, do you have the gift of sight 


Can you break the spell 
Can you ring the bell 
Can you break the spell 
It's cold black as night 
I've got a hard heart 
Since we've been apart 
Can you break the spell 
Break it all down tonight 

In the springtime when the floods come 
And the earth bursts with the terrible life 
And the sun splash on the windows 
There's a gypsy and he's all dressed in white 
My heart burns with the question 
Can you break the spell 
Still hot as fire 

Can you break the spell 
Can you ring the bell 
Can you break the spell 
It's cold black as night 
Cold black as night
