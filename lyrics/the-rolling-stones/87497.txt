I can turn your gray sky blue
I could make it rain whenever I wanted to
I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
I can make a ship sail on dry land
But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you
Next to you, I just can't get next to you 


I can fly like a bird in the sky
Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy
I can turn a river into a raging fire
I could live forever if I so desired
Unimportant are all these things I can do
'Cause I can't get next to you
No matter what I do 

I can turn back the hands of time
You'd better believe I can
I can make the seasons change
Just by a wave of my hand
I can change anything from old to new
The thing I want to do the most I'm unable to do
Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
'Cause girl, you're the key to my happiness
And I, wo, I can't get next to you 

Girl, you're blowin' my mind 'cause I can't get (next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm cryin'? I can't get (next to you)
Girl, it's you that I need; I gotta get (next to you)
