Love comes at the speed of light 
Love comes at the speed of light 
Love comes in a strange disguise 
Love comes 


Open the door and let the light pour over 
Open the door don't you keep me out 
Open the door and let the light pour over 
Hear me shout 
Open the door and let the light pour over 
Open the door don't you keep me out 
Open the door and let the light pour over 

Love comes at the speed of light 
Love comes 

It's a pure as silver 
It's as pure as gold 
It's a rushing river 
Let it run all over me 
It's as pure as silver 
It's as pure as gold 
Let it run all over me 

Love comes 
Love comes at the speed of light 
Love comes at the speed of light
