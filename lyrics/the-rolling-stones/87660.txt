Living in the heart of love
Living in the heart of love
Living in the heart of love
Living in the heart of love


Take me there, I've been freed
Today I get a crazy seize
Then I saw her, yes outside
Tomorrow I'l be there, ain't that nice

Living in the heart of love
Living in the heart of love
Living is the finer love
Loving is the finer feel

I'm trying so hard to be your lover
I'm trying so hard to be your baby
I'm trying so hard

Living, yeah, living, living
Living in the heart of love
Living is the finer love

Keep your time
And take your talk
?????
Driving me crazy, that's ok
Full control, you're my savor

I'm not crazy, don't miss girl
I ain't waiting for the sky for fall
I'm pretty dirty, I'm real mean
I'll go down, I'll be mean, oh yeah

I'm working so hard to be your baby
I'm working so hard, to be your love
I'm working so hard to be your baby
I'm working so hard
I'm working so hard

Living in the heart of love
Living in the heart of love
Living in the heart of love
Loving you is hard enough

Living
Living, yeah
Living
Living, yeah
(repeat over to fad out)
