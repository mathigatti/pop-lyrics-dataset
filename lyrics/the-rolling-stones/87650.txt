You're gonna get it straight from the shoulder 
Can't you see the party's over 
Let me go 


Can't you get it through your thick head 
This affair is finished - dead 
Hey, let me go 

I tried giving you the velvet gloves 
I tried giving you the knockout punch 
Hey, let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go 

I find it hard to be cruel 
I find it hard to be cruel 
With a smile, don't you? 
You'll never find that perfect love 
That you read about 
That you dream about 

Maybe I'll become a playboy 
Hang around in gay bars 
And move to the west side of town 

You're gonna get it straight from the shoulder 
Can't you see the party's over 
Hey, let me go 
Let me go 

So you think I'm giving you the brush off 
Well I'm just telling you to shove off 
Hey, let me go 

This ain't no time to waste my breath 
We're going into sudden death 
Hey, let me go 

Can't you get it through your thick head 
This affair is dead as a doornail 
Hey, baby won't you let me go 

The bell has rung, and I've called time 
The chair is on the table, out the door baby 

Baby won't you let me go 
Let me go...
