The keys to your love
I've got the keys to your love


No matter where I go baby, no matter what I do
I spend my whole life honey, just thinking of you
Yeah it don't seem to matter, who's right and who's wrong
I want to tell you how I feel now, in the words of this song
Want to baby put a spell on you
There ain't nothing that you're going to do
I've got the keys to your love
I've got the secret of your heart
No matter where you I go baby honey
We're not too far apart

Now try to lock me out, I can always get in
I've got every permutation, every code and every pin
I'm so crazy about you, yeah that's the word on the street
Yeah I bet you heard all about it from the people you meet

You know baby, I put a spell on you
Can't take it off now, there ain't nothing you can do
I've got the keys to your love
I play the keys of your heart
It sounds so sweet baby
Won't stop once I start
I've got the keys to your love
I've got the secret of your heart
No matter where I go baby
We're not too far apart

Your all that I got
Without you, baby, my life's kind of shot
I look for your face
Cause no one else could fill this space

Watch out baby, I put a spell on you
You can't resist it, I just hoodoo you

I've got the key to your love
I've got the secret of your heart
No matter where I go baby
No matter where I go sugar

Na, na, na, na
I got the keys to you love babe (keys to your love)
(keys to your love)
(keys to your love)
