I look out my window watch her as she passes by 
I say to myself I'm such a lucky guy 
To have a girl like her is a dream come true 
And of all the girls in New York she loves me true 


It was just my imagination, once again 
Running away with me 
It was just my imagination 
Running away with me 

Soon we'll be married and raise a family 
Two boys for you, what about two girls for me 
I tell you I am just a fellow with a one track mind 
Whatever it is I want baby I seek and I shall find 

I'll tell ya 
It was just my imagination, once again 
Running away with me 
It was just my imagination 
Running away with me 

Every night I hope and pray 
"Dear lord, hear my plea 
Don't ever let another take her love from me 
Or I will surely die" 

Her love is ecstasy 
When her arms enfold me 
I hear her tender rhapsody 
But in reality, she doesn't even know... me
