All your love, baby can it be mine
All your love, baby can it be mine
I hate to be the one
The one love you left behind


All your love, baby don't put around
All your love, baby don't put around
Love is one thing baby
You won't find on the ground

All your love, I've got to have one day
All your love, I've got to have one day
Don't you leave me baby
Please come back this way
