Don't you worry 'bout what's on your mind, woman
I'm in no hurry, I can take my time, woman
I'm going red and my tounge's getting tied (tounge's getting tied)
I'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm high, but I try, try, try, woman


Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

I feel so strong that I can't disguise, woman (let's spend the night together)
But I just can't apologize oh no (let's spend the night together)
Don't hang me up and don't let me down (don't let me down)
We could have fun just groovin' around, round, round

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together (2x)
Now I need you more than ever

You know I'm smiling, baby
You need some guiding, baby
I'm just deciding, baby, now
I need you more than ever

Let's spend the night together
Let's spend the night together, now

This doesn't happen to me ev'ry day, woman (let's spend the night together)
No excuses offered anyway, woman (let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need (your every need)
And now I know you'll satisfy me, oh my, my, my, my, my, my, my

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now (together now)

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you, need you more than ever, woman (let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need, woman (let's spend the night together)
Now I know, know, I'll satisfy me, woman (let's spend the night together)

I'll take you baby (let's spend the night together)
Oh come on now (let's spend the night together)
