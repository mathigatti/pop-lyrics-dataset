There've been so many
Girls that I've known
I've made so many cry and still I wonder why
Here comes the little girl
I see her walking down the street
She's all by herself
Trying so hard to please, but
She'll never break, nerver break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, this heart of stone
What's different about her?
I don't really know
No matter how I try
I just can't maker her cry
But she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone
Don't keep on looking that some old way
If you try acting sad
You'll only make me glad
Better listen, little girl
You go on walking down the street
I ain't got no love
I ain't the kind to meet
But you'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no
This heart of stone
You'll never break this heart of stone
