I want to dance, I want to sing 
I want to bust up everything 
To make some love 
I want to dance, I want to sing 
I want to bust up everything 
And make some love 


I can feel it in the air 
Feel it up above 
Feel the tension everywhere 
There is too much blood 
Too much blood, well alright 

Everything you see 
On the movie screen is tame 
Everything's gonna be arranged 

A friend of mine was this Japanese. He had a girlfriend in Paris
He tried to date her in six months and eventually she said yes
You know he took her to his apartment, cut off her head
Put the rest of her body in the refrigerator, ate her piece by piece
Put her in the refrigerator, put her in the freezer
And when he ate her and took her bones to the Bois de Boulogne
By chance a taxi driver noticed him burying the bones
You don't believe me? Truth is stranger than fiction
We drive through there every day

I want to dance, I want to sing 
I want to bust up everything 
Be number one, yeah 
I want to dance, I want to sing 
I want to bust up everything 
And have some fun 

I can feel it everywhere 
Feel it up above 
Feel the tension in the air 
There is too much blood, too much blood 
Too much, yeah too much blood, alright 

Did you ever see Texas Chain Saw Massacre? Horrible, wasn't it? 
You know people ask me: it is really true where you live in Texas
Is really true what they do around there, people? 
I say: Yeah everytime I drive through the crossroads I get scared 
There's a bloke running around with a fucking chainsaw
Oh oh no, gonna, oh no. Don't saw off me leg, don't saw off me arm
When I get to the movies, you know 
I'd like to see something more romantic, you know
Like An Officer and a Gentleman or something
Something you can take the wife to, you know what I mean? 

Yeah! 

I want to dance, I want to sing 
I want to bust up everything 
And have some fun 
I want to dance, I want to sing 
I want to bust up everything 
And make some love 

I can feel it everywhere 
Feel it up above 
Feel the tension in the air 
There is too much blood, too much blood 
Oh yeah 

Pretty ladies, don't be scared 
Pretty ladies, don't be scared 
Pretty ladies, don't be scared 
Pretty ladies, don't be scared 

Pretty ladies, don't despair 
There's still so much love 
Pretty ladies, don't despair 
Too much, too much, yeah 
Too much blood, too much blood 
Too much too much blood, too much blood 
Too much blood, too much blood
