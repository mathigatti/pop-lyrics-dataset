Baby back 
Dressed in black 
Silver buttons all down her back 
High hose, tippy toes 
She broke the needle and she can sew 


Walking the dog 
I'm just a walking the dog 
If you don't know how to do it 
I'll show you how to walk the dog 
C'mon now c'mon 

I asked her mother for fifteen cents 
I see you ever jumped the fence 
I jumped so high, touched the skies 
Didn't get back 'til a quarter to five 

Walking the dog 
I'm just a walking the dog 
If you don't know how to do it 
I'll show you how to walk the dog 
C'mon c'mon now 

Tell me Mary, what's your twelve 
How does your garden grow 
What with silver bells and cockle shells 
And pretty maids all in a row 

Walking the dog 
I'm just a walking the dog 
If you don't know how to do it 
I'll show you how to walk the dog 
C'mon now c'mon 

Baby, back 
Dressed in black 
Silver buttons all down her back 
High hose, tippy toes 
She broke the needle and she can sew 

Walking the dog 
I'm just a walking the dog 
If you don't know how to do it 
I'll show you how to walk the dog 
C'mon now c'mon 

Yeah just a walking 
Uh just a walking 
Uh just a walking 
Now, if you don't know how to do it 
I'll show you how to walk the dog 
C'mon now c'mon 
If you don't know how to do it 
I'll show you how to walk the dog 
C'mon now 
If you don't know how to do it 
I'll show you how to walk the dog
