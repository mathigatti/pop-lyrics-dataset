My spirit is winging 
My soul is free 
I'm doing my drinking 
In good company 
The music's screaming 
My feet are flying 
Everybody's laughing 
And nobody's crying 
Sneak suspicion 
It drags me down 
A nagging feeling 
Going round 


Hearts for sale 
Going cheap 
Hearts for sale 
Lovers' leap 

My belly's full 
My glass is brimming 
The women look so beautiful 
And I feel like singing 
The voice of conscience 
The voice of reason 
Is yacking in my plans 
I call that treason 

Hearts for sale 
Going cheap 
Hearts for sale 
Blood runs deep 

I'm losing my willpower 
My blood's running cold 
My body's on pause 
My mind's stuck on hold 
There ain't nothing I can do about it 
Sneak suspicion 
It drags me down 
Nagging feeling 
Going round 

Hearts for sale 
Going cheap 
Hearts for sale 
Blood runs deep 
Hearts for sale 

I don't need a doctor 
I need a deputation 
You don't want my loving 
You can just take my resignation 
I'm under the hammer 
I'm a full time worker 
I'm a real body slammer
