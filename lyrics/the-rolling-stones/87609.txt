You don't really understand
How it feels to be your man
You're just nice to have around, now
But I'll let you guess
You can get me
If you let me oh yes 


It's nice to talk to you today
It's very pleasant anyway
Is this as far as you go, girl
But I'll let you guess
You can get me
If you let me oh yes 

You can get me
If you let me oh yes 

Yes, you're younger than I thought
You're so tall and I'm so short
It doesn't matter anyhow
but I'll let you guess
You can get me
If you let me oh yes 

It's a brand new thing for me
Loving you so physically
The time has come to say goodnight
But I'll let you guess
You can get me
If you let me oh yes
Oh yes
