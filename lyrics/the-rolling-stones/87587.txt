'Cause we're going out to night.
Put on your red dress baby,
'Cause we're going out to night.
You better wear some boxing gloves
In case a fool might wanna fight. 


Put on your high-heel sneakers,
wear your wig hat on your head.
Put on your high-heel sneakers,
Wear your wig hat on your head.
I'm pretty sure now baby
'Cause you know, you're gonna knock 'em dead. 

Put on your high-heel sneakers,
Wear your wig hat on your head.
Put on your high-heel sneakers,
Wear your wig hat on your head.
Well I'm pretty sure now darling
'Cause you know you gonna knock 'em dead.
