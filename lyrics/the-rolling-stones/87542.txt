Do you think I could ever care
'Bout a girl, who's never there?
Do you think I could ever care
'Bout a girl who's never there?
I saw her on the subway
Saw her on the D-train
Saw her in the afternoon
After all the Giants' games
Saw her on the freeway
Saw her on a highway
Gimme a break, I need a Yellow Cab
Help me get outta this rain 


Do you think I could ever care
'Bout a girl who's almost never there?
Do you think the clothes she wears
Would change my mind
Or turn my hair?
I saw her on a freeway
Saw her on a A-train
Saw her hangin' out
On 52nd and Broad
Saw her on a highway
Saw her on a skyway
Ahhhh, need a Yellow Cab, Ronnie
Let me get outta the rain 

Yeah......g'head
Good job
Yeah! 

I saw her on a highway
On a D-train
I saw her eatin' a pizza
On 75th and Broadway
Saw her on a subway
On a biplane
Ahh, I'm getting tired o' this shit
I need a Yellow Cab
Help me get outta this rain 

Do you think I could ever care
'Bout a girl who's almost never there?
Do you think ......could ever care
'Bout a girl who cares about the...the clothes she wears?
Do you think I could ever care
'Bout a girl that even dyes her hair? 

The song
Do you think
Whooo
Oh no
Whooo 

Ohhh, do you think I would really care
'Bout a woman......who's never there?
Do you think I'd ever care
'Bout a woman....the clothes she wears? 

'Bout a girl who's hardly ever there?
Whooo! Whooo!
Well, that's alright
Whooo
