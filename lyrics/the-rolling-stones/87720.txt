Oh, I think I had enough of your religion 
It's tough, it's a state of mind 
I don't need it! 


Sending a letter 
To my mother 
I need some loving 
Send it to me 

I lost my lover 
Unfaithful lover 
I need some money 
Send it to me 

I need consoling 
Your boy's feeling lonely 
Describe her for me 

Send it to me 

Send it to me 
Send it to me 
Send it to me 
Send it to me 

If she can't travel 
I can take the mule train 
I can take the aeroplane 
Send it to me 

Yeah, and I'm begging you 
Begging you, down on my knees 
Baby please, please please 
You, you, got to send it, send it, send it 
Send it to me 
Send her to me 

Send her to me 
Send her to me 
Send her to me 

Yeah, I'm sending in a letter 
To my sister 
In Australia 
Sister Marie 

Ain't got no lover 
No sense of cover 
I need some loving 
Send it to me 

Send it to me 
Send it to me 
Send it to me 
Send it to me 

She won't have to watch her step 
Seh won't have to relocate 
I guarantee her personal security 

She don't have to be five foot ten 
Or blond or brunette 
She don't have to be no social hostess 
Send her 

She might work in a factory 
Right next door to me 
In my fantasy 
Send her to me 

Send her to me 
Send her to me 
Send her to me 
Send her to me 

She could be Rumanian 
Could be Bubarian 
Could be Albanian 
Might be Hungarian 
Could be Australian 
Could be the Alien 
Send her to me 

Send her to me 
Send her to me 
Send her to me 
Send her to me
