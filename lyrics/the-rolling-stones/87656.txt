I got the lumps in my throat
When I saw her coming down the aisle
I gets the wiggles in my knees
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled 


There she is again standing over by the record machine
Oooh, she's looking like a model on the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen 

Meanwhile, I was thinking
She's in the mood
No need to break it
I got the chance
I oughtta take it
She can dance
We can make it
Come on queenie
Let's shake it 

Go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie 

Won't ya tell me who the queen's
Standing over by the record machine
Why she's looking like a model
On the cover of a magazine
Yeah she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen 

Meanwhile, I was still thinkin'
If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
If it's a rocker, that'll get it
If it's good, she'll admit it
Come on queenie, lets get with it 

Go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie
