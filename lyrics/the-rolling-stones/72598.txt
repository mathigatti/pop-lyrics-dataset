I'm free to do what I want any old time
I'm free to do what I want any old time
So love me hold me love me hold me
I'm free to do what I want any old time


I'm free to sing my song knowing it's out of trend
I'm free to sing my song knowing it's out of trend
So love me hold hold me love me
'Cause I'm free to do any old time what I want

So love me hold hold me love me
I'm free to do any old time what I want

I'm free to choose who I see any old time
I'm free to bring who I choose any old time
Love me hold me love me hold me
I'm free to do what I want any old time
