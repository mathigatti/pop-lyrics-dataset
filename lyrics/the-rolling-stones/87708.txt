Sometimes I will, then again I think I won't
Sometimes I will, then again I think I won't
Sometimes I do, then again I think I don't


Well, I looked at my watch it was nine twenty-one
'T was at a rock 'n' roll dance havin' nothin' but fun
We rolled, reelin' and a-rockin'
We was reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn

Well, I looked at my watch, it was nine thirty-two
There's nothin' I'd rather do than dance with you
And we rolled, reelin' and a-rockin'
We was reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn

Well, I looked at my watch, it was nine forty-three
And every time I spin, she spins with me
And we rolled, reelin' and a-rockin'
We was reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn
Yeah, well all right!

Yeah, I looked at my watch, it was ten 0-five
Man, I didn't know if I was dead or alive
But I rolled, reelin' and a-rockin'
I was reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn

Yeah, I looked at my watch, it was ten twenty-six
I'm gonna keep on dancin' till I get my kicks
I was reelin', reelin' and a-rockin'
We's reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn

Well, I looked at my watch and to my surprise
I was dancin' with a woman that was twice my size
I was reelin', reelin' and a-rockin'
We's reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn

Well, I looked at my watch, and it was time to go
The band leader said, "We ain't playin' no more"
We were rollin', reelin' and a-rockin'
We was reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn
