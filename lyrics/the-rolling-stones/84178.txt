Let's take a walk 
Just you and me 
And talk of days gone by 
Across the fields 
Under the trees 
Let's speak of you and I


While the whole world 
Was wandering 
We walked a steady line 
When all our friends 
Were wavering 
We kept on trying

Now we're always suffering 
Already lost 
Always suffering 
Already lost

Remember when 
On summer days 
I would sing a lovers son 
How you would smile 
Shower me with praise 
And the sun shined on

Now the rain is falling slow 
And the nights grow long 
And the train 
Cries out so hauntingly 
She is gone

Now we're always suffering 
Already lost 
We're always suffering 
Already lost

Please take these flowers 
Smell the perfume 
Let your soul come alive 
Let there be hope 
Hope in your heart 
That our love may revive

For life is but a chance 
On a wind swept hill 
And the seeds of love 
Are swirling above 
Let them be still

But we're always suffering 
We're already lost 
Always suffering 
Already lost
