Yeah, you got satin shoes
Yeah, you got fancy boots
Y'all got cocaine eyes
Yeah, you got speed freak jive


Can't you hear me knockin' on your window
Can't you hear me knockin' on your door
Can't you hear me knockin' down the dirty street

Hey, help me baby,
I ain't no stranger
Help me baby,
I ain't no stranger
Help me baby,
I ain't no stranger

Can't you hear me knockin' when you're safe asleep
Can't you hear me knockin' down the gas light street
Can't you hear me knockin' throw me down the keys

Allright now
Hear me ringing big bells toll
Hear me singing soft and low
I've been begging on my knees
I've been kickin' Help me please
Hear me prowlin I'm gonna take you down
Hear me growlin', yeah I've got flatted feet
Now, now, now hear me howlin'
I'm all around your street now hear me knockin'
I'm around your town
