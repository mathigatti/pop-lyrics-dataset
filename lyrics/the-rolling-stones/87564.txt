Saw you stretched out, in-a-room ten oh nine,
A smile on your face, and tear in your eye
Could not seem to get a line on you
I could not seem to get a line on you
Oh sweet, sweet honey lover


Your Berber jewelry is jangling down the street
Smile on your face for every high school girl that you meet
Could not seem to get a line on you
Could not seem to get-a high on you
My, my sweet, sweet honey lover, now, oh 

May the good lord, flash a light on you
Make every song you're singing, your favorite tune
The good lord, flash a light on you
Warm, yeah, like the evening sun, now

You're drunk in the alley and your clothes are torn
And your late night friends have left you in the cold gray dawn
Just seen too many flies on you
I could not seem to get a-high on you
My sweet, sweet honey lover now (keep it up, boy)

Yeah honey, oh yeah,
Mmm, oh yeah-h
La la la la la
Could not seem to get a line on you, I'll tell ya
Could not seem to get a line on you
I just could not seem to get a line on you
I just can't, I just can't (to the lord now)
I just can't, I just can't (rub it all now)
I could not seem to get a line (one more tequila now)
I just could, not could not seem to get a line (come on over baby now)
I just could not seem to get line (come on and tell me now)
I just could not seem to get a line on you (na na na)
I just can't I just can't (to the lord now)
I just can't seem to get a line, line
