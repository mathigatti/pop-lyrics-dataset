I don't care if your love grows cold
Found love in someone else's home
Don't like standin' in the snow 


Everything's turning to gold
Everything's turning to gold
Everything's turning to gold 

You used to know me long ago
Was so lost and way down low.
Now that the love juice starts to flow,
Now that the love juice starts to flow,
Everything's turning to gold
Everything's turning to gold 

Everything's turning, everything's turning
Everything's turning, everything's turning to gold 

I'm tired, I'm tired of doing what I'm told.
Things are moving way too slow.
I got no problems, I got no problems, child.
It ain't my business, it ain't my business, ain't my style.
Now that the love juice starts to flow,
Now that the love juice starts to flow.
