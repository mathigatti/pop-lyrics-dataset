And it won't take long to forget you
Time it passes fast
Maybe all be over in a minute
You'll be in the past
You can lose a love of a life time
In a cinereous


You can gaine a fortune
Hand it
Instead
Or you can lose your soul

And it won't take long to forget you
You know
I'll never owner
And then all be over in a minute
And it won't take long

And it won't take long
To forgive you
But it's hard to forget
'cause it seems like as yesterday
The day that we first met

When you've gimme your smoulder ok
Put at your cigarette
When I saw you come salter
And oh wow
You wore a pale good dress

And it won't take long to forget you
You know
I'll never owner
And then all be over in a minute
And it won't take long

Life is short
One look and is over
'cause is quite shock
All I've got is some memories
Stack in a juke box

And it won't take long to forget you
You know
I'll never owner
And then all be over
Rock we's must
No it won't take long

And it won't take long
And it won't take long...
