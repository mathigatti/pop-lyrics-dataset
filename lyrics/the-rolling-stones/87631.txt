If I could stick my pen in my heart
And spill it all over the stage
Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya
Would you think, the boy is strange? Ain't he strange?


If I could win ya
If I could sing ya a love song so divine
Would it be enough for your cheating heart
If I broke down and cried? If I cried?

I said I know it's only rock 'n' roll but I like it
I know it's only rock 'n' roll but I like it
Like it, yes, I do, oh well, I like it, I like it, I like it
I said, can't you see that this old boy has been a lonely?

If I could stick a knife in my heart
Suicide right on stage
Would it be enough for your teenage lust
Would it help to ease the pain? Ease your brain?

If I could dig down deep in my heart
Feelings would flood on the page
Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya
Would ya think, the boy's insane? He's insane?

I said I know it's only rock 'n' roll but I like it
I said I know it's only rock 'n' roll but I like it
Like it, yes, I do, oh well, I like it, I like it, I like it
I said, can't you see that this old boy has been a lonely?

And do ya think that
You're the only girl around?
I bet you think that
You're the only woman in town

I said, I know it's only rock 'n' roll but I like it
I said, I know it's only rock 'n' roll but I like it
I said, I know it's only rock 'n' roll but I like it
Like it, yes, I do, oh well, I like it, I like it, I like it
