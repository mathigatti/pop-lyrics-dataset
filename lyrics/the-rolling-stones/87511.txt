Congratulations 
Congratulations 
Well done, my friend 
You've done it again 
You've gone and broken another heart 
Yeah, you've torn it apart 


You've done it before 
Hope to do it some more 
You've got it down to a fine art 

Remember the first time 
You tried to do it to me 
My girl won't fall 
Just wait and see 
Just wait and see 

Congratulations 
Congratulations 
You've gone and broken another heart 
Yeah, you've torn it apart 

La la, la la la, la la la la (congratulations)
