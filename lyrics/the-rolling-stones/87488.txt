Mmm...dear, I love you dearly, but don't forget trouble I,
used to find, and it was, in your mind...yeah 


I got red blood, and I got blood red wine Which I bring you,
when the snow is heavy on the ground If you say where go
I'll just, wrap my cloak around 

You say that every man you ever had Has been obsessed
with you and I, wanna prove an exception To the role, that
you lay down Babe, please don't make me cry, 'cause
there's a little pain inside..iide Yes my darling now you can't
expect me always to hide 

I got red blood, and I got, blood red wine Which I bring you
when the snow lies heavy on the ground If you say we'll go
Why-ow... let me, let me, wrap my coat around 

Yeah, that's right You see that every time well the lines must
rhyme And every verse, be in the same old time Does it all,
have to rhyme? But there go, and that's a place that you will
never... You said to remind of the girl I used to know, and
used to love, yeah 

I got red blood, and I got blood red wine Which I bring you,
when the snow lies heavy on the ground If, you get cold I, oh
wrap my, coat, coat around My, my, my, my don't you stay,
on that, that snowy ground...
