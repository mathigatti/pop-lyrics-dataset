Well she's very wealthy it's true 
So in that she is one up on you 
She's dressed all in red, white and blue 
And she always knows more than you do 


She's so affected 
Cool, calm, collected 

She knows who to smile to today 
She has just been brought up in that way 
She knows all the right games to play 
And she always just knows what to say 

She's well respected 
Cool, calm, collected 

She's so affected 
Cool, calm, collected 

In public the strain's heard to bear 
She exudes such a confident air 
But behind she is not without care 
But she sweeps it right under her hair 

She's well respected 
Cool, calm, collected 

She seems to glow brilliantly white 
And her hair seems to shine in the night 
With her feet unbelievably light 
And her teeth ready, sharpened to bite 

She's so respected 
Cool, calm, collected
