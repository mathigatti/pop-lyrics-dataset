Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail (again)
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine 


Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail (again)
She only does it at weekends
Claudine
Oh, Claudine 

Now only Spider knows for sure
But he ain't talkin' about it any more
Is he, Claudine? 

There's blood in the chalet
And blood in the snow
(She)Washed her hands of the whole damn show
The best thing you could do, Claudine 

Shot him once right through the head
Shot him twice right through the chest
The judge says (ruled) it was an accident
Claudine
Accidents will happen
(In the best homes) 

And Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine 

(Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine) [additional chorus] 

I'll tell you something
Now Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine 

Tell you one more
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Huh Claudine? 

Oh Claudine... 

Oooo ...
What about the children, baby?
Poor, poor children 

Now I threaten my wife with a gun
I always leave the safety on
I recommend it
Claudine 

Now she pistol whipped me once or twice
But she never tried to take my life
(What do you think about that)
Claudine 

The prettiest girl I ever seen
I saw you on the movie screen
Hope you don't try to make a sacrifice of me
Claudine
(Don't get trigger happy with me)
Don't wave a gun at me
(Claudine) 

I said Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine 

I said Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
She only does it at weekends
Claudine 

Keith, will you put that weapon down? 

Oh Claudine 

Oh Claudine
