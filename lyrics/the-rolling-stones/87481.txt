I don't want you to be high
I don't want you to be down
Don't want to tell you no lie
Just want you to be around 


Please come right up to my ears
You will be able to hear what I say 

Don't want you out in my world
Just you be my backstreet girl 

Please don't be part of my life
Please keep yourself to yourself
Please don't you bother my wife
That way you won't get no help 

Don't try to ride on my horse
You're rather common and coarse anyway

Don't want you out in my world
Just you be my backstreet girl 

Please don't you call me at home
Please don't come knocking at night
Please never ring on the phone
Your manners are never quite right 

Please take the favors I grant
Curtsy and look nonchalant, just for me 

Don't want you part of my world
Just you be my backstreet girl
