ItÂ´s funny how it seems, I'm here right now
Around you, there's no problem babe
Baby how it turns, I hear your voice
And there's no one there


Baby, there's no one there
Funny how it seems, I see your face
And yet there's no one there
Funny how you find yourself alone, baby
Cause there's no one there (there's a bridge there)

Oh, baby whip it on me
You know it's the truth
It's a virtual reality
Baby come and find out the truth
It's funny how it is

Oh Oh Baby you can't win
