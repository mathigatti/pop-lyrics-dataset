I went up to the island to, see that Angel was home
I went, out to the station to, see that the train was a blue
I was lookin' for my ba-by, well, see that my Angel was home 


I, called up your father to, see that the train
where does it go
And he offered me your sister, but she's
hooked here for later was so
And I'm lookin' for my baby, but it, looks like my Angel
Looks like my baby ... yeah she's gone 

Well I, went out to the main town to, see the train was lost
And I, went to your wedding, and I, saw the veil that you wore
Well I'm looking for my baby, it looks my Angel
Looks like my Angel ... is gone
