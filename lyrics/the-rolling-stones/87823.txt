I was a butcher cutting up meat 
My hands were bloody I'm dying on my feet 
I was a surgeon 'till I start to shake 
I was a falling 'till you put on the brakes 


Hey, hey you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey you got me rocking now 

I was a pitcher down in a slump 
I was a fighter taken for a sucker punch 
Feeling bad I guess I lost my spring 
I was the boxer who can't get in the ring 

Hey, hey you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey there ain't no stopping me 
Hey, hey you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey you got me rocking now 

I was a hooker losing her looks 
I was a writer can't write another book 
I was all dried up dying to get wet 
I was a tycoon drowning in debt 

Hey, hey you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey there ain't no stopping me 
Hey, hey you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey you got me rocking now 
Hey, hey you got me rocking now
