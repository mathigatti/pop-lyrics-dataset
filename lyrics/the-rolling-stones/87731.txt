Silver train is a coming
Think I'm gonna get on now (oh yeah)
Silver train is a coming
Think I wanna get on now (oh yeah, oh yeah)


Silver rain is a falling
Falling up around my house (oh yeah)
Silver rain is a falling
Falling up around my house (oh yeah, oh yeah)

And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure love the way
That she laughed and took my money

And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure loved the way
That she laughed and called me honey

Silver rain is a falling
Falling up around my house (oh yeah)
Silver bells is a ringing
Ringing all around my house (ding dong, oh yeah)

And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure loved the way
That she laughed and took my money

And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure loved the way
That she laughed and called me honey

I'm going home on a south bound train
With a song in my mouth
I'm going home on a south bound train
With a song in my mouth

Silver train is a running
Think I'm gonna get on now (oh yeah)
Silver train is a coming
Think I'm gonna get on now (oh yeah)

And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure loved the way
That she laughed and took my money

And I did not know her name
And I did not know her name
But I sure loved the way
That she laughed and called me honey

Silver train is a coming
Think I'm gonna get on now (oh yeah)
Silver train is a coming
Think I'm gonna get on board (oh yeah)
