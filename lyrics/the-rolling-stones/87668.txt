Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yes
Everything gonna be alright 


Oh yeah, yeah
Now when I was a young boy
At the age of five
My mother said I'll be
The greatest man alive 

And now I'm a man
I'm over twenty-one
You better believe me, baby
And I'll say, we can have lots of fun 

I'm a man
Huh huh huh huh huh
A man
Oh yeah 

Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Oh yeah 

The line I shoot
Will never miss
And when I make love to you baby
You just can't resist 

Ooh, ain't that man
Spelled "M"
"A" child
"N" 

No "B"
"O" child
"Y"
That spell mannish boy 

I'm a man
A man
I'm a man 
I'm a man 

I sittin' on the outside
Just me and my mate
I made the move
Come up two hours late 

Ain't that a man
No "B"
"O" child
"Y"
That spell mannish boy 

I'm a man
I'm a man
I'm a full grown man, baby 

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah 

All you pretty women
Stand in line
I make love with you baby
In an hour's time 

I'm a man
I'm a man
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
