Walk right in
Sit on down
And make
yourself
At home
Come on baby
You're just like I need
And you're hate
To be
Alone


Is funny how things go around
Is crazy
But it's true

This place is empty
Oh so empty
Is empty without you

Come on
Bear your breath
And make me
Feel
At home
You and me we're just like
All the rest
And we don't
Wanna be
Alone

Is funny how things go around
But go around they do

This place is empty
Empty
So empty without you

Yeah
This place is empty
Empty
So empty without you

Oh yeah
Mm mm

Is empty without you
Mmm mmm

Come on
Simmer down
And treat me
Sweet and cold
At least by now you
You have learnt
How
To plough
A fool

Is funny how dream turn around
Is crazy
But it's true

This place is empty
So empty
So empty without you

This place is empty
Oh so empty
So empty without you
