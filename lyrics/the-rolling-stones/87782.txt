Yes, star crossed in pleasure the stream flows on by 
Yes, as we're sated in leisure, we watch it fly 


And time waits for no one, and it won't wait for me 
And time waits for no one, and it won't wait for me 

Time can tear down a building or destroy a woman's face 
Hours are like diamonds, don't let them waste 

Time waits for no one, no favours has he 
Time waits for no one, and he won't wait for me 

Men, they build towers to their passing yes, to their fame everlasting 
Here he comes chopping and reaping, hear him laugh at their cheating 

And time waits for no man, and it won't wait for me 
Yes, time waits for no one, and it won't wait for me 

Drink in your summer, gather your corn 
The dreams of the night time will vanish by dawn 

And time waits for no one, and it won't wait for me 
And time waits for no one, and it won't wait for me 

No no no, not for me....
