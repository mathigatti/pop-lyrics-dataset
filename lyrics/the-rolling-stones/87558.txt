Fingerprint file, you get me down 
You keep me running 
Know my way around. Yes, you do, child 
Fingerprint file, you bring me down 
Keep me running 
You keep me on the ground 
Know my moves 
Way ahead of time 
Listening to me 
On your satellite 


Feeling followed 
Feeling tagged 
Crossing water 
Trying to wipe my tracks 

And there's some little jerk in the FBI 
A keepin' papers on me six feet high 
It gets me down, it gets me down, it gets me down 

You better watch out 
On your telephone 
Wrong number 
They know you ain't home 

And there's some little jerk in the FBI 
A keepin' papers on me six feet high 
It gets me down, it gets me down, it gets me down 

Who's the man on the corner; that corner over there 
I don't know. Well, you better lay low. Watch out 

Keep on the look out 
Electric eyes 
Rats on the sell out 
Who gonna testify 
You know my habits 
Way a head of time 
Listening to me 
On your satellite 

And there's some little jerk in the FBI 
A keepin' papers on me six feet high 
It gets me down, it gets me down, it gets me down 
It gets me down 

Hello, baby, mm-hmm 
Ah, yeah, you know we ain't, we ain't talkin' alone 
Who's listening? Well I don't really know 
But you better tell the SIS to keep out of sight 
'Cause I know they takin' pictures on the ultraviolet light 
Yes, uh huh, yeah, but these days it's all secrecy; no privacy 
Shoot first, that' s right... you know 
Bye bye. 
Right now somebody is listening to......  you 
Keeping their eyes peeled......   on you 
Mmm, mmm, what a price, what a price to pay 
All right. Good night, sleep tight
