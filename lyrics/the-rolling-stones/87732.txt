Why don't we sing this song all together 
Open our heads let the pictures come 
And if we close all our eyes together 
Then we will see where we all come from 


Pictures of us through the steamy haze 
Picture of us painted in our place 

Why don't we sing this song all together 
Open our heads let the pictures come 
And if we close all our eyes together 
Then we will see where we all come from 

Why don't we sing this song all together 
Open our heads let the pictures come 
And if we close all our eyes together 
Then we will see where we all come from 

Pictures of us beating on our drum 
Never stopping til the rain has come 

Why don't we sing this song all together 
Open our heads let the pictures come 
And if we close all our eyes together 
Then we will see where we all come from
