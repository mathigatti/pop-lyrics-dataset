Jiving Sister Fanny told her man of the dirty byway 
Uh huh, huh huh,
She even did the favor for the man on the broad highway
Uh huh, huh huh,
She got me walkin' 'round
Then she got me going down
"Hey" said the policeman
Get me quicky out of town
Woo who child you got me walkin' down the wrong highway
Hey hey hey hey


Now Jiving Sister Fanny got the brain of a dinosaur
Uh huh, huh huh,
She took my motley Billy and she broke up my electric guitar
Uh huh, huh huh,
She got the way around,
Yes she's got me out of town
The man on the juniper 
Gonna put me out of town
Ooh ooh child you got me walkin' down a broad highway
Uh huh, huh huh

Now, now, it's time thank y'all


Yeah if you got the ride boy if you got the right a way
If you ever go to bed you finally imagine how the way you play
You got the shy part
You got the red suit 
A man jumping hunky
With a skull and a straddle bar 
Voodoo child you got me walkin' down the broad highway
Uh huh, huh huh

Oh yeah ah ah ah

You got me walkin' 'round
Yes, you got me way around
I'm not in for a girl
That really wants to tie you down
Ooh child you got me walkin' down the broad highway

Na na na na na na na
Hey hey hey yeah yeah wah ooh
Na na na na

JIVING SISTER FANNY 
(Jagger/Richards) 

Jiving Sister Fanny told her man from Philadelphia Pa 
Uh huh, huh, huh 
He tore down the station, said she didn't like the way we played 
Uh huh, huh, huh 
If you got a diff'rent guy, 
Bitch you better be the one 
Hanging from the duties by 
The cold grab you by the while 
Ooh child, you've got me walking down a broad highway 
Uh huh, huh, huh 

Now Jiving Sister Fanny's got the brain of a dinosaur 
Uh huh, huh, huh 
Yeah she hocked my fancy mother 
And she hocked my electric guitar 
Uh huh, huh, huh 
Then she's waiting in the store, 
That's the way, the way to go 
Now she's found the way to go, 
Goodbye Charlie, get your way 
Ooh child, you've got me walking down a broad highway 

And-a 'come on boy, I want you to fuck'
Ah yeah, ooh, oh yeah come on by

Ooh child, you've got me walking down a broad highway 
Uh huh, huh, huh 
Yeah yeah, Jiving sister Fanny brought a man down the broad highway 
Uh huh, huh, huh 
Yeah she even took the question 
And she didn't like the games we played 
Na na na na na na 
Yeah you've got my way around, 
You've got me out of town 
A man from Philadelphia
Forget about a public house
Ooh child, you've got me walking down a broad highway 
Ooh! 

Jiving Sister Fanny got the brain of a dinosaur 
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir 
Ooh ooh oh, uh huh huh huh 
You've got me walking by
A man from Philadelphia
You've got me one about the famous child ....
Ooh na na uh huh huh huh huh 
Come on, boy, come on, come on, come on, come on now 
Yeah, yeah uh huh huh huh
