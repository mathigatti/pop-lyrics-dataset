(Ah, har har har har) 
She looks so simple in her way 
Does the same thing everyday 
But she's dedicated 
To having her own way 
She's very complicated 
(Ah, har, har, har, har) 


Yeah 

Women seem to fill her mind 
And many men in so short time 
But she's underrated 
She treats me oh so kind 
She's very complicated 
(Ha, har har har, har) 

Yeah 

We talk together and discuss 
What is really best for us 
She's sophisticated 
My head's fit to bust 
Cause she's so complicated 
Ah,. ha har har, har 

She knows just how to please her man 
Softer than a baby lamb 
But she's educated 
Doesn't give a damn 
She's very complicated 
(Har, har har har, har) 
Na, na na na num 

She looks so simple in her way 
Does the same thing everyday 
But she's dedicated 
To having her own way 
She's very complicated 
(Har, har har har, har....)
