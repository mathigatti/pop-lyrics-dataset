Woo whoo whoo whoo
Woo whoo whoo whoo


Saw you on the sidewalk sister
Walking home alone
You got the blues from working
Right down to your bones

Woun't you please tell me sister
Yeah, its all a trip
Yeah even alone
Yeah moma lets go
Yeah your all alone

My my my my my 
My my my my my

Stuck out all alone
Your stuck out all alone
(repeat 3 times)
