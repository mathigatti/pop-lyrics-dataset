My sweet Lady Jane
When I see you again
Your servant am I
And will humbly remain


Just heed this plea, my love
On bended knees, my love
I pledge myself to Lady Jane

My dear Lady Anne
I've done what I can
I must take my leave
For promised I am

This play is run, my love
Your time has come, my love
I've pledged my troth to Lady Jane

Oh, my sweet Marie
I wait at your ease
The sands have run out
For your lady and me

Wedlock is nigh, my love
Her station's right, my love
Life is secure with Lady Jane
