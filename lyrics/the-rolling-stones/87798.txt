Wake up in the morning there's a snap around the place
Wake up in the morning there's a crackle in your face
Wake up in the morning there's a pop that realy says
"Rice Crispies for you and you and you" 


Pour on the milk and listen to the snap that says: "It's nice"
Pour on the milk and listen to the crackle of that rice
Get up in the morning to the pop that says: "It's rice"

Hear them talking crisp. Rice Crispies!!
