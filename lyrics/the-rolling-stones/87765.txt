No matter what you say 
No matter what you do 
I'm lazy as a lion 
My body's just for you 
Crazy for you 
I'm sneaky as a snake 
I'm dirty as a dog 
I'm rutting like a goat 
I'm horny as a hog 
Terrifying love 


I get these strange strange strange desires 
Strange strange strange desires 

You're graceful as a bird 
My heart is on the wing 
You're gentle as a dove 
If a humming bird could sing 
Crazy for you 
You're gunning like a deer 
I'm wily as a fox 
You're faster than a mare 
I'm stronger than an ox 
Terrifying love 

I get these strange strange strange desires 
Strange strange strange desires 
Strange strange strange desires 

I'm faithful as a swan 
I'm darker than a bat 
I'm friendly as a bear 
And tougher than a rat 
No matter what you say 
No matter what you do 
I'm restless as a cat 
All caged up in a zoo 
Terrifying love 

I get these strange strange strange desires 
Strange strange strange desires 
Strange strange strange desires
