I am waiting, I am waiting
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I am waiting, I am waiting
Oh yeah, oh yeah


Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere
Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere

You can't hold out, you can't hold out
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You can't hold out, you can't hold out
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere
Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere

See it come along and don't know where it's from
Oh yes, you will find out
Well it happens all the time, it's censored from our minds
You'll find out

Slow or fast, slow or fast
Oh yeah, oh yeah
End at last, end at last
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere
Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere

Stand up coming years and escalation fears
Oh yes we will find out
Well like a withered stone, fears will pierce your bones
You'll find out

Oh we're waiting, oh we're waiting
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh we're waiting-ting, oh we're waiting-ting
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere
Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere

Oh we're waiting, oh we're waiting
Oh we're waiting, oh we're waiting
