It's not easy 
It's not easy living on your own 
It's not easy 
It's not easy living on your own 
And it's hard (it's not easy) 
And it's hard (it's not easy) 
And it's a pretty hard thing (it's not easy) 
It's not easy living on your own 


All of the things that you used to do 
If they're done now, well they're done by you 
It seems a big failing in a man 
To take his girl for granted if he can 

And it's hard thing (it's not easy) 
And it's hard (it's not easy) 
And it's a pretty hard thing (it's not easy) 
It's not easy livin' on your own 

There's no place where you can call home 
Got me running like a cat in a thunderstorm 
Just a big bed and a telephone 
Like the last remnants of a stately home 

And it's a pretty hard thing (it's not easy) 
And it's hard (it's not easy) 
Well, it's a pretty hard thing (it's not easy) 
It's not easy livin' on your own 

And it's hard (it's not easy) 
And it's hard (it's not easy) 
And it's a pretty hard thing (it's not easy) 
It's not easy living on your own 

Sit here thinking with your head of fire 
Go think the same thing and never tire 
Imaginin' the glow of her long clean hair 
As she goes to sit on her own high chair 

And it's hard thing (it's not easy) 
Well, it's a pretty hard thing (it's not easy) 
Well, it's hard babe (it's not easy) 
It's not easy livin' on your own 

It's not easy (a pretty tough thing) 
It's not easy (well, life pretty rough) 
It's not easy (it's a hard time baby) 
It's not easy (it's a hard time baby) 
It's not easy (it's a pretty hard life)
