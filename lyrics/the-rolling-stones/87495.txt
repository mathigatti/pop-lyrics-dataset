Ah ah listen to everybody (body) 
Especially you girls (girl) 
It's not right to be left alone 
When the one you love is never home 
I loved to hard my friends sometime say 
But I believe, I believe 
That a woman should be loved that way 


But it hurts me so inside 
To see you treat me so unkind 
Somebody, somewhere tell her it ain't fair 

Can I get a witness (can I get a witness) 
I want a witness (can I get a witness) 
I want a witness (can I get a witness) 
Somebody (can I get a witness) 

Is it right to be treated so bad 
When you give it everything you had 
If I talks in my sleep 
'Cuz I haven't seen my baby all week 

Now you chicks you all agree 
This ain't the way it's supposed to be 
Let me hear you 
Let me hear you say, "yeah yeah" 

Up early in the morning 
Well they're all in my mind 
Just to find her out all night 
Well I've been crying 

But I believe 
A women's a man's best friend 
I'm gonna stick by her 
'Till the very end 

Well she caused me so much misery 
I forget how it's supposed to be 
Somebody, somewhere 
Tell her it ain't fair 

Can I get a witness 
Can I get a witness (can I get a witness) 
I want a witness (can I get a witness) 
Witness, witness (can I get a witness) 
Witness, witness (can i get a witness) 

Everybody knows, especially you girls 
That a love can be sad 
But half a loves is twice as bad 

Now you chicks you all agree 
That ain't the way love's supposed to be 
Let me hear ya 
Let me hear you say "yeah yeah" 

I want a witness (can I get a witness) 
I want a witness (can I get a witness) 
Yeah I want a witness (I want a witness) 
Somebody (can I get a witness) 

Is it right to be treated so bad 
When you give it everything you had 
If I talk, in my sleep 
'Cuz i haven't seen my baby all week 

Yeah she caused me so much misery 
That ain't the way it's supposed to be 
Let me hear 
Let me hear you say "yeah yeah" 

I want a witness (can I get a witness) 
I want a witness (can I get a witness) 
I want be (can I get a witness) 
I want a witness (can I get a witness) 
Witness, witness 
I want a witness
