I've been working so hard, And feelin' no pain
Sure got pains in my head, My legs feel limp
Don't want to hear no noise, Don't want to hear you cuss
I need peace of mind, Don't you make no fuss 


Jump on top of me baby, Jump on top of me baby
Jump on top of me girl, Give it to me nice and slow 

Well there's too much talkin', 'bout this an' that
And the window needs fixin', Better feed the cat
We're fresh out of beer, Could you answer the phone
Well you call this bisque, Well I'm leavin' home 

Jump on top of me baby, Jump on top of me baby
Jump on top of me girl, Give it to me nice and slow
Alright 

Well jump on top of me baby, Jump on top of me baby
Get on top of me girl, Everybody lay down low 

When we first met, We were both so young
We didn't give a damn, How the clock would run
The time is right, To make some fool of you
'cause it's gettin' late, What would you like to do 

Jump on top of me baby, Get on top of me baby
Jump on top of me girl, Give it to me nice and slow
Alright 

Well
Jump on top of me baby, Jump on top of me baby
Jump on top of me girl, And give it to me nice and slow 

Alright
Jump on top of me baby, Jump on top of me baby
Jump on top of me girl, Everybody lay down low 

Alright
Jump on top of me baby, Yeah top of me baby
On top of me girl, Everybody lay down low 

I can't stand it, When the sun comes up
Gonna need some comfort, 'Cause I can't stand up
Shut the blinds, I'm gonna shut the shades
And tell the neighbors, We'll be gone for days 

Jump on top of me baby, Jump on top of me baby
Jump on top of me girl, Give it to me nice and slow
Alright
