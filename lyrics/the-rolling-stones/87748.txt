Baby, baby, I've been so sad since you've been gone 
Way back to New York City 
Where you do belong 
Honey, I missed your two-tone kisses 
Legs wrapped around me tight 
If I ever get back to Fun City, girl 
I'm gonna make you scream all night 


Honey, honey, call me on the telephone 
I know you're movin' out to Hollywood 
With your can of tasty foam 
All those beat up friends of mine 
Got to get you in their books 
Lead guitars and movie stars 
Get their tongues beneath your hood 

Yeah! You're a star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star 
Yeah, a star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star 
A star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker star 

Yeah, I heard about you Polaroid's 
Now that's what I call obscene 
Your tricks with fruit was kind a cute 
I bet you keep your pussy clean 
Honey, I miss your two tone kisses 
Legs wrapped around me tight 
If I ever get back to New York, girl 
Gonna make you scream all night 

Yeah! You're a star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star 
Yeah, a star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star 
A star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker star 

Yeah, Ali McGraw got mad with you 
For givin' head to Steve McQueen 
Yeah, you and me, we made a pretty pair 
Fallin' through the Silver Screen 
Honey, I'm open to anything 
I don't know where to draw the line 
Yeah, I'll make bets that you're gonna get 
John Wayne before he dies 

Yeah! You're a star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star 
Yeah, a star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star 
A star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker star 
Yes you are 
A star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker star   
A star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker star
A star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker star

Starfucker starfucker, starfucker starfucker starfucker (yes you are)
Starfucker starfucker, starfucker starfucker starfucker, yes you are, yes you are

Oh-Yeah - Oh!

Give us a kiss 
With a twist 
Ball me girl
