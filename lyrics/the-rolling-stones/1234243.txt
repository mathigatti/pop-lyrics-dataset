Angie, Angie, when will those clouds all disappear
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here
With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried


Angie, you're beautiful, but ain't it time we said goodbye
Angie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried
All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here
Oh, Angie, don't you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie, Angie, ain't it time we say good-bye

With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, I still love you, Baby, ev'rywhere I look I see youreyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you come on baby, dry your eyes

But Angie, Angie, ain't it good to be alive
Angie, Angie, they can't say we never tr√Øed
