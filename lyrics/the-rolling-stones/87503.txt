The wind blows rain into my face 
The sun glows at the end of the highway 
Child of the moon, rub your rainy eyes 
Oh, child of the moon 
Give me a wide-awake crescent-shaped smile 


She shivers, by the light she is hidden 
She flickers like a lamp lady vision 
Child of the moon, rub your rainy eyes 
Child of the moon 
Give me a wide-awake crescent-shaped smile 

The first car on the foggy road riding 
The last star for my lady is pining 
Oh, child of the moon, bid the sun arise 
Oh, child of the moon 
Give me a misty day, pearly gray, silver, silky faced, 
Wide-awake crescent-shaped smile
