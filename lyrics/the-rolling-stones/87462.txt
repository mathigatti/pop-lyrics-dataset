Went out walkin' through the wood the other day 
And the world was a carpet laid before me 
The buds were bursting and the air smelled sweet and strange 
And it seemed about a hundred years ago 


Mary and I, we would sit upon a gate 
Just gazin' at some dragon in the sky 
What tender days, we had no secrets hid away 
Well, it seemed about a hundred years ago 

Now all my friends are wearing worried smiles 
Living out a dream of what they was 
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up? 

Went out walkin' through the wood the other day 
Can't you see the furrows in my forehead? 
What tender days, we had no secrets hid away 
Now it seems about a hundred years ago 

Now if you see me drinkin' bad red wine 
Don't worry 'bout this man that you love 
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up? 

You're gonna kiss and say good-bye, yeah, I warn you 
You're gonna kiss and say good-bye, yeah, I warn you 
You're gonna kiss and say good-bye, oh Lord, I warn you 
And please excuse me while I hide away 

Call me lazy bones 
Ain't got no time to waste away 
Lazy bones ain't got no time to waste away 
Don't you think it's just about time to hide away? Yeah, yeah!
