I stand accused of talking
But I feel that we are falling
In the same old groove
The radio is playing
Spitting out the same old news 


It's time to get up, get out
Get out into something new
Time to get up, get out
Out into something new 

Everybody wants somebody's fantasy
Everybody wants somebody's crazy dreams
Everybody wants somebody's fantasy
Everybody wants somebody's crazy dreams 

If I was a woman, I would want a new man every night
If I was a woman, I would want a new man every night
If I was a politician, make sure I was the best in sight
If I was a woman, I would want a new man every night 

The poor man eyes the rich man
Denigrates his poverty
The rich man eyes the poor man
And envies his simplicity 

Everybody wants somebody's fantasy
Everybody wants somebody's crazy dreams 

If I was a movie star, five million dollars would be my price
If I was a trucker, I'd drive for seven days and seven lonely
nights
If I was a drummer, I would never miss the beat
If I was a dancer, y'all would never see my feet
If I was a hooker, a thousand dollars would be my price, all right
If I was a candidate for President, I'd make sure I had a steady wife
If I was a millionaire, I'd spend all my money in one crazy night 

I am what I am
Yeah, my my boss I am what I am
My dreams can't be bought Yeah, I said now
I tear across the dollar Just to end this day with you Yeah, I am what I am
I am my own boss Everybody wants somebody's crazy dreams
Everybody want somebody's fantasy
Everybody wants somebody's crazy dreams

Everybody wants somebody's crazy dreams
Everybody want somebody's fantasy
Everybody wants somebody's crazy dreams
