Oh, Mona 


I tell you Mona what I wanna do 
I'll build a house next door to you 
Can I see you sometimes? 
We can blow kisses through the blinds 
Yeah can I out come out on the front 
And listen to my heart go bumpety bump 
I need you baby that's no lie 
Without your love I'd surely die

And listen to my heart go bumpety bump 
I need you baby that's no lie 
Without your love I'd surely die
