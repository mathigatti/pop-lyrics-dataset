Heard from friends of mine 
You been telling lies 
How I was wrapped up in you 
But surprise, surprise 
Surprise, surprise 
I never wanted you that bad 
'Cause I knew you was telling lies 
Knew you was telling lies 
I could see it in your eyes 


Why did you have to 
Go and fool after 
We had got along so fine 
But surprise, suprise 
Surprise, surprise 
Ain't nothing strange to me 
Knew you was telling lies 
Knew you was telling lies 
I could see it in your eyes 

Knew you was telling lies 
Knew you was telling lies 
I could see it in your eyes 

I hope you're proud of 
All your chasin' 'round 
Thinkin' I was alone all night 
But surprise, suprise 
Surprise, surprise 
You're only foolin' yourself 
'Cause I knew you was telling lies 
Knew you was telling lies 
I could see it in your eyes 

Yeah, baby why did you have to go fool around 
After we got along so fine 
I knew you was tellin' lies and tellin' jive 
Yes I did 
We got along so fine 
But I knew you was telling lies 
Knew you was talkin' jive 
I could see it in your eyes
