I was twenty one naive 
Not cynical, I try to please 
Her wit, her speech, her repartee 
Impressed me almost instantly 


She went all the way 
All the way down 
She went all the way, all the way 

She showed me love a hundred ways 
How she pimped and how she paid 
All the daughters, all the sons 
All were welcome, all would come 

We went all the way 
All the way down 
We went all the way, all the way 

I was King, Mr. Cool 
Just a snobby little fool 
(Like kids are now.) 
I dreamed of reaching greater heights 
I raved about it every night 
Talk is cheap 

She went all the way, all the way 
All the way down, yeah 
She went all the way 
All the way all the way 
All the way, all the way down 

She's there when I close my eyes 
There when I close my eyes 
She's there when I close my eyes 
There when I close my eyes 

How the years they rush on by 
Birthdays, kids and suicides 
Still I play the fool and strut 
Still you're a slut 

Hey girl, she went all the way 
All the way, all the way 
All the way down 
She went all the way 
All the way, all the way 
All the way down 
She went all the way 
All the way, all the way 
All the way down 

You give me back that time right now 
I can see it if I close my eyes 
Was every minute just a waste? 
Was every hour a foolish chase? 
I don't believe it 

She went all the way 
All the way down 
She went all the way 
All the way down 
She went all the way 
All the way down 
She went all the way 
All the way all the way 
All the way down 
She went all the way 
All the way all the way 
All the way down
