We, on our present life, 
Knew that the stars were right. 
That if you are the first to go, 
You'll leave a sign to let me know, 
Tell me so. 
Please, carry the Lantern lights. 


You crossed the sea of night, 
Free from the spell of fright 
Your cloak it is a spirit shroud. 
You'll wake me in my sleeping hours, 
Like a cloud. 
So, please, carry the Lantern high. 

Me, in my sorry plight, 
You waiting ev'ry night. 
My face it turns a deathly pale, 
You're talking to me, through your veil, 
I hear you wail. 
So, please carry the Lantern light. 

The servants sleep, 
The door's are barred. 
You hear the stopping of my heart-we never part. 
So, please carry the Lantern high.
