I'm so glad to be here tonight and I'm so glad to be home. 
And I believe I've got a message for every woman and every man here tonight that ever needed somebody to love 
Someone to stay with them all the time, when they're up and when they're down.
You know, sometimes you get what you want 
And then you go and lose what you have 
And I believe every woman and every man here tonight listen to my song 
And it save the whole world. 
Listen to me. 


Everybody wants somebody 
Everybody wants somebody to love 
Someone to love 
Someone to kiss 
Sometime to miss, now 
Someone to squeeze 
Someone to please 
And I need you you you 
I need you you you 
I need you you you 
I need you you you 

Oh, sometimes I feel like 
I feel a little sad inside 
My baby mistreats me 
And I kinda get a little little mad 

I need you you you 
To see me through, babe 
When the sun go down 
Ain't nobody else around 
That's when I need you baby 
That's when I say I love you

Somebody to see me through, baby

Ain't nobody else around 
That's when I'm all by myself 
That's when I need your lovin' darlin' 
That's when I need you so bad 
You're the one I really need bad (???)
