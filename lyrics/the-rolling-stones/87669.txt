I'm getting wise to you 
You're going to see 
I'm going to work on you 
The way you worked on me 
I got a sharper aim 
And you're in my sights 
And if I'm going to go 
I'm going in a blaze of lights 


And in this crazy world of hit and run 
There are no laws here 
Just a loaded gun 

She's got a mean disposition 
She's got a big shooter too 
She's got a mean disposition 
Really make a mess 
Really make a mess out of you 

I never close my eyes 
I never sleep 
I'm staying on my guard 
Waiting for my flesh to creep 
And I never trusted you 
You never trusted me 
I'll do a deal with you 
If you'll do a deal with me 

For me the nightmare's only just begun 
There is no law here 
Just a loaded gun 

She's got a mean disposition 
Got a big shooter too 
She's got a mean disposition 
Got a bad attitude 
She's got a mean disposition 
Going to cut your half 
Going to cut your half in two 

I'm going have to stand my ground 
Like Crockett at the Alamo 
I'm going to draw the line 
One of us has got to go 

She's got a mean disposition 
Got a big shooter too 
She's got a mean disposition 
Got a bad attitude 
She's got a mean disposition 
Going to make a mess out of you 
She's got a mean disposition 
Going to cut your half 
Going to cut your half in two
