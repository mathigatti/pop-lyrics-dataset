One time you were my baby chicken
Now you've grown into a fox
And once upon a time I was your little rooster
Am I just one of your cocks?


It's rough justice, oh yeah!
You're gonna have to trust me
It's rough justice
But you know I never break your heart

So put your lips to my hips baby
And tell me what's on your mind
I know you still got that animal attraction for me
It's been a long, long time

It's rough justice, oh yeah!
We never thought it dusty
It's rough justice
But you know I never break your heart

You're feeling loose n' lusty
So if you really want me
It's rough justice
And you know I never break your heart

It's rough justice, oh yeah!
You think you really suss me?
It's rough justice
But you know I never break your heart

First time I saw baby
You were springin' like a young gazelle
And next thing I know, we're way down the road
And you're flying like a bat outta hell

It's rough justice, oh yeah!
You're attitude's disgusting
You're gonna have to trust me
But you know I never break your heart

I give you my possession
Don't want no opposition
It's rough justice
But you know I never break your heart
