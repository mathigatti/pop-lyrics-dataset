Walkin'thru' the sleepy city 
In the dark it looks so pretty 
Till I got to the one cafe 
That stays open night and day 


Just a lookin' at the sleepy city 
In the night it looks so pretty 
No one sees the city lights 
they just care about the warmth inside 

No one listens to what people say 
I just sit and hear the radio play 
Just then this girl walked in my way 
And she was as pretty as my sleepy city 

Will you walk through the sleepy city 
In the night it looks so pretty 
Tired of walkin on my own 
It looks better when you're not alone 

Will you walk through the sleepy city 
In the night it looks so pretty 
I'm tired of walkin on my own 
It looks better when you're not alone 

Mm mm mm mm mm mm 
La la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la 

Will you walk through the sleepy city 
In the night, well it looks so pretty 
I'm tired of walkin on my own 
It looks better when you're not alone 

C'mon walk through that sleepy city 
I said in the night it looks so pretty 
I'm tired of walkin that park on my own 
It looks better when you're not alone
