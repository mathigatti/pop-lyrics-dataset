When I come home baby 
And I've been working all night long 
I put my daughter on my knee, and she say 
"Daddy what's wrong?" 
I put my head on her shoulder 
She whispers in my ear so sweet 
You know what she says? 
"Daddy you're a fool to cry 
You're a fool to cry 
And it makes me wonder why." 


You know, I got a woman 
And she lives in the poor part of town 
and I go see her sometimes 
And we make love, so fine 
I put my head on her shoulder 
She says, "Tell me all your troubles." 
You know what she says? She says 
"Daddy you're a fool to cry 
You're a fool to cry 
and it makes me wonder why." 

Daddy you're a fool to cry 
Oh, I love you so much baby 
Daddy you're a fool to cry 
Daddy you're a fool to cry, yeah 
She says, "Daddy you're a fool to cry 
You're a fool to cry 
And it makes me wonder why." 

She says, "Daddy you're a fool to cry 
Daddy you're a fool to cry 
Daddy you're a fool to cry 
Daddy you're a fool to cry 

Even my friends say to me sometimes 
And make out like I don't understand them 
You know what they say 
They say, "Daddy you're a fool to cry 
You're a fool to cry 
You're a fool to cry 
And it makes me wonder why." 

I'm a fool baby 
I'm a fool baby 
I'm a certified fool, now 
I want to tell ya 
Gotta tell ya, baby 
I'm a fool baby 
I'm a fool baby 
Certified fool for ya, mama, come on 
I'm a fool 
I'm a fool 
I'm a fool
