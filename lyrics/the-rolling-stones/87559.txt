Well, I was happy here at home 
I got everything I need. 
Happy bein' on my own 
Just living the life I lead. 


Well suddenly it dawned on me 
That this was not my life. 
So I just phoned the airline girl 
And said, "Get me on flight number 505, 
Get me on flight number 505." 

Well, I confirmed my reservation. 
Then I hopped a cab. 
No idea of my destination 
And feeling pretty bad. 

With my suitcase in my hand. 
In my head, my new life. 
So then I told the airline girl 
"Well, get me on flight number 505, 
Get me on flight number 505." 
Alright. 

Well, I sat right there in my seat. 
Well, feeling like a king. 
With the whole world right at my feet. 
"Of course I'll have a drink!" 

Well, suddenly I saw 
That we never ever would arrive. 
He put the plane down in the sea. 
The end of flight number 505. 
The end of flight number 505. 
Alright. 

Whew, they put the plane down in the sea. 
The end of flight number 505. 
The end of flight number 505.
