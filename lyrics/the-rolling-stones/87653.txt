Lies, dripping off your mouth like dirt 
Lies, lies in every step you walk 
Lies, whispered sweetly in my ear 
Lies, how do I get out of here? 
Why, why you have to be so cruel? 
Lies, lies, lies I ain't such a fool! 


Lies, lies in my papa's looks 
Lies, lies in my history books 
Lies, lies like they teach in class 
Lies, lies, lies I catch on way too fast 
Fire, fire upon your wicked tongue 
Lies, lies, lies you're trying to spoil my fun 

Lies, lies you dirty jezebel 
Why, why, why, why don't you go to hell? 
Why, why you think me such a fool? 
Lies, lies, lies honey that's ya rules! 

Lies, lies, lies, lies, oh my lies, ...
