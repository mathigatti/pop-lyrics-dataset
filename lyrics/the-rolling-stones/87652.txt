They call my baby Patty, but, her real name, her real name, her real name is Linda Lu
They call my baby Patty, but, her real name, her real name, her real name is Linda Lu
She's so fine and darn too pretty I never know what that baby gonna do
She walkin' down the street, all the cats, all the cats, all the cats, turn to look around
She walkin' down the street, all the cats, all the cats, all the cats, turn to look around
She a fine dog-gone lady, she the best lookin' girl we had in this town 


Gonna remember that girl on Saturday night
We go out for the rest of my nights
And in my roamin' and Daisy too
And it's all because of that chick... 

Linda Linda Linda Linda Linda, tell me what's you gonna do?
Had a real bad dream last night
I dreamed I went a stroll
You're a fine doggone lady
You're, you gonna break my heart in two
A Linda Lu
All right solo... 

Linda Lu, Linda Lu, Lu Linda Linda Linda Linda Linda
T..T..tell me, w..w..what, is you gonna do?

Had a real bad dream last night
She went and fucked Ronnie with the whole do
Ohh... 

Linda, Linda, L..Linda L..Linda L..Linda
Linda, tell me what's you gonna do?
Had a real bad dream last night honey
I dreamed, I dreamed, I dreamed, that we was through
You gonna put me down out and leave me
Or ya'all, break my former doll heart in two
Whaa-lin-looo
