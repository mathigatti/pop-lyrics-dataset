Why put this sadness inside of me 
Why be so matter-of-fact 
Why put this one bit of hope in me 
You sold me out and that's that 


I hope that you're having fun with me 
There's not much left to attack 
I hope that you're nearly done with me 
You sold me out and that's that 

All sold out I'd never seen 
A mind so tangled, a girl so strangled 
All sold out well I felt so green 
It was just like that 
I was put down flat 
I was sold out just like that 
Oh baby 

All sold out I'd never seen 
A mind so tangled, a girl so strangled 
All sold out well I felt so green 
It was just like that 
I was put down flat 
I was sold out just like that 

I missed the point of you doing it 
Your mind has just jumped the track 
I took a bit different view of it 
You sold me out and that's that 

Hey hey, that's that
