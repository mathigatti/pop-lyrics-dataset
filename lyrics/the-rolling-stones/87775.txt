All the way, all the way 
I miss your touch baby, yeah 
Like a thief in the night 
It can't be right... 
(Like a thief) 


I know where your place is 
And it's not with him 
I'm the one who is out here baby 
Out here, just looking in 
He ain't gonna like it at all 
No no, that's no good 
I know the feeling 
(Just you wait there in the dark) 
In the dark, baby 
Yeah, how his dog can bark 
Like a thief in the night 
Like a thief in the night 
Like a thief in the night 
I'm gonna steal what's mine 

Oh I'm gonna break the laws 
But I'll get through you door 
But you wait and see 
Yeah, I'm gonna get ya, get you free 
(Like a thief) 

I found out where he keeps you 
I've even been inside 
You check under your pillow baby 
You'll get the message 
If I see you at your window, well then I'll know 
No one can separate us 

Like a thief in the night 
Like a thief in the night 
Like a thief in the night 

Yeah, you can set me up 
You can turn me in 
Or burn me baby 
Well you're in my skin 
The only reason I'm breaking in 
I'm coming baby, I'm breaking in 

Like a thief in the night 
Come on, yeah, oh yeah 
Like a thief in the night 
Oh baby you know what I'm talking, come on 
You can call the police on me baby 
Set me up and then bust me 
Come on I dare you, come on, come on 
I'll take the drop for you 
Soften the blow baby, baby, baby 
You know what I mean 
Nothing I can do about it 
It's the power of it 
Come on, like a thief 

Like a thief in the night 
Like a thief in the night 
Like a thief in the night
