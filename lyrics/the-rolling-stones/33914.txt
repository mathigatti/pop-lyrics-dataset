I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction


'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try

I can't get no
I can't get no

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information

Supposed to drive my imagination
I can't get no
Oh, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction

'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try

I can't get no
I can't get no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And that man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
But he can't be a man, 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no
Oh, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try

I can't get no
I can't get no

When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me, baby, better come back later next week
'Cause you see I'm on losing streak

I can't get no
Oh, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no
I can't get no

I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction
No satisfaction
No satisfaction
I can't get no
