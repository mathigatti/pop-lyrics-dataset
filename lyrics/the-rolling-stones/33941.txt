Did you ever feel the pain
That He felt upon the cross
Did you ever feel the night
Tearing flesh that's all so soft
Did you ever touch the night
Do you ever count the cost
Do you hide away the fear
Put down paradise as lost


Yeah you're blinded by rainbows
Watching the wind blow
Blinded by rainbows
Do you dream at night
Do you sleep at night
I doubt it

Did you ever feel the blast
As the Semtex bomb goes off
Do you ever hear the screams
As the limbs are all torn off
Did you ever kiss the child
Did you sell his father short
Do you ever shed a tear
As the war drags on and on
Do you ever touch the night
Or is it just another job
Do you fear the final hours
Put down paradise as lost

Yeah you're blinded by rainbows
And faces in windows
Blinded by rainbows
Do you dream at night
Do you sleep at night
I doubt it

Do you ever fear the night
Could it be the war is lost
Do you fear the final hour
Do you kneel before the cross

Mmm you're blinded by rainbows
Then watching the wind blow
Blinded by rainbows
Do you dream at night
Do you scream at night
Do you smell the fear
Is your concious clear
Are you caked in sweat
Are your clothes all wet
Do you see the light
Is the end in sight
See the face of Christ
Enter paradise
I doubt it
