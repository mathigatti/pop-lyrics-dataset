No matter how she wants me
I'm not going nowhere
I'm gonna stick right here, babe
You know how much I care
So don't worry 'bout me baby
'Cause I'm right here at home
Oh baby, oh baby, we got a good thing goin'


You may talk all about me
And scandalize my name
But deep down inside me
I know I'm the only man
So don't worry 'bout me baby
'Cause I'm right here at home
Oh baby, oh baby, we got a good thing goin'

So maybe I knew her
Once upon a time
But that's all in the past babe
Baby let me know you're mine, all mine, all mine

No matter how she wants me
I'm not going nowhere
I'm gonna stick right here, babe
I know how much you care
So don't worry 'bout me baby
'Cause I'm right here at home
Oh baby, oh baby, we got a good thing goin'

Got a good thing goin' babe
We got a good thing goin'
That's what I said
We got a good thing goin'
Got a? One for ourselves
Got a thing goin' for ourselves
We got a pretty good thing goin'
