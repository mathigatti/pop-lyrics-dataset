I met him on a Monday and my heart stood still
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
Somebody told me that his name was Bill
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
Yeah, my heart stood still, yeah, his name was Bill
And when he walked me home, da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
I know what he was thinking when he caught my eye
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
He looked so quiet but, my oh my
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
Yeah, he caught my eye, yeah but my oh my
And when he walked me home, da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
He picked me at seven and he looked so fine
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
Someday soon I'm gonna make him mine
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
Yeah, he looked so fine, yeah I'll make him mine
And when he walked me home, da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
Da do ron ron ron, da do ron ron
