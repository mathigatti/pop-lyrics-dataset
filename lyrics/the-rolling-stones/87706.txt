Pretty beat up 
Pretty beat up 


Since you put me down 
Pretty beat up, pretty beat up 
Yeah since you left me lying around 
Pretty beat up, pretty beat up 
Since you 86-ed me, pretty beat up 
Never restitched me, pretty beat up 
My face is a mess, pretty beat up 
Yeah yeah you ought to see my face 
Pretty beat up, pretty beat up 
It's a mess, pretty beat up, pretty beat up 
You ought to see inside my heart 
Pretty beat up, pretty beat up 
I'm marked for life, pretty beat up 
I'm marked for life, pretty beat up 

Pretty beat up 
Pretty beat up 
Pretty beat up 

Pretty beat up 
Pretty beat up 
Pretty beat up 
Pretty beat up 

Pretty beat up 
Pretty beat up 
Pretty beat up 

Yeah I'm just like a battered baby 
Just left on the street, pretty beat up 
You ought to see the state, pretty beat up 
I've been cut with a razor, pretty beat up 
Don't you cut me up, don't you cut me up 

I'm pretty beat up 
Pretty beat up 
Pretty beat up 
Pretty beat up.......
