I live in an apartment on the ninety-ninth floor of my block
And I sit at home looking out the window
Imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy who's all dressed up like a Union Jack
And says, I've won five pounds if I have his kind of detergent pack


I say, hey (Hey)
You (You)
Get off of my cloud

(2x)
Hey (Hey)
You (You)
Get off of my cloud

Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby

The telephone is ringing
I say, "hi, it's me, who is there on the line?"
A voice says, "hi, hello, how are you?"
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine

He says, "it's three a.m., there's too much noise
Don't you people ever wanna go to bed?
Just 'cause you feel so good, do you have?
To drive me out of my head?"

I say, hey (Hey)
You (You)
Get off of my cloud

(2x)
Hey (Hey)
You (You)
Get off of my cloud

Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby

I was sick and tired, fed up with this
And decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around

I laid myself out, I was so tired
And I started to dream
In the morning the parking tickets were just
Like a flag stuck on my window screen

I say, hey (Hey)
You (You)
Get off of my cloud

(2x)
Hey (Hey)
You (You)
Get off of my cloud

Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby

I say, hey (Hey)
You (You)
Get off of my cloud

(2x)
Hey (Hey)
You (You)
Get off of my cloud

Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
