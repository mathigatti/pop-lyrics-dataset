Why does the sky turn grey ev'ry night
Sun rise again in time
Why do you think of the first girl you had
Some things just stick in your mind 


Why does the rain fall down on the earth
Why do the clouds keep cryin'
Why do you sleep curled up like a child
Some things just stick in your mind 

Why when the children grow up and leave
Still remember their nursery rhymes
Why must there be so much hate in their lives
Some things just stick in their minds
