Little Indian girl, where is your mama? 
Little Indian girl, where is your papa? 
He's fighting in the war in the streets of Masaya 
All the children were dead, except for the girl who said 
"Please Mister Gringo, please find my father" 
Lesson number one that you learn while you're young 
Life just goes on and on getting harder and harder 
Little Indian girl, from Nueva, Granada 
Little Indian girl, from Nueva, Granada 
Yes, I saw them today. It's a sight I would say 
They're shooting down planes with their M-16 and with laughter 


Ma says there's no food, there's nothing left in the larder 
Last piece of meat was eaten by the soldiers that raped her 
All the children were dead, except for the girl who said 
"Please Mister Gringo, please find my father" 
Lesson number one that you learn while you're young 
Life just goes on and on getting harder and harder 
Life just goes on and on getting harder and harder 
Little Indian girl, from Nueva, Granada 
Yes, I saw them today. It's a sight I would say 
They're shooting down planes with their M-16 and with laughter 

[spoken] 
Mr. Gringo, my father he ain't no Che Guevara 
And he's fighting the war on the streets of Masaya 
Little Indian girl where is your father? 
Little Indian girl where is your momma? 
They're fighting for Mr. Castro in the streets of Angola
