I wanna tell you 'bout a dance 
that's goin' around 
everybody's doin' it 
from the grownups down 
Don't move your head 
don't move your hands 
don't move your lips 
just shake your hips 
Do the hip shake, babe 
do the hip shake, babe 
shake your hip, babe 
shake your hip, babe 


What you don't know 
don't be afraid 
just listen to me 
and do what I say 
Don't move your head 
don't move your hands 
don't move your lips 
just shake your hips 
Do the hip shake, babe 
do the hip shake, babe 
shake your hip, babe 
shake your hip, babe 
well ain't that easy 

Well, I met a little girl 
in a country town 
she said, "What do you know 
there's Slim Harpo!" 
Didn't move her head 
didn't move her hands 
didn't move her lips 
just shook her hips 
Do the hip shake, babe 
do the hip shake, babe 
shake your hip, babe 
shake your hip, babe 
well ain't that easy
