The hand of fate is on me now 
It pick me up and knock me down 
I'm on the run, I'm prison bound 
The hand of fate is heavy now 
I killed a man, I'm highway bound 
The wheel of fortune keeps turning round 
Turning round, turning round 
I should have known it was a one horse town 


My sweet girl was once his wife 
He had papers the judge had signed 
The wind blew hard, it was stormy night 
He shot me once, but I shot him twice 
The hand of fate is on me now 
It pick me up and it kicked me right down 
Kicked me right down 
Kicked me right down 

I had to save her life 
Yeah, I gunned him twice 
Yeah, and I watched him die, watch out boy 
Yeah, I watched him die 

He was a barroom man, the violent kind 
He had no love for that gal of mine 
Then one day in a drinking bout 
He swore he'd throw me right of town 
The hand of fate is on me now 
I shot that man I put him underground 
I put him underground 
Yes I did 

I'm on the run, I hear the hounds 
My luck is up, my chips are down 
So goodbye baby, so long now 
Wish me luck, I'm going to need it child 
The hand of fate is on me now 
Yeah it's too late 
Too late baby, too late now 
The hand of fate is on me now 
The hand of fate is heavy now 

It pick you up and knock you down
