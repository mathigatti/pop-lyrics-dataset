Well I'm a mix-up, mix-up
Baby and I'm a yellin'
I wanna dance
And I don't know
I'm a little mixed up
Talkin' about you 


Well I'm a little mixed up
And I don't know what to do 

Well I know I'm callin' Daisy
And I borrow some cloths
I'm OK and talkin' to you
And I mix it up
Talkin' about you
Well I'm a little mixed up
And, I don't know what to do 

Well I'm a mix...
Tell me baby and I'm a yellin'
I gonna dance and I don't know 

I'm a little mixed up
Talkin' 'bout you 

Well I'm a little mixed-up ba-by
I don't know what to do 

Well I'm mixed-up baby
I don't know... I'm a little mixed up (faint) 

I'm a little mixed up
Talkin' 'bout you 

Well I'm a little mixed-up
And I don't know, what to do 

Well a man come baby and I'm a mad at you
Well I'm gonna tell you what I'm a gonna do 

I'm a little mixed up
Yellin' about you 

Well I'm a little mixed-up
And I don't know what to do
