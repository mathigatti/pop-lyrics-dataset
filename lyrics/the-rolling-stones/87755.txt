Just a few days and you'll be back in your school 
I'll be sitting around by the swimming pool 
You'll be studying history and you'll be down the gym 
And I'll be down the pub, probably playing pool and drinking 
It's over now, it's a summer romance and it's through 
It's over now, it's a summer romance and it's through 


Just a few days and you'll be back in your class 
Sucking up the teacher and trying to get an 'a' pass 
Trying to hide your make-up and you're trying to flash your legs 
Yeh, no sympathy from your spotty friends 
It's over now, it's a summer romance and it's through 
It's over now, it's a summer romance and it's through 

I can't help myself, help it if I'm older than you 
I can't help myself, help it if I'm older than you 
Over, over, summer romance 
I need money so much, I need money so bad 
And I can't be your mum, don't want to be your dad 
I'm a serious man, I got serious lusts 
Gonna have to do away with this greasy kid stuff 
It's over now, it's a summer romance and it's through 
I can't help myself, I can't help it if I'm older than you 
It's over, over, summer romance 
It's just a summer romance, a summer romance, and it's through 
It's over now, it's a summer romance and it's through
Over, over, summer romance 
Over, over, summer romance
It's Over, over, summer romance
