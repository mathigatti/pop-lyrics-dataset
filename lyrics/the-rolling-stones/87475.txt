As you poured out the drinks for me
I felt your hooks sink right into me
And I knew you were my destiny
And I thought you'd get the best of me


On the way down to Mexico
As I danced in your rodeo
You say poverty is picturesque
As you dragged your nails across my chest

You're so cold
You're so cruel
I'm your man
Not your fool

Are you already over me
Are you already over me
Are you already over me
What a fool I've been

In the first flush of ecstacy
As you lay naked next to me
While our love put the dawn to flight
I just ignore all those warning lights

Cause when you laugh
I just cry
When you left
I just died

Are you already over me
Are you already over me
Are you already sick me
What a fool I've been

Hard to hold on
To a love divine
I'm kneeling in a corner
Praying to your shrine

I've been hurt
So confused
I've been burned
I've been bruised

Are you already over me
Are you already over me
Are you already sick of me
Are you already over me
Are you already over me
Are you already tired of me
Are you already over me
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
