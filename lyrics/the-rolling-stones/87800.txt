I wanna hold
I wanna hold you
Hold you baby close to me


I hope you find it funny
That I got no money
But if you stick with me
You're gonna get some love for free

I wanna hold you
I gotta hold you
Hold you baby close to me
Close to me

I wanna hold you
I gotta hold you
Hold you baby close to me, yeah

This time it's not for fun
That you're the only one
Why should I say to you?

I wanna hold you
I gotta hold you
Hold you baby close to me

I wanna hold you
I gotta hold you
Hold you baby close to me

But if you let me smile
But if you know I lie
But after all you gave
I'll be your lover
I'll be your slave

I wanna hold you yeah
I wanna hold you
Hold you baby close to me

I wanna hold you
I gotta gold you
Hold you baby close to me

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

I wanna hold you
I gotta hold you
Hold you baby close to me

I wanna hold you
I gotta hold you
Hold you baby close to me
