Sittin' in my bedroom late last night 
Got into bed and turned out the light 
Decided to call my baby on the telephone 
All I got was an engaged tone 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 


Talkin' so long she upset my mind 
Why is she talkin' such a long time? 
Maybe she's sleeping, maybe she's ill 
Phone's disconnected, unpaid bill 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 

Don't wanna see her, afraid of what I'd find 
Tired of letting her upset me all the time 
Back into bed started reading my books 
Take my phone right off of the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 
It's off the hook 

It's off the hook 
(repeat and fade)
