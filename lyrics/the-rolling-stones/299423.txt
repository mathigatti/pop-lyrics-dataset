In your high school photo
You looked so young and naive
Now i heard you got a nickname
The lady of the leash


Well i find you on a midnight shift
I bet you had your fair share of stiffs
There were onerous odours
I´ve got to admit

´cause you´re a dangerous, dangerous
A dangerous beauty
So plainfully plain to us
You´re doing your duty

Who you got there in that hood, you look so fancy in those photographs
With your rubber gloves on you´re a favourite with the chiefs of staff

You´re doing such a wonderful job
You´re a natural at working with dogs
Keeping everyone awake at night
With a touch of the prods

Well you´re a dangerous, dangerous
A dangerous beauty
Yeah, disdainfully, painfully
A bit of booty, yeah

You´re a dangerous, dangerous
A dangerous beauty
Beauty

Well you´re a dangerous, dangerous
A dangerous beauty
If i was your captain
I´d put you soon to bed

What i say
Yeah everybody
Beauty
Everybody now, yeah

Are you all tied up, put in a box
Yeah, dangerous
Giving them electric shocks
I´ve seen the gloves coming off
Dangerous
If looks could be killing, i bet you shoot me now
