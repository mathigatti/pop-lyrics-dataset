Do it, do it, do it, do it 
Don't wanna be your slave 


Twenty four hours a day 
Hey, why don't you go down to the supermarket 
Get something to eat, steal something of the shelves 
Pass by the liquor store 
Be back about quarter to twelve 

Don't want to be your slave 
Baby go, baby go, baby go 
Do it yeah
