I'm gonna leave you woman
Before I commit a crime
I'm gonna leave you woman
Before I commit a crime
You tried so hard to kill me
Woman it just was not my time


You put poison in my coffee
Instead of milk or cream
You put poison in my coffee
Instead of milk or cream
You're the meanest woman
That I ever seen

You mixed my drinks
With a can of Red Devil lye
You mixed my drinks
With a can of Red Devil lye
Then you sit back and watch me
Hopin that I would die
