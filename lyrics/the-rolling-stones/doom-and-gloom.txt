I had a dream last night
That I was piloting a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies
But I come out on top
What's it all about?
It just reflects my mood


Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt
All I hear is doooom and gloom
And all is darkness in my room
Through the light your face I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?

Lost all that treasure in an overseas war
It just goes to show you don't get what you paid for
Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor
Put my feet up on the couch
And lock all the doors
Hear a funky noise
That's the tightening of the screws

I'm feeling kind of hurt
Sitting in the dirt
All I hear is doom and gloom
But when those drums go boom boom boom
Through the night your face I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Yeah
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Oh, yeah

Fracking deep for oil
But there's nothing in the sump
There's kids all picking
Ar the garbage dumb
I'm running out of water
So I better prime the pump
I'm trying to stay sober
But I end up drunk

We'll be eating dirt
Living on the side of the road
There's some food for thought
Kind of makes your head explode
Feeling kind of hurt
Yeah

But all I hear is doooom and gloom
And all is darkness in my room
Through the night your face I see
Baby, come on
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Yeah
Yeah
Baby, won't you dance with me?
I'm feeling kind of hurt
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Yeah
Come on
Baby, won't you dance with me?
I'm sitting in the dirt
Baby, won't you dance with me?
