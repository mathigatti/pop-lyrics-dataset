Will you, will you, will you be my lover tonight? 
Will you, will you, will you hold me tight? 
I've been waiting such a long long time 
To here you say that you'll be mine 
Will you, will you, will you be my lover tonight? 


Tell me, tell me, tell me, you want me too 
Tell me, tell me, tell me, I need you 
When I saw you over there 
What could I do but stand and stare 
Will you, will you, will you be my lover tonight? 

I don't pretend to know the reason why 
I love you so don't ever make me cry, no no no no no 

Give me, give me, give me your whole heart 
Promise, promise, promise when we're apart 
You'll be faithful, you'll be true 
Just remember, I love you 
Will you, will you, will you be my lover tonight 

I'll be faithful, I'll be true 
Just remember, I love you 
Will you, will you, will you be my lover tonight?
