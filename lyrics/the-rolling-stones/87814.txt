I wanna be on top 
Forever on the up 
And damn the competition 
I never play it fair 
I never turn a hair 
Just like the politicians 
I wrap my conscience up 
I wanna win that cup 
And get my money baby 
But back in the dressing room 
The other side is weeping 
And we're winning, winning ugly 
And we're winning, winning ugly 


And we're heading for the heartbreak 
Heading for the blues 
We're heading for the heartbreak 
Heading for the blues 
And we're winning, winning ugly 
And we're winning, winning ugly 

I will not act unkind 
I will not be so blind 
I will not walk so proud 
Come down from off my cloud 
How can I live my life this way? 
Beauty is staring me in the face 
Ain't that the truth 
Ain't that the truth 
Hold on, come on girl 
Hold on 

Look out for number one 
My country right or wrong 
Let the devil take the hindmost 
I was brought up to cheat 
So long as the referee wasn't looking 
I'm never wrong at all 
I always fight the call 
I don't admit it 
But back in the dressing room 
The other side is screaming 
And we're winning, winning ugly, yeah 
And we're winning, winning ugly 

And we're heading for the heartbreak 
Heading for the blues 
We're heading for the heartbreak 
Heading for the blues 
And we're winning, winning ugly 

I will not act unkind 
I will not be so blind 
I will not walk so proud 
Come down from off my cloud 
How can I live my life this way 
Beauty is staring me in the face 
Ain't that the truth 
Ain't that the truth? 
Come on baby, come on girl 
A little bit louder 
Walk a little bit prouder 

And we're winning, winning ugly, that's alright 
And we're winning, winning ugly, come on girl 
And we're winning, winning ugly 
And we're winning, winning ugly, winning ugly
