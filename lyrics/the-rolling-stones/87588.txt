Won't you come on and call my name 
Can't you see I'm a only one 
Whoa when you call my name
Yeah I'm the lonely one
Yeah when you come along
We go for a drive 
Yeah I'm a lonely boy
Yeah going by
Every time I get to shell it down
Every time that you put me down 
Can't you see by now, I'm a highway child
Can't you see by now, I'm a highway child


Whooo!

Well when you call my name
Who should you hypnotize
Yeah when you scratch my lights out 
Yeah I feel it's all right
Yeah when you scratch me babe
Then you find me up peak
Yeah make me feel so good
Your plan would never look complete
Won't you come in and settle down
Can't you see I'm a hauling bound
Can't you see by now, I'm a highway bound
Can't you see by now, I'm a highway bound

Yeah get it!

Yeah!
Yeah baby when you call my name
You can see I'm the only one
Hey I'm in misery
Little mama I'm the lonely one
Yeah when you promise me
Yeah when you promise I 
Yeah I'm in misery
I'm a highway child
If you promise to call my name
I can promise to settle down
Can't you see by now, I'm a highway child
Can't you see by now, I'm a highway child
