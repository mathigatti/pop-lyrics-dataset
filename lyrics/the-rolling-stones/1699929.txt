When I'm looking out my window baby
And I'm standing by my door
Have you ever had the feeling baby
That you've been here before


When you're riding motorcycle baby
In your graveyard world
Have you ever had the feeling baby
That you've been here before

Honey I've been lying
Honey I've been jiving
Honey I've been signifying
Whoa, whoa, whoa

When you're lyring on the ceiling baby
And I'm gazing on your floor
Have you ever had the feeling baby
That you've been here before

Honey I've been lying
Honey I've been jiving
And I ain't signifying
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
