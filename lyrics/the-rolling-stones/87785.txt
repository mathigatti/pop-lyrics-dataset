Baby, don't get too tight with me 
Yes, you're far too tight for me 


I got your messages 
And how can I resist 
But if you come around 
Don't slap the cuffs upon my wrist 

Baby you're tight for me 
(I warn you) yeah 
Far too tight for me 
Yeah 

Untie those sheep shanks, yes 
And all those fancy knots 
I'm not Houdini, honey 
C'mon now and loosen up 

(Tight) 
(Too tight) 
(Too tight) 
(Too tight) 

Yeah, don't try to reel me in 
With all those charm school looks 
I've seen it all a thousand times 
I sung that song, I wrote that fucking book 

Do yourself a favor now 
Don't drive me 'round the block 
Let's split another bottle, now 
Let's take a hit, loosen up 

Don't get too tight on me 
'Cause I'm, I'm bound so tight I can't breathe 

We'll watch the sun go down 
Upon the swollen sea 
Aahhhhhh 
If you try to chain me up 
I'll vanish like a broken dream 

Don't get so tight 
Don't get so tight 
Too tight
