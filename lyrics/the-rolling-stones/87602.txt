I think I decided to get out of the rain
I wasn't thinkin' of your stayin'
But when you pulled me off the door-step
Somehow I knew I had the pain again
Somehow I knew I need the pain, yes!
I wasn't thinkin' cause the pa-in 


'Cause I love too much
I can't help it if I love you too much
What did-you-do to make me love you too much?
I can't help it if I love you
I can't help it if I love you 

Call it novelty fascination
I call it nasty education
Friends of mine, they'll snicker and sneer
Their all laughin' while I cry in my beer
I never give-in
I get scared is that I never give-in 

'Cause I love too much
I can't help it 'cause I love you too much
What did you get to make me love you too much?
I can't help it if I love you
I can't help it if I love you 

I need no help to make me a fool
Did it myself and it ... I'm in here thinkin' about startin' up school
Ah. . .you know
First believe it can happen to you
And when it does you know as much as I do 

I love you too much
I can't help it 'cause I love you too much
What did you get to make me love you too much?
I can't help it 'cause I love you
I can't help it if I love you
I can't help it if I love you
