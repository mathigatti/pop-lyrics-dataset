My friends all told me
And as a boy was I told
About all you baby´s
I love her so
Tell me baby
Tell me darling
How many times?



Jump up and tell me
Woah tell the truth
I didn´t sleep last night baby
I was that kind of fool
Tell me baby
Oh darling
How many times?

I called this morning
About half past four
I heard somebody 
Run out your back door
Tell me baby
Tell me darling
How many times?

You´re bound to tell me
Woah Tell the truth
Before I get Mad baby
And all is through
Tell me baby
Tell me darling
How many times
