There's something I should tell you
Why don't you sit there in that chair
You're lookin' good today, I love the way
Your comb's tucked in your hair


My cards are on the table
But the drinks are all run out
There's been some others in this room with me
Well, really quite a crowd.

It's hard to break it gently
But I really thought it through.
I don't think there's much future here
For me and you, me and you.

I've been following the river
'Till it joins hands with the sea
I've been thinking of you all day
'Cause you always saw the best in me
(Always saw the best in me)

You'll probably forget me
And I'll fade back in the fog
Just a face disappearing without trace
I'll be lost, I'll be lost.

One day I'll hear some laughter
In an out-of-town cafe.
I'll be reaching for your lover
I'll be callin' out your name, callin' out your name

I've been following the river
'Till it joins hands with the sea
I've been thinking of you all the time
'Cause you always saw the best in me

I've been following the river
'Till it spills out in the sea
And I've been thinkin' of you all day
'Cause you always saw the best in me
(Always saw the best in me!)

I've been following the river
'Till it joins hands with sea
I've been thinkin of you, I've been dreamin' all about you
'Cause you always saw the best in me

I've been following the river
'Till it joins hands with the sea
I've been thinking of you all day
'Cause you always saw the best in me.
