Now if you wanna hear some boogie like I'm gonna play 
It's just an old piano and a knockout bass 
The drummer's man's a cat they call Charlie McCoy 
You know, remember that rubber-legged boy? 
Mama cookin' chicken fried and bacon grease 
Come on along boys it's just down the road apiece 


Well there's a place you really get your kicks 
It's open every night about twelve to six 
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill 
And shove and sting like an old steam drill 
Come on along you can lose your lead 
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece 

Well there's a place you really get your kicks 
It's open every night about twelve to six 
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill 
And shove and sting like an old steam drill 
Come on along you can lose your lead 
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece
