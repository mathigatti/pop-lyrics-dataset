In another land where the breeze and the 
Trees and flowers were blue 
I stood and held your hand. 
And the grass grew high and the feathers floated by 
I stood and held your hand. 
And nobody else's hand will ever do 
Nobody else will do 
Then I awoke 
Was this some kind of joke 
Much to my surprise 
I opened my eyes. 


We walked across the sand and the sea and 
The sky and the castles were blue. 
I stood and held your hand. 
And the spray flew high and the feathers floated by 
I stood and held your hand. 
And nobody else's hand will ever do 
Nobody else will do 
Then I awoke 
Was this some kind of joke 
Much to my surprise 
When I opened my eyes. 

We heard the trumpets blow and the sky 
Turned red when I accidently said 
That I didn't know how I came to be here 
Not fast asleep in bed. 
I stood and held your hand. 
And nobody else's hand will ever do 
Nobody else's hand 
Then I awoke 
Was this some kind of joke 
I opened my eyes. 
Much to my surprise.
