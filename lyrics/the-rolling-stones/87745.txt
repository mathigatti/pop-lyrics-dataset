Well luck is expensive and freedom comes cheap
When love's on the menu, I don't drink so deep
Well I was just out there to have me some fun
But it's easier said than done


Mmm... we're standing so far apart
We had a string of false starts
I can't seem to stop it now
It grows and it grows and it grows

Stealing my heart, stealing my heart, stealing my heart
Yeah

My cards are on the table, you can look up my sleeves
You say you're honest but love is for thieves
Well I was just out there, chaste as a nun
But it's easier said than done

Yeah, like a shot in the dark
You shoot me right out the park
I can't seem to stop it
It grows and it grows and it grows

Stealing my heart, stealing my heart, stealing my heart
Yeah

Well you've got no money and I've got no charm
While you're in a panic, I stay so calm
Well I was just out there to have me some fun
But it's easier said than done

Yes, yeah, I though I was shot open
Yeah, you were a walk in the park
I though you were dinner, but you were the shark

Yeah, stealing, stealing my heart, yeah
Stealing, stealing, stealing, stealing my heart
Stealing my, stealing my heart
Stealing my heart, yeah 
Come on, come one
Stealing my heart....
