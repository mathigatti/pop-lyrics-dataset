She's my little rock 'n' roll 
She's my little rock 'n' roll 
The heat's raiding, the tracks is fading 
Joints rocking could be anytime at all 
But the bitch keeps bitching 
Snitcher keeps snitching 
Dropping names and telephone numbers and all 


She's my little rock 'n' roll 
She's my little rock 'n' roll 

The scars healing 
But the dealers squealing 
The pool's in but the patio ain't dry 
Well the sense is sensing 
That the juice keeps pumping and I know why 

She's my little rock 'n' roll 
My tits and ass with soul baby 
She's my little rock 'n' roll 
She's my little rock 'n' roll 
You got to shock them, show them 
She's my little rock 'n' roll 
Shock, shock, shock, oh my, my, my 

Well the sense is sensing 
That the juice keeps pumping and I know why 
The bitch keeps bitching 
Snitcher keeps snitching 
Dropping names and telephone numbers and all 

She's my little rock 'n' roll 
My tits and ass with soul baby 
She's my little rock 'n' roll 
You got to shock them, show them 
She's my little rock 'n' roll 
She got a feeling to know, baby 
She's my little rock 'n' roll 
Ah, the little bitch got soul
