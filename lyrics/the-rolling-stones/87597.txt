You offer me 
All your love and sympathy 
Sweet affection baby 
It's killing me 


'Cause baby baby 
Can't you see 
How could I stop 
Once I start baby 

How could I stop once I start 
How could I stop 
Yeah yeah 
How could I stop once I start 

You look at me 
But I don't know what you see 
A reflection baby 
Of what I want to be 

I see your face 
And I want to roll with it 

But how could I stop 
Baby how could I stop 
How could I stop 
Stop it, stop it 

If I could, I'd take you all the way 
Baby, baby listen what I say 
There's even some things 
That I just would not pay 

'Cause how could I stop 
If I start babe 
How could I stop 
If I start 
Start with you 

How could I stop 
If I start, baby 
How could I stop 
If I start with you 

It's too easy to lay here at your feet 
I couldn't take the heat 
There's somewhere else 
Maybe you should go 
Baby maybe baby just a further down the road 
How could I stop 
If I start with you baby 
How could I stop 
How could I stop 
Once I start 

You tell me baby 
Once I've started with you 
How could I stop 
Once I start 

Stop, stop, stop
