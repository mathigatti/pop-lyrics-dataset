Cook, cook, cook every mornin'
Cook, cook, cook through all the night
Work work work in the evening boy
And dance, and it will work out alright
Work on me, baby come- a- close
You cook, cook, cook all night 


Bad, bad, bad loving baby
And I lay out my love alright
And I ain't have spoiled sod
And I ani't must to imagine
And I'll give it up alright

Love, love, love and a cook cook for us every night

Cook, cook, cook till the mornin'
Cook, cook, cook till the night
Work, work, work in the kitchen
And it will make 'em all come out alright
Well I don't want to live like a poor man
And work, work, work every night

Oh, na, oh no, no, no
Work, work, work every mornin'
And the same thing every night
I just long for the morning 
When I'm cooked cooked cooked every night
