The po-lice in New York City
They chased a boy right through the park
In a case of mistaken identity
They put a bullet through his heart


Heart breakers with your forty four
I wanna tear your world apart
You heart breaker with your forty four
I wanna tear your world a part

A ten year old girl on a street corner
Sticking needles in her arm
She died in the dirt of an alleyway
Her mother said she had no chance, no chance!
Heart breaker, heart breaker
She stuck the pins right in her heart
Heart breaker, a pain maker
Stole the love right out of you heart

Oh yeah (doo, doo doo doo doo)
Oh yeah (doo doo doo, doo doo)
I wanna tear that word apart

Oh yeah (doo, doo doo doo doo)
Oh yeah (doo doo doo doo doo)
I wanna tear that word apart

Heart breaker, heart breaker
You stole the love right out of my heart
Heart breaker, heart breaker
I wanna tear your world apart

Heart breaker, heart breaker
Stole the love right out, stole the love right out

Doo, doo doo doo doo doo
Ah yeah, you shot the kid, he had no chance
Doo doo, doo doo do
Ah yeah, Ah yeah, you stuck pins right in her heart
Doo doo, doo doo do
You heart breaker, I wanna tear your world apart
Doo doo, doo doo do
