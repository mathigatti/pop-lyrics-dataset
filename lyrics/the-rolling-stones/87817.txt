Sometimes I wonder why you do these things to me
Sometimes I worry girl that you ain't in love with me
Sometimes I stay out late, yeah I'm having fun
Yes, I guess you know by now that you ain't the only one
Baby, sweet things that you promised me baby
Seemed to go up in smoke
Yeah, vanish like a dream
I wonder why you do these things to me


Cause I'm worried
I just can't seem to find my way, baby

Ooh, the nights I spent just waiting on the sun
Just like your burned out cigarette
You threw away my love
Why did you do that baby
I wonder why, why you do these things to me

I'm worried
Lord, I'll find out anyway
Sure going to find myself a girl someday
Till then I'm worried
Yeah, I just can't seem to find my way

Yeah, I'm a hard working man
When did I ever do you wrong?
Yeah, I get all my money baby
Bring it, bring it all home
Yeah, I'm telling the truth

Sweet things, sweet things that you promised me
Well I'm worried, I just can't seem to find my way, baby

I'm worried about you
I'm worried about you
Tell you something now
Worried 'bout you, child
Worried 'bout you, woman

Yeah, I'm worried
Lord, I'll find out anyway
Sure as Hell I'm going to find that girl someday
Till then I'm worried
Lord, I just can't seem to find my way
