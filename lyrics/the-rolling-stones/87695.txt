You fell out of the clear blue sky 
To the darkness below 
The smell of your flesh excites me 
My blood starts to flow 
So help me God 


You burst in in a blaze of light 
You unzippered the dark 
One kiss took my breath away 
One look lights up the stars 
And it's it's one hit to the body 
It comes straight from the heart 
One hit to the body 
Sure went straight to the mark 
So help me God 

It's one shot when you love me 
One shot when you leave me 
I don't need no security 
I just need some peace 
And it's one hit to the body 
It comes straight from the heart 
One voice calls out my name 
It sure went straight to the mark 

One punch and you knocked me down 
Tore my defenses apart 
One round took me out of the game 
You did me some permanent harm 
It took just one hit 
It took just one hit 
It ain't enough for me 
It ain't enough for me 
It ain't enough for me 
It's hurting me baby 

Oh your love is a sweet addiction 
I can't clean you out of my veins 
It's a life long addiction 
That has damaged my brain 
It took just one hit to the body 
To tear my defenses apart 
One hit to the body 
Sure went straight to the mark 
One hit to the body 
And it comes straight from the heart 
One hit to the body 
To the body, to the body 
Come straight from the heart 

One hit to the body 
And it comes straight from the heart 

One hit to the body 
And it comes straight from the heart 
That's all it took, that's all it took 
So help me so help me so help me God 
So help me so help me so help me God 

One hit to the body 
And it comes straight from the heart 
One hit to the body 
And it comes straight from the heart
