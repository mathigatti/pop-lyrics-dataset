Lord I swear the perfume you wear 
Was made out of turnip greens 
And everytime I kiss you girl 
It tastes like pork and beans 
Even though you're wearin' them 
Citified high heels 
I can tell by your giant step 
You been walkin' through the cotton fields 
Oh, you're so down home girl 


Everytime you monkey child 
You take my breath away 
And everytime you move like that 
I gotta get down and pray 
Don't you know that dress of yours 
Was made out of fiberglass 
And everytime you move like that 
I gotta go to Sunday mass 
Oh, you're so down home girl 

Oh, you're so down home girl 

I'm gonna take you to the muddy river 
And push you in 
Just to watch the water roll on 
Down your velvet skin 
I'm gonna take you back to New Orleans 
Down in Dixieland 
I'm gonna watch you do the second line 
With an umbrella in your hand 
Oh, you're so down home girl 

I'm with ya baby 
You're so down home 
Ow! Yeah, too much 
Outta sight 
You're so down home girl
