Well you've grown up all wrong 
Well you've grown up all wrong 
You come on too strong 
Well you've grown up all wrong 
Well you were easy to fool, when you were in school, but 
You've grown up all wrong 


Well you've grown up on me 
Well you've grown up on me 
Don't believe what I see 
Well you've grown up on me 
Well you look so sweet when you're in your jeans, but 
You've grown up on me 

Well you've grown up too fast 
Well you've grown up too fast 
Don't forget about the past 
Girl, you've grown up too fast 
Well you won't be a fool, but I'm through with you 
Well you've grown up too fast 
Well you've grown up too fast
