When your baby leaves you all alone 
And nobody call you on the phone 
Doncha feel like crying 
Doncha feel like crying like crying like crying 
C'mon baby, cry to me 


When you're all alone in your lonely room 
And there's nothing but the smell of her perfume 
Doncha feel like crying 
Doncha feel like crying like crying like crying 
C'mon baby, (c'mon) cry to me 

Nothing could be sadder than a glass of wine alone 
Loneliness loneliness, it just a waste of your time 
But you don't ever you don't ever have to walk alone 
You see, so c'mon take my hand 
C'mon walk with me 

When you're waiting for a voice to come 
In the night there is no one 
Doncha feel like crying 
Doncha feel like crying like crying like crying 
C'mon baby, cry to me 

C'mon baby, that's right cry to me 
Yes, I want you to come on baby 
C'mon c'mon cry to me 
I want you to c'mon baby 
C'mon c'mon and cry to me 
Yeah c'mon baby c'mon I want you to cry cry cry to me 
Yeah I want you to cry cry cry cry cry cry cry 
I want you to cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry...
