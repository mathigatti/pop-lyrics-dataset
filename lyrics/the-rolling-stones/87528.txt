Prince or pauper, beggar man or thing 
Play the game with every blow you bring 
Dandelion don't tell no lies 
Dandelion will make you wise 
Tell me if she laughs or cries 
Blow away dandelion 


One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four o'clock, five 
Dandelions don't care about the time 
Dandelion don't tell no lies 
Dandelion will make you wise 
Tell me if she laughs or cries 
Blow away dandelion, blow away dandelion 

Tho' you're older now its just the same 
You can play the dandelion game 
When you're finished with your childlike prayers 
Well, you know you should wear it 

Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailors lives 
Rich man, poor man, beautiful, daughters wives 
Dandelion don't tell no lies 
Dandelion will make you wise 
Tell me if she laughs or cries 
Blow away dandelion, blow away dandelion 

Little girls and boys come out to play, yes
Bring your dandelions to blow away 
Dandelion don't tell no lies 
Dandelion will make you wise 
Tell me if she laughs or cries 
Blow away dandelion, blow away dandelion 
Blow away dandelion
Blow away dandelion
Blow away dandelion
Dandelion
