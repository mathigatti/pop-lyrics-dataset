Here you stand before me
Waiting to be kissed
You´re a beauty, such a cutie
How could I resist


It´s been a month of Sundays
Since we last had spoke
So much water, you get dollars
I fell out of the boat

Oh no, not you again
Fucking up my life
It was bad the first time
I can´t stand it twice

Oh no, not you again
I can´t stand your face
Once bitten, twice shy
Get me out of the race

The setting´s so romantic
Love is in the air
All is perfect but I´m allergic
To your business stares

You look so cool and tempting
In your couture dress
You´re addictive, as predicted
I´m nervous, I confess

Oh no, not you again
Mashing up my life
It was bad the first time, yeah
You had me in a vice

Oh no, not you again
I hear ya and I shout
It was bad the first time around
When you turned me inside out

Everybody´s talking
Showing up their wits
The moon is yellow but I´m like jello
Staring down your tits

My mind flashes forward
I feel it flashing back
I still dreaming and I´m screaming
"Get me off the rack!"

Oh no, not you again
I can´t stand the pain
I was burned the first time, yeah
I can´t deal it again

Oh no, not you again
Messing up my life, yeah
Once bitten, twice shy
But I can´t do it twice

Oh no, not you again
Fucking up my life
It was bad first time around
I better take my own advice

Oh no, oh no, oh nooooo!
