I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man


You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you might find
You get what you need!

An' I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing: We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't, we're gonna blow a fifty amp fuse

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find
You get what you need!
(Oh, babe, yeah!)

I went down to the Chelsea Drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And, man, did he look pretty ill

We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavour, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
And he said one word to me, and that was: Dead
I said to him

You can't always get what you want, no!
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you just might find
You get what you need!
Oh yeah! Whoo

You get what you need
Yeah,  oh baby, oh yeah!

I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well, I could tell by her blood-stained hands
Say

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you just might find
You just might find
You get what you need!
Oh yeah!

Ah you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You cant always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find
You just might find
You get what you need!
