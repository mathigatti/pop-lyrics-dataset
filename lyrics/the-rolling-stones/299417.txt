I hear a preacher
On the corner
Ranting like a crazy man
He says there´s trouble
Trouble's a coming
I can read it like the back of my hand


I see love
I see misery
Jammin side by side on the stage
In the wind some mournful melody
I can read it like the back of my hand

The back of my hand..... Oh yeah

Oh yeah....

I see dreams
I see visions
Images I don´t understand
I see Goyas 
And paranoias
I can read it like the back of my hand

Well, read it like the back of my hand
Oh yeah, wow yeah
Wow yeah
Read it like the back of my hand
