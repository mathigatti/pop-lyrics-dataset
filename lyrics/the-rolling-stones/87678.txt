The way she held my eyes
Said "Ain't nobody take the misty road"


I'm gonna try it sometime
Even if I'm going away

And she take you down by the waist
On the way to find the misty road

She never said that with her eyes
She said "Don't you understand"
"I'm tempted but yeah if I find the road, I'm gonna ride"

Ooooh, oooh, ooh, aah (repeat)

The way she held me tight
I knew all right
In just a minute I'd be galloping away down the misty road

And jump

Oooh.....

And jump, and jump, and . . . 

The way she held me tight
Its a brilliant moonlight
I'd always thought that everybody was kicking us down the moonlight hill

We had heroin and booze
Those assholes that run us in
Said its a locked up case

Hey baby

Oooh...
