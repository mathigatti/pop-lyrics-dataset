I'm just your fool, can't help myself
I love you baby, and no one else
I ain't crazy, you are my baby
I'm just your fool


I'm just your fool, I must confess
To still love you baby, and take your mess
I ain't lyin', no use a jivin'
I'm just your fool

You must be tryin' to drive me crazy
Treatin' me the way you do
I ask you please have mercy baby
Let me be, happy too

If you gonna leave me, for someone new
Gonna buy me a shotgun, shoot it at you
I ain't lyin', no use a jivin'
I'm just your fool

I'm just your fool, can't help myself
I love you baby, and no one else
I ain't crazy, you are my baby
I'm just your fool
