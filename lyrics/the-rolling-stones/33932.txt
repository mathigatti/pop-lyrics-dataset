Well, baby use to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turning, now her turn to cry


Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Well, she used to run around with ev'ry man in town
Spent all my money playing a highclass game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
The tables turning now, her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Well, I used to wake 'the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I gotten worried she could ease my aching head
But now she's here and there with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
