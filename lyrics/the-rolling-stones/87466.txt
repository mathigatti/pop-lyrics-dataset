I know I love you baby 
I know I love you baby
I know I love you baby
But you don't even know my name


Yeah listen to me baby, what I say is right,
I could leave home in the morning baby
I won't stay out all night.
Ain't that loving you baby 
Ain't that loving you baby
Ain't that loving you baby
But you don't even know my name

Yeah listen to me baby, tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna find out if my baby's all right
And come home to you
Ain't that loving you baby 
Ain't that loving you baby
Ain't that loving you baby
But you don't even know my name

Well baby, you kill me baby, grab me just like you do
I'm gonna travel the railroad across the land
and come on home to you
Ain't that loving you baby 
Ain't that loving you baby
Ain't that loving you baby
But you don't even know my name
