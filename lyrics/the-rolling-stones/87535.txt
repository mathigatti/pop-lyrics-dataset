If it's love that you're running from
There's no hiding place
Just your problems, noone else's problems
You'll just have to face
But if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all the trouble behind 


Keep on walking - Dont look back! 

If your first lover let you down
There's something that can be done
Don't fear the faith and love
Remembering what will come
So, if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all the trouble behind 

Keep on walking - Dont look back!
