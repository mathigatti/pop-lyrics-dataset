Got the Monday mornin' blues (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Monday wasn't really real (Yeah, yeah) 
Oh, lying on a naked bed (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
With an Alka Seltzer head (Yeah, yeah) 


Oh, Lucy looked sweet just a-strollin' down Newport Street 
Talkin' 'bout Lu,  what ya gon' do
And I feel so bad 
Have you ever been had
I'll dry out sweet Lucy 

Took an early morning shower (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Well, I wasted 'bout half an hour (Yeah, yeah) 
I heard the ringing of a bell (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
It's Lucy with the cleaning towel (Yeah, yeah) 
Oh, I'm feelin' like the Sunday Times (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Soaked in Californian wine (Yeah, yeah) 
Oh Lucy kicked me in the hole (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
A Tennis worth of achin' bones (Ooh-ooh) 
Oh Lucy! Yep!

Oh Lucy looked sweet just a-strollin' down Newport Street 
Talkin bout Lu, what ya gonna do
I feel so bad 
Have you ever been had
Got a dose from sweet lucy 

Oh Lucy looked sweet just a-strollin' down Newport Street 
Talkin bout Lu (who?) what ya gonna do? 

Oh and I feeling so bad 
Have you ever been had? 
Oh by sweet Lucy
