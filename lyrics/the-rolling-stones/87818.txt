Who wants yesterdays papers
Who wants yesterdays girl
Who wants yesterdays papers
Nobody in the world


After this time I finally learned
After the pain and hurt
After all this what have I achieved
I've realized it's time to leave

Cause
Who wants yesterdays papers
Who wants yesterdays girl
Who wants yesterdays papers
Nobody in the world

Living a life of constant change
Every day means the turn of a page
Yesterdays papers are such bad news
Same thing applies to me and you

Who wants yesterdays papers
Who wants yesterdays girl
Who wants yesterdays papers
Nobody in the world

Seems very hard to have just one girl
When there's a million in the world
All of these people just can't wait
To fall right into their big mistake

Who wants yesterdays papers
Who wants yesterdays girl
Who wants yesterdays papers
Nobody in the world
