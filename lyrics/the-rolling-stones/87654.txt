You go and I'll come with you little baby
You go and I'll go with you little baby
You go and I'll come with you
You bet your life that I'll walk with you
You go and I'll come with you little baby 


You go to court and I'll come along
You go to jail and I'll get your bond
You got time tell you what I'll do
I'll stay outside and wait for you 

You go and I'll come with you little baby
You go and I'll go with you little baby
You go and I'll come with you
You bet your life that I'll walk with you
You go and I'll come with you little baby 

You go to church and I'll go there too
You go to work tell you what I'll do
You get paid and I'll hold the money
Be right there to protect you honey 

You go and I'll come with you little baby
You go and I'll go with you little baby
You go and I'll come with you
You bet your life that I'll walk with you
You go and I'll come with you little baby 

You get the fare I'll go the show
You bet the horses and I'll pick up the
dough
You work hard and it hurt my pride
I'll be there right by your side
