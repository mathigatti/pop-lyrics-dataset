Shang a doo lang, shang a lang doo lang 
Shang a doo lang, shang a lang doo lang 
Shang a doo lang, shang shang a doo lang 
shang a doo lang, shang a lang doo lang 


Well you tell me, that he really loves me 
I know he told me, that he really wants me 
But what he don't know, is that I love him too 

He said he'd seen me, goin' out with Charlie 
I only did it, to make him really want me 
You say you'll get me, but I'll get him too 

Shang a doo lang, shang a lang doo lang 
Shang a doo lang, shang a lang doo lang 
Shang a doo lang, shang shang a doo lang 
Shang a doo lang, shang a lang doo lang 

But now I think the time is right 
So let him take me out tonight 

I really love him, yes I really love him 
I really want him, yes I really want him 
Yes I love him, tell him I love him too 
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do
