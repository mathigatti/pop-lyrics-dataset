What a drag it is getting old

Kids are different today
I hear ev'ry mother say
Mother needs something today to calm her down
And though she's not really ill
There's a little yellow pill


She goes running for the shelter
Of a mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way
Gets her through her busy day

Things are different today
I hear ev'ry mother say
Cooking fresh food for a husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake
And she burns her frozen steak

And goes running for the shelter
Of a mother's little helper
And two help her on her way
Get her through her busy day

Doctor, please
Some more of these
Outside the door
She took four more

What a drag it is getting old

Men just aren't the same today
I hear ev'ry mother say
They just don't appreciate that you get tired
They're so hard to satisfy
You can tranquilise your mind

So go running for the shelter
Of a mother's little helper
And for help you through the night
Help to minimise your plight

Doctor please
Some more of these
Outside the door
She took four more

What a drag it is getting old

Life's just much too hard today
I hear ev'ry mother say
The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
And if you take more of those
You will get an overdose

No more running to the shelter
Of a mother's little helper
They just helped you on your way
Through your busy dying day
