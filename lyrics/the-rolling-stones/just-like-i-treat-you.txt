Some say you will
Some say you won't
Some say you do
Some say you don't
But I know
I know what you will do
Your gotta treat me baby, just like I treat you


If I give you little
You pickin' some bite
If I give you lots
I know what you'll be like
But I know
I know what you will do
You gotta treat me baby, just like I treat you

Your gotta treat me baby, just like I treat you, oh yeah

Some say you will
Some say you won't
Some say you do
Some say you don't
But I know
I know what you will do
Your gotta treat me baby, just like I treat you

If I give you little
You pickin' some bite
If I give you lots
I know what you'll be like
But I know
I know what you will do
You gotta treat me baby, just like I treat you

Some say you will
Some say you won't
Some say you do
Some say you don't
But I know
I know what you will do
Your gotta treat me baby, just like I treat you
