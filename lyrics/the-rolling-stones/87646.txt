I get home in the evening, when my day is through
The telephone starts ring ring ring but I know it's only you
Why don't you leave me alone, leave me alone, baby
Well I'm sick and tired of you keep on chasing me


I go out to a party, to get you out of my head
I look across that crowded room and I see you sitting there
Why don't you leave me alone, leave me alone
Well I'm sick and tired of you keep chasing me

Ah you say that you love me, I break your heart in two
If you leave me alone for a little while, I might come chasing you
Why don't you leave me alone, leave me alone, baby
Well I'm sick and tired of you keep on chasing me, oh yes I am!

Leave me alone, leave me alone, baby
Well I'm sick and tired of you keep on chasing me

Yeah, leave me alone, leave me alone baby
Won't you leave me me alone, oh yeah, leave me alone baby
Well I'm sick and tired of you keep chasing me

Yeah, leave me alone, leave me alone, baby
Won't you leave me alone, oh yeah, leave me alone, baby
Well I'm sick and tired of you keep chasing me
