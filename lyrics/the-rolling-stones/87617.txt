Well I'm a king bee 
Buzzing around your hive 
Well I'm a king bee, baby 
Buzzing around your hive 
Yeah I can make honey baby 
Let me come inside 


Well I'm a king bee 
Want you to be my queen 
Well I'm a king bee, baby 
Want you to be my queen 
Together we can make honey 
The world has never seen 

Well, buzz a while... 
Sting you bad... 

Well I'm a king bee 
Can buzz all night long 
Well I'm a king bee, baby 
Can buzz all night long 
Yeah I can buzz better baby 
When your man is gone
