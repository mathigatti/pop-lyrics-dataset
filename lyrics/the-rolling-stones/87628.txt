She's sweet and tender, but I remember 
The girl I once knew, made me feel so blue 
She loves me madly, I treat her badly 
'Cause girl, it should be you, it should be you 
It should be you, it should be you... 


I went all wrong, when you were gone 
It seems ashame, but I'm to blame 
She loves me madly, I treat her badly 
'Cause girl, it should be you, it should be you 
it should be you, it should be you... 

What can I do to win her back 
She kisses me but it's not the same 

I'm broken hearted, since we parted 
I wanna pick up, from where we started 
She loves me madly, I treat her badly 
'Cause girl, it should be you, it should be you 
It should be you, it should be you...
