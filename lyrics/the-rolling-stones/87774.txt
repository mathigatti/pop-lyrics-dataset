Well I said from the first
I am the worst kind of guy
For you to be around
Tear me apart
Including this old heart
That is true
And never ever let you down


You shouldn't stick with me
You trust me too much, you see
Take all the pain
It's yours anyway
Yeah kid...

Oh, put the blame on me
You ought to pass, you see
Somewhere outside
I threw love aside
Now it's a tragedy

I said from the first
I am the worst kind of guy
For you to be around
