She saw me coming
She saw me coming
She saw me coming


I didn´t see a thing
I wasn´t looking
I just walked into it
Sucker for her
I´m a sucker
Thought I was so cool
She saw me coming
Boy did I get screwed

She saw me coming
She had me dead to right
Her aim was stunning
I was lined up in her sites

She worked so fast
And she didn´t mess around
It was all over
Before the sun goes down before the sun goes down

She saw me coming... Yeah

She saw me coming
She moved in for the kill
She saw me coming
She served up on a grill

She busted in 
And she burglerized my soul
But now the bad news
She´s out on parole

She wrote the opening
The middle and the end
What a cast of characters
Her lovers and my friends
The plot was twisted
There was only one result
She saw me coming
But the going, going got too tough

She saw me coming
Yeah, yes she did
She saw me coming
Right on the grid, right on the grid
She saw me coming
Oh what a stupid jerk
She saw me coming
She was a piece of work

She must have tapped my phone
She saw me coming
I felt like I was cloned
She saw me coming
She had me on the ropes
She saw me coming
Took me for a dope
She saw me coming
Yes she did, yes she did
She saw me coming
