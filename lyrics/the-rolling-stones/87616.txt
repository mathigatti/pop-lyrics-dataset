You whipped me I'm hurting 
Abused me for certain 
And slavery should not exist 
Is this what I get a poison kiss 


Without you I'm dead meat 
I'm a raggedy dog dying in the street 
Of a God-forsaken shanty town 
Where gangs of children are hunted down 

I go wild when you're in my face 
I go wild when I taste your taste 
I go wild and I go insane 
I get sick--somebody stop this pain 

You left me I'm braindead 
I'm feeling nothing strapped to my bed 
On life support tubes in my nose 
Tubes in my arms shot full of holes 

I go wild act like a goat 
And I get sick, lumps in my throat 
I go wild 
I go wild 
I go crazy, I go insane 
I get sick somebody stop this pain 

And the doctors says you'll be okay 
And if you'd only stay away 
From femme fatales and dirty bitches 
And daylight drabs and nightime witches 
And working girls and blue stockings 
And dance hall babes and body poppers 
And waitresses with broken noses 
Checkout girls striking poses 
And politicians' garish wives 
With alcoholic cunts like knives 

I go wild 
I go wild 
I go wild 
I go wild 
I go wild when you're in my face 
And I'm entranced in a state of grace 
I go wild when you treat me bad 
I go wild, raving mad 

I go wild for you 
I go wild for you
