I got this sexdrive
Driving me mad
I've got to drive you crazy
Best you've ever had
I got this sexdrive
Driving me mad
Got to drive you crazy
The best you've ever had 


I can drive you fast
I can drive you slow
Put me on the hot seat
I've got no sense control
I'm a blot on the landscape
A blur on the beach
A bite of the cherry
I'll lick the fuzz right off the peach 

I got this sexdrive
Driving me mad
I've got to drive you crazy
The best you've ever had
The best you've ever had
I've got this sex
Oh I got this sexdrive
What you gonna do about that 

You can take the bus
You can take the cab
But if you want to change your style
And live a life more versatile
We could be a smash 

See you from behind
And they never gonna see again
Lookin' so fine
When you find another trick so fine
You never saw him going out all the night
And they look you all over
And you're gonna see the light
Oh, let's make it tonight 

I got this sexdrive
Driving me mad
I've got to drive you crazy
The best you've ever had
The best you've ever had
I've got this sex
Chuka lucka boom
Please give me some room
Chucka lucka back
Please give some slack
I've got this sex
I've got this sex
I've got this sexdrive 

See you from behind
And they never gonna see again
Lookin' so fine
When you find another trick so fine
You never saw him going out all the night
And they look you all over
And you're gonna see the light
Oh, let's make it tonight
I've got this sex
I've got this sexdrive
