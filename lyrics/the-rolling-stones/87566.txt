Well, while I was away, you said you missed me
And now I'm back to stay, come on and kiss me
I need you bad, it makes you glad
So give me your hand, I'll hold it tight


Well all you have to do, is try and please me
That's all I want from you, come on and squeeze me
I need you bad, it makes you glad
So give me your hand, I'll hold it tight

I don't pretend that I don't need you
So come on,come on and give me your hand
I need you bad, it makes you glad
So give me your hand, I'll hold it tight

Well here is my heart, come on and take it
Don't tear our love apart, oh! please don't break it
I need you bad, it makes you glad
So give me your hand, I'll hold it tight
