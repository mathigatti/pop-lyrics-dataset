You left me for another
Honey you found out it wasn`t a true lover
Now that he is gone
Lets go steady one more time


Please don`t cry dear, you`ve got to be strong dear
He will never hurt you anymore
But now that he`s gone 
Lets go steady one more time

I know he was wrong to come to the dance
With another girl the way that he did
I knew he was wrong when he took your love from me
After all he was once my best friend

Thats all in the past
Let`s forget him
He`ll never hurt you I won`t let him
Now that he`s gone
Let`s go steady one more time
