I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I'm gonna love you night and day
Love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away
And my love is bigger than a Cadillac
I'll try to show it if you drive me back


Your love for me has got to be real
Before you'd have noticed how I feel
Love real not fade away
Well love real not fade away
Yeah

I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
Love that lasts more than one day
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away
Not fade away
Not fade away
