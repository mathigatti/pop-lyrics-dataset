Wo Yeah! (Wo, wo)

Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me
And make me burn the candle right down
But baby, baby, I don't need no jewels in my crown


'Cause all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
But baby, crazy, there's fever in the funk house now
This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a itchin'
Don't you know the duece is still wild

Baby, I can't stay, you got to roll me
And call me the tumblin' dice

Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Don't you see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money
I'm all sixes and sevens and nines
Say now baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime

But baby, I can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Oh, my, my, my, I'm the lone crap shooter
Playin' the field ev'ry night

But baby, I can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice, (call me the tumblin')
Got to roll me (yayes), got to roll me, got to roll me (oh yeah)
Got to roll me
Got to roll me (yeah)
Got to roll me (keep on rolling)
Got to roll me (keep on rolling)
Got to roll me (keep on rolling)
Got to roll me
My baby, call me the tumblin' dice, yeah
Got to roll me
Baby sweet as sugar (got to roll me)
Yeah, my, my, my yeah (got to roll me)
I went down baby, oh
Got to roll me (hit me)
Baby I'm down
