If you need me 
Why don't you call me 
Said if you need me 
Why don't you call me 
Don't wait too long 
When things go wrong 
I'll be there, yeah 
Where I belong 


Said if you want me 
Why don't you send for me 
Said if you want, want, want 
All you gotta do is send for me 
Don't wait to long 
Just a pick up your phone 
I'll be there 
Right there, where I belong 

People always told me, darling 
That you didn't mean me no good 
But I know deep down in my heart 
I done the best I could 
And one of these days, darling 
It won't be long 
You're gonna come walking through that door 
And I know in my mind these are the very 
Words you're gonna say to me 

I still love you 
Always thinking of you 
I still love, love, love 
Always thinking of you 
Don't wait too long 
When things go wrong 
I'll be there, right there 
Where I belong
