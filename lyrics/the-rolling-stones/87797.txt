When your spine is cracking and your hands, they shake
Heart is bursting and your butt's gonna break
Woman's cussing, you can hear her scream
Feel like murder in the first degree


Ain't nobody slowing down no way
Everybody's stepping on their accelerator
Don't matter where you are
Everybody's gonna need a ventilator

When you're trapped and circled with no second chances
Your code of living is your gun in hand
We can't be browed by beating, we can't be cowed by words
Messed by cheating, ain't gonna ever learn

Everybody walking around
Everybody trying to step on their Creator
Don't matter where you are, everybody, everybody gonna
Need some kind of ventilator, some kind of ventilator

What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do?
Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it?
