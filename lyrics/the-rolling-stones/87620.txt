I've got itchy fingers, I've got muddy feet
And my mind is wanderin' in the steamin' heat
My head is swimmin' full of dirty lies
I'm tired of spinnin' freaky alibis 


I need open spaces to clear my head
Need a clearer view on the road ahead
Need to fill my tank, check the oil
Fix the air conditioner or I'm gonna boil 

I'm gonna drive
I'm gonna drive
To the edge of this-uh world 

I've seen fire, disaster and hurricane
And sad eyed people and dirty dreams
And battered suit cases and cryin' kids
And resignation at how life is 

And easy money and wine that flows
And pretty pictures and centerfolds
And double dealers who take it back
If he should mud yer daughter, throw 'im back 

I'm gonna drive
I'm gonna drive
I'm gonna drive
I'm gonna drive
To the edge of this-uh world 

I'm goin' through a desert across a plain
To the lonely mountain full of cloud and rain
Gonna scream out loud at the risin' sun
Gonna ask for pleasure when my day is done
Yeah, baby, hear my prayin' 

I'm gonna drive
I'm gonna drive
I'm gonna drive
I'm gonna drive
To the edge of this-uh world
