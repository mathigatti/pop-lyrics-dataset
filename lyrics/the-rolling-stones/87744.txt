You'd better grease up
I'm coming back
You're going to catch fire
Pyromaniac
You'd better shape up
You'd better get set
I'm gonna burn up
In the smoke of a jet


Sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back on you, baby
Sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back to you, baby
You're going to find out
Going to scream and shout
We're going to pierce through this drought
Sparks will fly, sparks will fly

You'd better stand back
The flames are high
Better get help
Can't stop the fire
Bell's going to ring
Hear the alarms
Better tell the fire chief
To quit playing cards

Sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back on you, baby
Sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back on you, baby
I'm gonna step on the gas
I want to get there really fast
I want to fuck your sweet ass
Sparks will fly
Sharks will cry
Sparks will fly

I had a good sniff around
Along old hunting grounds
But I have never found
A woman so hot

Sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back on you, baby
Sparks will fly
When I finally get myself back to you, baby
My fingers are crossed
The time that we lost
I'm in total chaos
Sparks will fly
Sparks will fly
Sparks will fly
