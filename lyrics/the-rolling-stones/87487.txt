We used to ride, baby 
Ride around in limousines 
We looked so fine, baby 
You in white and me in green 
Drinking and dancing 
All inside and crazy dream 
Well now look at your face now baby 
Look at you and look at me 


I get so scared 
Just to see you on the street 
They're living dead 
Your all the same, you never speak 
Your wrecked out now 
Washed up high up on the beach 
Well now look at your face now baby 
Look at you and look at me 

We used to shine, shine, shine, shine 
Say what a pair, say what a team 
We used to ride, ride, ride, ride 
In a long black limousine 
Those dreams are gone baby 
Locked away and never seen 
Well now look at your face now baby 
Look at you and look at me
