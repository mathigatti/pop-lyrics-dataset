Girl, why you left me?
Left me here to cry
Know I love her
She's my desire
She's my desire
She's my desire


Came home this mornin'
About half past four
Found that note
Lyin' on my floor

Girl, why you left me?
You just don't know
You heard some bad talk
Somethin' that you said
Somethin' that you said
Somethin' that you said

Come on back, baby
Baby, please, don't go
I love you, you'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know

My kind of baby
You know it's so
I ain't gonna tell you
And it ain't no joke
No, it ain't no joke
No, it ain't no joke
It ain't no joke

Come on back, baby
You know you done me wrong
You know I love you
Please, come on home
Come on back home
Come on back home

Come on back home
Come on back home
Come on back home
