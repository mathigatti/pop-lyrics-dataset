On Thursday night she looked a fright 
Her pricki hair all curled, oh Lord, what a sight 
Dance, dance, little sister, dance 


On Friday night she's all decked out 
Her high heel shoes, her dress so tight 
Dance, dance little sister, dance 

On Saturday night she bass-a-dee 
She stepping high on Frederick's Street 
Dance, dance, little sister, dance 

I said dance, dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 
I said dance, dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 

It make me hot, I wet with sweat 
It burn like hell, I've four hours left 
Dance, dance, little sister, dance 

Get next to me, drive me close 
Don't mammaguay, I lose control 
Dance, dance with fire, dance 

I said dance, dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 
I said dance, dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 

Jump out of Africa with a step that looks so bold 
Ah, when you kickin' high it make my blood run cold 

I said dance, dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 
I said dance, dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 
Dance, little sister, dance 

On Saturday night we don't go home 
We bacchanal, there ain't no dawn 
Dance, little sister, dance 
I said dance, dance, little sister 
Dance little sister 
Dance little sister, dance...
