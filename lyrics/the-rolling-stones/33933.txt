I want you back again
I want your love again
I know you find it hard to reason with me
But this time it's diff'rent, darling you'll see


You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me

You said we're through before
You walked out on me before
I tried to tell you, but you didn't want to know
This time you're diff'rent and determined to go

You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell...

I wait as the days go by
I long for the nights to go by
I hear the knock on my door that never comes
I hear the telephone that hasn't rung

You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell...
