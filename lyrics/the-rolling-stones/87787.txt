Hey, baby
Every man is the same come on
I'll make you a star
I'll take you a million miles from all this
Put you on a pedestal
Come on, come on


Have you ever heard those opening lines?
You should leave this small town way behind
I'll be your partner
Show you the steps
With me behind your tasting of the sweet wine of success
'Cause I'll take you to the top, baby
Hey, baby, I'll take you to the top

Step on the ladder
Toe in the pool
Your such a natural you don't need no acting school
Don't need no casting couch
Or be a star in bed
Never, never, never let success go to you pretty head
'Cause I'll take you to the top, baby
I swear we'll never going to stop, baby
I'll take you to the top

Don't let the world pass you by
You better take your chance now baby
Or be sorry for the rest of your sweet loving life, baby
Oh, sugar
Hey, sugar, I'll take you to the top
I'll take you to the top
I'll take you to the top, sugar
