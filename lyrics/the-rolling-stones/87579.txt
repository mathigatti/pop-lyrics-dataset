Well I never kept a dollar past sunset, 
It always burned a hole in my pants. 
Never made a school mama happy, 
Never blew  a second chance, oh no 


I need a love to keep me happy, 
I need a love to keep me happy. 
Baby, baby keep me happy. 
Baby, baby keep me happy. 

Always took candy from strangers, 
Didn't wanna get me no trade. 
Never want to be like papa, 
Working for the boss ev'ry night and day. 

I need a love to keep me happy, 
I need a love, baby won't ya keep me happy. 
Baby, won't ya keep me happy. 
Baby, please keep me 

I need a love to keep me happy, 
I need a love to keep me happy. 
Baby, baby keep me happy. 
Baby, baby keep me happy. 

Never got a flash out of cocktails, 
When I got some flesh off the bone. 
Never got a lift out of Lear jets, 
When I can fly way back home. 

I need a love to keep me happy, 
I need a love to keep me happy. 
Baby, baby keep me happy. 
Baby, baby keep me happy.
