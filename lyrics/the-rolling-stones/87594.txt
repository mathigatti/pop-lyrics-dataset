Well there's a hole in my chest
Where my heart was
The body refuses to die
And the rain's coming down
The night wont end
It looks like it's set for the night 


There's a train pullin' in at the station
And its wheels gonna take me home
When love walks in
And love walks out
I'm movin' to the danger zone 

Well I wont breathe a word about it
Cross my heart and hope to die
I give you all the love
In this mighty world
Stand up and testify 

I'm a' honest man
I'm a' honest lover
Stand by my word
Don't know no other 

I'm a' honest man
I'm a' honest lover
Don't tell my friend
Don't blow my cover 

Now there's some wild talkin' innuendo
An' some nasty nail-biting games
When the sun comes up
Look me right in the eye
And tell me you don't feel ashamed 

Well, I won't breathe a word about it
Cross my heart and hope to die
When love walks out
And love walks in
The fall-man is gonna cry 

I'm a' honest man
I'm a' honest lover
Don't tell my friend
Don't blow my cover 

I'm a' honest man
I'm a' honest lover
Don't tell my friend
Don't blow my cover 

Now there's a hole in my chest
Where my heart was
And nothing's gonna stop the pain
When the train pull out
The night comes in
Thinkin' of me once again 

And I wont breathe a word about it
I know I'm gonna take the blame
Give you all the love
In this mighty world
If you just let me clear my name 

I'm a' honest man
I'm a' honest lover
Don't tell my friend
Don't blow my cover 

I'm a' honest man
I'm an' honest lover
Tell my friend
Don't know no other 

Yeah
Uh-huh
Yeah
Uh-huh
Yeah 

C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon 

Mmh-hmm
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Mmh-hmm
Mmh-hmm
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Mmh-hmm...
