If I was the sun way up there
I'd go with my love everywhere
I'll be the moon when the sun go down
To let you know I'm still around
That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is


I'll be the weeping willow drowning in my tears
You can go swimming when you're here
I'll be the rainbow when the sun is gone
Wrap you in my colors and keep you warm
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is

I'll be the ocean so deep and wide
I'll dry the tears when you cry
I'll be the breeze when the storm is gone
To dry your eyes and keep you warm
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
Baby that's how strong my love is

That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is, yeah

That's how strong my love is
So deep and so wide my love is
Yes it is so strong can't get over it
Is so wide you can't get around me
That's how strong my love is
Yeah it so strong, so strong, so strong
Yeah yeah yeah, that's how strong my love is, is so strong
