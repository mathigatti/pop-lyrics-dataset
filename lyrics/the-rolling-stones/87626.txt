You said you was hurting, almost lost your mind,
And the man you love, he hurts you all the time.
When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too. 


You love him more when you should love him less.
I pick up behind him and take his mess.
When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too. 

He love another woman and I love you,
But you love him and stick to him like glue.
When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too. 

Now you better leave him; he better put you down.
Oh, I won't stand to see you pushed around.
When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too.
