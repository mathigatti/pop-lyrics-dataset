There's a new guy in town 
He's been dragging around 
He's the figure of youth 
And his eyes are so blue 
And they're looking at you 
So tell me the truth 


Well, well he's got stories to tell 
He bites off more than he chews 
Well, well is he ringing your bell 
My heart is breaking in two 

And his skin is so fair 
And it shines like his hair 
As he stands so aloof 
With an indolent air 
And an insolent stare 
He just shutters the truth 

Well, well is he ringing your bell 
My heart is breaking in two 
Well, well he'll be rotting in hell 
For playing the devil with you 

It is aready too late 
No point shutting the gate 
Have you already swallowed the bait 
And you're gone 

As he knocks you down cold 
As you lose all control 
To this slip of a youth 
I see fire in his eyes 
I see ice in his smile 
And I'm learning the truth 

Well, well he's got stories to tell 
Of love that is long overdue 
Well, well who is under his spell 
Is paying the devil his due
