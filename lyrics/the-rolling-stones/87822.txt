You don't have to mean it 
You just got to say it anyway 
I just need to hear those words for me 


You don't have to say too much 
Babe I wouldn't even touch you anyway 
I just want to hear you to say to me 

Sweet lies 
Baby baby dripping from your lips 
Sweet sighs 
Say to me come on and play 
Play with me baby 

You don't have to mean it 
You just got to say it to me baby 
Whisper whisper whisper in my ear 
(I don't believe it) 
(I don't believe it) 

I wouldn't want to use you 
Ooh I wouldn't blame you anyway 
If you never ever spoke to me 
(I don't believe it) 

Hmm just say those little words 
Sit on my shoulder like a little bird 
Baby baby sing those words for me 

Sweet lies 
Baby baby dripping from yuor lips 
Sweet sighs 
Ooh you make me cry 

Oh baby you know it 
You know what I want to hear 
Dripping from your lips 
I got to tell you baby 
Dripping from you lips 

You don't have to say too much 
Whisper whisper baby baby 
I just wanna hear you say to me 

(I don't believe it) 

You don't have to mean it 
Babe just say it anyway 
I just need to hear those words from your sweet lips 

You don't have to mean it 
You don't have to mean it 
(I don't believe you) 
You don't have to shout across the room 
Just whisper in my ear baby
