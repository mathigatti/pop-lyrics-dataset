Got a sweet black angel
Got a pin up girl
Got a sweet black angel
Up upon my wall
Well, she ain't no singer
And she ain't no star
But she sure talk good
And she move so fast
But the gal in danger
Yeah, de gal in chains
But she keep on pushin'
Would ya take her place?
She countin' up de minutes
She countin' up de days
She's a sweet black angel, woh
Not a sweet black slave
Ten little niggers
Sittin' on de wall
Her brothers been a fallin'
Fallin' one by one
For a judge they murdered
And a judge they stole
Now de judge he gonna judge her
For all dat he's worth
Well de gal in danger
De gal in chains
But she keep on pushin'
Would you do the same?
She countin' up de minutes
She countin' up de days
She's a sweet black angel
Not a gun toting teacher
Not a red lovin' school mom
Ain't someone gonna free her
Free de sweet black slave
Free de sweet black slave
