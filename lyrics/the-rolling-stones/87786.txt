If you want to wreck my life 
Go ahead my love 
Tried it once with poison 
Tried it once with drugs 
My circulation's running dry 
It's you that drank me up 
Screwed me down with kindness 
Suffocating love 


When it comes to fighting 
Trying to play it rough 
I will take you twenty rounds 
I'm just too tough, too tough 
Too tough, too tough 

Saw you on TV last night 
In a rerun soap 
You were young and beautiful 
Already without hope 

But I don't think you ever knew 
What you've bitten off 
But in the end, you spat me out 
You could not chew me up 
I'm too tough, too tough 
Too tough, too tough 

When it comes to fighting 
Trying to play it rough 
I will take you twenty rounds 
I'm just too tough, too tough 

I married yesterday 
To a teenage bride 
You said it's only physical 
But I love her deep inside 
I still see you in my dreams 
With a kitchen knife 
With it poised above your head 
Now who you gonna slice? 

When it comes to fighting 
Trying to play it rough 
I will take you twenty rounds 
I'm just too tough, too tough 

Too tough, too tough 

I don't think you'll ever know 
What you've bitten off 
But in the end, you spat me out 
You could not chew me up 
I was too tough, too tough 
Too tough, too tough 
Too tough, too tough 
Too tough 
Too tough, too tough 
Too tough, too tough
