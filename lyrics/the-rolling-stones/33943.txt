Won't you give me the low down
Just as quick you can
Baby, I've been out of touch
Just give me the scam


Don't give me
The sports page, baby
No political news
Don't you give me the gossip
Just give me the truth
Just between me and you

Give me the low down
If you can
Don't want a show down
I just want to know
Where I stand

Don't read me
The horoscope babe
That ain't what I need
Our future will never last
But that's between you and me

I don't want the movie the section
I'll see you for myself
I don't want the news that fits
Shove it back on the shelf

Give me the truth
Just between me and you

Give me low dow
If you can
I don't want a show down
I just want to know
Where I stand

The readllines are screaming
They change everyday
As long as ain't in them
I'm happy that way

I know that you won't lie to me
But you hold back the truth
Just between me and you

Give me low down
If you can
I don't want a show down
I just want to know
Where I stand

Give me the low down
as quick as you can
I don't want to hear about it
I want it straight from you

Give me the truth
Just between me and you
