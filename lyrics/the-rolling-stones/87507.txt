Everything is wrong since me and my baby parted
All day long I'm walkin' 'cause I couldn't get my car started
Laid off from my job and I can't afford to check it
I wish somebody'd come along and run into it and wreck it 


Come on, since me and my baby parted
Come on, I can't get started
Come on, I can't afford to check
I wish somebody'd come along and run into it and wreck it 

Everything is wrong since I've been without you
Ev'ry night I lay awake thinkin' about you
Ev'ry time the phone rings it sounds like thunder
Some stupid guy try'n' to reach another number 

Come on, since I've been without you
Come on, always thinkin' about you
Come on, phone sounds like thunder
Some stupid guy try'n' to reach another number 

Everything is wrong since I last saw you, baby
I really wanna see you and I don't mean maybe
I'm doin' ev'rything try'n' to make you see
That I belong to you, hon, and you belong to me 

Come on, I wanna see you, baby
Come on, I don't mean maybe
Come on, I'm try'n' to make you see
That I belong to you and you belong to me 

Come on, I gotta see you, baby
Come on, I don't mean maybe
Come on, I've gotta make you see
That I belong to you and you belong to me 

Come on, come on, come on, come on
