Time is on my side (Yes it is)
Time is on my side (Yes it is)
Now you always say that you want to be free
But you'll come running back, you'll come running back
You'll come running back to me


Yeah, time is on my side (Yes it is)
Time is on my side (Yes it is)
You're searching for good times, but just wait and see
You'll come running back...

Go ahead, baby, go ahead. Go ahead and light up the town
And baby, do anything your heart desires
Remember, I'll always be around
And I know like I told you so many times before
You're gonna come back
Yeah, you're gonna come back, baby
Knockin', yeah, knockin' right on my door, yeah!

Time is on my side (Yes it is)
Time is on my side (Yes it is)
Cause I've got real the love, the kind that you need
You'll come running back...

Yeah, time, time time is on my side (Yes it is)
I said, time, time, time is on my side (Yes it is)
I said, time, time, time is on my side
