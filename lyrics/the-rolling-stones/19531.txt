You can see it in a  clear blue sky
You can see it in a woman's eyes
You can hear it in your baby's cries
You can hear it in your lover's sighs
You can touch it in a grain of sand
Yeah hold it right there
In the palm of your hand
Feel it 'round you everyday
And hear what I've got to say


God gave me everything I want 
Come on
I'll give it all to you
God gave me everything I want
Come on
I'll give it all to you

I saw it in the midnight sun
And I felt it in the race I won
And I hear it in the windy storm
And I feel it in the icy dawn
And I smell it in the wine I taste
And I see it in my father's face
And I hear it in a symphony
And I feel it in the love
You show for me

Yeah
God gave me everything I want 
Come on
I'll give it all to you
God gave me everything I want

Come on
I'll give it all to you
God gave me everything I want
I can't stop can't stop
I'm still looking now
God gave me everything I want
Oh come on
I'll give it all to you

Crazy you said
It's all in your head

God gave me everything I want 
Come on
I'll give it all to you
God gave me everything I want
Come on
I'll give it all to you
