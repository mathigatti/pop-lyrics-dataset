New York was cold and damp 
TV is just a blank 
Looks like another dead end Sunday 


What about an early night 
Monday never feels so bright 
Ooh the sheets feel cold and lonely 

Who wants to brave the pouring rain 
For a glass of French champagne? 
Well grab a cab, grab a cap and baby, come right by 

And she was hot - as she kissed my mouth 
She was hot - as I wiped her brow 
She was hot - she pinned me to the ground 
She was quick - she knew her way around 
She was hot - as she tore my clothes 
She was hot - she had no place to go 
She was hot - on a cold and rainy night 

Detroit was smoky grey 
Nothing like the good old days 
Well I got a fever that I'm fighting 

I don't need your company 
Leave me in my misery 
I can take the rebound just like lightning 

And she was hot - in a 50's dress 
She was hot - her lips were flashing red 
I was lost - in her burning flesh 
I was hot - I was dripping sweat 
She was hot - in the Detroit snow 
She was hot - she had no place to go 
She was hot - on a cold and rainy night 

And she was hot - and I had the blues 
She was hot - honey, where were you? 
If you were in my shoes 
You would be excused 
She was hot - you can never wait 
She was hot - never hesitate 
She was hot - on a cold and rainy night 

I think I'm going off the rails 
Riding down the pleasure trails 
I was taking passion where you find it 

Honey when you were young and fresh 
And you need the touch of your flesh 
Go take the treasure where you find it 

And she was hot - in the melted snow 
She was hot - in the molten glow 
She was hot - she got it in the blood 
She was hot - like the dam that bursts 
She was black - she was strong and true 
She was black - and her eyes were blue 
She was lost - and she took a chance 
At just a brief romance 

Down the avenue into the lost bayou 
Into the tall bamboo, back to the human zoo 
I wish you all the best, I hope we meet again 
On a cold Chicago night 

She was hot 
She was hot 
She was hot hot hot 
She was hot hot hot....
