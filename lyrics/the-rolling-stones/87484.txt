Worked in bars and sideshows along the twilight zone 
Only a crowd can make you feel so alone 
And it really hit home 
Booze and pills and powders, you can choose your medicine 
Well it's another goodbye to another good friend 


After all is said and done 
Gotta move while it's still fun 
Let me walk before they make me run 
After all is said and done 
I gotta move, it's still fun 
I'm gonna walk before they make me run 

Watched the taillights fading, there ain't a dry eye in the house 
They're laughing and singing 
Started dancing and drinking as I left town 
Gonna find my way to heaven, `cause I did my time in hell 
I wasn't looking too good but I was feeling real well 

After all is said and done 
I gotta move I had my fun 
Let us walk before they make me run 

After all is said and done 
I did alright, I had my fun 
I will walk before they make me run
