Whoa la la ta ta 
Whoa la la ta ta 
La la la all night long 
Wanna tell you 


Whoa la la ta ta 
Whoa la la ta ta 
La la la all night long 

C'mon let the good times roll 
We're gonna stay here to soothe our soul 
It could take all night long 

The evening sun is sinking low 
The clock on the wall says it's time to go 
I've got my plans I don't know about you 
I tell you exactly what I'm gonna do 

Get in the groove and let the good times roll 
We're gonna stay here to soothe our soul 
It could take all night long 

It might be one o'clock it might be three 
Time don't mean that much to me 
Ain't felt this good since I don't know when 
I might not feel this good again 

So c'mon let the good time roll 
We're gonna stay here to soothe our soul 
It could take all night long 

All night, all night 
All night, all night long 
Somebody said it might take all night long 
All night, all night whoa 

C'mon let the good times roll 
We're gonna stay here to soothe our soul 
It could take all night long
