I'm blue and lonesome as a man can be
I'm blue and lonesome ooh as a man can be
I don't have headaches over myself
My love has gone away from me


Baby, please come on back home to me
Baby, please yeah come on back home to me
Yes, my heart is full of misery
Baby, you won't be sweet to me

I'm gonna cast myself off
Down in the deep blue see
I'm gonna cast myself off, yeah
Down in the deep blue see

Where the whales and the fishes
Have a fuss over me
