You're the kind of person you meet at certain dismal, dullaffairs
Center of a crowd, talking much too loud, running up and down thestairs
Well, it seems to me that you have seen too much in too fewyears
And though you've tried you just can't hide your eyes are edgedwith tears


You better stop, look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

When you were a child you were a treated kind
Byt you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys but still you criedall night
Your mother who neglected you owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways of making ceiling wax

You better stop, look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Oh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane
Well, nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make the matters worse. Oh, please

You were still in school when you had that fool who really messedyour mind
And after that you turned your back on treating people kind
On our first trip I tried so hard to rearrange your mind
But after awhile I realized you were disarranging mine

You better stop, look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Oh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane
Well, nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make the matters worse. Oh, please

When you were a child you were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys but still you criedall night
Your mother who neglected you owes a million dollars tax
And you father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax

You better stop, look around
Here it comes, here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
