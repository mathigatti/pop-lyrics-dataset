What you say girl, you see what is wrong 
You, must be joking, you was led alone 
But the butler the baker, the laughing cavalier 
Will tell me now, who's been sleeping here 


I want to know 

Tell me baby, who's been sleeping here 

What you say girl, who'd you see that night 
I was doing, doing something right 
Oh the soldier, the sailor then there's the three muskateers 
They'll now tell me now, who's been sleeping here 

Did I ever tell you I want to know 
Hey baby, who's been sleeping here 

Don't you look like, like a goldilocks 
There must be somewhere, somewhere you can stop 
Yes there's the noseless old newsboy the old british brigadier 
But you'll tell me now, who's been sleeping here 

Who's been eating, eating off my plate 
Who will tell me, who'll investigate 
There's the seargeants the soldiers the cruel old grenadiers 
But they'll tell me, now, who's been sleeping here 

Cause I want to know who's been sleeping right here 
Was it your mummy, your daddy, who's been sleeping here 
Was it your auntie, your uncle, who's been sleeping here 
Was it your boyfriend, your girlfriend, who's been sleeping here
