Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 
Well I went to see the gypsy 
To have my fortune read She said "Man, your baby gonna leave you 
Her bags are packed up under the bed," 
That's right 


Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 
But if you leave me baby 
Girl if you put me down 
I'm gonna make it to the nearest river child 
And jump overboard and drown 
That's right 

Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 
I said hey hey baby, hey hey now 
What you trying to do 
Hey hey baby, hey hey now 
Please don't say we're through 

Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 
But if you stay baby 
I tell you what I'm gonna do 
I'm gonna work two jobs, seven days a week 
And bring my money home to you 
That's right 
Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 
Yeah 

Have mercy, have mercy, baby 
Have mercy, have mercy on me
