I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain
But it's all right, now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas!


I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But it's all right, now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas!

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head
But it's all right, now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas!

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
