Owwwooooo, yeah
Well...
Like to put my foot down, head out of New York town
Hit the open road, open road
I guess it clears my mind, I love the change in time
It put my nose in joint, well well well
I'm just so signifyin', I know that it ain't no crime
I'm no country boy, country boy
The blues is in my heart, that's where my story starts
It makes me jump with joy, whoo whoo 


Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
And down in New Orleans
(Down in New Orleans)
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis, (goin')
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis, (goin')
I'm gonna be there
Whooo
Step on it!
Yeah .... yeah 

Back down on in the south
Sweet tastin' in my mouth
And honeysuckle vine, suckle vine
Into the big bayou
In with the Zydeco
My lovin' come alive, come alive
Too big to come upstairs, and Muddy Waters stayed,
Water-stayed
From an old man's mouth
Whoowooo 

Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
And down in New Orleans, (down in New Orleans)
Owwo
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
I'm gonna be there
Step on it!
You got it!
Bit on it!
She got it!
Whooo... 

Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
I'm gonna be there
Step on it!
You got it!, (you got it)
Yeah...
Owwoooo
(Yes) 

(I'm goin' to the Delta)
(Goin' on the shelter)
(Two little sissy boys)
(Say it again) 

Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
Yes, I'm goin' to Memphis, (yeah)
And down in New Orleans, (Ohwoowoo)
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
And down in New Orleans, (Aww)
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
Yes I'm like a tempest
And down in New Orleans, whoo
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
And down in New Orleans
(Say it again, say it again)
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis, (hey)
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis, (yeah)
And down in New Orleans
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
And down in New Orleans, (I gotta be there)
(I gotta be there)
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
Yes I'm goin' to Memphis
And down in New Orleans
You come alive...lii-iive
