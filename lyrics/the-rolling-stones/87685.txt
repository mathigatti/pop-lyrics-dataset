My obsessions are your possessions
Every piece that I can get
My obsessions are your possessions
My mouth is soaking wet


I think I blew it now
Confession

You can't dodge it, it's simple logic
You'd be better off with me
And you'll know it when you lost it
Lonely

My obsessions are your possesion
Are you smiling on my way
My obsession are your possession
One that you should give away

Give it to me now, I've no
Objection

I don't mind if it's unkind
And it's not my property
But I want it just to be mine
Exclusively

Oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby, oh baby

Aaah

You need teaching, you're a girl
There are things in this world
That need teaching with discretion
My profession

My obsessions are your possessions
Are you used to the idea
My obsessions are your possessions
Do you feel at home right here

You should relax, it's my
Impression

Didn't see you were so young
I could almost be your son
Please turn in my direction
No objection
