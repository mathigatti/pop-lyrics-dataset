Hear the screams of Center 42 
Loud enough to bust your brains out 
The opposition's tongue is cut in two 
Keep off the street 'cause you're in danger 


One hundred thousand disparus 
Lost in the jails in South America 
Cuddle up baby 
Cuddle up tight 
Cuddle up baby 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover of the night 

The sex police are out there on the streets 
Make sure the pass laws are not broken 
The race militia has got itchy fingers 
All the way from New York back to Africa 

Cuddle up baby 
Keep it all out of sight 
Cuddle up baby 
Sleep with all out of sight 
Cuddle up baby 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover 
Undercover 
Undercover 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover of the night 

All the young men they've been rounded up 
And sent to camps back in the jungle 
And people whisper people double-talk 
And once proud fathers act so humble 
All the young girls they have got the blues 
They're heading on back to Center 42 

Keep it undercover 
Keep it all out of sight 
Keep it undercover 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover of the night 

Down in the bars the girls are painted blue 
Done up in lace, done up in rubber 
The John's are jerky little G.I. Joe's 
On R&amp;R from Cuba and Russia 
The smell of sex, the smell of suicide 
All these things I can't keep inside 

Undercover 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover of the night 

Undercover of the night 
Undercover of the night 

Undercover 
Undercover 
Undercover of the night
