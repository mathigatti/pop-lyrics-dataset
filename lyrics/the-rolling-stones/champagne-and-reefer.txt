Bring me champagne when I'm thirsty
Bring me reefer when I want to get high
Give me champagne when I'm thirsty
Give me reefer when I want to get high
Well you know when I'm lonely
Give my woman set her right down here by my side
(Yeah, your time)


Well you know there should be no law
On a man that want to smoke a little dope
(Heat me)
Well you know there should be no law
On people that want to smoke a little dope
Well you know it's good for your head
And it relax your body don't you know
(All right, play this on)

Everytime I get high, yeah
I lay my head down on my baby's breast
Everytime I get high, yeah
I wanna lay down on my baby's breast
Well you know she done hug and kiss me
Says, "Buddy Guy, your the best"

I'm gonna get high this morning, Mik
Gonna get high just as sure as you know my name
Y'know I'm gonna get so high this morning
It's going to be a cryin' shame
Well you know I'm gonna stick with my reefer
Ain't gonna be messin' round with no cocaine

Give me a reefer when I wanna get high
Give me champgne when I´m thirsty
Give me a reefer when I wanna get high
