If you really want to rip up your mind 
If you want to take the lid off your life 
If you want to reach down in the sump 
To last dregs off the camel's back hump 


And the wolves are howling right at your door 
And the vultures want to tear off some more 
Your flesh is burning right off your bones 
Your children kick you out of your home 

If you really want to tear up your mind 
If you really want to get yourself blind 
Might as well get juiced 
Might as well get juiced 

Hey mama 
What's this crazy game of sevens, eights and nines 
I can't keep up with you baby 
I'm gonna give you such a piece of my mind 
When I get around to it 
'Cause honey I'm abused 
Might as well get juiced 

If you really want to melt down your mind 
Crank it up to straight double time 
If you really want to have you some fun 
Spit right down on everyone 
If you've got the strength to scream out "Hell Why?" 
The wheels of life are passing you by 
You might as well get juiced 
Might as well get juiced 

Some people like to get high on love 
Buss it off with alcohol 
Give me a little taste of those fumes 
I need a little boost 
I tell you the sweet things in life 
How am I going to survive 
I might as well get juiced 
I might as well get juiced 
I might as well get juiced 
A little bit confused
