I was talking to the postman
And he mentioned your name
Seems like everybody
Knows about my good thing


Call the plumber darling
There must be a leak in my drain
Seems like everybody
Knows about my good thing

I was talking to my neighbour
About the way you wear your hair
They say you must have a lot of children
Because the milk man is always there

Call the plumber darling
There must be a leak in my drain
Seems like everybody
Knows about my good thing

I was talking to the butcher
He said you always look neat
I guess that's why my box
Always filled with meat

Call the plumber darling
There must be a leak in my drain
Seems like everybody
Knows about my good thing

Everybody knows about my good thing
Lord they just won't leave my baby alone

Everybody knows about my good thing
Lord I'm talking about my baby
They just won't leave my baby alone

It makes me wanna shout sometimes
It makes me wanna scream sometimes
