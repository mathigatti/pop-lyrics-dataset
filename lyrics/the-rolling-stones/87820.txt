You can make it if you try 
You can make it if you try 
You can make it if you try 
Yeh, yeh you can make it if you try 


Sometime you had to fall 
Don't you know sometime you want to cry 
Don't it make you feel so bad sometime 
You wanna lay down and die 
Yeh, yeh, you can make it if you try, ummmmmmm 

If you're baby treats you wrong 
Don't run around being blue 
Remember my friend 
Everybdody can't win 
'Cuz you know sometime, sometime 
You got to lose 

You can make it if you try 
They always told me 
I could make it if I tried 
I'm going to make it if i try 
Yeh, yeh, i'm gonna make it if I try 
If you try
