There've been good times
There've been bad times
I have my share of hard times too
But I lost my faith in the world,
honey, when I lost you


Remember the good times
we've had together?
Don't you want them back again?
Tho' these hard times are
bugging me now
Honey now it's the same

There's gotta be trust in this world,
or it won't get very far
Well, trust in someone,
or there's gonna be a war
