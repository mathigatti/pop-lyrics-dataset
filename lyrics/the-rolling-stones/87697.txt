Good evening one and all we're all so glad to see you here 
We'll play your favorite songs while you all soak up the atmosphere 
We'll start with over river, then maybe stormy weather, too 
I'm sure you know just what to do 
On with the show good health to you 


Please pour another glass it time to watch the cabaret 
Your wife will never know that you're not really working late 
Your hostess here is Wendy, you'll find  her very friendly, too 
And we don't care just what you do 
On with the show good health to you 

Petina, start the show at 2 o'clock 

Oh if by chance you find that you can't make it anymore 
We'll put you in a cab and get you safely to the door 
But we've got all the answers, and we've got lovely dancers, too 
There's nothing else you have to do 
On with the show good health to you 

You're all such lovely people dancing, eating round the floor 
But if you have to fight, please take your trouble out the door 
For now I say with sorrow, until this time tomorrow 
We'll bid you all a find adieu 
On with the show good health to you
