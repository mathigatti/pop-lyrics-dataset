Some girls give me money 
Some girls buy me clothes 
Some girls give me jewelry 
That I never thought I'd own 


Some girls give me diamonds 
Some girls, heart attacks 
Some girls I give all my bread to 
I don't ever want it back 

Some girls give me jewelry 
Others buy me clothes 
Some girls give me children 
I never asked them for 

So give me all your money 
Give me all your gold 
I'll buy you a house back in Zuma beach 
And give you half of what I own 

Some girls take my money 
Some girls take my clothes 
Some girls get the shirt off my back 
And leave me with a lethal dose 

French girls they want Cartier 
Italian girls want cars 
American girls want everything in the world 
You can possibly imagine 

English girls they're so prissy 
I can't stand them on the telephone 
Sometimes I take the receiver off the hook 
I don't want them to ever call at all 

White girls they're pretty funny 
Sometimes they drive me mad 
Black girls just wanna get fucked all night 
I just don't have that much jam 

Chinese girls are so gentle 
They're really such a tease 
You never know quite what they're cookin' 
Inside those silky sleeves 

Give me all you money 
Give me all your gold 
I'll buy you a house back in Zuma beach 
And give you half of what I own 

Yeah baby why don't you please come home

Some girls they're so pure 
Some girls so corrupt 
Some girls give me children 
I only made love to her once 

Give me half your money 
Give me half your car 
Give me half of everything 
I'll make you world's biggest star 

So gimme all your money 
Give me all your gold 
Let's go back to Zuma beach 
I'll give you half of everything I own
