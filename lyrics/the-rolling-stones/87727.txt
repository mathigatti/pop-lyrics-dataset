I'm so hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold
I'm so hot for her, I'm on fire for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold


I'm the burning bush, I'm the burning fire
I'm the bleeding volcano
I'm so hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold

Yeah, I tried re-wiring her, tried re-firing her
I think her engine is permanently stalled
She's so cold, she's so cold
She's so cold, cold, cold
Like a tombstone
She's so cold, she's so cold
She's so cold, cold, cold like an ice cream cone
She's so cold, she's so cold
I dare not touch her, my hand just froze

Yeah, I'm so hot for hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and even so
Put your hand on the heat, put your hand on the heat
Aw c'mon baby, let's go

She's so cold, she's so cold, cold, she's so cold
But she's beautiful, though

Yeah, she's so cold

She's so cold, she's so cold
She was born in an arctic zone
She's so cold, she's so cold, cold, cold
I dare not touch her, my hand just froze

She's so cold, she's so goddamn cold, she's so
Cold, cold, cold, she's so cold

Who would believe you were a beauty indeed
When the days get shorter and the nights get long
Lie awake when the rain comes
Nobody will know, when you're old
When you're old, nobody will know
That you was a beauty, a sweet, sweet beauty
A sweet, sweet, beauty, but stone, stone cold

You're so cold, you're so cold, cold, cold
You're so cold, you're so cold

I'm so hot for you, I'm so hot for you
I'm so hot for you and you're so cold

I'm the burning bush, I'm the burning fire
I'm the bleeding volcano
