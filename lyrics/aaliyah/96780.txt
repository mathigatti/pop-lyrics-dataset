I Gave You All Of My Love..... All To You.
And You Dont Appreciate The Things That I Do.
I Gave You All Of My Time..... Cause You Blew My Mind.
I Let You Do Me Wrong, Cause Love Had Me So Blind.

I Was So Strong, But Im All Grown Up 'N',
Im Dumb By Love 'N', I Used To Love You.
You Tried To Play Me And Then Persuede me.
I Still Remember The Pain You Gave Me.
I Cant Believe You, I Gotta Leave You.
Im Packin Up 'N' You Can Hit The Road Jack.
You Can Take These Things That You Gave Me,
Cause Im Never Comin Back.

All I Wanted..... Was A Little Love.
But You Chose To Hang Out All Night With The Boys.
So What Are You Saying?(Quit Wasting My Time)
Trying To Claim Something That Aint Even Mine.

I Was So Strong, But Im All Grown Up 'N',
Im Dumb By Love 'N', I Used To Love You.
You Tried To Play Me And Then Persuede me.
I Still Remember The Pain You Gave Me.
I Cant Believe You, I Gotta Leave You.
Im Packin Up 'N' You Can Hit The Road Jack.
You Can Take These Things That You Gave Me,
Cause Im Never Comin Back.

Why You Hurt Me? [Echo]
Why You Hurting Me So Bad?
Gave You My Time, You Played With My Mind.
Why You Wanna Make Me Sad?
[Repeat]
