Verse
I must have rehearsed me lines
a thousand times
until I had them memorized
but when I get up the nerve 
to tell you the words
they never seem to come out right


Chorus
Oh if only you knew
how much I do
do love you
oh if only you knew 
how much I do
do need you baby

Verse
I dream of moments we shared
but you not there
I'm living in a fantasy
but you don't even suspect
could probably care less
about the changes I've been going through

chorus

No you don't even suspect
could probably care less
about the changes I've been going through

chorus
