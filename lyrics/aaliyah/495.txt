Ima make it hot like fire
Ima make it hot like fire


Your hotter than summer day in California
Ya got me meltin like a sundae
And I want ya
I know you've been waitin
You've been waitin a long time for me
But if you wait a little while longer this is how it'll be

Oh it's gonna be, hot like fire
I'm gonna take you, take you higher
You can't resist, kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss

You shouldn't rush it
Take our time
I'll let you know when I'm ready
If that's alright
I won't keep you-I won't keep you
I won't keep you holdin on
But if you wait on me
I promise you it won't be long

Oh it's gonna be, hot like fire
I'm gonna take you, take you higher
You can't resist, kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss

Baby take your time
Take your time, Don't move too fast
No No No
Take your time, There's no rushin babe, No No No
Take your time
Take your time
I'm gonna make it all good for you baby

Hot like fire
I'm gonna take you
Take you higher
You can't resist
When I taste your lips
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss

C'mon Can you fell us

Ba-Baby
