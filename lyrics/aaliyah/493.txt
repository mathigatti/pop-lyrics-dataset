How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad?
How could the one who made me happy
Make me feel so sad?
Won't somebody tell me, so I can understand
If you love me
How could you hurt me like that?
How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away?
How could the one who said I love you
Say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to
Just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break this heart of mine?
Tell me!


How could you be so cold to me
When I gave you everything?
All my love, all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever
I can't understand

How could the one I shared my dreams with
Take my dreams from me?
How could the love that brought such pleasure
Bring such misery?
Won't somebody tell me
Somebody tell me, please!
If you love me
How could you do that to me?
Tell me!

How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever
I can't understand

How could the one I gave my heart to
(Ooooh ooh uuuh)
Break my heart so bad?
(Break my heart oh oh ooh)
How could the one who made me happy
(Made me so happy,)
Make me feel so sad?
(Oooh hey yeah)
Won't somebody tell me
(Won't you tell me)
So I can understand
(So I can understand heey)
If you love me
(Hey yeah, heeeey)
How could you hurt me like that?
(How could you hurt me?)
How could the one I gave my world to
(Yeah, yeah, yeaaah)
Throw my world away?
(Throw my world awaay?)
How could the one who said I love you
(You said you love me)
Say the things you say?
(But you didn't love me)
How could the one I was so true to
(Oooh ooh ooooh ooooh)
(Yeah, you did) just tell me lies? (you told me lies)
How could the one I gave my heart to
(Ooooh ooooh ooooh yeah)
Make me feel so sad? (heey, yeaah)
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad?
Tell me, ooohh, tell me!
