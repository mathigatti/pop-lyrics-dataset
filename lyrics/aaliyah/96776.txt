Ohhhh no... ohh, oh... mmmm
Oh... ohhhh


Maybe I'm just wrong for feelin the way I do
Thoughts indecent, want to put those down to you
I know you have a girl, I don't want to tie
When you're free one night just make those hours mine

I can be another woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side
That would alright, alright, alright

Love just ain't my thang, but half of you might be
Enough for two or more, no her to me and me
Fine like expensive wine, drunk off one glass of you
I think that might be too much, so weekends for me are cool

I can be another woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side
That would alright, alright, alright

I can be another woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side
That would alright, alright, alright

Alright, alright, alright, alright
