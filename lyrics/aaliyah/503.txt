Heart don't fail me now
Courage don't desert me
Don't turn back now that we're here
People always say
Life is full of choices
No one ever mentions fear
Or how the road can seem so long
How the world can seem so vast


Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
On this journey to the past

Somewhere down this road
I know someone's waiting
Years of dreams just can't be wrong
Arms will open wide
I'll be safe and wanted
Finding home where I belong
Well starting here my life begins
Starting now I'm learning fast

Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
On this journey to the past

Heart don't fail me now
Courage don't desert me
Home, love, family
There was once a time
I must've had them too
Home, love, family
I will never be complete until I find you

One step at a time
One hope then another
Who knows where this road may go
Back to who I was
Onto find my future
Things my heart still needs to know
Yes, let this be a sign
Let this road be mine
Let it lead me to my past

Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
To bring me home
At last
At last
