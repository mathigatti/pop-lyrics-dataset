How could the one I gave my heart to 
Break my heart so bad
How could the one who made me happy
Make me feel so sad
Won't somebody tell me
So I can understand
If you love me 
How could you hurt me like that


How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away
How could the one who said "I love you"
Say the things you say
How could the one I was so true to
Just tell me lies
How could the one I gave my heart to 
Break this heart of mine
Tell me...

How could you be so cold to me
When I gave you everything 
All my love
All I had inside
How could you just walk out the door
How could you not love me anymore
I thought we had forever
I can't understand

How could the one I shared my dreams with
Take my dreams from me
How could the love that brought such pleasure
Bring such misery
Won't somebody tell me 
Somebody tell me please
If you love me 
How could you do that to me
Tell me...

Hey
How could you just walk out the door 
How could you not love me anymore 
I thought we had forever 
I Can't understand

How could the one I gave my heart to (the one I gave my heart to)
Break my heart so bad (break my heart oh)
How could the one who made me happy (you made me so happy)
Make me feel so sad (you made me feel so sad)
Won't somebody tell me (won't they tell me)
So I can understand (so i can understand)
If you love me
How could you hurt me like that (how could you hurt me)
How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away (throw my world away)
How could the one who said "I love You" (you said you loved me)
Say the things you say (but you didn't love me)
How could the one I was so true to 
Just tell me lies (you told me lies)
How could the one I gave my heart to...

How could the one I gave my heart to (oooh) 
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break this heart of mine
Tell me...
