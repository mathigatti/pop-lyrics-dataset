O say, can you see 
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hail'd 
At the twilight's 
last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes 
And bright stars
Thro' the perilous fight


O'er the ramparts we watch'd 
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare 
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof thro' the night 
That our flag was still there
O say 
Does that star-spangled banner 
Yet wave
O'er the land of the free 
And the home of the brave?
