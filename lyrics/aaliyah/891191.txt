What is this numbers in your pocket i remember when you used to
Throw those things away. why do you wanna keep in touch now who
Gave you a reason to act so shady...


Baby you know you can call me anytime anything you need it, i will
Give it to you, that's how much i care for you.

You wanna act now never call me back now, turning off your cellphone,
Girl you know that ain't cool.. i don't understand

Chorus:
Baby it's a shame we gotta
Go through this we can't even talk
Girl we don't even kiss, i never would
Have thought we be breaking up like this
But it's over now, it's over now...

You think that i don't know what's going on cause your always home
Alone and i'm always out of town. you need to stop trying to play me cause
You can't even fake me
