Choosey lover
Boy I’m so proud of you
I’m so glad you chose me, baby (baby)
And I’ll make you so happy


(Thought I had a lover)
Thought I had a lover
But I was kidding myself, baby
(By the time I learned about it)
By the time I learned the truth about it
He was sleeping with someone else
But not you baby

Boy I’m so proud of you

'Cause you're giving me (giving me security)
Giving me security, baby
And you’ve proven what you said (ohh)

Never worried about you baby
Jumping in and out of bed
Ohhhh, but not my baby
