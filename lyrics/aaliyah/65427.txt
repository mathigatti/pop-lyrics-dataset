You wanna handcuff me
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You want my intamacy
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You wanna walla around me
I swear I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You want my lock and my key
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)


Incarceration
What I'm facin'
When I'm with you
You're watchin' my every move
Tryna pick up on some clues
We play twenty questions
Everytime I walk in or out the door
What do ya bother for? (what do ya bother for?)
Get confortable, enjoy

It's gonna take t-r-u-s-t to keep my l-o-v-e
It's gonna take t-r-u-s-t to keep my l-o-v-e
Crackin' stressin' and second guessin'
Many time and time again
We go from lovers back to friends
Got to put this to an end

You wanna handcuff me
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You want my intamacy
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You wanna walla around me
I swear I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You want my lock and my key
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)

No justification for your actions
Should have been somewhere relaxing
Don't compare me to your last one
I can't help it she was a fast one
A sassy one, I'm a classy one
I can't keep them from getting at me hun
Seems like that should make you happy hun

It's gonna take t-r-u-s-t to keep my l-o-v-e
It's gonna take t-r-u-s-t to keep my l-o-v-e
Crackin', I can't deny it why I try to put up with you
These insecurities everyday
Pushing my love away hay

You wanna handcuff me
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You want my intamacy
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You wanna walla around me
I swear I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You want my lock and my key
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)

It's gonna take t-r-u-s-t to keep my l-o-v-e
It's gonna take t-r-u-s-t to keep my l-o-v-e
It's gonna take, its gonna take t-r-u-s-t to keep my l-o-v-e
It's gonna take, its gonna take t-r-u-s-t to keep my l-o-v-e
Crackin'
