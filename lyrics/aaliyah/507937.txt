3 DOORS DONW - LET ME GO
BY BRAD  ARNOLD


ONE MORE KISS COULD BE THE BEST THING
ONE MORE LIE COULD BE THE WORST
NEVER RESTING 
AND YOU'RE NOT SOMETHING I DESERVE
NOW
THIS WORLD FALLS ON ME 
AND MAKE BELIEVE
THIS SEEMS REAL TO ME

YOU LOVE ME, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
I'M TORN BETWEEN  THIS LIFE I LEAD
AND WHERE I STAND
 YOU KNOW WHO  I AM
SO LET  ME GO
 LET ME GO
i dream we head to what i hope for
and i turn my back on loving you
how could this love be a good thing
when i know what i'm going through

in my head there's only you now
this world falls on me
in this world, there's real and make believe
this seems real to me

you love me, but you don't know who i am
i'm torn between this life i lead
and where i stand
you love me, but you don't know who i am
so let me go, just let me go

no matter how hard i try
i cant escape these things inside
i know, i know
but all the pieces fall apart
you will be the only one who knows
who knows

you love me, but you don't know who i am
i'm torn between this life i lead
and where i stand, 
you love me, but you don't know who i am
so let me go
just let me go

you love me, but you don't
you love me, but you don't
you love me, but you don't know who i am

you love me, but you don't
you love me, but you don't
you love me, but you don't know me...
