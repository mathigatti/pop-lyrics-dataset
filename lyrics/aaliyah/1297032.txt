Say what
You look good

You look good good

You look good good good
(say it four times)
Oh oh oh oh good


[verse 1]
I,i, like the way, way you get down, down
(thats the way I like it)
You're the kinda guy
That makes me feel proud
Don't have to show you're the boy, oh
I,i, like you the way that you are

[chorus]
I like my man undecover
Smooth dark brotha
Fly to the bone
You don't need no fly jeep
To come and scoop me
You can drive what you own
(thats the way I like it)
A man undercover
Smooth black brotha
Fly to the bone
Don't need no Gucci Sweater
To make you look better
You can wear what you own

I,i, love, love the way that you smile, smile
You, yo the type of guy
That got his own style
All I want to do is be with you
You, you got me feelin
The way that I do

[chorus]
I like my man undecover
Smooth dark brotha
Fly to the bone
You don't need no fly jeep
To come and scoop me
You can drive what you own
(thats the way I like it)
A man undercover
Smooth black brotha
Fly to the bone
Don't need no Gucci Sweater
To make you look better
You can wear what you own

Say what
You look good
(say it two times)
You look good good
(say it three times)
You look good good good
(say it four times)
Oh oh oh oh good
