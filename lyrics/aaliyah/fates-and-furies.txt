If you and I
Meant to be right here
If you and I
Get threatened by fear
It's not important where we're
From, what we do, what we have right here
As long as you love me right
Sometimes I forget who I am, don't recall where I came from
You know
You know that nobody can touch my heart like you do
I just wanna close my eyes to feel you
I'm thinking of you
Even when I'm trying not to, can you hear me?
Every night and day, I dream of us loving
I'm thinking of you
I give all my love to you, say you love me
Every night and day, I dream of us loving, I do
Dream of us loving, I do


If you and I
Meant to be right here
If you and I
Get threatened by fear
It's not important where we're
From, what we do, what we have right here
As long as you love me right
Sometimes I forget who I am, don't recall where I came from
You know
You know that nobody can touch my heart like you do
I just wanna close my eyes to feel you

I need you here, right here
Don't break me down, don't leave
Don't you go away
You know how I want you to be
By my side, right here
Right now, right here, can you hear me?

I'm thinking of you
Even when I'm trying not to, can you hear me?
Every night and day, I dream of us loving
I'm thinking of you
I give all my love to you, say you love me
Every night and day, I dream of us loving, I do
Dream of us loving, I do

If you and I
