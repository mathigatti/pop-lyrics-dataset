[Jermaine Dupri and Aaliyah]
Hmmm, whoa, whoa, yeah
(I gotcha back)
Oh hey
(I gotcha back)


Verse 1:
I bet women always wonder how I keep my man
They've been trying for so long
And still don't understand
It's not the things I say it's the way I say it
That keeps them locked down, no where to go
And on top of that, I let 'em know

Chorus:
I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act
You'll never have to worry about a thing
I gotcha' back (I got your back)
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
Because it feels real good
When you know somebody gots your back
(I gotcha back)

Verse 2:
I am the type when I find a man I like
It's on and popping, ain't no stopping
The things I do for you
No complications baby, keep it real
Do unto me as I do and everything will be cool
When you find yourself in times of trouble
Remember that I'm by your side (I'm by your side)
Lean on me when you're not strong, I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on

Chorus:
I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act
You'll never have to worry about a thing
I gotcha' back (I got your back)
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
Because it feels real good
When you know somebody gots your back
(I gotcha back)
--repeat 'till ends--
