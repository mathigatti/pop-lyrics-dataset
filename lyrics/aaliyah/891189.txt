Verse One: 
[Trife]
Baby listen, bets to believe
I can give you what you want and all that you need
Mackin' all the ladies, from the fly to the shady
Marquis diamonds, 600 Mersadies
I'll fly you across the seas in a private jet
Whisper shit in ya ear to get ya panties wet, honey I'll show you how
Good life can get, wining and dinning nonchalaunt in the finests 
Resturaunts, feed you lobster because I'm a true mobster!
Lamer niggaz bore ya, lay ya down in the Walldoff Vistoria
Victoria Secrets, lengerie I loves to freak shit
Dim the lights, sex all through the night
King sized beds, Satin sheets gettin' right
Wear you out, leave my number by the phone
In the morn', I'm gone


Chorus:
[Aaliyah]
I wonder if I take you home, 
Would you still be in love baby
Because I need you tonight
Wonder if I take you home,
would you still be in love baby
Because I need you tonight

Home, home
Home, homeeeee

Verse Two:
[Lil' Kim]
Do you know who I be? Lil' Kim the loot teddy (that's right)
Here trying to put it on you fools trying to run up in
(what's the matter Big Momma, don't you like what you see)
Like my girl Mary B. you just ain't runnin' up in me
You got to give me what I need baby, that's a drop top Z baby
Martini and Roxy, icedy Spomaonte`
Dom Perejoun so we can get it on, Movatto watch
Tennis for the wrists, nigga you ain't ever since no ice like this
So now you know what you're working with, handle ya business
And keep coming with that stuff that I like, light a candle
I'm too hot to handle, I see your eyes sizin' up my hips and my thighs
Man I'll do things to you, Vanessa Del Rio would be shamed to do

Chorus:
[Aaliyah]
I wonder if I take you home, 
Would you still be in love baby
Because I need you tonight
Wonder if I take you home,
would you still be in love baby
Because I need you tonight

Verse Three: 
[Kleptomaniac]
Mack ass niggaz, smooth like Tom Cat and ?Masusso?
Games for pro leading parties with bitches and a sex Coupes
Who spittin' game, all without the eye contact
We're all without contracts, laying my game down flat
Kleptomaniac, rides in this rhythm that you give him
I'm that right, let press ya suns you got to get ya skins tight
Catching mobile phones, showing women how to live life
If that's your girl, she wasn't last night
Made her life worth while, Benjamins by the piles
Turn her frowns to smiles, lvin' Goodfellaz life style
Nails done and hair, living rooms with chandelaers
Sex in a strech Lex, no cares for who wanna stare
Yeah now that's a real women for ya, higherd Vecks and lawyers
Pearl gems and tag for ya's, Bachelor Degrees
Bringin' home bacon and cheese, freaky Shaundra ain't afraid to get some
Dirt up on her knees

Chorus:
[Aaliyah]
I wonder if I take you home, 
Would you still be in love baby
Because I need you tonight
Wonder if I take you home,
would you still be in love baby
Because I need you tonight

--Aaliyah adlibs 'till fade--
