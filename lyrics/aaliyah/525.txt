I'm sick and tired of the loose rap
Now now, yeah, for the one


I know you can come better
Can come better than that
So you can kill all your loose rap
Hahaha, baby girl

How many times I tell you don't come to me?
You bringin me all of that jealousy
'Cause you got envy (dont hate me, baby)
Talk smack behind my back
Then when you see me
You try to come up and talk to me (dont talk to me)
I'm not saying nothing (nothing)

I know you can come better
Can come better than that (that)
Dont come here with all that loose rap (loose rap)
You can keep that
I know you can come better
Can come better than that
I'm sick and tired of the loose rap (loose rap)
You can save that

To many times you guys would come step to me
I guess you call yourself booking me
But do I look easy? (well, it ain't easy)
Well, it never hurts to try
I just might let you call me
I hope you don't plan on buggin' me
That would be ugly

I know you can come better
Can come better than that (than that)
Dont come here with all that loose rap
You can keep that
I know you can come better
Can come better than that (that)
I'm sick and tired of the loose rap
You can save that (save that)

I know you can come better
Can come better than that
So you can kill all the loose rap
You can quit that (quit that)
I know you can come better
Can come better than that
So you can stop all your loose rap, your loose rap

To many times I hear trying to knock at my crew
Well, we've got something for all the fools
It ain't just rhythm and blues
If you just quit trying to compete yeah
No telling what you could be
Might even be doper than me, I doubt it!

I know you can come better
Can come better than that (that)
Dont come here with all that loose rap (oh, loose rap)
You can keep that (or save that)
I know you can come better
Can come better than that
I'm sick and tired of the loose rap
You can save that

I know you can come better
Can come better than that
Dont come here with all that loose rap
You can keep that
I know you can come better
Can come better than that
I'm sick and tired of the loose rap
You can save that
