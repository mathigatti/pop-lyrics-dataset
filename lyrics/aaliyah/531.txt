(Never givin' up all this love)
Your all I'm thinkin' of


(Aaliyah)
Sittin' hear in this empty room
thinkin' bout you babe
thinkin' bout all the changes we been through
and i know it might sound crazy but i'm still lovin you
inspite of all the stupid thangz

The way you make me feel i can't explain
but i love what you do what you do to me
the way we made love is drivin' me insane

Never givin' up all this love
Never givin' up your all i'm thinkin' of
(Your always on my mind all the time)
Never givin' up all this love

Never givin' up your all I'm thinkin' of

Feels so strange when i was on the train
I cracked a smile when i thought of you
The thangz that you do
makes me feel so good inside

No need to lie to you
