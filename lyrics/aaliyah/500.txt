Aaliyah's diary
Got it, hmmph


Age ain't nothing but a number
Throwing down ain't nothing but a thang
This lovin' I have for you
It'll never change

Here I am and there you are
Your eyes are calling me to your heart
All you gotta do is knock and I'll let you in
Then we will feel the passion that flows within
I don't mean to be bold but I gotta let you know
I got a thing for you and I can't let go

Take my hand and come with me
And let me show you true ecstasy
Boy be brave don't be afraid
Cause tonight we're gonna go all the way
I don't mean to be bold but I gotta let you know
I got a thing for you and I can't let go

So what's up, here I am, reach
Baby come here
Age ain't nothin' ohhh, ooh
I don't mean to be bold, but I gotta let you know
Liyah's got a thang for and I can't let go
Ooh my
