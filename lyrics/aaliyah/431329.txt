Let me know
Let me know
oooo
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know


When I feel
What I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn
What you think you know

There are times
When I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror
Of what I see

hook:

But at your best
You are love
you're a positve motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know
Let me know
ooo
Let me know

When you feel
What you feel
O how hard for me to understand
So many things
Have taken place before this love affair
Began
But if you feel
More like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times
When I fall short of what I say
What I say im all about
All About

hook

Tell me what it is
(Tell me what it is)
There is no need to make believe
(Make believe no need to make believe)
Look beyond your world
(Look beyond your world)
Try to find a place for me
(Try to find, find a place for me)

hook
