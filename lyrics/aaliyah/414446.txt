Aaliyah, Aaliyah
Wake up!
You've just now entered, into the next level (yes)
The new world of funk (ahhha)
As we do it one time


Creeping through the fog, who dat y'all
(A-A-L-I-Y-A-H)
Creeping through the fog, who dat y'all
(A-A-L-I-Y-A-H)

I've got the beats for da streets
(A-A-L-I-Y-A-H)
Everything I make is so unique (heyy)
(A-A-L-I-Y-A-H)
Say hey if you down with me
(Hey L-I-Y-A-H)
If you step to me there's no need
(A-A-L-I-Y-A-H)

Creeping through the fog, who dat y'all
Damn she be the bomb, damn (say what?)
Creeping through the fog, who dat y'all
Dang, damn she be da bomb
Creeping through the fog, who dat y'all

Wake up
Goodnight
