It be the R, O, C,
Stop the sh*t, 
ain't nothin' change in this bendy drop,
I take ten out, believe me, Bleek and out,
that you ain't liven' for the moment,
ma get out, you know the whips sink,
plus it's missin' the top, 
you wanna roll with the rock,
then come get hot,
I got no take, cause the wrists it sparkle,
beats bark, new sh*t, black sparkle
come on,


(Aaliyah)
All my clothes are tailer made,
and yes I got a house right on the lake,
you know I be spendin' everyday,
don't matter cause all my bills are paid,
Drop top bently, gucci shades
Jammin' in Vegas for a day,
As well as I do intimidate,
And sixers can date me cause I'm made.

(Chorus sung be Aaliyah)
(you) See, I'm liven' the good life,
I'm partyin' every night,
I'm watchin' the Crystal flow,
V.I.P. and that's all i know,
Just liven that good life, (good life)
still partyin' every night, (every night)
still watchin' the Crystal flow, (Crystals flowin')
V.I.P. and that's all I know.

(Aaliyah)
I could jet to Amsterdam,
13 karrets on my hands,
Wallstreet says I'm doin' fine,
Drop cash for all country side,
payin' showfers, butlers, maids,
runnin' up my bills everyday,
country clubbin' with rich friends,
tomorrow I'll do it all again.
