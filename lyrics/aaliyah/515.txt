Choosey lover, boy I'm so proud of ya
I'm so glad you chose me, baby
And I'll make you so happy


Thought I had a lover, but I was kidding myself, baby
By the time I learned the truth about it
He was sleeping with someone else
But not you, baby

Choosey lover, boy I'm so proud of ya
I'm so glad you chose me, baby
And I'll make you so happy

Cause you're givin' me
Givin' me security, baby
And you've proven what you said (Ohh)
Never worried about you, baby
Jumpin in and out of bed
Ohhhh, but not my baby

Choosey lover, boy I'm so proud of ya
I'm so glad you chose me, baby
And I'll make you so happy
