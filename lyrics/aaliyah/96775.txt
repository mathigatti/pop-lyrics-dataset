Baby Baby Baby...... I Wanna Satisfy You.
Maybe I Try Too Damn Hard, To Show You I Love You.
What Made You Go And Run This Game On Me?
When I Stayed By Your Side,
What Made You Go And Leave?


Im Tired Of My Heart..... Being Broken.
Im Tired Of These Tears..... Falling Down My Face.
Im Tired Of This Love..... Being Taken For Granted.(Wont You Go Your Way)

You Dont Know, How I Feel..... Im For Real.
I Used To Be In Love,...... But Not Nomore.
When Will You Learn That I Got Feelings Too?
You'll Never Know Untill It Happens To You.

Im Tired Of My Heart..... Being Broken.
Im Tired Of These Tears..... Falling Down My Face.
Im Tired Of This Love..... Being Taken For Granted.(Wont You Go Your Way)

Theres One Thing I Gotta Ask of You,
One Thing, Gotta Ask Of You (Gotta Ask Of You)
If This Is True (True)
Why You Took Your Love Away?
Why You Took Your Love Away, From Meeee
Theres One Thing I Gotta Ask of You,
One Thing, Gotta Ask Of You (Gotta Ask Of You)
If This Is True (True)
Why You Took Your Love Away?(Whyyyyy)

Im Tired Of My Heart..... Being Broken.
Im Tired Of These Tears..... Falling Down My Face.(Falling, Falling)
Im Tired Of This Love..... Being Taken For Granted.(Wont You Go Your way)
