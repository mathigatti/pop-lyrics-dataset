You and me got a street thing going on

Now that we have come to know each other
I'll never go away, love will always stay here forever
Cause this thing we've got is very rare (yeah)
So don't ever go nowhere
No, because


Cause you and me got
A street kinda thing going on
And I'm so happy that I found you
Our love ain't going nowhere
It's gonna stay right here
Right here forever

You'll never have to ask a second time
I'm the one for you, you're the one for me, so there's no doubt in my mind (no)
Boy this love we have is oh so real (oh, yes it is)
That's why I'm never going nowhere, no

Cause you and me got
A street kinda thing going on
And I'm so happy that I found you
Our love ain't going nowhere
It's gonna stay right here
Right here forever

Yo Liyah, why don't you take it to the bridge
And let 'em know how you really feel

You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But, boy, I gotta let you know
My love will always be

You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But, boy, I gotta let you know
My love will always be

You can climb
Swim the deepest sea
Hey, my love will always be, hey
You can climb, swim the deepest sea
I gotta let you know my love will always be
Yes it will, swim the deepest sea
I gotta let you know, gotta let you know
You can go searching, but you will never find
Someone like me to love you nowhere, no way, no how
You can take a trip all around the world, you will never find
Another girl who's gonna love you like I do, hold you like I do
Yeah
