So, he got big brown eyes, so he built nice
Ooh, Comin' on strong, six pack showin'
Oh, He's too cool for his own shoes
Ooh, Nothin' rude, but way too sure for me!


He try to be extra smooth, extra smooth
Extra cool extra cute
Am I suppose to talk to you, be your boo
Don't come tryna be extra smooth

So, he got line for line, wastin' my time
Frontin in the ride tryna to catch my eye
Disturbin' my groove tryna be smooth
Get the boot

Boy you can go 'head
And work on yourself another quick romance
A little too hot for me
You act like you already got the number

Ooh I wish you quit tryna be..
Extra smooth extra smooth
Extra cool extra cute

If I'm supposed to talk to you, be your boo
Don't come tryna be..
Tryna be extra extra extra smooth
See he wanna be, see he wanna be smooth
Extra extra extra cool
See he tryna be, see he tryna be cool
I won't talk to you, won't be your boo

Talk to you won't be your boo
Extra extra extra
Tryna be extra extra extra smooth

Tryna be extra extra extra smooth
See he wanna be, see he wanna be smooth
Extra extra extra cool
See he tryna be, see he trya be cool

I won't talk to you won't be your boo
Talk to you won't be your boo
Extra extra extra
Tryna be extra extra extra smooth

Trya be extra extra extra smooth
See he wanna be, see he wanna be smooth
Extra extra extra cool
See he trya be, see he trya be cool
I won't talk to you won't be your boo

Talk to you won't be your boo

Trya be extra extra extra smooth
