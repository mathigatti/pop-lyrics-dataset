Whaa?
I'm back
[verse1]
You don't say that I'm pretty
All these simple things
Adding up to big ones
There is where you messed up
No movies or flowers
Hours not knowing
Whereyou are or who you're with
There is where you messed up
[Chorus]
You keep on actin' like
I really need a brother
Man I don't need a brother
Better get you're ish together
Can't keep on holding on
Waitin'for you 
And baby there is where you messed up
You keep on actin like 
Ireally need a brother
Man I don't need a brother
Can't keep on holding on
Waiting for you
And baby there is where you messed up


You keep on actin' like 
I really need a brother
Man I don't need a brother
Better get you're ish together
Can't keep on holding on
Waitin' for you
And baby there is where you messed up
[VERSE 2]

And baby there is where you messed up
You take me for granted
And expect me to stay right here
