Hey there, help me
With this night gown, don't peek
I'm so tired, pamper me
My door's open, and that don't mean leave, hey

Don't let me fool ya
Boy you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
Very, very moment, yeah
Come here and let me school ya
This is how it's done
Boy you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on

[Static Major]
Don't rush, but don't wait
Don't talk cause it's gettin' late
Sit right here, next to me
What's up? The talk is cheap
This is your chance
To prove that you got the skill
You said you could give me the chills
What's all this, all up to you
But you don't know what to do

Boy you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
