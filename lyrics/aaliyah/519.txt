Boy, you know you make me float
Boy, you really get me fly
I feel like I have hope
'Cause you
You serve me on a regular


Boy, we need to tie this rope
Before we drift any deeper
Ready now hold me close
Lets take this over board now
I want you to

Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat

Work it in the middle
Work the middle
Work the middle
Work the middle

Change positions
New position

New position

Now stroke it for me
Stroke it for me
Stroke it for me
Stroke it for me

Ooh, baby, I love your stroke
'Cause you
'Cause you get me where I'm going
In jury you'll get my vote
'Cause I believe
I believe you know just
What you doing, now

Baby, now we can coast
Let's don't get in a hurry
That's too slow
Go ahead and put
That thang in overdrive now

Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat

Work it in the middle
Work the middle
Work the middle
Work the middle

Change positions
New position

Now stroke it for me
Stroke it for me
Stroke it for me
Stroke it for me

Stroke it for me
Hmm, stroke it baby stroke it baby
Hmm, work it baby work it baby
Ooh, stroke it
There is something I want you

I want you to use yourself
Like you never ever used it before
To explore my body (explore it, baby)
Until you reach the shore
I'll be callin' callin' for more

Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat

Work it in the middle
Work the middle
Work the middle
Work the middle
