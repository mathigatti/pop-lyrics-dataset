Chorus 2x
I ain't never had a girl run game like you
Ain't never felt the way I felt about you
Ain't never had to beg,
Nor do I want to start
So if you gonna play me you can walk


Thought you was at the mall,
Shoppin' with your friends
Lookin' for a dress for a wedding you was in
Just the other day,
Stopped in at your work
You wern't there,
Can't believe what I heard

She the girl with the long hair? (Yeah that's her)
You mean the one that works upstairs? (um hm, yeah that's her)
She been seeing my boy 'bout three months now (What?)
If that's the same girl we talkin' 'bout

Chorus 2x
I ain't never had a girl run game like you
Ain't never felt the way I felt about you
Ain't never had to beg,
Nor do I want to start
So if you gonna play me you can walk

[phone conversation]
Let me hit this girl up.
See what the hell she talkin' 'bout
I know she there… I know she there…

(Aaliyah)
… Um, Hello?

Boyfriend 1:
Now can you tell me what I'm hearin' ain't true,
Don't want to be a fool for trustin' you
I've givin' you all that I had to give
So why you want to go on and go do this?

Aaliyah:
Well I don't know whatchu talkin' 'bout, no no

Boyfriend 1:
No I think you do,
'Cause I got him on the line listenin' in to you

Boyfriend 2: Wassup?

Bboyfriend 1:
So whatchu gotta say now?
Or do you still say you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

Chorus 2x
I ain't never had a girl run game like you
Ain't never felt the way I felt about you
Ain't never had to beg,
Nor do I want to start
So if you gonna play me you can walk

Aaliyah:
Now don't be callin' me with all this drama you got

Boyfriend 1:
Whatchu talkin' 'bout?

Aaliyah:
And don't you realize that it's close to three o'clock?

Boyfriend 1:
It shouldn't matter now!

Aaliyah:
Didn't I tell you that I'll never do you wrong?
And who's this kid you got on the phone?

Boyfriend 1:
Ooohh! Whatchu tryin' to say you don't know who I am?
When just the other day you was callin' me your man

Aaliyah:
Well I can't lie,
I guess it's time that I, I… (Ooh yeah)
Tell You Both Bye, Bye!
