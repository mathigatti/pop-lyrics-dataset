I got a car a j-o-b
I'm an independent man, God is blessing me
A lot of girls that I can call
9 Times out of 10 I don't call them at all


The fun and games is overdue
I miss havin' someone to answer to
I got a house, I got a key
There's one more thing that I really need

I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause I'll be your man plus your friend (well here I am)

Since I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause we can be lovers and friends (well here I am)

I saw you out with all the guys
I love the way you look with those big brown eyes,yeah
And if it were up to me
We'd both run away and start a family

And on a scale from 1 to 10
I'm giving you 11 boy, you're worth that 1
Only you can rescue me
I will provide anything you need

I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause I'll be your man plus your friend (well here I am)

Since I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause we can be lovers and friends (well here I am)

I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause I'll be your man plus your friend (well here I am)

Since I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause we can be lovers and friends (well here I am)

I'm tryin' to prove to you
I think I'm ready for you
Baby, don't fight my love
Baby, invite my love
Haven't I proved to you
I know I'm ready for you
Baby, don't fight my love
Baby, invite my love

I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause I'll be your man plus your friend (well here I am)

Since I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause we can be lovers and friends (well here I am)
