Chorus:
Representin' for the ladies 
Hangin' outside
Takin' in light
(You know I'm comin' back, Tell me if you're ready)
Breakin it down for the fellas
Keepin' it smooth
Keepin' it tight
(You know I'm comin' back, Tell me if you're ready)



1st Verse: 
Hey You

You wanted to partay
Well I 
Feel The Same 
So I'm willin' to show ya
What the music does to me oh baby

Hook: 
It's in the rhythm and it's givin' me emotion (Givin' me babe)
I often find it in strong culiminic potion

And I have come back to thank you ooooooooooooooo)

Representin' for the ladies

Keepin' it tight
(You know I'm comin' back, Tell me if you're ready)

We're having a good time
And just lay back

Since we partied all night
Like tonight
