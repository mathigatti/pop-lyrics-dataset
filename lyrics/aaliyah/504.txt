More Than A Woman


Passion, instant
Sweat me, feel me
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing
Tempt me, drive me
Feels so exciting
Thought of highly
It's yours entirely


I'll Be...
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your others
I'll be...
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you
Ill be more...
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
Making love under covers
I'll be more...
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you

Midnight grindin'
My heartrate's climbin'
You go, I go
'Cause we share pillows
Taste me, Feed me
There's still no separating
Morning massages
With new bones in your closet

I'll Be...
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your others
I said Ill be...
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you
Ill be more...
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
Making love under covers
I'm gonna be more...
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you


I don't think you're ready
I don't think you're ready
For this thang
For this thang
I don't think you're ready
For this thang
You're not ready
I don't think you're ready
For this thang
This thang, this thang
I don't think you're ready
For this thang

Constant pressures
No scale can measure
Secret treasures
Keeps on getting better
Do you wanna roll with me?
We can go to foreign lands
Your hand in my hand
Do you wanna ride with me?
We can be like Bonnie &amp; Clyde
Be by your side

I'll Be...
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your others
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you
I, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
Making love under covers
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you
