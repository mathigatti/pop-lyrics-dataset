Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeats racing
Tempt me, drive me
Feels so exciting
Thought of highly
It's yours entirely


I'll be
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your lover
I'll be
I'll be more than another
More than a woman
More than enough for you
I'll be
(i'll be more) more than your lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) even more undercovers
I'll be
(i'll be more) more than a lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) more than enough for you

Midnight grindin'
My heartrate's climbin'
You go, i go
Cause we share pillows
Chase me, beat me
There's still no separating
Morning massages
With new bones in your closet

I'll be
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your lover
I said i'll be
I'll be more than enough for you
More than a woman
More than enough for you
I'll be
(i'll be more) more than your lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) even more undercovers
I'm gonna be
(i'll be more) more than a lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) more than enough for you

I don't think your ready
I don't think your ready for this thing
For this thing
I don't think your ready for this thing
You're not ready
I don't think your ready for this thing
This thing, this thing
I don't think your ready for this thing

Constant pleasure
No scale can measure
Secret treasures
Keeps on getting better
Do you wanna roll with me?
We can go to foreign lands  your hand in my hand
Do you wanna ride with me?
We can be like bonnie &amp; clyde
Be by your side

I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your lover
I'll be more than enough for you
More than a woman
More than enough for you
(i'll be more) more than your lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) even more undercovers
(i'll be more) more than a lover
(more) more than a woman
(more) more than enough for you
