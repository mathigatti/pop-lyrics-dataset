1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 90
Aaliyah's in the house
Fools!
So check, check, check it out


The time has finally come to save my beats
With the funky hip-hop swing!
A funky swing I might add!

Ooohhh, check it!

No holding back now is the time, to get busy!
So take me to the bridge!

I work hard for mine, spending all my time
To give you what you need!

Yeah, come on, come on, come on!
So if you're down with this funky flavor, throw your hands up!
And if you got the fever for Aaliyah, throw your hands up!
And if you down with blackground, throw your hands up!
And if it got soul, let me see your hands up!
If you got bass in your jeeps, throw your hands up!
If you're not down with the crack, throw your hands up!
And if you think you're hype enough to swing it, throw your hands up!
And if you're down with the second chapter, throw your hands up!

Straight from the streets is where I'm coming from!
Straight out the streets

With the touch of jazz in me, check it
Take in no shorts when it comes down to shows!
I got to wreck it!

Wreck it!
So take me to the bridge

Haha
So if you're down with the PA, let me see your hands up!
And if your head is bobbing to the track, throw your hands up!
And if you got loot in your pocket, throw your hands up!
And if you not foul, let me see your hands up!
And if you're protected and you know it, throw your hands up!
And if R. Kelly's record's sharp, let me see your hands up!
And if your body's swinging to the track, throw your hands up!
And if you want some more of the flavor, throw your hands up!

Uh, uh, uh yeah, yeah!
Yo Aaliyah bust a freestyle!

This is for the jeeps
Strictly for the jeeps
This is for the jeeps
