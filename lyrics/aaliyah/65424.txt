She's back on the street she's here for the night
Fills you with grief she cuts like a knife
Make you do things that no others could do
She turns a professor into a fool
Oh she ain't hard to get, the girl gets around
Those that she met are destined to drown
She'll make ya change like you never believe
She turns a working man into a thief
Oh



She's Erika Erika Erika Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica 
She's Erica Erica Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica Erica Erica Kane
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica (Erica Kane)


Oh back on the block she's at it again
She'll be your best friend as long as you spend
I know she's torn whole families apart
She'll shoot a poison arrow straight threw your heart
Oh this is the day for Erica Kane
There's nothing to lose, none for her to gain
She'll make a honest man steal from his folks
And drain a millionaire man until he go broke


She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica 
She's Erica Erica Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica Kane
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica (Erica Kane)


She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica 
She's Erica Erica Erica Erika (Erica Kane)
She's Erica Erica Erica Kane
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erika (Erica Kane)


I really don't think you should mess around
Cause all she'll do is bring you down
And there's nothing for you to gain
And she goes by this name...


She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica 
She's Erica Erica Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica Erica Erica Kane
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erika (Erica Kane)


She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica 
She's Erica Erica Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica Erica Erica Kane
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica Erica
She's Erica Erica Erica (Erica Kane)
