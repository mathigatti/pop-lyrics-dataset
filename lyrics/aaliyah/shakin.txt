The 90s baby, 90s floor (what?)
Yeah Dj Timie Temp (what?)
All you want's to choose
The moment you've been waiting for
Freak freak, baby girl come on!


[Aaliyah]
Hey there, you nasty boy, it's been a minute (minute)
And I could say my life has changed, since you hit it, (hit it)
This is your strongest trait, you work the middle (baby)
While they say I'm sprung, I'll say, maybe a little

[Timbaland]
I like movin' to the little bit (to the little bit girl)
I like getting to the middle baby (middle)
Oh, can you see me coming? ( do you see me coming?)
I don't want you to see me coming (hey)
I want to be up on the sneak attack (wooo)
Cause I want to hit it from the back (ohh)
Baby I like shakin', (shakin') ooh, baby I got you shakin'

She said they all just the same when she loving them
I'm Mcnabbin, out of pocket, I'm so Donovan
The quick fix to all her broken promises
I'm 7-11 in that thing, thank you come again
That's All night, all pipe, she alright
I hit it once, she called twice, that's called life
That hotline bling'n off how I sling it
She telling all her homegirls 'bout it, it ain't no secret
It's Hard to shake it off when I keep you shakin' baby
That On-demand, pay per view, where your patience baby?
Go Rowdy Rod Piper when I just pipe her
I kinda like her so it's a must that I change her life up
