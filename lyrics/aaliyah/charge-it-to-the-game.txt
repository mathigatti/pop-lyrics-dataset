I can't believe you're telling me these things boy


If you ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood
If you ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood, no love

Want this be fast
Oh boy you'll never last
My body's just talking right
Can't come with just all night
Boy you don't know me
Try and you'll see
So what you telling me
Won't spend my day on me

[Static Major &amp; Aaliyah]
And I don't know if we gon' ever change
Ask the next man, he'll probably say the same
I can't believe you're telling me these things boy
Don't help me, just charge it to the game

[Aaliyah &amp; Chris Brown]
You ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood
If you ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood

[Chris Brown]
When I'm around her, you know you get
Say she loves me, she loves me, you did
I do you right, that's what you get
When you leave who you think she staying with?
Okay now baby b-baby
I know you really wanna, now you really wanna leave
You can be my girl
I know you wanna, I know you really wanna be
Girl you don't know me
Try and you'll see
Cause what you telling me
I can't get rid of

[Chris Brown &amp; Aaliyah]
I can't believe you're telling me these things boy
Girl I won't be phased, you think I'm gonna last
Girl what I'm talking about, baby you're on my mind
Girl you don't know me

You ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood
If you ain't no good, you ain't no good
You gets no love in my hood

When I'm around her, you know you get no love
Say she loves me, she loves me you get no love
I do you right, that's what you get no love
When you leave who you think she staying with?
