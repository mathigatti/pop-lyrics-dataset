Its whatever

Verse 1

Just like the bird
That whistle in the trees
It in the leaves
So happily
Well You're my tree
And through the storms
You stood strong for me
Kept me warm as can be ( Warm as can be )
Like a candy
To an apple
Oh we go together
You're so sweet on me ( Oh so sweet )
I can say that i do believe
This is destiny
It keeps callin me

Chorus 1

Now its me and you
You and me
And its whatever
Whatever you want it to be
I'm tellin you  ( I'm tellin you )
If it's up to me
Whatever is whatever
Its whatever with you and me ( You and me) ( Whatever )

Verse 2

Just like a breeze
In the middle of a summer's eve
When you come through
You comfort me ( Oh you comfort me )
If i'm a drink
You're my lemon squeeze
Oh you got flavor boy
You go good with me
So boy don't play or tease me
Ooo We we're together
You got what i need
Now it's getting late ( Getting late )
It's after 3 (Its after 3 )
So quit your stallin'
My bodys callin'

Chorus 2
Now it's me and you ( Now it's me and you )
You and me ( You and me )
And it whatever
Whatever you want it to be
I'm tellin you  ( I'm tellin you )
If it's up to me
Whatever is whatever
As long as it's you and me

Bridge

Whatever is whatever
Whatever
It's whatever  ( Whatever )
It's your world
I put that on everything
It's your world ( Your world )
Your world
Yeahhhh

Chorus 1

Whatever is whatever
Baby ( fades )
Whatever is whatever
