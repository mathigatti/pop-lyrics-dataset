[First Verse]
Well now I guess it's time for me to wreck shop,
so show your peace while the beat drops,
and if you're in the house just throw your hands up,
and let me see my brothas and sistas spread luv.
And if you're not down there's sumthin wrong see,
cause see my project homies, they got my back G,
droppin a old school with a new school..
PA's in the house and it's a good thang..


[chorus repeat 4 times]
Well if you down with the clique,
let me hear you say (I'm down wit it)

[Second Verse]
Now it's a phone checker, I mustn't do this and if you didn't know I thought you knew this,
It took a little time but now it's on see you been waiting for so long to beep me..hmmm...
so check check check it out, all the dogs in the house (woof woof woof),
so pump your fist in the air, say R. Kelly's on the track and it's a good thang.

[chorus]

[Third verse]
Now I don't mind when my homies on the chit chat,
but when it's time to...ain't no get backs,
see I am what I am when I jam so as the beat slams I'll make U say (Gotdamn)...
Now if you not down with my clique, 
you can just doo-doo on a stick and if you down with Liyah I'm glad you feel the same..
Boy it feels good to know you're in my good thang

[chorus]

[break it down]
tonite is the night that I... 
I take you boy and I put you in my good thang all night...

[R. Kelly:] First we have the Black ground posse in her clique,
then we have the funky second chapter in her clique.
PA's in the house and yes you know they're in her clique
and all the project homies are down with the clique,
well now we have the double x-tra large in her clique
plus we have the DA to the Smahd in her clique,
then we have the down town possee in her clique,
Peace to the hood cause ya down with her clique.

[chorus repeat til' fade out]
