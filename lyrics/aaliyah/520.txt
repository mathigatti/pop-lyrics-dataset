Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know


When I feel
What I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times
When I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are loved
Your a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know
Let me know

When you feel
What you feel
Oh how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken the least before this love affair begins
But if you feel
Boy like I feel
Confusion can get weighed out
For there are times when I felt sure of what I say
Of what I say I'm all about

But at your best you are loved
Your a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know
Let me know

Tell me what it is
I don't feel the need to make beleive

Cus at your best you are loved
Your a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know
Let me know

Ha ha how noo
Please stay at your best, baby
