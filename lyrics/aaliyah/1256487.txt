Giving Up

Giving up is hard to do 
When you really love someone 
Giving up - so hard to do 
When you still depend upon 
His warm and tender touch 
His kiss and his caress
Oooooh they used to mean so much 
And bring you happiness 
ooo ooooooh 


Giving up - so hard to do 
I've tried 
But it just ain't no use 
Giving up - so hard to do 
I said I've tried 
But it just ain't no use 
But my light of hope is burning dim 
Oh but 
But in my heart I pray 
That my love and faith in the man 
Will bring him back to me 

I'm talking 'bout if you really love somebody

Whether,
Whether he knows or not 
He really needs me too
I said the man is all I got 
Yes he is 
And giving up, giving up is so hard to do 
Giving up 
So hard to do 
Heey, heey, giving up 
So hard for me to do
I said I've tried 
Hey, Can't break through
I don't want to lose you 
Cause you mean so much to me 
Givin up
