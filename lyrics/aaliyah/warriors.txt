We're warriors
Unstoppable


We feel the evil coming
And shadows all around
Danger surrounds us but wont bring us down

We're on the edge of greatness
Turning darkness to light
We're right beside you ready to fight

We must be strong (we must be strong)
And we must be brave (we must be brave)
We gotta find every bit of strength that we have and never let it go

We're bound to this struggle
With mighty sword and flame
We'll never fail you when you call our name

Together we'll be heroes
Joining forces as one
Strong as the steel we carry
We ride like the sun

We must be strong (we must be strong)
And we must be brave (we must be brave)
We gotta find every bit of strength that we have and never let it go
We must be strong

'Cuz we're warriors, we are unstoppable
Nothings gonna get in our way

We're gonna win in the end
We must be strong
And we must be brave (we must be brave)
We gotta find every bit of strength that we have and never let it go

We must be strong (we must be strong)
And we must be brave (we must be brave)
We gotta reach inside stand together and fight never let it go
We must be strong
