Like the homeless in the road
I'm starving in my soul
They can't get me to go
If there is no you...


Just like a rose
I sat and watched us grow
And you never hear me low
I know this love is true
We've seen it through
It's crazy like the blues
And I've always stuck with you
I want to help share your love
It can't be sold
It can't be priced with gold
And you've always took control
Right now I know...

[CHORUS:]
I'm on steady ground when you're around
(See you always bring comfort to me)
I'm on precious ground when you're around
(And you've always been so precious to me)
I'm on protected ground when you're around
(Because I always feel so safe around you)
I'm on steady ground when you're around
(And I always feel this way when you're around)

When you're around
You hold it down
You put it down
Piece of the ground (???)
You changed my frown
When love's tuned loud
The sweetest sound
Always there when I...

[CHORUS x2]

Ain't no doubt in my mind
Guess I can't stop destiny
Got to be the best for me
From love you cannot run
Even under the gun
At the end of the day
No use looking around
Right now I'm on steady ground
Ain't no doubt in my mind
Guess I can't stop destiny
Got to be the best for me
From love you cannot run
Even under the gun
At the end of the day
No use looking around
Right now I'm on steady ground
