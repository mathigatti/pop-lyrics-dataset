You don't say
That I'm pretty
All these simple things
Adding
Up to
Big ones
There is where you messed up
Movies
Flowers
Hours
Not knowing
Where you are
Or who your with
There is where you messed up

You keep on acting like
I really need a brother
Man I don't need a brother
Better get your act together
Can't keep on holding on
Waiting for you
And baby there is where you messed up
You keep on acting like
I really need a brother
Man I don't need a brother
Better get your act together
Can't keep on holding on
Waiting for you
And baby there is where you messed up

I don't need your
Money
No dinners
I've got jewelry
To win or
To lose
And baby there is where you messed up
You take me
For granted
And expect me to
Stay right here
And wait on you
While you have your fun
There is where you messed up

You keep on acting like
I really need a brother
Man I don't need a brother
Better get your act together
Can't keep on holding on
Waiting for you
And baby there is where you messed up
You keep on acting like
I really need a brother
Man I don't need a brother
Better get your act together
Can't keep on holding on
Waiting for you
And baby there is where you messed up

Heading straight for the gate
It's time to cut my dead weight
With you
And baby that is where you messed up
I heard it all thousand time
Try to mess with my mind
And you
And baby that is where you messed up
She don't need you dog
That's where you went wrong
I don't need you dog
See there is why you messed up
She don't need you dog
That's where you went wrong
She don't need you dog
And there is where you messed up

You keep on acting like
I really need a brother
Man I don't need a brother
Better get your act together
Can't keep on holding on
Waiting for you
And baby there is where you messed up
You keep on acting like
I really need a brother
Man I don't need a brother
Better get your act together
Can't keep on holding on
Waiting for you
And baby there is where you messed up
