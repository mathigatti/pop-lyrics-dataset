Verse 1:
This is where I've got to draw the line.
'Cause I refuse to let you think you can play with my mind.
Always seems that you think that I'm blind.
'Cause theres always certain times when you're hard to find.


You're on the go, I'm on the go, we're on the go.
I can't catch you no more, can't see you no more.
And it no longer can be ignored.
'Cause that once upon a time it was you I adored.

You disappeared and left me here out in the cold.
And the absence of you is hurting my soul.
Didn't know that was an end of the road.
It was so easy for you just to let it all go.

Chorus:
(And I refuse)
I refuse to have one more sleepless night.
(I refuse)
I refuse to let a tear fall out my eye.
(I refuse)
I refuse to continue to try.
I felt like I would die. Or I could break down and cry.

(And I refuse)
I refuse to let you walk back through that door.
(I refuse)
I refuse to let you hurt me any more.
(And I refuse)
I refuse to continue to ignore
The fact I fell to the floor the day you walked out my door.

Hook:
(And I refuse) No way I can take it baby,
(I refuse) No way I can take it baby,
(And I refuse) No way
But I refuse to take it any more.

Verse 2:
Remember when I told you I could feel the change. (Change)
You don't touch me the same(the same), nor hold me the same(thesame).
Now I don't want you to take all the blame.
Cuz I know I had those moments when I caused the pain.

This back and forth, just like a war, with you and me.(with youand me)
See we both disagree, have we ever agreed?
This ain't nothing like I thought it would be.
Was it all just a dream, was it ever  in my reach?

Chorus:
(And I refuse)
I refuse to have one more sleepless night.
(I refuse)
I refuse to let a tear fall out my eye.
(And I refuse)
I refuse to continue to try.
I Felt like I would die. Or I could break down and cry.

(And I refuse)
I refuse to let you walk back through that door.
(I refuse)
I refuse to let you hurt me any more.
( And I refuse)
I refuse to continue to ignore
The fact I fell to the floor the day you walked out my door.

Bridge:
It was your way, or it was no way,
And I couldn't live that way.

It was our call, and then it was your call.
'Cause I gave you my all and all.

Chorus:
(And I refuse)
I refuse to have one more sleepless night.
(I refuse)
I refuse to let a tear fall out my eye.
(And I refuse)
I refuse to continue to try.
I felt like I would die. Or I could break down and cry.

(And I refuse)
I refuse to let you walk back through that door.
(I refuse)
I refuse to let you hurt me any more.
( And I refuse)
I refuse to continue to ignore
The fact I fell to the floor the day you walked out my door.

Hook:
No way I can take it baby,
No way I can take it baby,
No way
But I refuse to take it any more.

No, no, no way I can take it baby,
No, no, no way I can take it baby,
No, no way
But I refuse to take it any more.

(And I refuse)
(I refuse)
(And I refuse)

(And I refuse)
(I refuse)
(And I refuse)

Said I refuse to take it anymore
