CHORUS: 
You used to love them, leave them, kiss them
Break their hearts, but now I got you in my arms
You used to get them, trick them, diss them
Do them wrong, but now your playa days are gone


VERSE1: 
Everybody knew about you baby and the games you played
Couldn´t count the names, faces and numbers
Nor the times you laid down
But somebody knew about you baby and that you´d change
It was me 'cause I could see my love would turn you around

CHORUS: 
You used to love them, leave them, kiss them
Break their hearts, but now I got you in my arms
You used to get them, trick them, diss them
Do them wrong, but now your playa days are gone

VERSE2: 
I always say never say never boy, but you did
That's when I took your mind and flipped the script
Your boys talkin' 'bout you're falling off
And that you're whipped
But who are they to say when it's all my love I give to you

CHORUS: 
You used to love them, leave them, kiss them
Break their hearts, but now I got you in my arms
You used to get them, trick them, diss them
Do them wrong, but now your playa days are gone

RASHAD'S RAP:

CHORUS: (until fade out)
