[Intro x2: Timbaland]
It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky


[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
What would you do, to get to me?
What would you say, to have your way?
Would you give up, or try again
If I hesitated to let you in?
Now would you be yourself or play your role?
Tell all the boys, I keep it low
If I say no, would you turn away
Or play me off, or would you stay?

[Hook]
And if at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (and again)

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
I'm in to you, you into me
But I can't let it go so easily
Not 'til I see, whether this could be
Could be eternity, or just a week
Ayo our chemistry is off the chain
It's perfect now, but will it change?
This ain't a yes, this ain't a no
Just do your thing, we'll see how it goes

[Hook]

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
You don't wanna throw it all away
I might be shy on the first date, what about the next date
Huh, huh, huh, huh
I said you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be bugging on the first date, what about the next date?
Huh, huh, huh, huh

[Hook]

[Break]

[Hook x2]

[Interlude x2: Timbaland]
It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky

[Hook: Aaliyah &amp; Timbaland]

[Outro: Timbaland]
It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky
