[Drake + Static Major]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, hey there, help me
I've been away too long and I know you'd agree
I'm so tired, but I can't sleep
My door's open and that don't mean leave
Know what I mean?


[Aaliyah + Drake]
Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me (oh shit)
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Boy, you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

[Static Major]
Don't rush, but don't wait
Don't talk 'cause it's gettin' late
Sit right here, next to me
What's up? Your talk is cheap

[Aaliyah]
Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Boy, you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

[Drake]
You know I gotta ask, what's up with the friends that you bring?
Know you got some other cool friends that you never bring
New stories for you every time the phone ring
They don't understand, girl if anything you're everything
Oh lord, good lord, smoke a little, then record
You know Papi on the vocals, 40 on the boards
Call me when you feel inspired, never when you're bored
And have a real conversation with your fuckin' boy
With the fuckin' man, Mr. Lover-Lover-Man
How come everything is on the other hand?
How come you ain't never busy when I'm busy
But the moment that I'm free you always end up with some other plans?
How you make a good dude wait so long?
I don't understand why, that's some girl shit
And what you doin' in the bedroom with your clothes on?
I want you wearin' what you came into the world with

[Aaliyah + Static Major]
This is your chance to prove that you got the skill
Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
You said you could give me the chills
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Well it's all up to you
Boy you gotta push my buttons
But you don't know what to do
The ones that turn me on, turn me on

[Aaliyah + Static Major]
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Hey, woo!
Girl this very, very moment, yeah
Yeah, yeah
