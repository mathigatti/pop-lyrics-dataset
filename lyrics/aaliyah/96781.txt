It's all because of you I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away and now my life is filled with rainy days


No days go by I'm thinking of you
And no way can I forget the things you do
[repeat]

You're on my mind all day and night
You're all I'm thinking of the way you treat me right
My days with you are here no more
We had some good days I know for sure

[chorus]
No days go by I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget( I can't get you off my mind)
The thing you do
[repeats]

We've got a special thing I never could explain
Straight up the way I feel it doesn't seem real
I never meant to hurt you don't go nowhere
Cause you know this heart I'll always share

You said your love was true but I don't see that
You left me alone broke up this happy home
Why'd you have lie

No days go by I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget ( you are always on my mind)
The thing you do

My love
And on and on and on
