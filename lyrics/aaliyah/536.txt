There we go, okay, okay
Don't do me Greasy, okay


Uh, ay yo
You know what a dog needs
Do you really know what a dog needs?
Uh a dog needs a bitch!
What? What? A dog needs a bitch!
Come on

Not just any bitch but a real bitch
That's gonna hold that dog down
Arf! Arf!

Baby I am what I am, I'm gon' be who I be
Everything from chasing a cat to pissin' on a tree
Let me see what I gotta to see
Do what I gotta to do
Dog for life but keep it true

Every once in a while I'll break out the backyard to roam
And get reckless
But I still know that home is home
And when I get there I'ma sit there
Take a shit there
Put my dick there
Do I handle my business?
Shit yeah

I'ma run till I bust my gun and empty the clip
Never come home, I gotta go just gimme the whip
I ain't got time for the lip
Just open the fence
Let me go I'll come back
I ain't got time to convince

Ever since I was a pup
I've been stuck with the street shit
Keep the heat shit
Fuck it nigga gotta eat shit
I past on a weak shit
If it's out there I want it
All at one time
So when it's my time, I've done it

[Aaliyah]
I know you'd kill for me
You'd die for me
I know you like to rip and run the streets
But I get nervous sometimes
Baby, I can't help to think
You might not make it home to eat
I barely sleep

Could you pick up the phone and call me at home?
And let me know you ain't in some heat
And don't go crying, you're grown
You know I'm looking out for you
Cause you be looking out for me, me, me

Chorus:
(Yo you can go with your dogs)
If you make this promise to me
You'll make it back in one piece
(So you can go with your dogs)
If you make this promise to me
You'll make it back in one piece
(Boy, you go back and you ball)
But you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
(I know you up in it all)
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece

And oh boy I know you got to do what you do, ooh-ooh
You're making moves, I'm makin' moves yo we cool
(What? What? What?)
Lay on your paws I got your back if you fall, hey-hey
Nothing's too big, nothing's too small just go ball, yeah

Uh dog tags around my neck the streets are mine
I might leave the heat behind
Cause in the streets I'm fine
That's why nigga sleep till nine
Out by ten back by ten
Sleep till nine do it again

If you love something let it go
If it comes back to you it yours
If it doesn't fuck it you'll never know
You got me I got you, uh
Dog with a dog, ride till we die
If it's on then it's on

Repeat Chorus to End
