The Aaliyah Song by Boyz II Men

 

[Nate]:
Ooooooaaahh, ooohh yea
Oooooh, Aaliyah
Every once in awhile
I see her smile
It turns my day around
Girl with those eyes
Could stare through the lies
And see what your heart was saying


[Nate]
Chorus:
Think of Aaliyah
Laugh, don't cry
I know
She'd want it that way.. hey yea
When ya think of Aaliyah
Laugh, don't cry
I know
She'd want it that way

Ooooooh
Friend of a friend
Friend 'til the end
That's the kind of girl she was
Taken away so young
Taken away
Without a warning, oh
