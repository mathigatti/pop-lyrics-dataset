No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do 
No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do


Liyah you're the only one for me,[3x]
the one for me, the one for me

[chorus]

No one knows how to love me quite like you do... [4x]

[Verse 1]

When it comes down to the things I like
Boy, you know just how to satisfy me
You pick me up when I'm down, you put my feet on solid ground
And you make me your first priority

[Bridge]

(Keep it comin') keep it comin', babe
(Cause I like it) cause I like it, babe
Don't stop cause no one knows...

[chorus]

[Verse 2]

When there are clouds on a rainy day
You know how to bring sunshine to my life
And I've never felt this way before
You make me feel like I'm your goddess

[Bridge]

[chorus]

[rap]
Well it's the L-I-Y-A-H plus the second chapter
R Kelly's spitin' tracks, as if it were tobacco
It's the ninties, time to get the pockets phat
So when I say "book", you say "read that"
Now back to the matter of the song
No one knows how to love me like you do
I got words for you...
Uh! Forever my man!!!

[chorus]

Liyah you're the only one for me, [3x]
the one for me, the one for me [till fade...]
