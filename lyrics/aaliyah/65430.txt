It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needing you, wanting you
Said I need you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you


Off to college, yes you went away
Straight from high school, you up and left me
We were close friends also lovers
Did everything for one another
Now you're gone and I'm lost without you here now
But I know I gotta live and make it somehow
Come back, to me
Can you, feel me, calling
Hear me, calling, for you
For you 'cause it's

It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needing you, wanting you
Said I need you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

Now I'm sitting here, thinking about you
And the days we used to share
It's driving me crazy, I don't know what to do
I'm just wondering if you still care
I just wanna let you know that it's killing me
I know you got another life you gotta concentrate baby
Come back, to me
Can you, feel me? (Calling)
Hear me, calling, for you
For you 'cause it's

It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needing you, wanting you
Said I need you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needing you, wanting you
Said I need you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

I can't be no more
Since you went away I don't really feel like talking
No one here to love me, baby do you understand me?
I can't do a thing without you

It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needing you, wanting you
Said I need you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do
Said I been needing you, wanting you
Said I need you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do
Said I been needing you, wanting you
Said I need you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you
