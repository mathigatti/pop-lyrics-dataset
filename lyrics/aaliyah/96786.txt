[chorus]

Young nation under a groove
Keeping it smooth with a jazz that's so cool
Young nation under a groove keeping it smooth
Young nation under a groove
Keeping it smooth with a jazz that's so cool
Young nation under a groove keeping it smooth


[Verse 1]

As I'm strollin' down the park with really nothing on my mind
Laid back and I'm just thinkin' of old times
Pumpin' our Isley Brothers tape when I'm waxin'
Peepin' through my sapeau checkin' out my waxin'
Hey! I gotta say today's a good day for me the lover on the way
Ho! Time to hit the six-four
And pump the bass and I'm Just a little known
Aaliyah's in the house so I think you'd better check my flow
Hello! Hello!
I'm the young nation and young nation is me
So here we go from the one the two and to the three-ee-ee

[chorus]

[verse 2]

I check my celular because my beepers beepin'
Booty calls are creepin'
Fellas on the corner beepin' me (Wassup, wassup)
Don't set it off
So I pick up my girls and hit the streets just because...
Jazz-aray, it's Saturday and...
The sun is blazin', and so I'm lazin'
And if you are a YNP and you're rollin' with the PGP, congratulations
I know I got the skills to make you trip
R Kelly's flippin' tracks so grab a hold and don't you sit
The nigga diggin nation that's a sooner gets my grip
So raise your hands if you're sure...
Are you a young nation?

[chorus]

[verse 3]

Well, six o' clock, girls are round and now I'm steppin'
Stop to get some dressin', to the mall I'm flexin'
You know to get them funky croaka-sacks
Tonight I'm hittin' the town, ain't holding nothing back
Hey!, Well alright tonight is the night
Well I'm in the mood for celebration, or even some jazzy conversation
Hey! It's O.K here I come so anyway
I'm the young nation and young nation is me
So here we go from the one the two and to the three-ee-ee

[chorus 2x]

Hey! It's a great day, the lover on the way, Young Nation...
