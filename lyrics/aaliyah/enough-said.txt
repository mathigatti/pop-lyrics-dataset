Went from my nigga serving it by the tele to venues in manchester
Just swerving with balotelli the fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit's embarrassing (I just wanna cry)
They even bring up these niggas make a comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding (I just wanna cry)
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin (I just wanna cry)
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something
Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city, this shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This is shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know

[Aaliyah]
Can't you talk to me?
Let's talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need
Just tell me baby, just tell me baby
Be allow, settle down
You’re not just alone
Sometimes for you
Sometimes you love all alone
Needing love, needing lobe
But there's no doubt, no doubt around the love
So don't just shut me out
Cause that's not what love's about
Tell me why?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (no, I can’t baby)

Came too far to give up, gotta try
'Cause I can't do it on all alone (ooh ooh)

Can you talk to me?
Can you talk to me?
Tell me what you need
Can you talk to me?
Can you talk to me?
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
