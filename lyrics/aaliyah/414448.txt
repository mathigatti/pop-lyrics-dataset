[Aaliyah]
Ooh who keeps calling you
Boy I ain't scared of you
No no see I got your number
Tell me who you snuck and gave your number to.


[Ginuwine]
Ooh your tripin' now (see you trippin')
Girl quit fussin' now
Naw you can't go jumpin to conclusions
It's ringin' but that doesn't mean I've been foolin'
does it?

[Chorus]
Not right now I'm busy 
Call me in the morning whoa-whoa-oa-oa
Your telphone's awful busy
They callin' in the morning
That was your final warning
Don't call me in the morning whoa-whoa-oa-oa

[Aaliyah]
Who keeps buggin' you
Or who's been lovin' you
Tell me "Are You"...
"Are You That Somebody?"
Or is it you've been lovin' on somebody else

[Ginuwine]
Woo what the hell you talkin' 'bout?
And could you put that finger down
I'm always going to be the "Same Ol' G"
Are you leaving or stayin' with me?
Tell me....

(Aaliyah &amp; Playa Repeat Chorus 1x)

[Aaliyah]
Someone keeps buggin' you, tell me

(Aaliyah &amp; Playa Repeat Chorus until fade
