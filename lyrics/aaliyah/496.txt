If your girl only knew
That you was tryin to get with me
(What would she do)
If your girl only knew
That you was dissin her to talk to me


CHORUS:
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that he was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

If your girl only knew
That I would want to kick it with you
And if your girl could only see
How you be callin me
Gettin fresh with me

*CHORUS*

She's crazy to put up with you
Oh boy I won't be no fool
If you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me
But it's dumb to put up with you
I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me

*CHORUS*

She would probably leave you alone

*repeat*
If your girl only knew

*Timbaland*
What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, huh?

*Fade Out*
