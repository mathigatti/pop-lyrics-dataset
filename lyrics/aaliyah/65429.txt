Ooh
Mmm mm mm
Mm yeah
Uh, mm, yeah


I just touched down
Quarter after two
I know it's late
I'm calling you
Tryin' to figure if I 
Can come see you
(Can I come see you?)

I know you're asleep
But you're on my mind
I'm wide awake
And I wanna stop by
So you can get up
And get out of the bed
Cuz I wanna see you
And I been wondering....

Can I come over?
Can I (come over)
Stop by (come over)
To see you (come over)
Tonight (can I come over?)
Can I (come over)
Get wit' ya (come over)
I just wanna (come over)
Be wit' ya babe

Can I come over?
Can I (come over)
Stop by (come over)
To see you (come over)
Tonight (can I come over?)
Can I (come over)
Get wit' ya (come over)
I just wanna (come over)
Be wit' ya babe
What the deal?
I'm not that far
I just got my bags
And I'm headed to the car
Say yes or no
Cuz I'm on the road
(Wait a minute, my battery's low.. alright)

Baby I wanna come see you
Said I really wanna come see you
Don't you worry about a thing
I'm just wantin' to hold you
Praise you, I want to guide you, tell you
How much I love you, I need you, I miss you

Can I come over?
Can I (come over)
Stop by (come over)
To see you (come over)
Tonight (can I come over?)
Can I (come over)
Get wit' ya (come over)
I just wanna (come over)
Be wit' ya babe

Can I come over?
Can I (come over)
Stop by (come over)
To see you (come over)
Tonight (can I come over?)
Can I (come over)
Get wit' ya (come over)
I just wanna (come over)
Be wit' ya babe

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh oh, oh, ooh ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh oh, oh, ooh ooh

Can I come over?
Can I (come over)
Stop by (come over)
To see you (come over)

Get wit' ya (come over)
I just wanna (come over)
Be wit' ya babe
