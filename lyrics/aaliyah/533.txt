Late afternoon
Something's going down
I ca, ca, call on your cell
(Why's he in such a hurry)
Leaving the room
He's mumbling, too
Knocked out with his shoes
(He's leaving another boot)
No explanation
No actual location
Just watching and pacing
(Wonder who he's chasing)
Little conversation
Even motivation
He looked at the ceiling
You better open your mi, in, ind
CHORUS:
Gotta read
Between the lines
You gotta read
Between the lines, ines
You gotta read
Between the li, ines
You gotta read
Between the lines


9 in the morning, up, up
Up waiting for breakfast
He's getting more restless
(Who is this fool of questions)
Little replying
Whole lot of denying
He's still colliding
(So why do he keep on trying)
Sexual domedian
Now he's a comedian
That's all the more reason
(He's changing like seasons)
Are you still pleasing?
Will soon you be you leaving?
Which one will be grieving?
You better open your mind

Repeat chorus

Your vibes are getting old
It's in his eyes
Gotta read
Between the lines
Lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes
Gotta read
Between the lines
(Repeat)

I hope u don't think
You're pullin' all over me
'Cause I, I know
What's going on
I hope you ain't been planning
On runnin' me
'Cause that, that ain't
For no more
If you don't think
You're pullin' all over me
'Cause a, look up
I'll be gone
If you been making
Plans on runnin' me
'Cause I'll
Read between the lines

Who got you thinkin' you ishh
Ain't been stinkin'?
Might as well quit ya speakin'
(Why is your belly speakin)
Bustin' his bubble
And he know he in trouble
He's talkin' in doubles
(I'm listening but hardly believing)
Changing the story
And trying to ignore me
He's still reaching out for me
(He's steadily hardly breathing)
Give me a reason to
Put you back on the line
You've wasted enough time
I had to open my mind

Gotta read
Between the lines-ines
You gotta read
Between the li, ines
You gotta read
Between the lines, ines
You gotta read
Between the li, ines
You gotta read
Between the lines, ines
You gotta read
Between the li, ines
You gotta read
Between the lines

Your vibes are gettin' old
It's in his eyes
Gotta read
Between the lines
Lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes
Gotta read
Between the lines
