Ooh... Ooh
Hey... ey... ey... ey
N, n, n, n, no, no, no


It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do 
Said I've been needin you wantin you
Wonderin if you're the same and
And who's been with you
Is your heart still mine
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

Off to college
Yes you went away
Straight from highschool
You up and left me
We were close friends, also lovers
Did everything for one another
Now you're gone
And I'm lost without you here now
But I know I gotta live and make it somehow
Come back... to me (to me)
Can you... feel me (callin)
Hear me... callin (for you) 
For you...'cause it's

It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do 
Said I've been needin you
Wantin you
Wonderin if you're the same and
And who's been with you
Is your heart still mine 
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

Now I'm sittin here
Thinkin' bout you
And the days we used to share
It's drivin' me crazy 
I don't know what to do
I'm just wonderin' if you still care
I don't wanna let you know, that it's killin' me
I know you got another life
You gotta concentrate baby

Come back to me(to me)
Can you feel me (callin)
Hear me callin (for you) for you
'Cause it's

It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do 
Said I've been needin you
Wantin you (wanting you baby)
Wonderin if you're the same and
And who's been with you
Is your heart still mine 
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do 
Said I've been needin you
Wantin you
Wonderin if you're the same and
And who's been with you
Is your heart still mine 
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

I, aye aye aye aye aye I aye aye aye aye aye
I aye aye aye aye aye I aye aye aye aye aye
I miss you

I... can't... breathe... no... more
Since you went away I
Don't really feel like talkin'
No one here to love me
Baby do you understand me
I can't do a thing without you

It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do 
Said I've been needin you 
Wantin you
Wonderin if you're the same and
And who's been with you
Is your heart still mine
I wanna cry sometimes (Yeah)
I miss you
Yeah yeah yeah
