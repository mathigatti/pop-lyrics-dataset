Hmm, yeah, yeah, hey
Oh, hmm, yeah, oh yeah


I know in my heart
I know in my mind
We were meant to be
Are you feeling me yo?

I'm the girl in your life
I'm the one you call wife
And I need to know
Are you feeling me yo?
Is there anyone else?
That can do it the best
Give you things you need
Well it must be me
I've got very good dreams
And the fantasies
But I need to know
Are you feeling me yo?

Boy, are you feeling me?
'Cause I'm feeling you
Something in my heart
Tells me you're the one
Boy, are you feeling me?
'Cause I'm feeling you
Something in my heart
Are you feeling me yo?

I'm crazy for you
I'm falling for you
I've got feelings for you
Are you loving me, yo?
Tell me if it's our time
Do I blow your mind?
Cause I need to know
Put my life on the line
I'mma give you my heart
All the love that I own
But before I do that
Are you feeling me yo?
Anything for you
Cause I'm big on you
But I need to know
Are you loving me, yo?

Boy, are you feeling me?
'Cause I'm feeling you
Something in my heart
Tells me you're the one
Boy, are you feeling me?
'Cause I'm feeling you
Something in my heart
