Oooooh ooooh ooooh oooh
Oooooh ooooh ooooh oooh


[chorus]

I'm down with the way that you want me to be
And I would do anything for you baby
I'm down with the way that you want me to be
And I would do anything for you

[verse 1]

Boy there's no need to look no further
Cause everything you want is right here
And I don't mind giving you what you want
Just as long as you stay near me

[Bridge]

Put a message in a bottle baby
And send it to me, I'll come runnin' to you
Beacuse baby I'm down

[chorus]

[verse 2]

I have no doubt in my mind you are the one for me
So there is no need to be insecure see
I'm so glad to know we got a street thing going on
So here I am baby, just bring your loving on, on, on

[bridge]

[chorus]

I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
[chorus till fade...]
