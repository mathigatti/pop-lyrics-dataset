See you either in the studio
Or on the go
I'm on the road
With my clique
We cannot quit
'Cause I know you want some more
I do more than sing
I'm a hit writer now
I'm in stable now
'Cause I got my own label now
Interviews that I do
With my crew
We can choose
Cuz we can loose
We pay dues
And I know you want some more
I trully believe that
If you knew the real me
Then you'd know I do this shit for free (free, free, free...)

I don't think they know

Thank you for the autographs
Energy is what it gives
You still find me
You can't doubt me
I think you want some more
I do more than sing
I'm older now
Actin' now
'Cause I got my own movie now
After all
Through all this
You can give me
You still find me
You can't play me
You can't doubt me
And I think you want some more
I trully believe that
if it was not for you
I don't know what I would do (ooh...)

All we're tryin'to say is
It's not about the monopoly
It's only about the love we see
He'll be up in her space

It's all about the love you show
And we just want you to know
We'll be there to be your soul (We all can see you)
Demonstrate through our thing (yeah...)
