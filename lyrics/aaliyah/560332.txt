All alone on a Sunday morning 
Outside I see the rain is falling 
Inside I'm slowly dying 
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying 
And you 
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow 
Set this place on fire 
'Cause I'm tired of your lie 
All I needed was a simple "Hello" 
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry 
(I) I gave you my love in vain 
My body never knew such pleasure, 
My heart never knew such pain 
(And you) You leave me so confused 
Now I'm all cried out, over you. 


[112] 
Cryin' over you, yeah 

Never wanted to see things your way, 
Had to go astray 
For why was I such a fool (Why was I such a fool) 
Now I see that the grass is greener 
Is it too late for me to find my way home, 
How could I be so wrong? 

[Allure] 
Leaving me all alone 
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno 
Romance up in flames, 
Why should I take the blame? 
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry baby) 
Apology not accepted 
Add me to the broken hearts you've collected 
(I) I gave you all of me (Gave you all of me) 
How was I to know, 
You would weaken so easily 
(I) I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do) 
Now I'm all cried out (All cried out) 
Over you 

(I) I gave you my love in vain 
My body never knew such pleasure, 
My heart never knew such pain 
And you 

[112] 
You left me so confused 

[Allure] 
Now I'm all cried out 
Now I'm all cried out 
Over you
