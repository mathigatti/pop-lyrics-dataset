I know in my heart
I know in my mind
We were meant to be
Are you feelin' me yo?
I'm the girl in your life
I'm the one you call wife
And I need to know
Are you feelin' me yo?


Is there anyone else
That can do it the best?
Give you things you need
Well it must be me

I got very good dreams
I got fantasies
But I need to know
Are you feelin' me yo?

Boy boy, are you feelin' me?
Cause I'm feelin' you
There's somethin' in my heart
Tell me you're the one
Are you feelin' me?
Cause I'm feelin' you
There's somethin' in my heart
Are you feelin' me yo?

I'm crazy for you
I'm fallin' for you
I got feelins for you
Are you lovin' me yo?

Tell me if it's our time
Do I blow your mind?
Cause I need to know
Put my life on the line

Imma give you my heart
All the love that I owe
But before I do that
Are you feelin' me yo?

Anything for you
Cause I'm big on you
But I need to know
Are you lovin' me yo?

Boy, are you feelin' me?
Cause I'm feelin' you
There's somethin' in my heart
Tell me you're the one
Are you feelin' me?
Cause I'm feelin' you
There's somethin' in my heart
Are you feelin' me yo?
