Gave you chances
On top of chances
Opportunities
Taken for granted
My reality
Is all your exshalities
'Cause insanity
Why you askin me?
Took my kindness
For a sign of weakness
My own blindness
'Cause my sadness


No longer am a slave
Over your madness
I am glad it's finally over

Who do you think
You are now?
I can't believe aah
You've got the nerve boy

See I'm tired of all the games
That you seem to like to play
See what you can do for me
Is forget you knew my name

See your qualities
Are Less than pleasing
I got more than One
Reason for leaving
It's time to close shop
Open new chapters
See new beginnings
Is What I'm after
Get your skeletons
Up Out my closet
Don't make me lose it
I just might lose it
