Yo turn my music up
Up some more
Up some more
Up a little bit more


Mama always told me to be careful who I love
And daddy always told me make sure he's right
I always had my eyes on this one paticular guy
I was to shy so I decided to write

I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write them, he better get it on time

People always say-ing that I play myself for you
They say that you don't even notice me
Baby when I get the nerve to come to you
Promise me that you won't dis me

I'm writing you a love letter tonight
You better keep watch cause the mailman's coming
(Ohhh yes he is, ohhh)
I'm writing you a love letter tonight (tonight)
Better keep watch cause the mailman's coming
(Ohh)

Get it on time
