[v.1] [Slick Rick]
Like Everyone Was Chasing My Finance.
But When Aaliyah Walked In, The Whole Place Went Bananas.
Im Playin For Most Of My Perks.
(And They Offerin The Hunk Free Krystal. The Works)
Not To Mention, Smelled Good. Looked Dope.
I Brought Me A Bottle So I Wouldnt Look Broke.
Stepped Like A Big Willie, WoodgeWell, Playa,
Sign This Thousand Dollar Bill For Me Aaliyah.

[Aaliyah]
I Used To Go Out To Partys, And Stand Around.
Cause I Was Too Nervous, To Really Get Down.
But My Body Yearned To Be Free.
I Went Off On The Floor, So Somebody Would Choose Me.
No More Standing, Upside The Wall.
Now I Got Myself Together Baby, And Im Having A Ball.
Long As Your Groovin, Theres Always A Chance.
Somebody Watchin, Might Wanna Make Romance.
Move Your Body, (Ooooh Baby) And Dance All Night.
To The Groovin, Feel All Right.
Move Your Body (Oh) And Move Your Feet.
Cause The DJ's Grooin, (Ohhh) And It Sounds So Sweet.(C'Mon)
Then Just Party, All Night Long.
Cause This Party Is Jumpin, Till The Break Of Dawn.

[Slick Rick]
Well I Peeled Off One More Thousand, And Hand Her.
One More Please For My Girlfriend Amanda.

Wanna Buy You A Drink,
Tell Shorty Not Now.

[Aaliyah]
