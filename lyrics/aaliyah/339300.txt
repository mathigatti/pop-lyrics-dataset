If i had one wish boy,
I'd wish you next to me
And it could be in summer, fall or spring, boy
'cause you make my heart sing
I wanna give my heart, my soul, my love to you
Oh baby
'cause every day i'm not with you
I'm missing yoyu like crazy
I need for you...
(chorus)
I need for you to love me, hold me, touch me


Down deep in my soul never let it go
Of the love we share, no one compares to you
I'll never let you go, oh no
If you must knoe the truth, boy
I'm nothing without you
Now i know what people mean, boy
Because you give me joy, good love,
Good times, such happiness

Oh yea
And every day i thank the lord for you
I feel so blessed
I need to...

(chorus)

If you only knew
What you really do
Ain't never had no one that does it quite like you do
You could spend half a lifetime
Trying to find one like you
Thats why i'm so glad i found you
I wished upon a star and it came true
Darling i need for you

(chorus)
