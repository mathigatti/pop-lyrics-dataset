This Is David Nevermind
And today's controversy is coming from yet another member
Or should I say members, of the hip hop community
Petey Pablo, a new artist signed under Jive
Has teamed up with Timbaland, out of V.A.
In a quest to redeem the title
And Bring North Carolina, and Virginia, to the front of the line
We're gonna stay by


[Chorus 1]
This one's for North Carolina! C'mon and raise up
Take your shirt off, and twist is 'round yo head
Spin it like a helicopter
South Carolina! C'mon and raise up
This one's for you, uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us! it's uhh..
Ooh, Hot Atlanta! C'mon and raise up
Take your shirt off, and twist is 'round yo head
Spin it like a helicopter
Stand up Virginia! C'mon and raise up
This one's for you, uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us! it's uhh..

[Petey Pablo]
Who am I? Petey Pab motherfucker
I'm The First puttin' it down for North Carolina
But guess what? (what) it's been worth it
I'm a superstar, bought me a big ol' car
Four point Six (see the car?)
Black fifty four, from the front to the back
Got a button in the middle that makes a trunk go, eh eh
But it ain't bout that, it's about gettin' what you get and drivin all back here
Big Fellas (six fellas)
Half of me, and Carolina niggaz dont have enough time together
Polk, Bladen, Marshall, Hoke, Green County, Timbaland (damn!)
Transfer, Sandy Ridge, browns over here (greens over here)
Pasqoutank, down on the Odom East (let me think)
Johnson County, Franklin, Burgaw, Newport, Warren, Shelby, Kenansville
Man Catantwa Tarboro, Triangle, Goldsboro, Halifax, Statesville
And all my niggaz doin' life behind the walls
This right here, right here, right here, this one's for

[Chorus 2]
New York City! C'mon and raise up
Take your shirt off, and twist is 'round yo head
Spin it like a helicopter
Ah, Jersey To Philly! C'mon and raise up
This one's for you, uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us! it's uhh..
Ay, D.C. To Maryland! C'mon and raise up

Spin it like a helicopter
Houston to Dallas! C'mon and raise up
This one's for you, uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us! it's uhh..

[Petey Pablo]
Beat it, Beat it
You remember them days y'all, we use to play y'all
The radio and put our own lil part in the song y'all
We use to (rep our city! rep our city!)
Runnin' through the school halls
Just before our basketball pep rally jumped off
My house, my home, my hood
My brother my sister my cous
My nigga that was there from the beginning
Been wit me, even before I even been wit the world
Y'all niggaz just glanced at it, then we got y'all starin at it
But it's been the same old North Carolina that's been there
Y'all niggaz is gettin it, oh it's a shame isn't it?
Oh you thought we said we were comin' with a whole lot of songs
We were bullshh!

[Chorus 3]
New Orleans! C'mon and raise up
Take your shirt off, and twist is 'round yo head
Spin it like a helicopter
Ah St. Louis! C'mon and raise up
This one's for you, uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us! it's uhh..
Man, M-I-A! C'mon and raise up
Take your shirt off, and twist is 'round yo head
Spin it like a helicopter
All the way to L.A.! C'mon and raise up
This one's for you, uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us! it's uhh..

[Petey Pablo]
Man I had to do it
Just incase you were one of the ones that wanted to come and ask somethin' stupid!
(Whatchu think you doin') What it look like? Puttin it down for my niggaz on the south side
North Carolina, South Carolina, and all my little bitty, hooks and cape towns
We gon' hit y'all ass, it's nothin' but a T.D. blast, that we got comin' at ya
(Beat) slammin', (first) classic, go for this, what's after platinum?
(Baby you'll walk the ball) and I don't mean to scare y'all but I'ma bout to bring it home
Blow these fellas, these hills, these things and N.C. out the water
How's it feel to lose a motherfucker that's real
Tell 'em (I TOLD EM!)

[Chorus 4]
This one's for Chi-Town Playas! C'mon and raise up
Take your shirt off, and twist is 'round yo head
Spin it like a helicopter (c'mon c'mon c'mon)

[Reporter]
Uh, a-after seeing this, I, I have no other questions
I, I mean I, hey look this is David Nevermind
I'm signing off, but before I'm outta here
But Remember, if I ever talked anything about the Polk guys, nevermind
North Carolina and V.A., are definately at the front of the line
You have my vote and support, over and out

(music until fade)
