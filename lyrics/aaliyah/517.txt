I gave it all to you
With no questions asked
I wanted a future
Who cares 'bout the past
That first argument
You up and left (up and left)
I've seen a change in you (change in you)
Words I won't accept
I thought I had lost you
When you twist back my arm
Cuz the man I thought I knew
Would do me no harm
And that ran through my mind
Over again, I promised myself
You wouldn't put your hands on me again
Never no more


I didn't sleep that night
And I held my pillow tight
Now trust me when I say
You have been told
I'm tellin you to never touch me no more
Never no more

I should have left you
When you called me out my name
I stooped to your level
Replied you the same
Now here we are again
You at my throat
Now I see the same old change
That I did before
I walked away from you
At the drop of a dime
Saw that this treatment is way out of line
And it ran through my mind
Over and over again, I promised myself
You wouldn't put your hands on me again
Never no more

You know I'd rather give you your space
Cuz I just don't know
What, to or to say
Stay out your way or get in your face
I just know you better not touch me again
Oh I, I'm walkin away
That is one game I refuse to play

Oh, I didn't sleep that night
I held my pillow tight
Now trust me when I say
You have been told
I'm tellin you never to touch me no more
Never no more

Never no more
