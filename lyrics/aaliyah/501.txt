Mmm yeh yeh
a special smile
a certain touch
i never had a love that i loved so much
when i look back you're everywhere
turn the page
you were there


my very best friend
my summer day
my only someone to depend on when i've lost my way
you came and answered my every prayer
turn the page
you were there

what would i do if some strange morning
i opened my eyes to find you gone
i can't imagine how i would survive that
find another reason to go on

my one sure thing
my solid ground
all i ever wanted was the love that we found
when i look back you're everywhere
turn the page
you were there

what would i do if some strange morning
i opened my eyes to find you gone
i can't imagine how i would survive that
can't imagine how i would go on

a special smile
a certain touch
i never had a love that i loved so much
when i look back you're everywhere
turn the page
you were there

you came and answered my every prayer
turn the page
you were there
