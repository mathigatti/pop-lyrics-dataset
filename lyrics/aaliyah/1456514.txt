Well, honky-tonk baby get on the floor
All the cats are yellin they're shoutin for more
My baby likes to rock, my baby likes to roll
My baby does the chicken and she does the stroll


Well shake it
Yeah shake it
Yeah shake it
Everybody shake it
Shake it at the high school hop


Well Sock-hop baby

Roll up her crazy jeans

Gonna rock to the music

Gonna dig the scene

Shimmy to the left
Guys and girls:
Cha-cha to the right
We're gonna do the stomp till broad daylight 

Well shake it
Yeah shake it
Yeah shake it
Everybody shake it
Shake it at the high school hop

We're gonna alley-oop on blueberry hill

Party with Lucille we wont be standin still

Hand-jive baby, do the stomp with me
A calypso- do the slop, gonna bop with mister Lee

Well shake it
Yeah shake it
Yeah shake it
Everybody shake it
Shake it at the high school hop

Shake, Rock and Roll
Rock, Roll and Shake
Shake, Rock and Roll
Rock, Roll and Shake
Shake, Rock and Roll
