*Timbaland*
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me
East coast feel me
West Coast feel me (repeat x 4)


Boy, I've been watchin you
like a hawk in the sky at night
Cause you are my prey (my prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin heads
I know that one of these days (days)
We gon hook it up while we talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I been holdin back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell it but

CHORUS:
If I, If I let you know you can't tell nobody
I'm talkin bout nobody
Are you responsible
Boy i gotta watch my body
cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me your that somebody

Boy, won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block while everyone sleeps (sleeps sleeps)
I'll be waitin there with my dukes, my locs, my hat
Just so I'm low key
If you tell the world
(don't sleep, you know that we'll be weak)
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart,
my soul I probably shouldn't let ya but

CHORUS:
If i If I let this go
you can't tell nobody
I'm talkin bout nobody
I hope your responsible
Boy gotta watch my body
cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me your that somebody
