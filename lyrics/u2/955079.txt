Jah love 
Old folks dying in the heat 
Jah love 
Young men dying in the street 


Cities of concrete and glass 
All will turn to sand 
None of them will last 
But Jah love 
Jah love 
Jah love 
Jah love 

Jah love 
Let freedom pour, let freedom run 
Jah love 
Let every heart beat as one 
We make one step, Jah does the rest 
Jah loves everything, that has breath 

Cities of concrete and glass 
All will turn to sand 
None of them will last 
But Jah love 
Jah love 
Jah love 

Steel towers rise, to pierce the sky 
While the children, hurt and cry 
Jah will wipe away the tears from their eyes 
Jah love 

Oh Jah love 

Jah love 
Lift our hearts and free our minds 
Jah love 
Justice the wonder and a sign 
Under the shadow, the eye of the clock 
We fight for a future, on this sovereign rock 

Cities of concrete and glass 
All will turn to sand 
None of them will last 
But Jah love 
Jah love 
Jah love / Never fade away 
Jah love / Yeah 

Dip me in the water 
Make me like the land 
Glory to our father 
His kingdom is at hand 
See the living order / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one 
Spread over the land / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one 
The hearing of the nation / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one 
Seat of every man / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one 

Dip me in the water / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one 
Make me like the land / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one 
Glory to our father / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one 
His kingdom is at hand / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one 
See the living order / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one 
Spread over the land / Heart, heart, heart, hearts, all hearts, beat as one
