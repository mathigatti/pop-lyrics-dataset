I was drinking some wine, and it turned to blood
What's the use of religion, if you're any good
I know i'm weedkiller honey, and you're sugar
If you're the prosecution, I get away with murder


If you were ice, I'm water
And with your telescope, I can see further
We're binary code, a one and a zero
You wanted violins, and you got nero

You're gravity, searching for the ground
You're silence, searching for a sound
Your heart is aching, your heart is my home
It's fascinating, I know I'll never be alone

I'm rippin' the stitches
You got two hands to rub
I'm in the ditches
Of someone else's love

Love is when I lie
Love puts the blue back in my eye
Love will come again
I'll be gone again... again

If you're hunger, baby let me feed it
If your heart is full, baby let me bleed it
And happiness is for, those who don't really need it

You love me too much
You always loved me too much

When I was rippin' the stitches
You got two fists to rub
I'm in the ditches
Of someone else's luck

Love is when i lie
Love puts the blue back in my eye
Love has come again
I am gone again

Love's got to be with the weak
Only then love gets a chance to speak
Love will come again
I'll be gone again... again

I... I can't escape myself
I hear you talk
Feeling nothing
I fear nothing
Fear....

I can hear so much
Fear nothing
Ican hear so much
Fear nothing

Love has come again
I am gone again

Love is the end of history
The enemy of misery
Love has come again
I am gone again

Love is justice, not charity
Love brings with it a clarity
Love has come again
I'm alive again
Alive...

I am alive, baby I'm born again and again
And again, and again and again and again
Again...
