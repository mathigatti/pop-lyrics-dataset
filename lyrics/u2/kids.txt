When I turn around, I don't want to see anyone sitting down. Ladies and gentlemen, we are in the company of greatness tonight. let me hear it for bono.

Me no bubblicious
Me smoke heavy tar
Me be grooving slowly where you are
Notify my next of kin
'Cause I'm never coming back
I've been dropping beats since back in black


And we'll paint by numbers, 'til something sticks
I don't mind doing it for the kids
So come on, jump on board
Take a ride, yeah
You'll be doing it all right
Jump on board, feel the high
'Cause the kids are alright

You've got a reputation
Well I guess this can be explored
You're dancing with the chairman of the board
Take a ride on my twelve cylinder symphony
But if you got other plans
The purpose of a woman is to love her man

And we'll paint by numbers, 'til something sticks
What
I don't mind doing it for the kids
So come on, jump on board
Take a ride, yeah
You'll be doing it all right
Jump on board, feel the high
'Cause the kids are alright

I'm gonna give it all of my loving
It's gonna take up all of my love
I'm gonna give it all of my loving
It's gonna take up all of my love
I'm gonna give it all of my loving
It's gonna take up all of my love
I'm gonna give it all of my loving
It's gonna take up all of my love

Come down from the ceiling
I didn't mean to get so high
I didn't do what I wanted to do
When my lips were dry
You can't just up and leave me
I'm a singer in a band
Well I like drummers baby, you're not my bag

Jump on board, take a ride, yeah
Put those hands up
Jump on board, feel the high
Jump on board, take a ride
Jump on board, feel the high
'Cause the kids are alright

Cutie cutie

Jump on board, take a ride
Taking me over, breaking me down
Making me want you, my love
Jump on board, feel the high
Taking me over, breaking me down
Making me want you, my love
'Cause the kids are alright
