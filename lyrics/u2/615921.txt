My cell is ringing, no ID
I want to know who's calling
My garden's overgrown
I go out on my belly crawling / (he's crawling)
I got CCTV, pornography, CNBC
I got the nightly news
To get to know the enemy


All I want is a picture of you
All I want is to get right next to you
All I want is a picture in a locket
Your face in my pocket
I take a pill to stop it

Take me, save me from myself
I know that you've been good to me
Now I need you not to be
Wake me, I feel like I've been asleep
I'm buying things I can't afford
I'm on a high diving board
Oh it's you that's keeping me dry
Xanax and wine

I'm going nowhere
Where I am it is a lot of fun
They're in the desert to dismantle an atomic bomb
I watch 'em shadow box
Check the stocks, I'm in detox
Want the lot of what you've got
If what you've got can make this stop

All I want is a picture of you
All I want is to get right next to you
All I want is your picture in a locket
Your face in my pocket
I take a pill to stop it

Take me, save me from myself
I know that you've been good to me
Now I need you not to be
Wake me, I feel like I've been asleep
Try not to look so bored
You're buying things you can't afford
I got yours and I know you want mine
Xanax and wine

Don't you worry 'bout your mind
Thing is I worry all the time
Don't you worry you'll be fine
You should worry about the day
That the pain it goes away
You know I miss mine sometimes

There is no fiction
That will truly fit the situation
I'm documenting every detail
Every conversation
I'm not used to talking to somebody in their body
It's somebody in a body, it's somebody in a body
In a body there's somebody
Somebody in a body

Somebody, somebody, somebody
It's somebody... in a body
Somebody... in a body
It's somebody... in a body
There's somebody...
