Once heard Captain Dan tell me a story
about this lovely girl who's name was Jane
She was vast and deep and filled with glory


Aaaahhhh

Bottom served as home for hull and anchor
She's always fit to quarrel with the wind
The great Titanic yes it's she that sank her

Aaaahhhh

Then she heard me
Say that oath that
made everything clear

I love you 
My ocean blue
I like the way your sea sees me
My darling Jane
She speaks to me at times through falling rain

Now twas time to manifest her vigor
Was she fit to quarrel with the wind?
The air was strong but Jane she was much bigger

Aaaaahhhh

Then she heard me
say that oath that
made everything clear
