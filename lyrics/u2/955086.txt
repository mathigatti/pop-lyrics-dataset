Miserere, miserere 
Miserere, misero me 
Peró brindo allá vita 


Who is the child sleeping here in my bed 
Where are the words to say what's left unsaid 
Yeah I've been lying, I've been hiding 
Here beside you 
I was the saint who disowned you 
Now I'm the beggar who owes you 

Miserere, misero me 
Peró brindo allá vita 

Is there a night dark enough for us to hide 
There is a light bright enough to make us blind 
Yeah I'm a straying man, Lord I got no plan 
Drinking from another well 
Vivo nell'anima del mondo 
Perso nel vivere profondo 

Miserere, misero me 
Peró brindo allá vita 

Another road, another place tomorrow 
Running from you, running from love 
You give me so much to hold on 

Sole magnifico che splendi dentro me 
Dammi la gioia di vivere 
Oh help me now, help me now 

Miserere, miserere 

Like a bird with a broken wing 
In your arms, I'm afraid to sing
