Sad eyes, sad eyes 
Where're you going with that confidence? 
Sad eyes, sad eyes 
Where're you going with that confidence? 


I'm going to where the boats go by 
Caledonia river flow so wide 
I'm going to where the boats go by 
Caledonia river flow so wide 

Still water, laying over 
Still water, laying over 
Still water, laying over 
Caledonia river oh, so wide 

Wild eyes in the wilderness 
Where're you going with the devil in hand? 
Wild eyes in the wilderness 
Where're you going with the devil in hand? 

I'm going to build the bridges high 
For working money, for working money 
I'm going to climb then the bridges high 
Caledonia brother far away 

Still water, laying over 
Still water, lay my body down 
Still water, laying over 
Caledonia river far away... 

Sad eyes in the weary night 
Have you seen your brother 
Have you seen your brother 
Waiting by the river grand 
The Caledonia river oh, so wide 

Going to where the rain falls 
Look for my brother 
Look for my brother 
Going to where the rain falls 
Caledonia river far away 

Still water, laying over 
Still water, lay my body down 
Still water, laying over 
Caledonia river far away...
