Now come thoughts that you shall not banish
Secret fears, visions never to vanish
Crawling shapes now come writhing out
To cast their shadows over this human rout


You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire

Breath of our breath with no blood or bone
Never grows weary, never grows old
Mutters and mumbles in infinite ways
Ever the tyrant to the willing slaves

You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire

Much of madness and more of sin
No government of this vast, formless thing

You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
