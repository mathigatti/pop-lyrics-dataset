I don't know 
Man, I just got here 
You got me thinking 
I'm about to leave 


Some say maybe tomorrow 
New direction, hello 
What I know know know 
What I know know know 

I walk tall 
I walk in the wild wind 
I love to stare 
I love to watch myself grow 

Someday, maybe tomorrow 
New direction, hello 
Well I know know know 
Well I know know know 

Street mission 
Street mission 
Street mission 
Street mission 

And I'm promising nothing 
I'm just living a smile 
I casually arrange it 
I know...well I know know know 

Street mission 
Street mission 
Street mission 
Street mission 

I walk tall 
I walk in the wild wind 
I live an image 
Of plastic and gold 

Some say maybe tomorrow 
A resurrection, hello 
Well I know know know 
Well I know know know 
Well I know know know 
Well I know know know 

Oh... 
Oh... 
Oh...I need something 
I need someone 
I need you 


Oh...I've got something 
I've got someone 
I've got you 


Street mission 
Street mission 
Street mission 
Good night
