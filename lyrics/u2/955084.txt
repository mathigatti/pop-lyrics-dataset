Ten years ago on a cold dark night 
There was someone was killed 'neath the town hall light 
Just a few at the scene, and they all did agree 
That the man who ran looked a lot like me 


Well the judge said, "Son, what is your alibi? 
If you were somewhere else, well you don't have to die" 
But I spoke not a word, though it meant my life 
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife 

She walks these hills in a long black veil 
She visits my grave when the night winds wail 
Nobody knows Lord, nobody sees 
Nobody knows but me 

Well the scaffold's is high and eternity near 
She stands in the crowd and sheds not a tear 
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moans 
In a long black veil she cries all over my bones 

She walks these hills in a long black veil 
She visits my grave when the night winds wail 
Nobody knows Lord, nobody sees 
Nobody knows but me 

Nobody knows but me, yeah
