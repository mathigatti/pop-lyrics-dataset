I'm in the moon... yeah

All right, let's sing it

No fuel on the car
No money on the car
How we take it away, baby


No moon in the sky
No tile to keep us dry.
See the rain tonight

I have a feeling sick
Coming on me 
I tried to paint a portrait 
A picture through the clouds for you. 
(My, my, my)

Green - your smile
Red - why I made you cry 
Gray - this rainy sky 
Tomorrow I will be

Blue - Stay love 
Keep this evening 
This rainy sky 
Tomorrow I will be blue

No caffeine in coffee 
No sugar in my tea 
Only watching TV 
With the sound down 
None connected Radio 
No melody to the music 
And the words are wrong 

His fingers beating 
In rhythm of the rain 
His fingers 
I tried to paint a picture 
A photo over you
(Yeah, my, my, my) 


Green - its look cool 
Red - why I made you cry 
Gray - those days Rainy 
Tomorrow I will be 

Blue - Stay love 
Keep this evening 
This rainy sky 
Tomorrow I will be blue 

I have a feeling sick 
Coming on me 
I have a feeling sick 
I tried to paint a picture 
I tried to paint a picture 
A photo over you
(She is my, my, my) 

Green - its look cool 
Red - why I made you cry 
Gray - those days Rainy 
Tomorrow I will be 

Blue - Stay love 
Keep this evening 
This rainy sky 
Tomorrow I will be blue 

Oh child 
Do not say goodbye 
This rainy sky 
Tomorrow I will be blue 

Stay love 
Keep this evening 
This rainy sky 
Tomorrow I will be blue
