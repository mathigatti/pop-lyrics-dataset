I want to reach out over the Loch
And feel your hand across the water
Walk with you along an unapproved road
Not looking over my shoulder


I want to see, and I want to hear
To understand your fears
But we're north and south of the river

I've been doing it wrong all of my life
This holy town has turned me over
A young man running when he didn't understand
That the wind from the Loch just get colder and colder

There was a badness that had its way
But love wasn't lost, love will have its day
North and south of the river
North and south of the river

Can we stop playing this old tune?
Darling I don't have the answer
I want to meet you where you are
I don't need you to surrender

'Cause there's no feeling that's so alone
As when the one you're hurting is your own
North and south of the river
North and south of the river
North and south of the river

Some high ground is not worth taking
Some connections are not worth making
This old church bell no longer ringing
Some old songs are not worth bringing
North...
(Higher ground is not worth taking)
North and south of the river
