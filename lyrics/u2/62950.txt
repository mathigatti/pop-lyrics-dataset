I see you dressed to kill
I know I can't wait until 
Hallelujah, here she comes
I see you dressed in black
I guess I'm not coming back.
Hallelujah, here she comes.
Born and raised on the wrong side of town
You get so high that you can't come down.


I see the road is rough
You know I'm not giving up
Hallelujah, here she comes
I know where the lady goes
I know she got rings on her toes
Hallelujah, here she comes.

Born and raised on the wrong side of town
You get so high that you can't come down.

I'm goin' higher, higher, higher on love.
Higher, higher, higher on love.
Higher, higher, higher on love.
Higher, higher, higher on love.
I'm gonna be there
When that light gonna shine.
I'm gonna be there
When her heart kindles next to mine.
I'm gonna be ...
Here she comes
Yeah, here she comes.

I see you dressed to kill
I know I can't wait until Hallelujah.
Here she comes
I see you dressed in black
I guess I'm not coming back.
Hallelujah... here she comes.

Born and raised on the wrong side of town
You get so high that you can't come down.

I'm gonna be there
Higher, higher on love
Gonna get higher
Higher, higher on love.
