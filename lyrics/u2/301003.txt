Those cars
All new
So small
Down there
From here
So high
We drift
We fly
The twilight breaking through
A different kind of blue


More lights
Blue signs
More gold
More new
So small
So high
Down there
Tonight
With the twilight breaking through
It's a different kind of blue

The twilight breaking through
It's a different kind of blue
