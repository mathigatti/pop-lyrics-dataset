It's falling, it's falling
And outside a building comes tumbling down.
And inside a child on the ground
Says he'll do it again.


And what am I to do?
What in the world am I to say?
There's nothing else to do.
He says he'll change the world some day
I rejoice.

This morning I fell out of bed
When I woke up to what he had said
Everything's crazy but I'm too lazy to lie.

And what am I to do?
Just tell me what am I supposed to say?
I can't change the world
But I can change the world in me
Rejoice.
Rejoice.

And what am I to do?
Just tell me what am I supposed to say?
I can't change the world 
But I can change the world in me. 

I rejoice.
