Say goodnight
She waits for me to turn out the light
Really still
She waits to break my will.


Woah-oh
Yes, and I know the truth about you.
She cat.
And in the daylight
A blackbird makes a violent sight
And when she is done
She sleeps beside the one

Woah-oh-oh
Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat.

Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat.
