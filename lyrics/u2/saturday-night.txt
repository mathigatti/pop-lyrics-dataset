Stood on his shadow
They always do
All he wanted to spoil the view
Of people and places
Second-hand faces
He saw but never knew


Look like a painting
A picture of you
Depending on your point of view
She laughed with the others
They call out her name
She smiled, she said
Goodbye

On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night

They met at a streetlight
Though she never knew
All he wanted was to spoil the view
And just for a second
It felt like a year
He waited for her second tear

On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night

Can you soar any higher
If you can't let go
To save her in the fire
She won't say no
