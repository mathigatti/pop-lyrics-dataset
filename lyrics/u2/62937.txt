I don't know you, you don't know the half of it.
I had a starring role. I was the bad guy who walked out.
They say be careful where you aim
Because where you aim you might just hit.
You can hold onto something so tight
You've already lost it.
Dragging me down, that's not the way it used to be.
You can't even remember what I'm trying to forget.


It was a dirty day, dirty day.
Looking for explanations I don't even understand.
If you need someone to blame, throw a rock in the air, you'll hitsomeone guilty.

From father to son, in one life has begun
A work that's never done, father to son.

(Love, it won't last kissin' time).
(Love, it won't last kissin' time).
(Love, it won't last kissin' time).

Get it right, there's no blood thicker than ink.
Hear what I say, nothing's as simple as you think.
Wake up, some things you can't get around
I'm in you, more so when they put me in the ground.

"The days, days, days run away like horses over the hill."
