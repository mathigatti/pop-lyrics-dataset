Let's read the trees and their Autumn leaves 
As they fall like a dress undone 
At the end of summers love will find lovers 
Who need the shadows of a winter sun 


Don't tell me you're leaving we can hide in the evening 
It's getting darker than it should 
If we read the leaves as they blow in the breeze 
Would it stop us now, my love 

Time enough for hard questions 
Time enough for all our fears 
Time is tougher than we both know yet 
Time enough for tears 

The moon is milk and the sky where it's split 
Is magic, and we all need to believe we can 
Wake in the dreams, it's not as hard as it seems 
You know its harder to leave 

Time enough for being braver 
Time enough for all the fears 
Time is tougher than we both know yet 
Time enough for tears 

I heard you say underneath your breath 
Some kind of prayer 
I heard you say underneath your breath that 
You never want to feel this way about anybody else 

Time enough for hard questions 
Time enough for all our fears 
Time is tougher than we both know yet 
Time enough for tears 

Time enough for being braver 
Time enough I love this time of year 
Time is tough, its running away from us 
Time enough for tears 
Time enough for tears 

(My heart, I can... it's okay, it's okay...)
