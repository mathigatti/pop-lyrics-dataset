Spider-man, spider-man
Enhanced genetics
Spider-man
Super-human kinetics
Spider-man
Muscle augmentation
And look at that, web bio-generation
This, this looks like my work
It's getting out
Your life's work, your precious research
Your secrets
Getting sold, getting bought
It isn't possible, is it
It's not, or is it


Maybe it was kassidy
You relied on loyalty
All your staff, where did they go
And what did they take
And what did they know
Our funding dried up
They weren't getting paid
How's it feel to be betrayed
They're leaving like rats from a sinking ship
You're losing control, you're letting it slip

Time to get it
You've been stabbed in the back
Are you gonna roll over, play dead
Or attack
Competition, I don't have any

Wake up son
Someone's cheating you
You do have competition and they're beating you
So fight back, what
Are you just gonna wait
It's an arms race, boy
You can't hesitate
We want new men
A new breed of marines
Not human, we want fighting machines
A new species, one that's harder to kill
And what if I won't
We'll get someone who will

Don't just think of you
Think of God and country
Join the proud and few who know best for their country
Get some patriotic pride or get on to the other side

How do we win, by living in fear
How do we win, get the enemy clear
How do we win, by saying it's done in retaliation
How do we win, by clearing them out
How do we win, by murdering doubt
How do we win, 'cause we're in the right
Get in line or say goodnight

Don't just think of you
Think of God and country
Join the proud and few who know best for their country
Get some patriotic pride or get on to the other side

So deliver
I ain't working for you
We want bigger
That ain't something I do
Pull the trigger
Start being a man
Take care of real business or get off the can
Start making and you'll be in control
Start taking, you wanna suck out my soul
Get funded or your baby won't live
I'm gonna say no
You mean affirmative
Yes sir hut hut
Yes sir hut hut
Yes sir hut hut
Yes sir hut hut
Hut two three
Hut hut hut hut
Hut hut hut two three
Yes sir hut hut hut hut
Yes sir hut hut hut two three
Yes sir hut hut hut hut
Hut hut hut two three
