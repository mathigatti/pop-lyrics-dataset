Down by the motion
Down by the girl
Down into let go of me
I don't ever hurt
We shadow down
We shadow down
By the water land


Baby don't move it
Don't knock me in the tide
I'm like the sun and
You're like the sand
Don't knock me down
Don't knock me
I feel free

And I...I feel free
And I...feel free

(Sixty nine)
(Sixty nine...)

She's a'calling me
Down want to water
I like a court you You understand it
I under war
A whispering shadow

Don't tell me that
I live a going
I am the storm
To all that was is kicking me
Ever take me down
Take me down tonight
Take me down town

And I...feel free
Well I...feel free

And if a chance
Don't take no choice
Another time
(Sixty nine)

I feel free
I feel free such a lie
And I feel walking in the sun
And I feel running with you one
And I feel nothing in the, nothing in
I feel nothing in your time

I feel haunted in your life
I feel talking in your
Walking back in you, baby
Nothing in your touch
Live within your blood
Take me, I'm walking, waking
Hoping, waiting in the sun beats
In your heart

And babe it gives me
I...I feel free
