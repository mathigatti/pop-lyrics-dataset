My love is cruel as the night
She steals the sun and shuts out the light.
All of my colours, they turn to blue
Win or lose.


She does his slow dancing, slow dancing,
She does his slow... dancing.
All night long.

Scarlet eyes and see-through heart
She saw me coming right from the start.
She picked me up, but had me down on my knees
Just to begging her, begging her please.

Take me slow dancing, slow dancing,
She took me slow... dancing.
All night long.

And, I don't know why a man
Search for himself in his lover's eyes.
No, I don't know why a man
Sees the truth, but needs the lies.

My love is restless as the wind
She moves like a shadow across my skin
She left with my conscience
I don't want it back.
It just gets in the way.

If you wanna go slow dancing, slow dancing,
She took me slow... dancing.
All night long.

Slow dancing
