Ice, your only rivers run cold
These city lights, they shine as silver and gold
Dug from the night, your eyes as black as coal


Walk on by, walk on through
Walk till you run and don't look back
For here I am

Carnival, the wheels fly and the colours spin through alcohol
Red wine that punctures the skin
Face to face in a dry and waterless place

Walk on by, walk on through
So sad to besiege your love, oh hang on

Stay this time, stay tonight in a lie
I'm only asking, but I, I think you know
Come on take me away, come on take me away
Come on take me home, home again

And if the mountains should crumble
Or disappear into the sea
Not a tear, no not I

Stay this time, stay tonight in a lie
Ever after is a long time
And if you save your love, save it all, save it all
Don't push me too far, don't push me too far
Tonight, tonight
