I'm 'round the corner from anything that's real 
I'm across the road from hope 
I'm under a bridge in a rip tide 
That's taken everything I call my own 


One step closer to knowing 
One step closer to knowing 

I'm on an island at a busy intersection 
I can't go forward, I can't turn back 
Can't see the future 
It's getting away from me 
I just watch the tail lights glowing 

One step closer to knowing 
One step closer to knowing 
One step closer to knowing 
Knowing, knowing 

I'm hanging out to dry 
With my old clothes 
Finger still red with the prick of an old rose 
Well the heart that hurts 
Is a heart that beats 
Can you hear the drummer slowing? 

One step closer to knowing 
One step closer to knowing 
One step closer to knowing 
To knowing, to knowing, to knowing
