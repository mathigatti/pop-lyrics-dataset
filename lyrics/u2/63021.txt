The city's alight
With lover and lies
Bright blue eyes
The city's bright
Brighter than day tonight
Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender


Sadie said she couldn't
Work out what it was all about
And so she let go
Now Sadie's on the street
And the people she mees you know
She tried be to be a good girl
And a good wife
Raise a good family
Lead a good life
It's not good enough
She got herself up on the 48th floor
Got to find out, find out
What she's living for
Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender

The city's a fire
A passionate flame
That knows me by name
The city's desire
To take me for more and more
It's in the street getting under my feet
It's in the air it's everywere I look for you
It's in the things I do and say
If I want to live, I've got to die to myself
Someday

Papa sing my sing my song
Papa sing my sing my song
Papa sing my sing my song
