I know a girl 
A girl called Party, Party Girl 
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl 
And she won't tell me her name 


I know a boy 
A boy called Trash, Trash Can 
I know he does all that he can, wham bam 
And she won't tell me his name 

When I was three 
I thought the world revolved around me 
I was wrong 
But you can sing, sing along 
And if you dance 
Then dance with me 

I know a girl 
A girl called Party, Party Girl 
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl 

I know a boy 
A boy called Trampoline 
You know what I mean 
I think you know what he wants 
I think he knows what he wants 
I think he knows what he wants
