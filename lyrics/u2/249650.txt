See a red door
And I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes


I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see them turn their heads
Quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day

I look inside my self
See my heart is back
I see my red door
And I want it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black

No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you.
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes

I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night

I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night

I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night

I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night

I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night

I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
