You don't know how you took it
You just know what you got
Oh lordy, you've been stealing from the thieves
And you got caught
In the headlights of a stretch car,
You're a star.


Dressing like your sister
Living like a tart
They don't know what you're doing
Babe it must be art,
You're a headache, in a suitcase
You're a star.

Oh, no, don't be shy
You don't have to go blind,
Hold me
Thrill me
Kiss me
Kill me.

You don't know how you got here
You just know you want out
Believing in yourself almost as much as you doubt,
You're a big smash
You wear it like a rash
Star.

Oh no, don't be shy
There's a crowd to cry,
Hold me
Thrill me
Kiss me
Kill me.

They want you to be Jesus
They'll got down on one knee
But they'll want their money back
If you're alive at thirty-three,
And you're turning tricks
With your crucifix.
You're a star, oh child

Of course you're not shy
You don't have to deny love,
Hold me
Thrill me
Kiss me
Kill me.
