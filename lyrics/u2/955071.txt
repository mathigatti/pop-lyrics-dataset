I can't be your weather 
Cuz' if it rains then it rains 
I can't be your lover 
Cuz' the feelings would change 
I can't be the wind 
Cuz' the wind blows too free 
But if you want a true companion 
Don't forget about me 


Don't forget about me 
When your heart's in the shade 
When there's no one to hold you 
And you've fallen from grace 
When the spotlights come blind you 
And you can no longer see 
I'll be right there beside you 
Don't forget about me 

Friends never leave you 
They're a two way street 
They'll always believe in you 
When you've ceased to believe 
And I'll still feel the same 
If you're a friend in need 
Cuz', I'll always love you 
Don't forget about me 

Don't forget about me 
When your heart's in the shade 
When there's no one to hold you 
And you've fallen from grace 
When the spotlights come blind you 
And you can no longer see 
I'll be right there beside you 
Don't forget about me 

Don't forget about me 
When your heart's in the shade 
When there's no one to hold you 
And you've fallen from grace 
When the spotlights come blind you 
And you can no longer see 
I'll be right there beside you 
Don't forget about me 

Don't forget about me
