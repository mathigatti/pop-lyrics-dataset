Life begins with the first glance
The first kiss and the first dance
All of us are wondering why we're here
In the crystal ballroom underneath the chandelier


Wet the glass until the glasses sing
We punish our hearts 'til the heart bells ring
Cos' where we come from we're not always kind
The human soul is what love leaves behind

We're the ghosts of love and we haunt this place
We're the ghosts of love in every face
In the ballroom of the crystal light
Everyone is here with me tonight
Every one but you

Our first chance is their last dance
Our life is shaped by another's hands
Buttoning and unbuttoning a cold cold dress
Stopping and unstopping every cold caress

Born for bliss born for this
Every human life begins with a kiss
A kiss by every kind of possibility
And everyone is here tonight with me

We're the ghosts of love and we haunt this place
We're the ghosts of love in every face
In the ballroom of the crystal light
Everyone is here with me tonight
Every one but you
