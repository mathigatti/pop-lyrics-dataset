Take my hand
You know I'll be there,
If you can I'll cross
The sky for your love
For I have promised oh
To be with you tonight
And for the time that will come.


Take my hand
You know I'll be there,
If you can I'll cross
The sky for your love.
And I understand
These winds are tides,
This change of times
Won't drag you away.
Hold on,Hold on tightly,
Hold on and don't let go
Of my love.

The storms will pass
It won't be long now.
The storms will pass
But my love lasts forever.

And take my hand,
You know I'll be there,
If you can I'll cross the sky
For your love.
Give you what I hold dear,
Hold on, Hold on tightly.
Hold on, Hold on tightly.
Rise up, rise up with wings,
Like eagles you'll run, you'll run,
You'll run and not grow weary.

Take my hand, take my hand.
Hold on, Hold on tightly.
Hold on, Hold on tightly.
This love lasts forever,
This love lasts forever,
Take my hand,
Take my hand.
