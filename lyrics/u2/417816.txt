Come closer
You seem so far away
There is something I know you need to say
I feel your emotions
When I look in your eyes
Your silence
Whispering misunderstandings
There's so much you need to realize
You'll feel my emotions if you look in my
EyesHey darlin'
I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby it's all in your mind
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby it's all in your mind
Believe me I believe in you
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do
Move closer
