I'll meet you where the sky is torn
I'll meet you in the end
I'll meet you before the world was born
When we had not a care

This is an invitation
To a high location
From someone who wants to be loved
This is a meditation
On your radio station
If you like it, you can sing along

Ahimsa
Ahimsa
Ahimsa
Ahimsa

I'll meet you where there is no weeping
Your tears are now a stream
I'll meet you where there is no sleeping
But we wake up to dream

This is an invitation
To a high location
From someone who wants to be loved
This is a meditation
On your radio station
If you like it, you can sing along

Ahimsa
Ahimsa
Ahimsa
Ahimsa

Ahimsa
Ahimsa
Ahimsa
