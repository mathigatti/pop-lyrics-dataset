Back to the cold restless streets at night
Talk to myself about tomorrow night
Walls of white protest
A gravestone in name
Who is it now?
It's always the same


Who is it now? Who calls me inside?
Are the leaves on the trees just a living disguise?
I walk the street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again to the street melody

But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know

Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees

Life through a window
Discoloured pain
Mrs Brown's washing is always the same
I walk the street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again to the street melody

But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know

Do you feel in me
Anything redeeming
Any worthwhile feeling?
Is love like a tightrope
Hanging on my ceiling?

But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know

Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees

Shadows, shadows, shadows
Shadows, shadows, shadows
Shadows and tall trees

Shadows, shadows, shadows
Shadows, shadows, shadows
Shadows and tall trees
