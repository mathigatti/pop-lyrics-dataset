Is there a time for keeping your distance
A time to turn your eyes away
Is there a time for keeping your head down
For getting on with your day


Is there a time for kohl and lipstick
A time for curling hair
Is there a time for high street shopping
To find the right dress to wear

Here she comes, oh oh
Heads turn around
Here she comes
To take her crown

Is there a time to run for cover
A time for kiss and tell
Is there a time for different colours
Different names you find it hard to spell

Is there a time for first communion
A time for East Seventeen
Is there a time to turn to Mecca
Is there time to be a beauty queen

Here she comes, oh oh
Beauty plays the clown
Here she comes
Surreal in her crown

Dici che il fiume
Trova la via al mare
E come il fiume
Giungerai a me
Oltre i confini
E le terre assetate
Dici che come fiume
Come fiume
L'amore giungerà
L'amore
E non so più pregare
E nell'amore non so più sperare
E quell'amore non so più aspettare

Is there a time for tying ribbons
A time for Christmas trees
Is there a time for laying tables
And the night is set to freeze
