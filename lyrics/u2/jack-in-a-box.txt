Delayed for a time, trip for an answer
We're in for a line, I can't think to carry on
We're able to chew it, chained for a speaker
And I won't move it, he's gonna have to carry on
I wait for the time when my tunes feel better than life
I know


Who will buy me, who will try me
Who will buy me, look
Jack in a box
Jack in a box

They shuffle and look, readin' your book
Look in their face, I don't
I said no, we know

Who will buy me, who will try me
Who will buy me
Jack in a box
Jack in a box

Let's go

Who will buy me, who will try me
Who will buy me up
Jack in a box
Jack in a box
Jack in a big box
Jack in the box
Jack in a box
Jack in a box
Jack in a big box
Jack in a big box
