It's Christmastime 
There's no need to be afraid 
At Christmastime 
We let in light and we banish shade


And in our world of plenty 
We can spread a smile of joy 
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime

But say a prayer 
Pray for the other ones 
At Christmastime 
It's hard, but when you're having fun 
There's a world outside your window 
And it's a world of dread and fear 
Where the only water flowing is 
The bitter sting of tears 

And the Christmas bells that ring there 
Are the clanging chimes of doom 
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you 

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime 
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life 
Where nothing ever grows 
No rain nor rivers flow 
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?

Here's to you / Raise a glass for everyone
Here's to them / Underneath that burning sun 
Do they know it's Christmastime at all? 

Feed the world 
Feed the world 
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmastime again 
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmastime again
