A Room At The Heartbreak Hotel




From where I stand
I can see through you
From where you're sitting, pretty one
I know it got to you


I see the stars in your eyes
You want the truth, but you need the lies
Like Judy Garland, like Valentino
You give your life for rock n' roll
A-ha

Stand
We're on a landslide of love
You got everything you want
But what you need
You give away

For primitive love
And a ride on the mystery train
A primitive love
A room at the heart
The heartbreak hotel
A room at the heartbreak
Heartbreak hotel
A room at the heartbreak
Heartbreak hotel

You say it's love, it's not the money
You let them suck your life out like honey
Turning tricks, you're on the street
Selling your kisses so bittersweet

I wanna know
Did you bet again?
I gotta know
Oh the price
Is to hard to pay

A primitive love
A and a ride on the mystery train
A primitive love
A room at the heart
The heartbreak hotel

A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel

A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
