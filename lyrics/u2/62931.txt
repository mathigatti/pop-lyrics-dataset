Soul wind blow
Soul wind blow
Soul wind blow
Blow by blow


Under her skin I feel her laughing
Under her nails a piece of me
Under her weight I feel weightless
Under her sheets a friend and enemy

Soul wind blow
Soul wind blow
Soul wind blow
Blow by blow
In the drift we come
In the drift we go...

Under her wings I feel I'm flying
Under her breath I hear my name
Under her spell I'm going under
Under her eyes...I disappear

Soul wind blow
Soul wind blow
Soul wind blow
Blow by blow
You blow me away, blow me away

In the drift we come
In the drift we go...
In the drift we come
In the drift we go...

Soul wind blow
Soul wind blow
Soul wind blow
Blow by blow

Under her roof I feel shelter
Under her hands I feel as clay
Under her weight I feel weightless
Under her clock time goes away
