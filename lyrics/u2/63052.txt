She said it wasn't cold
She left her coat at home that day.
She wore canvas shoes, white canvas shoes.
Around her neck she wore a silver necklace.
"It was given to me by my father." she said.
"That was given to me."
She took the back way home
Passed the lights at Summer Hill
Turned left onto the North Strand and on
On towards the sea.


He said he was an artist
But he really painted billboards 
In large capital letters.
In large capital letters.
He was telling jokes
Nobody else would listen to him.

I saw you that day, your lips of cherry red
Your legs were crossed, your arms wide open
Your hair was coloured gold
And like a field of corn
You were blown by the wind
You were blown by the wind.

Walk, walk, walk
To the water.
Walk with me awhile.
Walk, walk, walk
To the water.
Walk with me
In the light.

A room in the Royal Hotel
With sea-facing views.
A man with a suitcase
Full of things he doesn't need.
I'm looking through your window
I'm walking through your doorway.
I'm on the outside let me in.
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me.

Walk, walk, walk
To the water.
Walk with me, yeah.
Walk, walk, walk
To the roadside
Walk with me awhile.
