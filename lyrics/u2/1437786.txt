I know a girl
Who is like the sea
I watch her changing
Every day for me
Oh, yeah


One day she's still
The next she swells
You can hear the universe
In her seashells
Oh, yeah

No, no line on the horizon
No, no line

I know a girl
A hole in her heart
She said infinity
Is a great place to start

Time is irrelevant
It's not linear
Then she put her tongue in my ear

No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line

The songs in your head
Are now on my mind
You put me on pause
I try to rewind, oh no
And replay, hey

Every night
I have the same dream
I'm hatching some plot
Scheming some scheme
Oh yeah

I'm a traffic cop
Rue du Marais
The siren's wailing
But it's me that wants to get away

No line on the horizon
No, no line
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
