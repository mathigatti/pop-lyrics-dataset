I was on the outside when you said
You needed me
I was looking at myself
I was blind, I could not see.


A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by his hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh why?

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
I will follow.

I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found.

Walk away, walk away
You walk away, walk away
I will follow.
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
I will follow.

Your eyes make a circle
I see you when I go in there
Your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes.

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
I will follow.
