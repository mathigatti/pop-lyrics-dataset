Soldier, soldier
We signed our lives away
Complete surrender
The only weapon we know
Soldier soldier
We knew the world would never be the same
Soldier this is where you can reach me now


We come from an ancient place
Beyond what we can see
We’ve come to colonise your night
And steal your poetry

Old man knows that I never listen
So how could I have something to say
Old man knows how to cheat ambition
You don’t lose if you don’t play

1, 2, 3, 4, was enough

Soldier soldier
We signed our lives away
Complete surrender
The only weapon we know
Soldier soldier
We knew the world would never be the same
Soldier this is where you can reach me now

On a double decker bus
Into College Square
If you won’t let us in your world
Your world just isn’t there

Old man says that we never listen
We shout about what we don’t know
We’re taking the path of most resistance
The only way for us to go

Hup, 2, 3, 4, was enough

Soldier soldier
We signed our lives away
Complete surrender
The only weapon we know
Soldier soldier
We knew the world will never be the same
Soldier this is where you can reach me now

This is the site
This is the season
This is where you can reach me now
This is the time
This is the number
This is where you can reach me now
