Take me to the mountain green
You know at good I've never been
I was packaged as a temple made
A few distraction hits along the way


Pale as snow, a flowering rose, for a flowering rose I would bend my knee
I came to find the flowering rose, the flowering rose of Glastonbury

You. Are. A pocketful of sunshine
You. Are. The miracle I came here to find

Some things you just can`t control
Sometimes you just can't let it go

You know that it was heaven-sent
Music is a sacrament
You took him to the mountain green
You know at good I'd never been

Pale as snow, the flowering rose, for the flowering rose I would bend my knee
I came to find the flowering rose, the flowering rose of Glastonbury

You. Are. A pocketful of sunshine
You. Are. The miracle I came here to find

All right, friend of Jimmy's club

Down by the river where the pilgrims lay sleeping
Under the flower of the American dream
Set the scene like a thought worth keepin
Livin in a dream jeez you can't be sleepin

You. Are. A pocketful of sunshine
You can't let go
You are jumping all the time
You. Are. A pocketful of sunshine
You. Are. A miracle I came here to find
A miracle I came here to find
A miracle I came here to find
