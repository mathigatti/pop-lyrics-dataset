Yeah it's on the street
It's under your feet
It's everywhere
But if you're look for free
Don't look at me
My enemy became my country
On the run
Officer put down the gun
I neer wanted to own one
Native son
Both of us want to be someone
It's so hard is it so hard for a native son
To be free?
Tears fallen from the sky
Fallen to the ground
Bullets start to fly
He's hurt he's in the dirt
On my word
I dd not take his lie
Don't want to run away
This isn't my father's plans
I know I can't stay
If I stay I know what's next
On the run
Officer put down the gun
Native son
All of us want to be someone
It's so hard is it so hard for a native son
To be free?
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Free...
On the run
Officer put down the gun
I neer wanted to own one
Native son
Both of us want to be someone
It's so hard is it so hard for a native son
To be free?
