Here she comes
Lady luck again
Figure of eight
Six and nine again.
I, I, I, my lady with the spinning head.


Whatever the deal
She won't let me down
Wherever I go
She's always hanging round.

Lady with the spinning head.
Lady with the spinning head.

She's been gone
But I knew she'd be back
She's got the rent
She put me in the black.
I, I need you lady with the spinning head.

Mean old man took away my car
those credit guys they've got the power
I'm on top
When she's around
She's the ticket
Out of town.

Lady with the spinning head.
Lady with the spinning head.
Lady with the spinning head.
