Wey, hey, baby hang on
Wey, hey, baby hang on.
Hang on to your heartbeat, tight as a drum
Hang on to your love, see it shines like a song
Wey, hey, hey, sugar hang on.
Our love shines like rain
In those Spanish eyes.


Wey, hey, hey, here she comes
Comes in colours now she's gonna turn the daylight on
'Cos I love the way you talk to me, and I love the way you walkon me
And I need you more than you need me (yeah)
Our love shines like rain in those Spanish eyes.

I'll cross the world for green and gold
But, it's those Spanish eyes that get me home. 
Home again.

Wey, hey, hey, sugar hang on.
Wey, hey, hey, you know that the night is as young
I'm dazzled by a light that shines in your eyes
I'm used to standing in the shadows and waiting for the night
Forever in fever, forever in heat
You re-invented me, now don't put me back on the street.

Wey, hey, hey, baby hang on
Wey, hey, hey, baby hang on
'Cause I love the way you talk to me
And I mean the things you mean to me
I need you.
