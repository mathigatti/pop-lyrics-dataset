You get to feel so guilty
Got so much for so little
Then you find that the feeling just won't go away.
You're holding on to every little thing so tightly
Till there's nothing left for you anyway.


Goodbye, you can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the sun
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down.

You wanted to get somewhere so badly
You had to lose yourself along the way.
You changed your name
Well that's okay, it's necessary
And what you leave behind you don't miss anyway.

Goodbye, you can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the sun
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down.
'Cause I'm already gone
Felt that way all along.
Closer to you every day
I didn't want it that much anyway.

You're taking steps that make you feel dizzy
Then you learn to like the way it feels.
You hurt yourself, you hurt your lover
Then you discover
What you thought was freedom is just greed.

Goodbye, and it's an emotional
Goodnight, I'll be up with the sun.
Are you still holding on?
I'm not coming downâ€¦
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down.
