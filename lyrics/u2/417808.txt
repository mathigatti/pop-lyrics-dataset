When I wanted to call you
And ask you for help
I stopped myself


Gomenasai for everything
Gomenasai, I know I let you down
Gomenasai till the end
I never needed a friend
Like I do now

What I thought was a dream
A mirage
Was as real as it seemed
A privilege

When I wanted to tell you
I made a mistake
I walked away

Gomenasai, for everything
Gomenasai, Gomenasai,
I never needed a friend,
Like I do now

Gomenasai, I let you down
Gomenasai, Gomen nasai,
Gomenasai till the end
I never needed a friend
Like I do now
