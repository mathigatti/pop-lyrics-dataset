Hunters and Prey

Fly from the haze 
Jump on the prey
Scaring away
Capture's in vain
Daring the hills
Mountains ahead
Roaming and stare 
Lonely again
Perish the heat 
Succumbing breath
Last but not least 
Die or slay
Hide on the field 
Perceiving eyes
Hunting the prey 
In paradise
No one is to know 
Secrets of your soul
No one knows for sure
Still I wonder why
I'm waiting, just waiting
Answers to return
Don't let your dreams deny you
When it's time to learn
I'm standing, I'm waiting
Time has no reverse
Can someone see them falling
Bones will feed the dirt
Hunters and Prey
You got to run away!
