Alive in an ocean
A world that I didn't see
I walk the world backways
It's aways the same ballgame


That's out of mind
Out of the living world
Out of time
I break all the rules
They call me a fool

I cartoon in motion
A hero pretends no pain
A clown slipping backwards
You laugh at another's shame

But I don't mind
I know I'm limping low down
I don't mind
Winners or losers
It's all just a game
And I'm going down
And I'm strolling down

Life and an answer
The key to an open door
Admiting I'm laughing
Living I'm limping more

It's out of mind
Out of the living world
Out of time
Winners or losers
It's always a game
And I'm going down
But I'm strolling down
To rout around
And around, and around
To round round
There's a cloud
There's a cloud

So...the fool has found the golden key
So...it's waiting there for you and me

Just a fool, a street jester
The hero of society
Just a fool, a street jester
Look at me, now can't you see

A life in emotion
A world I'm glad I didn't see
A cartoon in motion
A key to the same day

I don't mind, I'm here to know
I wanna go go go go go

So...the fool has found the golden key
It's so...it's waiting there for you and me
Just a fool, a street jester
The hero of society
Just a fool, a street jester
Look at me, now can't you see
