The world is a vampire, sent to drain
Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames
And what do i get, for my pain
Betrayed desires, and a piece of the game
Even though i know-i suppose i'll show
All my cool and cold-like old job


Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
Someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage

Now i'm naked, nothing but an animal
But can you fake it, for just one more show
And what do you want, i want change
And what have you got
When you feel the same
Even though i know-i suppose i'll show
All my cool and cold-like old job

Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
Someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage

Tell me i'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son yeah
Tell me i'm the chosen one
Jesus was an only son for you

Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
Someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage

Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a
Despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage

Tell me i'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son for you

And i still believe that i cannot be saved
And i still believe that i cannot be saved
And i still believe that i cannot be saved
And i still believe that i cannot be saved
