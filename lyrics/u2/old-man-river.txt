Ol' man river
Dat ol' man river
He mus'know sumpin'
But don't say nuthin'
He jes'keeps rollin'
He keeps on rollin' along


He don' plant taters/tators
He don't plant cotton
An' dem dat plants'em
Is soon forgotten
But ol'man river
He jes keeps rollin'along

You an'me, we sweat an' strain
Body all achin' an' racket wid pain
Tote dat barge!
Lif' dat bale!
Git a little drunk
An' you land in jail

Ah gits weary
An' sick of tryin'
Ah'm tired of livin'
An' skeered of dyin'
But ol' man river
He jes'keeps rolling' along

Colored folks work on de Mississippi
Colored folks work while de white folks play
Pullin' dose boats from de dawn to sunset
Gittin' no rest till de judgement day
Or musical part

Don't look up
An' don't look down
You don' dast make
De white boss frown
Bend your knees
An'bow your head
An' pull date rope
Until you' dead.

Let me go 'way from the Mississippi
Let me go 'way from de white man boss
Show me dat stream called de river Jordan
Dat's de ol' stream dat I long to cross

O' man river
Dat ol' man river
He mus'know sumpin'
But don't say nuthin'
He jes' keeps rollin'
He keeps on rollin' along

Long ol' river forever keeps rollin' on

He don' plant tater
He don' plant cotton
An' dem dat plants 'em
Is soon forgotten
But ol' man river
He jes' keeps rollin' along

Long ol' river keeps hearing dat song
You an' me, we sweat an' strain
Body all achin an' racked wid pain
Tote dat barge
Lif' dat bale!
Git a little drunk
An' you land in jail

Ah, gits weary
An' sick of tryin'
Ah'm tired of livin'
An' skeered of dyin'
But ol' man river
He jes'keeps rollin' along!
