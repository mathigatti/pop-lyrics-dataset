When you stop seeing beauty
You start growing old
The lines on your face
Are a map to your soul


When you stop taking chances
You'll stay where you sit
You won't live any longer
But it'll feel like it

I lost myself in the summer rain
I lost myself
I lost myself in the summer rain
In the summer rain

Tequila and Orange
Jamaica and rum
At the Moreilla
Honey on my tongue

In a small boat on a generous sea
You let me be your enemy
Tiny hand
With a grip on the world
Holding our breath now
Diving for pearls

I lost myself in the summer rain
I lost myself
I lost myself in the summer rain
Oh oh, oh oh

Just as you find me
Always I will be
A little bit too free
With myself

Just as you find me
Always I will be
A little bit too free
With myself

I lost myself in the summer rain
I lost myself
Now there's no one else
In the summer rain

Raining down
It's raining down
It rain

Raining now
Raining now

Just as you find me
Always I will be
A little bit too free
With myself

Just as you find me
Always I will be
A little bit too free
With myself

(Cha cha cha)
It's not why you're running
It's where you're going
It's not what you're dreaming
But what you're gonna do

It's not where you're born
It's where you belong
It's not how weak
But what will make you strong
