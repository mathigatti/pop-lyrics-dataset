So I want to sing this for Joey Ramone 

I remember lying 
Awake at night 
And thinking just of you 
But things don't last forever 
Baby 
They never really do 
They never really do 


I remember you 
I remember you 

I remember lying 
Awake at night 
And thinking just of you 
But things don't last forever 
And somehow baby 
They never really do 
They never really do 

I remember you 
I remember you 
I remember you
