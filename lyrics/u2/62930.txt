As long as the night is coloured
Blue and black
Oh yeah yeah yeah
As long as you're on your knees
And she's not on her back
Oh yeah yeah yeah


Avenue Atlantico
Seventeen-o-two
She's cocoa butter
Baby, she's the glue

She's got the baby at her breast
She knows big girls are best

Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma
Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma

I'm gonna change like the weather
Hot to cold
Oh yeah yeah yeah
She keeps it all together
She's got the motherload
Oh yeah yeah yeah

She feels it
Every sensation
She's got a smile
Like salvation
She's got a baby at her breast
She knows big girls are best

Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma
Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma

She's elliptical
Also political
All so spiritual
Not superficial
Yeah, she's tropical
Yes, she's illogical
Those little girls are a pest
Big girls are the best

Oh Oh Oh
Baby

As long as the night is coloured
Blue and black
Oh yeah yeah yeah
As long as you're on your knees
And she's not on her back
Oh yeah yeah yeah

She can taste every sensation
She's got a smile
Like salvation
A baby at her breast
She walk like she talk
Big girls are best

Big Girls

Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma
Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma
