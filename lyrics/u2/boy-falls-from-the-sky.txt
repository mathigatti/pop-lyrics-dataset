Boy Falls From Sky
You can change your mind
But you cannot change your heart
It's a compass and a map
The key to the chart


I'd be myself
If I knew I'd become
You can fly too high
And get too close to the sun

See how the boy falls from the sky

Not every wanderer
Is lost or far from home
I didn't have to move so far
To find myself alone

Save, you save yourself
If you even get that right
I used to use a single thread
To cross the sky

And now the eye of the needle
Is your heart denied
The boy falls from the sky

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh

The city conducts a symphony
And such soul trash your melody
A single scrap of dignity
In the junkyard of humanity

To hear the voice inside your head
Listen now to no one else
You know exactly what to do
Believe in me
Believe in you

You take a look at my self esteem
And when you do
When you do
Ohhhhhhhhhhh
Believe
