People get ready
There's a train a-coming
You don't need no baggage
You just get on board


All you need is faith
To hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket
You just thank the lord

People get ready
For the train to jordan
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast

Faith is the key
Open the doors and board them
There's room for all
Among the loved the most

There aint no room
For the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just
To save his own

Have pity on those
Whose chances are thinner
Cause there's no hiding place
From the kingdoms throne

So people get ready
For the train a-coming
You don't need no baggage
You just get on board!

All you need is faith
To hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket
You just thank, you just thank the lord
