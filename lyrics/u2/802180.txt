There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy
God, I know I'm one


I cry to my daddy on the telephone, how long now
Until the clouds unroll and you come down, the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent

I cry to my daddy on the telephone, how long now
Until the clouds unroll and you come home, the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent

The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply

A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief, how long now?
Until a weather change condemns belief, how long now?
When the night watchman lets in the thief, what's wrong now?

The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
The saints are coming, the saints are coming

I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
