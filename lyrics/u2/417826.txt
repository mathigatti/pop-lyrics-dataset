Then it's truely gonna weep
I`m confessing my memories of you in my head
Tell me you want me


I fall a sleep and dream
of alternate realities
And I push myself and ease my pain
Tell me she still loves me

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
Remember what do I do
And I can't stop thinking about you

Ohhâ€¦yeah

Can't believe, can't believe that she would
just hide in the end, be a rebel
I was dressing with you in my dreams
And wake up making love to a pillow

I fall asleep and dream
of alternate realities
And I push myself and ease my pain
Tell me she still loves me

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
Remember what do I do
And I can't stop, I can't stop

What, what can I do, I do?
Look in my direction
And I'd give my life or soul
To attract your attention
And I tucked my soul
Inside this, miles below

Can I show you
My attempt to
Move my mind
