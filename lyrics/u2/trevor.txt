Thank you, don't mention it
I'm standing, standing on a beach a bit
A bit


I don't want to go
I don't want to go home

She saw what she saw to know
The police, they know
So leave me on your... My, oh, my

I don't want to go
I don't want to go

Trevor's seems quite clever
But Trevor lives forever
Trevor is together
Trevor whatever

Calling, the trench in the floor
Is falling
I don't know what is falling

I don't want to go
I don't want to go

Trevor's seems quite clever
But Trevor lives forever
Trevor seems quite clever
Trevor whatever
Trevor seems quite clever
And Trevor lives forever
Trevor seems quite clever
Trevor seems together
Trevor lives forever
