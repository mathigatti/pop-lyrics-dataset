I look into his eyes
They're closed but I see something.
A teacher told me why
I laugh when old men cry.


My body grows and grows
It frightens me, you know
The old man tried to walk me home
I thought he should have known.

Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, can't find my way.

In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.

I'm running in the rain
I'm caught in a late night play.
It's all, it's everything
I'm soaking through the skin.

Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.
Can't find your way
Can't find my way
Can't find your way.

Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.

In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.
