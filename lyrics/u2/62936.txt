Lover, I'm on the streets
I'm gonna go where the bright lights
And the big city meet
With a red guitar, on fire
Desire.


She's the candle burnin' in my room
Yeah, I'm like the needle
Needle and spoon
Over the counter, with a shotgun
Pretty soon, everybody's got one
And the fever, when I'm beside her
Desire
Desire.

And the fever, gettin' higher
Desire
Desire.
(Burning, burning).

She's the dollars
She's my protection
Yeah, she's the promise
In the year of election.
Sister I can't let you go
Like a preacher stealin' hearts at a travellin' show
For love or money, money, money... ?
And the fever, gettin' higher.
Desire.
