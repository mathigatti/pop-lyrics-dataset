Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Yeah, the red, white, and blue
When the band plays 'Hail To The Chief'
Yeah, they'll point the cannon at you


It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I'm no millionaire's son
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Well, they help themselves, yeah
When the taxman comes to the door
House looks a like a rummage sale

It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Yeah, when they send you down to war
Well, when you ask them how much you should give
Yeah, it's always more, more, more

It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I'm no fortunate one

It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate son
Take it away
