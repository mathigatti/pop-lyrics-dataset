I hope you're happy now
I could never make you so
You were a hard man
No harder in this world
You made me cold
And you made me hard
And you made me the thief
Of your heart


Winter is cold
Oh, but you're colder still
And for the first time
I feel like you're mine
I'll share you with the one
Who will mend what falls apart
And turn a blind eye
To the thief of your heart

Oh, you lost
Oh, you lost
Hope
You lost hope

You lost hope

I'll never wash these clothes
I want to keep the stain
Your blood to me is precious
Nor would I spill it in vain
Your spirit sings
Though your lips never part
Singing only to me
The thief of your heart

Oh, you lost

Oh, you lost
Oh, you lost
Hope
You lost hope

Oh, you lost
Oh, you lost
Hope
You lost hope
