Where I came from there were no hills at all
The land was flat, the highway straight and wide
My brother and I, we'd drive for hours
Like we'd years instead of days
Our faces as pale as the dirty snow


Once I knew there was a love divine
Then came a time I thought it knew me not
Who can forgive forgiveness when forgiveness is not?
Only the land as white as snow

And the water it was icy
As it washed over me
And the moon shined above me

Now this dry ground it bears no fruit at all
Only poppies laugh under a crescent moon

The road refuses strangers
The land, the seeds we sowed
Where might we find a land as white as snow?

As boys we would go hunting in the wood
To sleep the night shooting out the stars
Now the wolves are every passing stranger
Every face we cannot know
If only a heart could be as white as snow
If only a heart could be as white as snow
