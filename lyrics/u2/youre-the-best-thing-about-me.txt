When you look so good
The pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good
And baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours
But the world is not your kind of thing
Full of shooting stars
Brighter as they're vanishing


Oh, you've seen enough
To know it's children who teach
You're still free enough
To wake up on a bed or a beach

You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing about me

I been crying out
How bad can a good time be
Shooting off my mouth
That's another great thing about me
I have everything
But I feel like nothing at all
There's no risky thing
For a man who's determined to fall

You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

Why am I
Why am I walking away?
(Walking away)
Why am I walking away?

I can see it all so clearly
I can see what you can't see
I can see you love her loudly
When she needs you quietly

You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

Why am I
Why am I walking away?
(Walking away)
Why am I walking away?
