Green light, seven, eleven
You stop in
For a pack of cigarettes
You don't smoke
Don't even want to
Hey! Now check you change
Dressed up like a car crash
The wheels are turning
But you're upside down
You say when he hits you
You don't mind
Because when he hurts you
You feel alive
Is that what it is?


Red light, gray morning
You stumble
Out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim
It depends on who's around
You used to stay in
To watch the adverts
You could lip synch
To the talk shows
And if you look
You look through me
And when you talk
Is not to me
And when I touch you
You don't feel a thing

If I could stay
Then the night would give you up
Stay
Then the day would keep its trust
Stay
and the night would be enough

Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satellite television
You can go anywhere
Miami, New Orleans
London, Belfast and Berlin
And if you listen
I can't call
And if you jump
You just might fall
And if you shout
I'll only hear you

If I could stay
Then the night would give you up
Stay
Then the day would keep its trust
If I could stay
With the demons you drowned
Stay
With the spirits I found
Stay
And the night would be enough

Three o'clock in the morning
It's quiet and there's no one around
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel runs to ground
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel hits to ground
