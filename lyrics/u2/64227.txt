Oh my love, it's a long way we've come.
From the freckled hills, to the steel and glass canyons.
From the stony fields, to hanging steel from the sky.
From digging in our pockets, for a reason not to say goodbye.


These are the hands that built America.
Ahhhh America.

Last saw your face, in a water colour sky.
As sea birds argue, a long goodbye.
I took your kiss on the spray of the new land star.
You gotta live in your dreams, don't make them so hard, ohhohh.

And these are the hands that built America.
Ahhhh America.

Of all of the promises, is this one we could keep?
Of all of the dreams, is this one still out of reach?

Halle, Ole

It's early fall, there's a cloud on the New York sky line.
Innocence, dragged across a yellow line.

These are the hands that built America.
These are the hands that built America.
Ahhhh America.
Ahhhh America.
