Rise Up 

In a stairway on a on a stone walk 
In a doorstep, golden light 
In a cold wind blowing 
In the danger, out of the storm 


I remain in you 
I will recall this storm 
This storm recalls you 

Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 

In the lands you have a garden 
In the garden it's going dark 
In the cold a wind blowing 
In the cold wind blowing 

I am in this doorway 
Feel her in this doorway 
Golden hills, golden memories 
I follow the ocean wherever it goes 

In the doorway I don't know where to start 
Emotion in the cold 
In the day, darkest night 
In the darkest night I know 
I stumble in these shoes 
In the dark night 

Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 

Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up 

Go in the lonely, lone 
Loneliness a path to go 
Only if you know 
Our love helps me know 
Your love will help me 
Discover you beneath the thing 
Only if you know 
Only rise up, rise up
