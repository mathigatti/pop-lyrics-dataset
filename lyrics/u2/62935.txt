Angel, everything's gonna be alright.
Angel, everything's gonna work out tonight.


Thirteen years old
Sweet as a rose
Every petal of her wafer thin.

Love will make you blind
Creep up from behind
Get you jumping out of your skin
Angel, it's sink or swim.

Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.

Door is closed behind me now
The window is sealed to shut out the light.
Green as the leaves
And the cure for the nettle sting.
Do your homework it'll work out right.

Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.

The scent of cedar
I can still see her
You can't return to the place you never left.

Angel, we'll make it work out tonight
Angel, I wanna be home tonight.

Door is closed behind me now
The window's sealed, to shut out the light
Green as the leaves the cure for the nettle sting
Do your work and you'll work out right.

Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place.
