Did you get it, did you need it
Was it really what you wanted.
Was it good in the sun
Did you really have some fun?


Did you smash it, did you grab it
Did you jump it like a rabbit.
Did you walk, did you run
Did you slap it, did you come?

And I know that you do 
Put your soul into the song.
Where did it all go wrong.
Where did it all go wrong.

Did you crack it, did you taunt it
Was it really what you wanted
Did you burn in the sun
or are you burning for someone?

Did you shoot it, did you stab it
Did you chase it like a rabbit
Did you walk, did you run
Did you come in at number one?

I know what you do
Put your soul in the song
But now it's sinking like you
Where did it all go wrong.

Did you drown it, did you clown it
Would you really have gone down on it
Did you clean it, clean it up
Did you rub it, did you soap.

Did you screen it, did you ream it
Did you ruin it, did you feed it
Is it warm in the sun
With your ear in her tongue.
