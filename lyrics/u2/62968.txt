She feel the ground is giving way
But she thinks we're better off that way.
"The more you take, the less you feel
The less you know the more you believe
The more you have, the more it takes today".


You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
Give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away

Well she don't care what it's worth
She's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth.

She's not waiting on a saviour to come
She's at the bus stop
With the News Of The World
And the sun, sun, here it comes.
She's not waiting for anyone.

You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
Give it away.
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away

Well she don't care what it's worth
She's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth.

Slipping away, slip, slide
Too many slipping away.
The world turns and we get dizzy
Slipping away.

She's living
She's living next week now.
You know she's gonna pay you back somehow.

She hasn't been to bed in a week
She'll be dead soon, then she'll sleep.

You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
Give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away

She already knows it hurts
She's living like it the last night on earth
The last night on earth
Last night on earth
Last night.
