It's time to go again 
To your blue room 
Got some questions to ask of you 
In your blue room 


The air is clean 
Your skin is clear 
I've had enough of 
hanging round here 
It's a different kind of conversation 
In your blue room 

Saw me coming 
In and outside 
Saw me coming 
Somewhere to hide 

And time is a string of pearls 
Your blue room 
Once again 
See the future just hanging there 
Your blue room 
A new frame 
A new perspective 
Looking down on my objectives 
Your instructions 
Whatever their directions 
Your blue room 

Saw me coming 
East by the moon 
Saw me coming 
Can you feel 

(It's allright) 

Your blue room 

One day I'll be back 
Your blue room 
Yeah, I hope I remember where it's at 
Your blue room 

We see me slide down 
Won't you give me a home 
So much for change 

Zooming in 
Zooming out 
Nothing I can't do without 
A lense to it all up close 
To Magnify what no one knows 
Never in company 
Never alone 
No car alarm 
No cellular phone
