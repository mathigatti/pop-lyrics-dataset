Don't move
Don't talk out-a time,
Don't think
Don't worry, everything's just fine
Just fine.


Don't grab
Don't clutch
Don't hope for too much
Don't breathe
Don't achieve
Don't grieve without leave.

Don't check, just balance on the fence
Don't answer
Don't ask
Don't try and make sense.

Don't whisper
Don't talk
Don't run if you can walk,
Don't cheat, compete
Don't miss the one beat.

Don't travel by train
Don't eat
Don't spill
Don't piss in the drain
Don't make a will.

Don't fill out any forms
Don't compensate
Don't cover
Don't crawl
Don't come around late
Don't hover at the gate


Don't take it on board
Don't fall on your sword
Just play another chord
If you feel you're getting bored

Don't change your brand
Don't listen to the band
Don't gape
Don't ape
Don't change your shape
Have another grape

Don't plead
Don't bridle
Don't shackle
Don't grind
Don't curve
Don't swerve
Don't lie, die, serve

Don't theorise, realise, polarise
Chance, dance, dismiss, apologise

Don't spy
Don't lie
Don't try
Imply
Detain
Explain
Start again

Don't triumph
Don't coax
Don't cling
Don't hoax
Don't freak
Peak
Don't leak
Don't speak

Don't project
Don't connect
Protect
Don't expect
Suggest

Don't project
Don't connect
Protect
Don't expect

Don't struggle
Don't jerk
Don't collar
Don't work
Don't wish
Don't fish
Don't teach
Don't reach

Don't borrow
Don't break
Don't fence
Don't steal
Don't pass
Don't press
Don't try
Don't feel

Don't touch
Don't dive
Don't suffer
Don't rhyme
Don't fantasise
Don't rise
Don't lie

Don't project
Don't connect
