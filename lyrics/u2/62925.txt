It was a cold and wet December day
When we touched the ground at J.F.K
The snow was melting on the ground
On B.L.S. I heard the sound
(Of an angel)
New York like a Christmas tree
Tonight, this city belongs to me
(Angel)


Soul love
Well this love won't let me go
So long
Angel of Harlem

Birdland on Fifty-Three
The street sounds like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme
Miles and she's got to be an angel
Lady Day got diamond eyes
She sees the truth behind the lies
(Angel)

Soul love
Well this love won't let me go
So long
Angel of Harlem

She says it's heart
Heart and soul
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (right now)

Blue light on the avenue
God knows they got to you
Empty glass, the lady sings
Eyes swollen like a bee-sting

Blinded, you lost your way
In the side streets and the alleyways
Like a star exploding in the night
Filling up the city with broad daylight

Angel in devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an angel
Angel of Harlem
