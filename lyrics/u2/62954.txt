I, I'm a humble guy
No really, I try
You know it's hard sometimes
You, you're messed up too
But both of us are gonna get through
I'm working my way to get to you.


Come on, come one, come on, come on
Be good to me.
Come on, come one, come on, come on
Be good to me.
Come on, come one, come on, come on
Be good to me.
Here it comes, here it comes
Holy Joe.

Please, don't make me say please
To champagne and ice cream
It's not what I want
It's what I need
Devotion, a little appreciation
A little heavy rotation
Oh, looks good on me.
I'm having the best of anybody's life
Closer than ever to everybody's wife, yeah.

Come on, come one, come on, come on
Be good to me.
Come on, come one, come on, come on
Be good to me.
Here it comes, here it comes
Holy Joe.

Come on, come one, come on, come on
Be good to me.
Come on, come one, come on, come on
Be good to me.
Come on, come one, come on, come on
Be good to me.
Come on, come one, come on, come on
Be good to me.
Here it comes, here it comes
Holy Joe.
Here it comes, here it comes
Holy Joe.
Here it comes, here it comes
Holy Joe.
