Judith? 
Judith? 
Can you hear me? 
Can you see me? 


Life on a distant planet 
Another atmosphere 
Life on a distant planet 
So cool inside of here 

You can see her but she can't see you 
You can call her name but she won't even hear you 

In the morning 
All through the day 
To the evening 
D-Day and beyond

Lost on a silent planet
To look rising stars 
Lost on a silent planet 
So close and yet so far 

Children scream and shout their eyes call out 
Judith turns around and stumbles to the ground 

In the morning 
All through the day 
To the evening time 
D-Day and beyond

Oh girl, you call out 
Oh girl you come out to cry
Have you nothing to say 
Can you come out to play 
Have you nothing to say 
Well... 

In the morning 
All through the daytime 
To the evening 
D-Day and beyond
