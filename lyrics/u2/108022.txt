Hearts gone astray
Keeping up when they go
I went away
Just when you needed me so
You won't regret
I'll come back begging you
Don't you forget
Welcome love we once knew
Yeah


Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love

Need you by my side
Come and be my pride
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love

From the very start
Open up your heart
Feel the love you've got
Everlasting love

This love will last forever
This love will last forever

Hearts gone astray
Keeping up when they go
I went away
Just when you needed me so
You won't regret it
I'll come back begging you
Don't you forget
Welcome love we once knew
Yeah

When life really flows
No one really knows
The sun will have to show them
Everlasting love

Like the sun it shines
Endlessly it shines
You always will be mine
Eternal love

Whenever love went wrong
Ours would still be strong
We'd have our own
Everlasting love

This love will last forever
This love will last forever

Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love

Need you by my side
Come and be my pride
Never be denied
Everlasting love

From the very start
Open up your heart
Feel the love you've got

Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
