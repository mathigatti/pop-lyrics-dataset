Slow is the memory 
I can see it stop in my front 
Flores orange crushed in concrete 
I walk around, barefoot 
Because I know you want me to 
I can not remember everything 
Your sweat is sweet taste as a stick of sugar 
I had been there before coming 
My tank is empty 
But you are based 
I have tried to explain 
What I love another person 
But I can not bear to hear you cry 
I was sick in all those years wasted 
A rag for the tears of someone 
I would bring out and hang dry pra 
And I saw you when I came back 
Perhaps we can begin to track the back forward 
You touch it because he knows how much I 
I think that we need to relax 
Because I know you want me to 
Every time and everywhere 
A superficial happiness but the belly is not there 
With the bad things you really should take care 
And the gap is too bear pra 
I have tried to explain 
What I love another person 
But I can not bear to hear you cry 
I was sick in all those years wasted 
A rag for the tears of someone 
I would bring out and hang dry pra 
Come, come 
Turn off the phone 
Please go home
