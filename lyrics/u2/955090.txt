Just a perfect day, drink sangria in the park 
And then later when it gets dark 
We go home 


Just a perfect day 
Feed animals in the zoo 
Then later a movie too 
And then home 

Oh it's such a perfect day / (Such a perfect day) 
I'm glad I spent it with you 
Oh such a perfect day 
You just keep me hanging on 
You just keep me hanging on 

Just a perfect day 
Problems are left alone 
Weekenders on our own 
It's such fun 

Just a perfect day 
You made me forget myself 
I thought I was someone else 
Someone good, yeah 

Oh it's such a perfect day / (Such a perfect day) 
I'm glad I spent it with you 
Oh such a perfect day 
You just keep me hanging on 
You just keep me hanging on 

You're gonna reap just what you sow / Reap reap reap, what you sow 
You're going to reap just what you sow / Reap reap reap, what you sow 
You're going to reap just what you sow / Reap reap reap, what you sow 
Oh, you're gonna to reap just what you sow / Reap reap reap, what you sow 
You're going to reap just what you sow / Reap reap reap, what you sow 
Reap reap reap, what you sow 
Oh what a perfect day
