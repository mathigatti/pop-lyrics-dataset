Well you can bump and grind
If it's good for your mind
Well you can twist and shout
Let it all hang out


But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No no

Well you can tell it plain
In the falling rain
I drive a Rolls Royce
'Cause it's good for my voice

But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No no

You won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool, no no baby you won't fool the children
No no you can die for the paradigm
You won't make it alive
