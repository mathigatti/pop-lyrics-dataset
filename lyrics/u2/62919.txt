I gotta go!
I believe in a celebration
I believe we can be free.
I believe you can loose these chains
I believe you can dance with me, dance with me.
Shake! Shake!
Shake! Shake!


I believe in the Third World War
I believe in the atomic bomb.
I believe in the powers-that-be
But they won't overpower me.

And you can go there too,
And you can go, go, go, go!
Shake! Shake!
Shake! Shake!

And we don't have the time
And everything goes round and round
And we don't have the time
To watch the world go tumbling down.
I believe in the bells of Christchurch
Ringing for this land.
I believe in the cells of Mountjoy
There's an honest man.

And you can go there too, etc.

I believe in the walls of Jericho
I believe they're coming down.
I believe in this city's children
I believe the trumpet's sound.

And you can go there too, etc.
