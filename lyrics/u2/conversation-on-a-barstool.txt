I'm tired, so tired I can hardly stand
I can't breathe in the air in this city tonight
It's taken everything I had to give
And now, I just want to get out of here


But I won't be sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or sympathy
But for forty five dollars I can make it
You wait and see

He came from miami to start out again
I hear that he's back with his mother ill
He told me he loved me and he wanted my child
But you know people change their minds

But I won't be sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or sympathy
But with forty five dollars I can make it
You wait and see

But I won't be sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy
But with forty five dollars I can make it
You wait and see

It isn't as if I was just anybody
On broadway I danced for that senator
They know me in london and they know me in paris
I'm only talking because you look like you needed a friend

But I won't sorry if you won't be
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy
But with forty five dollars
I'm halfway to miami
