Don't believe the devil
I don't believe his book
But the truth is not the same
Without the lies he made up
Don't believe in excess
Success is to give


Don't believe in riches
But you should see where I live
I, I believe in love
Don't believe in forced entry
Don't believe in rape
But every time she passes by
Wild thoughts escape
I don't believe in death row
Skid row or the gangs

Don't believe in the Uzi
It just went off in my hand
I, I believe in love
Don't believe in cocaine
Got a speed-ball in my head
I could cut and crack you open
Do you hear what I said
Don't believe them when they tell me
There ain't no cure

The rich stay healthy
While the sick stay poor
I, I believe in love
Don't believe in Goldman
His type like a curse
Instant karma's going to get him
If I don't
