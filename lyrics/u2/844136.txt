And I'll coming to say goodbye
Took inside and maids by buck-bye
More than dreams and the bottom come
When she would come back, right and well


And if you catch me I'll take your time
Ride on home in monday's own
Of this coldness in my heart
And this whole world riding home

Sweet baby Jane, sweet baby Jane
Sweet baby Jane, sweet baby Jane

And if you call, I'll come running
And if you ask, I will be given
And if you need me, I will be there
When you rush when the feeling's gone
I'll give you hope, I'll give you hate
By the burden's own, by the sun but it burns on
