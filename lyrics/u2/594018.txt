Don't want to lose my shirt
Don't want to dig the dirt
Don't want you to get hurt
Can't help it, I'm a flirt 


Don't want to take your drugs
Don't want to be your slug
Don't want to overdress
Don't want to make a mess
Don't want you to confess
Not under duress

Don't want to be untrue
I want to be with you

Don't want to lose my nerve
Don't want to clothe the curve
Don't want to make you swerve
Don't want what I deserve
Don't want to change the frame
Don't want to feel your pain
Don't want to stay the same
