Oh, and where do we go 
Where do we go from here 
Where to go 
To the side of a hill 
Blood was spilt 
We were still looking 
At each other 


Oh, we're goin' back there 
Jerusalem Jerusalem 

Shout, shout 
With a shout, shout it out 
Shout...shout it out... 

I wanna go 
To the foot of the messiah 
To the foot of he who made me see 
To the side of a hill 
Where we were still 
We were filled 
With our love 

We're gonna be there again 
Jerusalem Jerusalem 

Shout, shout 
With a shout 
Shout... 
With a shout
