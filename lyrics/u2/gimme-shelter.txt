Yeah, the storm is threatening
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Lord, I'm gonna fade away


War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Ooh, see the fire is sweeping
Our very street today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost its way

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape and murder
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape and murder
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape baby baby baby and murder
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape baby baby baby band murder
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Yeah, c’mon

Yeah, yeah so the storm is threatening
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Lord, I'm gonna fade away

War and children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War and children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

It's just a shot away
War, children

Shot away, shot away

Shot away, shot away

Kiss away, kiss away
