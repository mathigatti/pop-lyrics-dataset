All the promises we made from the
Cradle to the grave


You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night
You say you'll give me eyes on a moon of blindness
A rive in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest

All the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you want your love to work out right
To last with me through the night
You say you want a diamond on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
You love not to grow cold

All the promises we break from the
Cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
All I want is you
