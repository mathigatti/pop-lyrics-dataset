Yesterday I spent asleep, woke up in my clothes in a dirty heap
Spent the night trying to make a deadline
Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline
I have your face in an old polaroid
Tidying the children's clothes and toys
You're smiling back at me, I took the photo from the fridge
Can't remember what then we did


I haven't been with a woman it feels, like, for years
Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears
This shitty world sometimes produces a rose
The scent of it lingers but then it just goes

Return the call to home

The worst of us are a long, drawn out confession
The best of us are geniuses of compression
You say you're not gonna leave the truth alone
I'm here 'cause I don't wanna go home

Child drinking dirty water from the riverbank
Soldier brings oranges, he got out from a tank
Waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come
Watching the sun go down in Lebanon

Return the call to home

Now I got a head like a lit cigarette
Unholy clouds reflecting a minaret
You're so high above me, higher than everyone
Where are you in the Cedars of Lebanon?

Choose your enemies carefully 'cause they will define you
Make them interesting, 'cause in some ways they will mind you
They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends
Gonna last with you longer than your friends
