Oh, wrap me in my country's flag, and lay me in the
cold blue sea
Let the roaring of the waves, my solemn requiem be
And I shall sleep a pleasant sleep, while storms above
their vigils keep


My Captain brave shall read for me, the service of the
silent dead
And yay shall lower me in the waves, when all the
prayers are said
And I will find my long, long home, among the billows
and the foam
Farewell my friends for many a league, we've sailed
together on the deep
Come let us shake our hands, I'll sail no more, but
shipmates wear for weep

I'm bound above, my course is run
I near the port, my voyage is done.
