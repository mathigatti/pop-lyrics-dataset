What is it that keeps me back from you
What is it when I just can't get through
What is it when we've nothing left to do
But savor the mess that we tried


What is it when the clock just won't rewind
What is it when our love seems to stop time
I'm telling you
Waving a white flag
Baby got a white flag flying for you baby
Got a white flag, a white flag

Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground

And now it's only alive in my head
In my mind
All in my head, in my mind

Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground

Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground
Angels too tied to the ground
