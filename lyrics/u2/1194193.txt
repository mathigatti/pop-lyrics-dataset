Oh Vanessa holding time with your beautiful eyes of velvet
She dance in the rain, was lost in our games
Turn our backs to the world the night
Sleep in the grass


Stay tuned for passage of the seasons
While the days leading our innocence
We are holding in safety
But we can not open
The summer so early for Vanessa

Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh

She is beautiful before you start to cry
How many stars reflected in your eye
Vanessa

Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh

She is beautiful before you start to cry
How many stars reflected in your eye
Vanessa

Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
Oohhh oohhh oooh oohhh
