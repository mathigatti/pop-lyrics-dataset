It's a beautiful day
Everything is goin' my way
Even the words are doing what I say
Oh babe, got to get away.
To be impossible
Isn't that difficult
In the city you're invisible
When you come from a small town.


Everything is alright
Everything is alright
I'm not your baby, please.

Tourist in a traffic jam
Babycham and handicam.
I'm not your mother, you're not my man.
I'm not your baby.
Don't treat me like I'm a trick
I won't treat you like you're a prick.
Don't need no doctor, I'm not ill.
I'm not your baby.
Everything is alright, etc.

Cut out the poetry
Let's hit the main artery
No time for a tourniquet
Let the colours all run out of me.
You've brought me all kinds of goods
Now my heart is so full up it hurts.
It's heavy as a shopping bag
Full of things I should give back.

Everything is alright
Everything is alright
I'm not your baby, please.

Not dizzy, just busy
Didn't drink nothing fizzy
No pills to feel easy
Don't know what got into me
Daylight a kinda robbery
The night is your geography
You're not white
You're pink and rosy
You could be right 
But you're way above me.

I'm in recovery
A star of pornography.
I'm a tourist
There's a lot to see
You don't like the photographs of me
So, you've got a lot to say
You don't sleep around, but sometimes you stray
You don't believe
But oftentimes you pray for something
What is it babe?

Don't treat me like I'm a trick
I won't treat you like you're a prick.
Don't need no doctor, I'm not sick.
I'm not your baby.
Everything is alright
Everything is alright
I'm not your baby.
