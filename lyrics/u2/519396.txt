I have got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me


So deep in my heart
You're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I have tried so not to give in
I have said to myself this affair
Never gonna go so well

But why should I try to resist
When baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything
Come what might
For the sake of holding you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
And repeats and it shouts in my ear

Don't you know blue-eyes
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality

But each time I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

'cause I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything
Come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
And repeats and it shouts in my ear

Don't you know you fool
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality

But each time that I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

'cause I've got you under my skin
And I love you (when you're) under my skin
