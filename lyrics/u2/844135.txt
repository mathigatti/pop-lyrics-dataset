Like to, I'd like to try a song that I
Think we've only played once before, so
This is a city that a lot of irish people came to this city,right?
So this time, this irish, these irish people
Came as rock and roll band, okay?
So, but this is a folk song
It's like, the irish kinda' hold america
In a very special place because, for over a hundred years or more
Irish have come over here to find work and find a future
And they brouught with them songs, old irish folk songs
That became old american folk songs
And, I hope maybe we'd leave behind some songs one day.
This is a song written by peggy seeger
It's a song
I wished I'd heard this song on the raidio
During the miners' strike in england a few years ago
This is called springhill mining disaster


In the town of springhill nova scotia
Down in the dark of the cumberland mine
There's blood on the coal, and the miners lie
In roads that never saw sun or sky
Roads

Shut up for a second, will you?
Stop whistling 'cause I'm not in the beatles, okay?
It's U2 here

In the town of springhill
They don't sleep easy
Often the earth will tremble and roll
When the earth is restless
Miners die

Bone and blood is the price of coal
Bone and blood is the price of coal

Listen to the shouts of the black faced miner
Listen to the call of the rescue team
We have no water, light or bread
So we're living on songs and hope instead
Living on songs and hope instead

In the town of springhill nova scotia
Down in the dark of the cumberland mine
There's blood on the coal, and the miners lie
In roads that never saw sun or sky
Roads that never saw sun nor sky

In the town of springhill
Don't sleep easy
Often the earth will tremble and roll
When the earth is restless
Miners die

Bone and blood is the price of coal
Bone and blood is the price of coal
Bone and blood is the price of coal
