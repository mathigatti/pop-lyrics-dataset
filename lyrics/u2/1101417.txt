I hear in color, I see in black person and white 
I falante age my mirror, but would not answer 
I tried speaking, but my language was very thick 
Oh oh the baby, I had sufficiently of this if to cagar 
Then I looked at my eye, the mirror for my soul, 
This life is good, but this ai not rock'n'roll 


My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes 
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes 
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes 
My head is rockin', rockin, 

Bad seed, rye drink is my fuel to fly 
Running in reserve, I gave for the easy life a test 
I am looking at in my eye, the mirror for my soul, 
This life is good, but this ai not rock'n'roll, not 

My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes 
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes 
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes 
My head is rockin', rockin, 

My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes 
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes 
My head is rockin' and my coil of eyes 
My head is rockin', rockin, 

Sex, drugs, and rock'n roll, are all the same you 
Girls who dance in the table, doin' arrulho of hoochy 
Sticky soils and smokey if lodge I started to lose 
I lose looking a girl to slide in this 
Then I looked at my eye, the mirror for my soul, 
This life is good, but this ai not rock'n'roll, not 
This all cool life/Life is good 
But this ai not rock'n'roll, not 
This life is good, but this ai not rock'n'roll, none not
