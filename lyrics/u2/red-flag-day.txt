I am made of all that I'm afraid of
I'm most afraid of losing you
Hell's a season
You're the reason that I even dreamt of getting through


I, I can feel your body shaking
I, I will meet you where the waves are breaking

Baby it's a red flag day
Baby let's get in the water
Taken out by a wave
Where we've never been before

Baby it's a red flag day
Baby let's go a bit further
Paradise is a place
You can see when it's yours
Red flag day
Red flag day

Sun comes here and oceanic feeling
Sky will soon be clear
Today we can't afford to be afraid of what we fear

I, I can feel your body shaking
I, I will meet you where the waves are breaking

Baby it's a red flag day
Baby let's get in the water
Taken out by a wave
Where we've never been before

Baby it's a red flag day
Baby let's go a bit further
Paradise is a place
You can see when it's yours
Red flag day
Baby it's a red flag day
Red flag day

Not even news today
So many lost in the sea last night
One word that the sea canâ€™t say
Is no, no, no, no

Baby it's a red flag day
Red flag day
Baby it's a red flag day
Baby let's get in the water
