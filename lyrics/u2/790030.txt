Shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky


It's no secret that the stars
Are falling from the sky
It's no secret that I left you
And still I don't know why
You say the sun is sometimes
Eclipsed by a moon
You know I'd come back, baby
If you gave me some room

It's no secret that a friend
Is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar
Won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something
You tell one other person
What do you think
Child...

Love...shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky

A man will beg
A man will crawl
But it's never too late
To take his call
It's no secret at all

It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
And everyone needs music 'cause everyone needs relief

Love...live like a shining star
She calls, the sun will burn

A man will rise
A man will fall
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all

Love...you shine like a burning star
You're falling from the sky
Tonight...

Love...you shine like a burning star
You're falling from the sky

A man will rise
A man will fall
Tonight...
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe expolded 'cause one man told a lie
Look, I gotta go, yeah I'm running outta change
There's a lot of things, if I could I'd rearrange

Love...shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky
