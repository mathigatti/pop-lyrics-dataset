The night gave you a song
A light had been turned on
You walked out in the world
Like you belong there


As easy as a breeze
Each heart was yours to please
Is it only me who sees
There’s something wrong there

Oh, la, la, la
I’m not a ghost now
I can see you
You need to see me

It’s the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way

It's the little things that tease and betray
As the hunted I become the prey
It's the little things
The little things that give you away

I saw you on the stairs
You didn’t notice I was there
That’s ‘cause you were talking at me
And not to me

You were high above the storm
A hurricane being born
This freedom it might cost you
Your liberty

It’s the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way
It’s the little things that tease and betray
As the hunted I become the prey
It’s the little things
The little things that give you away

Sometimes
I can’t believe my existence
I see myself on a distance
I can’t get back inside

Sometimes
The air is so anxious
All my thoughts are so reckless
And all of my innocence has died

Sometimes
I wake at four in the morning
Where all the doubt is swarming
And it covers me in fear

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

Sometimes
I'm full of anger and grieving
So far away from believing
That any song will reappear

Sometimes
The end is not dawning
It’s not coming
The end is here, sometimes

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

Sometimes
When the paintings are shadows
And you're the only that matters
And I can see you through the tears

Sometimes
The end isn’t coming
It’s not coming
The end is here
Sometimes
