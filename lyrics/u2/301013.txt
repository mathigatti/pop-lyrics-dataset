Wake up 
The dawn of another dull day 
Take up 
Your dreams and on your way 


Daylight 
Mother stands in the hall 
Last night 
Head against the wall 

When night turns to day 
And the children come out to play 
Another day 

Stop, shake out 
They come my way 

Boy, salute in a street uniform 
Toy, soldier ripped and torn 

When night turns to day 
And the children come out to play 
Another day 

Stop, shout 
They came my way 

(My heart)
