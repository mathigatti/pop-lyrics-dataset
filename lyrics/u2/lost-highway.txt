I'm a rolling stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I pass by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway


Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's laugh makes a life like mine
The day we met, I went astray
I started down that lost highway

Just like to thank you for being with us tonight
We love you and we know you love us, too
And it's great to know that in Los Angeles it's love, not money, that makes the world go around. Hallelujah
Everybody say amen, amen.

I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
But now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I take a cost, on the lost highway

Last verse

Boys, don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started down that lost highway

Amen, amen
