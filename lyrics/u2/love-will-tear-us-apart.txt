When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again


Why is the bedroom so cold
You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed, our respect run so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Do you cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed
There's a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Just that something so good
Just can't function no more
When love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
