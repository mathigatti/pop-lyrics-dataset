Judith? judith?)
(can you hear me?)
(can you see me?)


Life on a distant planet
Another atmosphere
Life on a distant planet
So cold inside of here

You can see her
But she can't see you
You can call her name
But she won't even hear you

In the morning of the day
To the evening
D-day and beyond

Lost on a silent planet
Two lone, rising stars
Locked on a silent planet
So close and yet so far

Children scream and shout
Their eyes torn out
Judith turns around and stumbles
To the ground

In the morning of the day
The evening time
D-day and beyond

Oh...girl you fall out
Oh...girl you come out to cry
Have you nothing to say
Girl you come out to cry
Have you nothing to say

In the morning
On to the day time
To the evening
