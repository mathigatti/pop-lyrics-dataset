I know you're so sad
So sad you can't cry
But i know you let go
Although you can't remember why



Your lipstick don't fit
Your strap's coming loose
You're out in the hall
Waltzing the blues


Now you hurt somewhere
They won't find a bruise
You've been learning to walk
In those dancin' shoes


I had a mama
She told me 'bout you
She said true love don't lie
You touch that woman
And the smoke won't leave your eyes


You're talking, you walk
'cause you can't refuse
Learning to walk
In those dancin' shoes


Now you hurt somewhere
They won't find a bruise
Learning to walk
