Yell so the book is gone
Well time goes on
Well, will we resign
Well, well the book is on
Well time can run
When will we sign
Well, when the pully is high
When the time is low
Well, there I grow
Well, what can I be
When will we see
The time is near


Tick tock tock tock time goes away
Tick tock then time goes away

Well, what will it be
Where love can be
Will it end there
When will it still be strong
When time moves on
When time will rhyme
