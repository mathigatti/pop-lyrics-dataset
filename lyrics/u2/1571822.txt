You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act


Silence, I know I could get used to this
Cunning, your scent is something I'm not gonna miss
Exile, it's a small price to pay for bliss
Alone, like the painter's dog without a bone
When there's only one thing you need to own
And that is hunger, hunger itself

I know you'll be convinced
Your mattress ripped, and it is torn to shreds
From all the lovers taken to your beds
They're empty now
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love someone into love

You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act

Jealousy, it's not what it's cracked up to be
Envy, gets you where you need to be
Alone, rather the river than your stepping stones
Leave the graveyard 'fore you turn to bones
I'm tragic, you're comedy

Oh, baby doll, the dogs are barking, they need to be fed
All the lepers you let in your head - is it empty now?
Cos you think that you can love
And you think that you can love
And you think that you can love someone into love

You do your disappearing act
You do your disappearing act
