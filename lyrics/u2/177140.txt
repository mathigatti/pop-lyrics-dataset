Oh, oh my love 
Oh my darling 
I,ve hungered for your touch 
A long and lonely time 


And time goes by so slowly 
And time can do so much 
Are you still mine 

I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
God speed your love to me 

Lonely rivers flow 
To the sea, to the sea 
To the open arms of the sea 

Lonely rivers sigh 
Wait for me, wait for me 
I,ll be coming home 
Wait for me 

Oh, oh my love 
Oh my darling 
I,ve hungered for your touch 
A long and lonely time 

And time goes by so slowly 
And time can do so much 
Are you still mine 

I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 
God speed your love to me (it to me) 
God speed your love to me 
(I need your love) 
[Repeat until end]
