Search on, man
God speed and forgive you


Moonshine night
Mountain village
Insane in the woods
In the deep trees

Under the moon
Beneath the stars
They reel and dance
The young folk

Led to the lake
By a king and queen
Oh, I want to be there
I want us to be there
Beside the lake
Beneath the moon
Cool and swollen
Dripping its hot liquor

Frozen moment by a lake
A knife has been stolen
The death of the snake

I know the impossible sea
When the dogs bark
I am a death bird
Naughty night bird

There’s a belief by the children
Of man which states all will be well
Search on, man
Calm saviour
Veteran of wars, incalculable greed
Search on, man
Calm saviour
God speed and forgive you
Morning star
Fragrant meadow person girl

Waiting for us
Waiting for us
Waiting for us
They’re coming
Don’t you
In the broken dagger
My kind of yearn

Who is this
Hush now

Here, out in the desert somewhere in new mexico, the feds have their own covert, non-existent missile-testing facilities. You know, but it goes on for several hundreds of miles with those scary signs that read: “do not trespass or we shoot.” deploying what they call weather balloons, when in actuality it is hydrogen testing.

Before we end our day, oh lord
We make this prayer to you
Before we end our day, oh lord
We make this prayer to you

These tests happen so far underground the fallout feeds into our water supply.

That you continue in your love
To guard your people here
That you continue in your love
To guard your people here

Be patient. It will be ready for consumption in less than 30 years.

Give us this night untroubled rest
And build our strength in you
Give us this night untroubled rest
And build our strength in you

Your splendour driving far away
All darkness of the fog
Your splendour driving far away
All darkness of the fog

Our hearts desire to love you, lord
Watch over while we sleep
Our hearts desire to love you, lord
Watch over while we sleep

That when the new day dawns on high
We may your praises sing
That when the new day dawns on high
We may your praises sing

Amen, amen, amen, amen
