The winter doesn't want you
It haunts you summer serenadings
A long way from this frozen place
Your face


Our teacher, our preacher
It's nature and like flowers growing in a bomb crater
From nothing a rose it grows

I've been thinking about the west coast
Not the one that everyone knows
I'm sick of living in the shadows
We've one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love
A summer of love

We're freezing we're leaving
Believing that all we need is to head over somewhere
In a summer to come
So we run

I've been thinking about the west coast
Not the one that everyone knows
I'm sick of living in the shadows
We've one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love
A summer of love

Oh and when all is lost
When all is lost we find out what remains
Oh the same oceans crossed
For some it’s pleasure, for some it’s pain

I've been thinking about the west coast
Not the one that everyone knows
In the rubble of aleppo
Flowers blooming in the shadows
For a summer of love
A summer of love
