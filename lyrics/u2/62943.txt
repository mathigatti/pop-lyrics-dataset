You know he got the cure
You know he went astray
He used to stay awake
To drive the dreams he had away.
He wanted to believe
In the hands of love
In the hands of love.


His head it felt heavy
As he came across the land
A dog started cryin'
Like a broken-hearted man
At the howling wind
At the howling wind.

He went deeper into black
Deeper into white.
He could see the stars shine
Like nails in the night.

He felt the healing, healing
Healing hands of love
Like the stars shiny, shiny from above.

A hand in the pocket
Fingering the steel
The pistol weighed heavy
And his heart he could feel was beating
Beating, beating, beating,
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love, oh my love.

So hands that build
Can also pull down
Even the hands of love.

Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A (many times)
