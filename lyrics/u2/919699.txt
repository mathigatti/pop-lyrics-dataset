That's life, that's what all the people say
You're ridin' high in April, you're shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June


I say that's life, and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, get me down
'Cause this old world, just keeps spinnin' around

I've been a puppet, a poet, a pauper, a pirate, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life, I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting baby, but my heart just won't buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth just one more try
I'd roll myself up in a big ball and die

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down, over and out, I know one thing
Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face
I just pick myself up and I get back in the race

That's life, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting baby, but my heart just won't buy it
But if there's nothin' shakin' come here this July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
