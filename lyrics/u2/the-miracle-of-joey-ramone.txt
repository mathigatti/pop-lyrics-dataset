I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise, above the hurt


I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blided
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
I woke up at the moment when then the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned
In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain, and give it a name

I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blided
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occured
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned
In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

We can hear you
We can hear you
We can hear you
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occured
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices will someday be returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard
Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard
