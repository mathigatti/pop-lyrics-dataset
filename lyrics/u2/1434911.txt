Magnificent
Oh, oh, magnificent
I was born
I was born to be with you
In this space and time
After that and ever after I haven't had a clue
Only to break rhyme
This foolishness can leave a heart black and blue
Oh, oh


Only love, only love can leave such a mark
But only love, only love can heal such a scar

I was born
I was born to sing for you
I didn't have a choice but to lift you up
And sing whatever song you wanted me to
I give you back my voice
From the womb my first cry, it was a joyful noise
Oh, oh

Only love, only love can leave such a mark
But only love, only love can heal such a scar
Justified till we die, you and I will magnify, oh-oh
The Magnificent
Magnificent, oh, oh

Only love, only love can leave such a mark
But only love, only love unites our hearts
Justified till we die, you and I will magnify, oh-oh
The Magnificent
Magnificent
Magnificent
