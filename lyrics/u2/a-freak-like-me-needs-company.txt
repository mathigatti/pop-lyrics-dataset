If you’re looking for a night out on the town
You just found me
A freak like me needs company
I’m a 65 million dollar circus tragedy
A freak like me needs company
I’m not rollin’, baby rollin’
In the green but I’m unique
Freak, a freak, freak
I’m the new coney island
And all the rides are open and free
On me
Freak like me needs company


All the weirdos in the world
Are right here in new york city
All the brazen boys and girls
Dressed to kill without pity
All the weirdos from out of town
And all the freaks always around
All the weirdos in the world
Are here in new york city tonight
Here in new york city tonight

I got a crew of party animal mutants by my side
A freak like me needs company
Demon hairdo evil dressers who just won’t be denied
A freak like me needs company
The crossroads of the roads just need a little tweak
From a freak
I said goodbye to my straight life
‘Cause I love a freak
A freak like me needs company

All the weirdos in the world
Are here right now in new york city
All the brazen boys and girls
Peacocks, posers show no pity
All the weirdos from out of town
And all the freaks always around
All the weirdos in the world
Are here in new york city tonight
Here in new york city tonight

Oh yeah
That’s the boys
And the ladies sing
