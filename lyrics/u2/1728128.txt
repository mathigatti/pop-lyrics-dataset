Forty-five light years
From home
From where you are
Where I wanna be
Beside you


Looking for direction
Star to your affection
The space between you and me

I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For it
I can't wait any longer
For your love

The birds still singing for them
As they fly above the firmament
It's not a song of discontent
It's not like that
Up in the sky

Here I am, a space guy
Caught between the love and logic
Out here in the universe
Hey hey

I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For it
I can't wait any longer
For your love

And a day as it ends
And you watch as the sun goes down
Pray that the night
Will go quickly now
Your hope
Your prayer
And the clouds leave the sky alone
There's only one light that can guide you
Guide you

I can't wait any longer
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For your love
For your love

It's like the silence and shock
Of the lights up there shining
You want it
You got it
You want it
