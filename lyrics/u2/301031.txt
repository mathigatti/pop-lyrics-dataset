Today, while on my way 
I met a man in gray 
Yesterday 


Told a story, oh 
I've a ring of gold 
He was told 

The dream is over 
The dream is over 
The dream is over 
(Wake up) 

Tomorrow, I will seek and find 
The peace of mind 
He left behind 

So, he knows I know 
I've a ring of gold 
He was told 

The dream is over 
The dream is over 
The dream is over 
The dream is over / Over 

The dream is over / The dream, is over 
The dream is over / And now the dream is over
