The sea it swells like a sore head
And the night it is aching
Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed
And the day it is breaking
On rainy days we'd go swimming out
On rainy days swimming in the sound
On rainy days we'd go swimming out


You're in my mind all of the time
I know that's not enough
If the sky can crack
There must be someway back
For love and only love

Electrical Storm (x2)
Baby, don't cry

Car alarm won't let you back to sleep
You're kept awake dreaming someone elses dream
Coffee is cold but it'll get you through
Compromise that's nothing new to you
Let's see colours that have never been seen
Let's go to places no one else has been

You're in my mind all of the time
I know that's not enough
If the sky can crack
There must be someway back
To love and only love
Electrical storm (x3)
Baby, don't cry!

It's hot as hell, honey, in this room
Sure hope the weather will break soon
The air is heavy, heavy as a truck
We need the rain to wash away our bad luck

Well if the sky can crack
There must be some way back
To love and only love
Electrical storm (x3)
Baby, don't cry! (x4)
