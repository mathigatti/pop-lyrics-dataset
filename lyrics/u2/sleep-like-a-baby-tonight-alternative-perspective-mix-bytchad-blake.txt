Wake
In the morning when you wake up
You won’t have much but you’ll have enough
When you are weakest I’ll be strong enough for you
Dreams, the ones where you are fearless
Can’t break what’s broken, you are tearless
Steal back your innocence
That’s what they stole from you


You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
But you can sleep like a baby tonight

Stop, stop
Where you stand right now, just stop
Don’t think or look down at the drop
The people staring from the street don’t know what you’ve got

You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
No, not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
But you can sleep like a baby tonight

Hope is where the door is
When home is where the war is
Where nobody can feel no one else’s pain

You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
You’ve got to sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Take care of your heart until it is light
Where you stand, where you fall is where I kneel
To take your heart back to where you can feel
Like a child, a child
