Hey, see you soon
Sail through your room
I'll meet you there



Hey, be my friend
Stay 'til the end
Don't walk away
Hey, hey, hey, hey...


Hey, take 'em off
Don't talk that way
Don't feel my lover say
Hey, hey, hey...


Chains move that thing
Chains we can see
My chains way too long
Chains in this
Chains move that thing
Chains we could see
Chains are way too long
And I hear my song
Hear my song
