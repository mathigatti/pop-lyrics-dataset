Afraid, but he will not run 
Alone, thy will be done
Confessed, but you still 
Feel the shame
Bring me into 
Your arms again 


Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 

Touch these eyes 
With your broken smile
Touch my mouth 
With your furrowed brow 

Lift my heart 
Feel my shame 
Lead me into 
Rest again 

Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 

The night is long 
But the day will come 
With promises 
For the chosen one 

Sowed the seed 
Sweet taste therein 
Call tonight into 
My arms again 

Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 
Heroine 

The night is long 
But the day will come 
With promises 
For the chosen one 

Sowed the seed 
Sweet taste therein
Follow dead of night into
The light of day
