Innocent, and in a sense I am
Guilty of the crime that's now in hand
Such a nice day to throw your life away
Such a nice day, let it go


Cold in his eyes, I can't believe it
Cold, this hear is slow
Heart is stone

Call me, such a cold heart
Such a cold man, watch you tear yourself apart

So lay me down, my soul to give
So lay me down, the longest sleep
Oh, the longest sleep

In I come and out you go you get
Here we are again, now place your bets
Is this the time, the time to win or lose?
Is this the time, the time to choose?

Cold these eyes, I can't believe it
So deep inside a cold fire
Cold, this heart is slow

Don't do it, d-d-don't do it
Don't do it, d-d-don't do it
Anytime you're on there (Kiss me)
Won't you tell me
That's it just give me it

In some white track
You come right back
Cartoon cutout
Cut throat let out
I'm on your side
Be on the both side
I'm on right track
You get off my back
I'm no dope
I give you hope
Here's the rope
Here's the rope
Now...swing away
