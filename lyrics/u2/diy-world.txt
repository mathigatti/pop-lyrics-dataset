‘Cause we can be what we wanna be
And we need to be what we gotta be
That’s what we oughta be in the diy world


‘Cause we can be what we wanna be
Tomorrow belongs to the brave
And we need to be what we gotta be
Do it yourself
Do it yourself
Diy world

Gamma rays, tidal waves, influenza
There’s so many ways
The human race can take a hit
We’re gonna sink but you can swim
If you don’t mind a little change of skin
Designer genes are a better fit

‘Cause we can be what we wanna be
And we need to be what we gotta be
And that’s what we oughta be
In the diy world
Cause we can be what we wanna be
Tomorrow belongs to the brave
And we need to be what we gotta be
Not the slave but the brave
Do it yourself
Do it yourself
Diy world

Rising seas, no more trees
Then be a freaking fleet of killer bees
We’re masters of creation
Dna is the way
Now that evolution’s had its day
The intelligent design solution
And we, we could live for a thousand years

‘Cause we can be what we wanna be
And we need to be what we gotta be
That’s what we oughta be
In the diy world
Cause we can be what we wanna be
Do it yourself
And we need to be what we gotta be
Yourself, do it yourself
That’s what we oughta be
In the diy world
Do it yourself
Do it yourself
Do it yourself

‘Cause we can be what we wanna be
Tomorrow belongs to thte brave
Not the slave
And we need to be what we gotta be
But the brave
Do it yourself
Do it yourself
Diy world

Imagine, we could produce super-strength
Electric reflexes
Powers once reserved for the ancient gods
Are now within our grasp

And we, we could live
We could live for a thousand years
