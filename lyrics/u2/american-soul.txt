[Kendrick Lamar]
Blessed are the bullies
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves
Blessed are the liars
For the truth can be awkward


[Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

Look around
Look around
Look around
It's a sound
Look around
Look around
It's a sound

It's not a place
This country is to me a thought
That offers grace
For every welcome that is sought

You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

It's not a place
This is a dream the whole world owns
The pilgrim's face
It had your heart to call her home

Hold on, brother John
Too many mothers weeping
Dream on, brother John
In your dreams you canâ€™t be sleeping

You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

American
American

Put your hands in the air
Hold up the sky
Could be too late, but we still gotta try

There's a moment in life where a soul can die
In a person, in a country, when you believe the lie
The lie, the lie, the lie
There's a promise at the heart of every good dream
It's a call to action, not a fantasy
The end of the dream, the start of what's real
Let it be unity, let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be my sanctuary?
Refu-Jesus

You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

American soul
American soul
