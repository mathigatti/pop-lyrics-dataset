One, two, three, four
Oh Jesus was a man
Who traveled through the land
A hard working man and brave
Well he said to the rich give your money to the poor
For they layed Jesus Christ in his grave
Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah
For they layed Jesus Christ is his grave


Well he went to the preacher
He went to the law
Told them all the same
He said sell all your jewelery and give it to the poor
For they layed Jesus Christ in his grave
Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah
For they layed Jesus Christ in his grave

When Jesus came to town all the working folks around
Believed what he did say
Well the bankers and the preachers 
They nailed him on a cross
For they layed Jesus Christ in his grave

And [hard] working people
They followed him around
They sung and shouted gay 
Well the cops and the soldiers
They nailed him in the head

And they layed Jesus Christ in his grave

Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah
For they layed Jesus Christ in his grave
Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah

Well this song was written in New York City
A rich man, preacher and slave
Well if Jesus was to preach while he preached in Galilee
They would lay Jesus Christ in his grave
One, two, three, four !

Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah
For they layed Jesus Christ in his grave
Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah
Hah-le, halelujah
For they layed Jesus Christ in his grave
