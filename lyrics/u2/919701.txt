Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying


Oh Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
And war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate

You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay
Picket lines won't block our way

Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, and you can see

What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on

Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong
But who are they to judge us
Together we can be strong

You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay
The picket lines won't block our way
Don't punish me with brutality
And talk to me
So you can see

Oh what's going on
What's going on
Oh, what's going on
Yeah, what's going on
Let's see what's going on
What's going on
What's going on
Yeah, what's going on
