U2 - Are You Gonna Wait Forever



All the obstacles in my way, now 
Are disappearing every day, now 
I'm getting closer 
We're getting closer to home 
It won't be long until the summer comes 


Are you gonna wait forever? 
Are you gonna wait forever? 

Getting out from under my bed, now 
I'm going to say the things I should have said, now 
Getting closer 
Getter to close to what's true 
Gonna find myself in you 

Are you gonna wait forever? 
Are you gonna wait forever? 
Are you gonna wait forever? 
Are you gonna wait forever? 

There's no one there behind their eyes 
They're in the business, beautiful lies 
We'll keep the promise 
Cause we don't know how to break it 
The furniture you can rearrange 
Don't trade your dreams for some small change 
Guard the flame, we're better living naked 

Are you gonna wait forever? 
Are you gonna wait forever? 
Are you gonna wait forever? 
How? 
Are you gonna wait forever? 
How, how long, how long? 
Or is it now, now, now? 
Or is it now?
