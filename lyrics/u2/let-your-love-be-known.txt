Yes, there was silence
Yes, there was no people here
Yes, I walked through the streets of Dublin
And no-one was near
Yes, I don’t know you
No, I didn’t think I didn’t care
You live so very far away from just across the square


And I can’t reach but I can ring
You can’t touch but you can, you can sing
Across rooftops
Sing down the phone
Sing and promise me you won’t stop
Sing your love, be known
Let your love be known

Yes, there is isolation
You and me, we’re still here
Yes, when we open our eyes we will stare down the fear
And maybe I’ve said the wrong thing
Yes, I made you smile
I guess the longest distance is always the last mile

And I can’t reach but I can ring
You can’t touch but you can, you can sing
Across rooftops
Sing to me down the phone
Sing and promise me you won’t stop
Sing and you’re never alone

Sing as an act of resistance
Sing, though your heart is overthrown
Sing, when you sing there is no distance
So let your love be known
Oh, let your love be known
Though your heart is overthrown
Let your love be known
