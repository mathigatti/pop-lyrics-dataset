C'mon everybody:
C'mon everybody let's get together tonight
I got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it right
Been a-doin' my homework all week long
The house is empty, the folks are gone
Ooo c'mon everybody


Well my baby's number one but I'm gonna dance with three or four
And the house'll be shakin' from my bare feet slappin' the floor
When you hear that music you can't sit still
If your brother won't rock you then your sister will
Ooo c'mon everybody

Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside
If my folks come home I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide
They'll be no more movies for a week or two
No more runnin' round with the usual crew
Who cares c'mon everybody

C'mon everybody
C'mon everybody
