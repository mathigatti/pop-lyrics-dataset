That pace is too hot to handle 
As stories that are too good to be true 
You want to join in the action 
And do believe it came from you 
And then you begin to erect the time 
Because who has time to down there? 
But in the noise and confusion 
You are losing contact with the sound 


Of the air waves ... 
Check the message in the air waves 
Do not let it escape 

A lover escorrega in its orbit 
To show a path easier 
But as an idiot you think that the mission it 
We supply the parts that are missing in you 
And then you discover that it can not deliver 
His world is upside-down 
And the noise and confusion 
You are losing contact with the sound 

Of the air waves ... 
Check the message in the air waves 
All you need is in the air waves 
Oh, do not let it escape ... 

Because the time will come / Check the message 
When I and you are one / In the air waves 
Getting / Check the message 
To touch the hearts of all / On the air waves 
The time will come / Check the message, in the air waves 
When I and you are one / Check the message 
Getting / In the air waves 
To touch the hearts of all / Check the message 


(Check the message, in the air waves) 

(The heart is beating, in the air waves) 

(Check the message, in the air waves)
