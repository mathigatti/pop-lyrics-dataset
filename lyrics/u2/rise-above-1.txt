And you said rise above
Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
I can't
I can't


How long will it take
Before these feelings go away?
How much longer do I wait
And are there any real answers
Anyway?

Your silence in a crowded room
Louder than the loudest tune
I hang on every word

And you said rise above
Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
I can't
I can't

I miss you and everything
I was too fast traveling
To take you in, I know
But silence is no crime
Just wish could hear you fill it up one more time
Yeah, I know what you'd say to me
Exactly what you'd say to me
I still hang on every word

And you said rise above
Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
Yourself

In a time of treason
Is there time for trust
When there's no them, only us
Is there time for reason
Has your heart had enough?
Is there time to let go
And rise above

And you said rise above
Open your eyes to love
And you said rise above
Yourself
