We've qualified for the World Cup 
Go and compete 

We're prepared, a new goal 
We'll do our best 
We'll Put 'em Under Pressure, defense, defense 

The game is about 
Being effective
Being aggressive
Winning the ball 
Getting it on with the play 
We'll Put 'em Under Pressure

We're all part of jackie's army 
We're all off to win the league 
And we really shake them up 
When we win the World Cup 
Cause Ireland's are the greatest football team 

Put 'em Under Pressure 

It's not going to be easy for us 
But it's not going to be easy for them either 
Watch, watch, watch the people 
Watch the people, watch the people, watch the people, defense, defense 
We inflict our game on the people 
Put 'em Under Pressure, defense, defense, defense, defense 

You gotta give, you gotta give, you gotta give to win
Goal!
