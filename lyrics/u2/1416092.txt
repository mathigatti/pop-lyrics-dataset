The future needs a big kiss
Winds blow with a twist
Never seen a moon like this
Can you see it too?


Night's falling everywhere
Rockets at the fun fair
Satan loves a bomb scare
But he won't scare you

Hey, sexy boots
Get on your boots, yeah

You free me from the dark dream
Candy floss ice cream
All our kids are screaming
But the ghosts aren't real

Here's where we gotta be
Love and community
Laughter is eternity
If joy is real

You don't know how beautiful
You don't know how beautiful you are
You don't know, and you don't get it, do you?
You don't know how beautiful you are

That's someone's stuff they're blowing up
We're into growing up
Women of the future
Hold the big revelations

I got a submarine
You got gasoline
I don't want to talk about wars between nations

Not right now

Hey sexy boots...
Get on your boots, yeah
Not right now
Bossy boots

You don't know how beautiful
You don't know how beautiful you are
You don't know, and you don't get it, do you?
You don't know how beautiful you are

Sexy boots
I don't want to talk about the wars between the nations
Sexy boots, yeah

Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound, sound
Let me in the sound, sound
Let me in the sound

Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound, now
God, I'm going down
I don't wanna drown now
Meet me in the sound

Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound, sound
Let me in the sound, sound
Meet me in the sound

Get on your boots
Get on your boots
Get on your boots
