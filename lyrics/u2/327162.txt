The tomtoms
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tick of the eye of the clock
You're standing up against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops
When the sun shines through
So a voice within me
Keeps revealing you
You


Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, baby, where you are
I think of you
Night and day

Day and night
Why is it so ?
That this longing for you follows
Wherever I go
In the roaring traffic gloom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day

Night and day
Under the hide of me
Though such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
This torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life 
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day

Night and day
Under the hide of me
Oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning, burning inside of me
This torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life 
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day

Night and day
Night and day
Night and day
Night, night, night and day
Night, night, night and day
Night and day
Night, 
Night and day

All I want to do
Is make love to you
I'll miss you baby sing it
