Satellite's gone
Up to the sky
Things like that drive me
Out of my mind
I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV


Satellite of love
Satellite of love

Satellite's gone
Way up to mars
Soon it will be filled
With parking cars
I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV

Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite

I've been told that you've been bold
Com Harry, Mark and John
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday
Com Harry, Mark and John

Satellite's gone
Up to the sky
Things like that drive me
Out of my mind
I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV

Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
