It takes a seconds to say goodbye,
Say goodbye.
It takes a seconds to say goodbye,
Say goodbay,say bye bye
Where are you going to now?


Lightning flashes across the sky,
From east to wast you do or die.
Like a thief in the night,
You see the world by candlelight.

Fall,rise and...Fall rise and...
In an apartment on Times Square,
You can assemble them anywhere.
Held ro ransom,hell to play,
A revolution every day.
U.S.S.R., D.D.R..
London,New York,Peking.
It's the puppets,It's the puppets who pull the
strings.

Say goodbye,Say goodbye,
Say goodbye,Say goodbye.
It takes a seconds to say goodbye,
Push the button and pull the plug,say goodbye.

Fall,rise and...Fall,rise and...
They're doing the atomic bomb,
Do they know where the dance comes from?
Yes they're doing the atomic bomb,
They wnat you to sing along.
Say goodbye,say goodbye.
