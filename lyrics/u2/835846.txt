The shackles are undone
The bullets quit the gun
The heat that's in the sun
Will keep us when there's none


The rule has been disproved
The stone it has been moved
The grave is now a groove
All debts are removed, ooh

Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
What it's done to me?

Love makes strange enemies
Makes love where love may please
Soul and its striptease
Hate brought to its knees

The sky over our head
We can reach it from our bed
You let me in your heart
And out of my head... head...

Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
What it's done to me?

Oh oh oh oh, ohh
Oh oh oh oh, ohh
Please don't ever let me out of you

I've got no shame
Oh no, oh no

Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
What it's doing to me?

Oh can't you see what love has done?
I know I hurt you and I made you cry
Oh can't you see what love has done?
Did everything but murder you and I
Oh can't you see what love has done?
But love left a window in the skies
What it's doing to me?
And to love I rhapsodise

Oh can't you see what love has done?
To every broken heart
Oh can't you see what love has done?
For every heart that cries
Oh can't you see what love has done?
Love left a window in the skies
What it's doing to me?
And to love I rhapsodise

Oh can't you see?
