The world is spinning fast tonight
You can hurt yourself tryin to hold on
To what you used to be
I’m so glad the past is all gone?
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?


Volcano, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know.
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know

Your eyes were like landing lights
They used to be the clearest blue
Now you don’t see so well
The future’s gonna land on you

Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?

Volcano, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know.
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
You’re on a piece of ground above a volcano

You were alone,
Now you’re not alone
You were alone
But now
You are rock n roll
You and I are rock n roll
You are rock n roll
You and I are rock n roll

Volcano, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know.
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
You’re on a piece of ground above a volcano
