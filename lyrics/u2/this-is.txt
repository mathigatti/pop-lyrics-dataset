These are the hands of a tired man
This is the old man's shroud
These are the eyes of the blood crazed tiger
Staring at the maddening crowd


This is the face of a teenage mother
This is the child she bears
This is the soul of her broken lover
Searching for the smiles she shared

These are the feet of the punished pilgrim
And in his book of punished love
Tou see his eyes
You see no surprise
Waiting for a lie that's true

Everybody hits you with this feeling
Nobody seems to understand
You stop, you look
You're searching for the meaning
Wasting your life away

These are the dreams of a sleeping father
And in his long lost days
He sees a child
He sees his eyes
Waiting for the price he's paid

These are the tears of a fallen idol
And in his smile of shattered love
You see his eyes
You see no surprise
You just see lights then realise

Here with you
No one here but you
No one moves but you
Nobody touches like you

You
Nobody moves like you
But everybody hits you
Everybody knocks you down

These are the feet of a punished pilgrim
And to the book he prays
You see his eyes
You see no surprise
You just see lights then you realise
