It's in your voice 
I can feel it I can tell 
It's in your voice 
Has me ringing me like a bell 
Peace of mind 
Peace comes dropping slow 
I'm in the mind to let go of control 
Spirit come on down 
No I'm not coming down 


In the backstreets 
In the backstreets of our love 
Through the locked doors 
Deep down deep down is not enough 
Spirit come on down no I'm not coming down 

Who can stop us now 
It's much too late 
Can't slow us down 
We can't hesitate 
I want a love that's hard 
As hard as hate 
Levitate 

To be the bee 
To be the bee and the flower 
Before the sweetness 
Before the sweetness turns to sour 
When freedom comes 
Freedom has a scent 
It's like the top of a new born baby's head 
Baby we can taste it 
You and I 

Spirit come on down 
No I'm not coming down 

Who can stop us now 
Who could make us wait 
Who could slow us down 
Make us hesitate 
I want a love that's hard 
As hard as hate 
Levitate 

Lift me up 

Spirit come on down 
No I'm not coming down 
Spirit come on down 
No I'm not coming down
