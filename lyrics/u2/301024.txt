Late at night 
When the motion beats down 
I feel so low, oh no 


I lived a lie 
For a thousand years 
We start to cower, oh no 

I said oh no, baby don't 
What you got to do it for 
Can't go on 

She says oh no, baby don't 
Let me take me out here 
Thank you man 

You can think you're so high 
When the moon is way down low 
Take your time feel fine 
Those ladies are so darn high 
Oh no no no 

You gamble inside out 
Forever inside out
