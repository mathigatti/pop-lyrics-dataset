I know a girl, a girl called Party
Party girl
I know she wants more than a party
Party girl
And she won't tell me her name


I know a boy, a boy called Trash
Trash Can
I know he does all that he can
Wham Bam
And he won't tell me his name

I have a heart, a heart that's beating inside
When I was three I thought the world revolved around me
I was wrong
And so I sing along
And if you dance, then dance with me

I know a girl, a girl called Party
Party girl
I know she wants more than a party
Party girl
I know a boy, a boy called Trampoline
You know what I mean

I think you know what he wants
I think he knows what he wants
I think he knows what he wants
