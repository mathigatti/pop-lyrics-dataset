When you look so good
The pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good
Baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours
And every door smells of fresh paint
When the girl involved
Says its friction that makes you a saint
When we've seen enough
To know it's children that teach
When you're free enough
To wake up on a bed on a beach


You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened to boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kinda trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

Why... why am I walking away
Why am I walking away

I'll be crying out
How bad can a good boy be?
Shooting off my mouth
That's another great thing about me

I got everything, but I feel like nothing at all
There's no risky thing for a man
Who's determined to fall

You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kinda trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
Save me from myself

The best thing
The best thing
