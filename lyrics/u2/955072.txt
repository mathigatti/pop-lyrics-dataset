A young boy named Billy Joe, restless on the farm 
A boy filled with wanderlust, who never really meant no harm 
He changed his clothes and he shined his boots 
And he combed his dark hair down 


But his mama cried as he walked out: 
'Don't take your guns to town 
Don't take your guns to town 
Don't take your guns... to town' 

He laughed and kissed his mom and said 'Your Billy Joe he's the man 
I can shoot as quick, I can shoot as straight, as anybody, can 
But I wouldn't shoot, without a cause, or gun nobody down' 

But she cried again as he rode away: 
'Don't take your guns to town 
Son, leave your guns at home 
Don't take your guns to town' 

Well he drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hands 
And he tried, he tried to tell himself at last he had become a man 
But a dusty cowpoke stood at his side, began to laugh him down 

And he heard again his mother's words: 
'Don't take your guns to town 
Son, leave your guns at home 
Don't take your guns...' 

Don't take your guns.... 
Don't take your guns to town 
Don't take your guns.... 
Don't take your guns to town 

Filled with rage then Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw 
But the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw 
As Billy Joe fell to the floor the crowd all gathered around 

And wondered at his final words: 
'Don't take your guns to town 
Son, leave your guns at home 
Don't take your guns to town'
