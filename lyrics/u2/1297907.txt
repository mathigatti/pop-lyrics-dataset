Next to it 
I was so close to it 
I had the universe decoded 
And the atom split 


I hear you say 
My oh my 
You know I got no tears to cry 
And I got no love left in me now 
Just salt in my eye 

All because of you 
All because of you 
All because of you 
And time time 

Poor man's loud 
But the sun is shining up above the cloud 
It's not the noise it's the deafening silence 
Drowns God out 

You say I shout government 
But I kicked over to my party friends 
You're like the river flowing underground 
I can feel you when you're not around 

All because of you 
All because of you 
All because of you 
And time time 

You said, to all mine 
Shut your tiny heart 
To humble me 
Humble humble yeah 

I'm alive I'm being born 
I just arrived I'm at the door 
Of the place I started out from 
I want back inside 

All because of you 
All because of you 
All because of you
