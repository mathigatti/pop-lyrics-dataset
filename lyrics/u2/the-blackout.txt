A dinosaur wonders why he still walks the Earth, yeah
A meteor promises its not gonna hurt, yeah
Earthquake always happen when you're in bed, Fred
The house shakes, maybe it was something I said, Ned


Go easy on me, easy on me, brother
Go easy on me, easy on me, brother

When the lights go out
Throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out
Don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be

Statues fall and democracy is flat on it's back, Jack
We had it all, and what we had is not coming back, Zac
A big mouth says the people they don't wanna be free for free
The Blackout â€” is this an extinction event we see?

Go easy on me, easy on me, brother
Go easy on me, easy on me now

When the lights go out
And you throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out
Don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be

When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out

Blackout
It's clear
Who you are will appear
Blackout
No fear
So glad that we are all still here, here

The lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out

When the lights go out
And you throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out
Don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be

When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
The lights go out
The lights go out
