Loving the small time
Save our lives
Can't revive
Your magic place is nearing hell
Set it straight
Can't relate
I hope your friends treat you well
All the waiting
Killing fading
And i'm falling
I'm falling
All the waiting
Killing fading
And i'm falling
I'm falling
You saved our lives
And took our dives
You waited for the time to sell
All the waiting
Killing fading
And i'm falling
I'm falling
All the waiting
Killing fading
And i'm falling
I'm falling
Save our lives
Can't revive
Your magic place is nearing hell
Set it straight
Can't relate
I hope your friends treat you well
All the waiting
