Who can take your trash out
Stomp it down for you
Shake the plastic bag and do the twisty-thingy-doo


The garbage man
Oh, the garbage man can
The garbage man can
And he does it with a smile and never judges you.

Who can take this diaper
Ma'am, I don't mind at all
Who can clean me up before the big policeman's ball

The garbage man
Yes, the garbage man can

The sanitation folks are jolly friendly folks
Courteous and easy-going
They mop up when you're over-flowing
And tell you when you arse is showing

Who can
Who can
Who can
The garbage man can
Cause he's the homer simpson man
He cleans the town for you
