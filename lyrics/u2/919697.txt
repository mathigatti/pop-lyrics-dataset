Nothing worth taking so I never really took
Nothing was shaking but baby you really shook
No one was waking until you kept me up
If your heart was breaking you know I won't see you stuck


The pain never felt so good
To feel so bad

I love you
I love you like mad
I love you
I love you like mad

No one worth knowing has ever known a thing
No one who knew how could ever teach the world to sing
You are the only one I've ever listened to
So don't wait for me to ask, tell me what to do

The pain never felt so good
To feel so bad

I love you
I love you like mad
Love you
I love you like mad
Love
Love you like mad

Don't worry baby if you're in the spotlight
I'll do the maximum time for you tonight
You know that we're not crazy
Well maybe just a touch
Some sweet delight usher the rush
And some gets us close too much

I love you
I love you like mad
Love you
I love you like mad
Love you
Love you like mad
Love you
Love you like mad

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey
Love you, love you like mad
Love you, love you like mad
Love you, love you like mad
Love you, love you like mad
Love you, love you like mad
