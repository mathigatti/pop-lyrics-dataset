Stranger, stranger in a strange land.
He looked at me like I was the one who should run.


We asked him to smile for a photograph
Waited a while to see if we could make him laugh.

The soldier asked for a cigarette
His smiling face I can't forget.
He looked at me across the street
But that's a long way here.

Oh, and I wish you were here.
Oh, and I wish you were here.

Stranger, stranger in a strange land.
He looked at me like I was the one who should run.

I watched as he watched us get back on the bus
I watched the way it was
The way it was when he was with us
And I really don't mind sleeping on the floor
But I couldn't sleep after what I saw
I wrote this letter to tell you the way I feel.

Oh I wish you were here
Oh I wish you were here
To see what I could see
To hear
And I wish you were here.
