From the brightest star 
Comes the blackest hole 
You had so much to offer 
Why did you offer your soul? 
I was there for you baby 
When you needed my help 
Would you deny for others 
What you demand for yourself? 


Cool down mama, cool off 
Cool down mama, cool off 

You speak of signs and wonders 
I need something other 
I would believe if I was able 
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table 

You were pretty as a picture 
It was all there to see 
Then your face caught up with your psychology 
With a mouth full of teeth 
You ate all your friends 
And you broke every heart thinking every heart mends 

You speak of signs and wonders 
But I need something other 
I would believe if I was able 
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table 

Where you live should not decide 
Whether you live or whether you die 
Three to a bed 
Sister Ann, she said 
Dignity passes by 

And you speak of signs and wonders 
But I need something other 
I would believe if I was able 
I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table
