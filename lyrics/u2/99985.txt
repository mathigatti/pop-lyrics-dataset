Uno, dos, tres, catorce!

(Turn it up loud, captain)

Lights go down, it's dark
The jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart
A feeling is so much stronger than
A thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul
It can't be bought
Your mind can wander


Hello, hello (¡hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde estás?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something
I can feel, feel

The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys
Play rock and roll
They know they can't dance
At least they know

I can't stand the beats
I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails
Has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music (oh oh oh oh)
Swinging to the music (oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Hello, hello (¡hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde estás?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
But you give me something
I can feel, feel

Check mated
Just for
Show meaning

All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no one gets hurt

Hello, hello (¡hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde estás?)
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something

I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how
How to kneel, kneel

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah
