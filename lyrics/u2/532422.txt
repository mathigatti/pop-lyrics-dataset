It's Christmas
Baby, please come home



(Yeah!)


The snow's coming down
I'm watching it fall
Watching the people around
Baby please come home


The church bells in town
They're ringing a song
What a happy sound
Baby please come home


They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year


Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching 'em shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home


Baby please come home
Baby please come home


They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year


If there was a way
I'd hold back these tears
But it's Christmas day
Baby please come home
Ohh...


Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Ohh...
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
