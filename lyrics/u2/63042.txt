Sometimes I feel like I don't know
Sometimes I feel like checking out
I wanna get it wrong
Can't always be strong
And love, it won't be long


Oh, sugar, don't you cry
Oh, child, wipe the tears from your eye
You know I need you to be strong
And the day it as dark, as the night is long
Feel like trash, you make me feel clean
I'm in the black, can't see or be seen

Baby, baby, baby, light my way
Alright now, baby, baby, baby, light my way

You bury your treasure where it can't be found
But your love is like a secret that's been passed around
There is a silence that comes to our house
When no-one can sleep
I guess it's the price of love, I know it's not cheap

Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way
Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way
Baby, baby, baby, light my way

I remember when we could sleep on stones
Now we lie together in whispers and moans
When I was all messed up and I heard opera in my head
Your love was a light bulb hanging over my bed

Baby, baby, baby, light my way
(Oh, come on)
Baby, baby, baby, light my way

(Ultraviolet - ultraviolet)
(Ultraviolet - ultraviolet)
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, light my way
