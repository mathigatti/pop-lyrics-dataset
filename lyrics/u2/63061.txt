I'm ready, I'm ready for laughing gas
I'm ready, I'm ready for what's next.
I'm ready to duck, ready to dive
Ready to say I'm glad to be alive
I'm ready, I'm ready for the push.


In the cool of the night, in the warmth of the breeze
I'll be crawling around on my hands and knees.
She's just down the line, Zoo Station.
Got to make it on time, Zoo Station.

I'm ready, I'm ready for the gridlock
I'm ready to take it to the street.
Ready for the shuffle, ready for the deal
Ready to let go of the steering wheel.
I'm ready, ready for the crush.

Zoo Station.

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby,
It's alright, it's alright.

Time is a train makes the future the past
Leaves you standing in the station
Your face pressed up against the glass.

I'm just down the line from your love...Zoo Station
I'm under the sign of your love... Zoo Station
I'm gonna be there... Zoo Station
Tracing the line... Zoo Station
I'm gonna make it on time, make it on time ... Zoo Station

Just two stops down the line... Zoo Station
Just a stop down the line... Zoo Station
