There are colors on the street
Oh, red, white, and blue
People shufflin' their feet
People sleepin' in their shoes
[You got endure]
A warnin' sign in the road ahead
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
I don't feel like satan, but I am to them
So I try to forgive 'em any way I can


Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

There's a girl in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Oh, next to a garbage can
Oh, now she put her kid away, she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life, and what she's done with it
That's one more kid that'll never be cool
Never get to fall in love, never get to be him

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

Sadness in the culture, man
You know, you, don't you want to say
Got to feelin' like I'm, like I'm,
Like I'm on my way
Girls, I want you to all say what to feel
Got the manacle, man, of voice and steel
Got the flaxen locks
He got the eyes of clocks
I wish him stay up on the boat until he kill the jocks
I got the super soul
He got the man of steel
He got the higher with the feeling in the meanest feel
Keep on rockin' in the free world

(Stay/keep on)

It would be difficult to work harder than that man
Keepin' us in a free world, that's all I'm gonna say

There's a thousand points of light
For the african man
There's a kinder, gentler,
Coming-to-help-you hand
There's department stores and toilet paper
Styrofoam garbage for the ozone layer
There's a fan of the people, he's standin' on their side
He's got fuel to burn, he's got roads to drive

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

A song that needs to understand
I'm here to see pearl jam
They're givin' people 'lieving again
I never say never again
They're makin' me believer again
They rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
-N-roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll

Thank you
Thank you, sir
Love ya
