(Ooo, Ooo, yeah)
(Come on) 


Look over yonder, Apollo at a distance 
You can hear his music if you listen to the wind (blow) 
I want to be there - I want to be right there 
I want to see it with my own eyes 

Bear witness, I'm wailing like the wind 
Come bear witness, the half-breed rides again 
In these hands, I've held the broken dream 
In my soul, I'm howling at the moon 

Testimony / Whoa-ah 
Testimony / Whoa-ah 
Declare yourself, I will testify 
Testimony / Whoa-ah 
Testimony / Whoa-ah 
State the truth, I will testify 

I had a revelation like runaway horses 
Took to the road with a carnival show (roll on) 
Those golden days on Smokey Mountain (lord) 
Playing guitar in a one man band (that's right) 

Bear witness, I'm howling at the moon 
Come bear witness, I've danced among the ruins 
In these shoes, I've walked a crooked mile 
All my life I been searching for the nightbird 

Testimony, testimony 
Declare yourself - I will testify 
Testimony / Ah-ha 
Testimony / Whoa-ah 
Speak the truth, I will testify 

Are you ready to take the heat 
Are you ready to blow the steam 
Are you ready to bag the street 
You got nothing to lose - but your chains 

For forty days and forty nights 
I come across the desert 
Apollo right by my side (rave on) 

Bear witness, I'm wailing like the wind 
Come bear witness, the half-breed rides again 
In these hands, I've held the broken dream 
In my soul, I'm howling at the moon 

Testimony, testimony (tell them) 
Declare yourself - I will testify 
Testimony (oh oh), testimony 
Speak the truth, I will testify 

(This is my) 
(Testimony, testimony) / Mmm this is my testimony 
(I will testify) 

Testimony ah ha 
Testimony whoa ha 
Speak the truth 
I will testify 

Testimony, testimony oh-ha 
Declare yourself - I will testify 
Testimony / (Oh oh) 
Testimony 
Speak the truth, I will testify
