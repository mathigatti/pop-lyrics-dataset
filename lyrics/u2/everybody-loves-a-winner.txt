Once I had fame
I was full of pride
Well, there were a lot of friends
Always by my side


But my luck ran dry
Now my friends begin to hide

Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
When you lose, you lose alone

Everywhere I turned
There was a hello and a smile
I never thought they'd be gone
After a while

Oh, that big road ran down
And the smiles turned to frowns

Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone

Hands to heaven that I would be true
To get back that love
There's nothing I wouldn't do
But I learned and I lost
And now I paid the cost

Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone
