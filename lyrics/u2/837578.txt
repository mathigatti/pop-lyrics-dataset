Hard to tell or recognise a sign
To see me through, a warning sign


First the thunder
Satisfied
If the past, it will not lie
Then the storm, torn assunder
The future you and i get blown away
In the storm

In a lifetime
In a lifetime

And as the rain it falls, begin again
As the storm breaks through
Heavy in my heart
Believe the light in you
So the light shines in you
Without colour, faded and worn
Torn assunder in the storm

Unless the sound has faded from your soul
Unless it dissapears
First the thunder
Selfish storm
Then the storm
Hold on the inside
Torn assunder
One life
In the storm

In a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
