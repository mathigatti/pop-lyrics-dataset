There's a place I go
And I am far away
There's a T.V. show
And I can grow


Sometimes the hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Hello, hello.

There's a picture book
With colored photographs
There's a comic strip
That makes me laugh

Sometimes the lady takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Hello, hello.

There's a place I go
And it's a part of me
There's a radio
And I will crawl

Sometimes the hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Hello, hello.
