Wow... After I jumped, it ocurred to me.
Life is perfect.
Life is the best, full of magic, beauty,
opportunity, and television.
And surprises... Lot's of surprises, yeah.
And then there's the best stuff, of course.
Better than anything anyone ever made up, 'cause it's real...


You take a stranger by the hand
A man who doesn't understand
His wildest dreams
You walk across the dirty sand
And offer him an ocean
Of what he's never seen

Maybe I was blind
Or I might have closed my eyes
Maybe I was dumb
But what I forgot to say
If you didn't know isâ€¦
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go

You run from love
And don't believe
Unless it catches you by the heel
And even then you struggle
From Red Island across the strand
Your footprints still in the sand
Everything else is washed away

I may not be alone
Or I may have found my home
I may have lost my way
But what I forgot to say
If you didn't know
Is never let me go
Never let me go
