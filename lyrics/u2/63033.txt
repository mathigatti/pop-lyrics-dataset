Won't you come back tomorrow
Won't you come back tomorrow
Won't you come back tomorrow
Can I sleep tonight?


Outside, somebody's outside
Somebody's knocking at the door
There's a black car parked at the side of the road
Don't go to the door
Don't go to the door

I'm going out
I'm going outside mother
I'm going out there

Won't you be back tomorrow
Won't you be back tomorrow
Will you be back tomorrow?
La la la la

Who broke the window
Who broke down the door?
Who tore the curtain
And who was it for?
Who heals the wounds
Who heals the scars?
Open the door, open the door

Won't you come back tomorrow?
Won't you be back tomorrow?
Will you be back tomorrow?
Can I sleep tonight?

'Cause I want you
I, I want you
I really want you
I, I want, I, I
Want you to be back tomorrow
I want you to be back tomorrow
Will you be back tomorrow?
La la la la

I want you to be back tomorrow
I want you to be back tomorrow
Will you be back tomorrow?
Open up, open up, to the Lamb Of God
To the love of He
Who made the blind to see

He's coming back
He's coming back
Oh, believe Him

I'm going to be back, mother
I'm going to be back, mother
