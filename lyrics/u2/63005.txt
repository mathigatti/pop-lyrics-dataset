Baby, please, baby please don't go
I got flies to feed, they want skin and seed
And don't make me crawl


Please
Baby don't bite your lip
Give you half what I got
If you untie the knot
It's a promise

Salomé, Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Salomé

Baby please
Baby what's that tune?
Well I heard it before
When I crawled from your door
And my blood turned blue

Please
Baby please slow down
Baby I feel sick
Don't make me stick to a promise

Salomé, Salomé
Salomé, Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Salomé
Salomé, shake it, shake it, shake it, Salomé
Salomé, shake it, shake it, shake it, Salomé

Baby please, baby don't say no
Won't you dance for me, under the cherry tree?
Won't you swing down low?

Please
Baby please say yes
Baby don't go away
You're spilling me
And your precious love

Salomé, Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Salomé
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Salomé
Salomé, shake it, shake it, shake it, Salomé
Salomé, shake it, shake it, shake it, Salomé
Salomé, shake it, shake it, shake it, Salomé
