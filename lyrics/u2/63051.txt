And love is not the easy thing
Is the only baggage that you can bring
Love is not the easy thing
The only baggage you can bring
Is all that you can't leave behind


And if the darkness is to keep us apart
And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off
And if your glass heart should crack
And for a second you turn back
Oh, no, be strong

Walk on! Walk on!
What you got, they can't steal it
No, they can't even feel it
Walk on! Walk on!
Stay safe tonight

You're packing a suitcase for a place
None of us has been
A place that has to be believed to be seen
You could have flown away
A singing bird in an open cage
Who will only fly, only fly for freedom

Walk on! Walk on!
What you got, they can't deny it
Can't sell it, or buy it
Walk on! Walk on!
You stay safe tonight

And I know it aches
How your heart it breaks
You can only take so much
Walk on! Walk on!

Home!
Hard to know what it is
If you never had one
Home!
I can't say where it is
But I know I'm going
Home!
That's where the hurt is

And I know it aches
And your heart, it breaks
And you can only take so much
Walk on!
You've got to leave it behind:

All that you fashion
All that you make
All that you build
All that you break
All that you measure
All that you feel
All this you can leave behind
All that you reason, it's only time

And I'll never fill up all I find
All that you sense
All that you scheme
All you dress-up
All that you've seen
All you create
All that you wreck
All that you hate
