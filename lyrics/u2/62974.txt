High, higher than the sun
You shoot me from a gun
I need you to elevate me here
At the corner of your lips
As the orbit of your hips
Eclipse, you elevate my soul


I've got no self-control
Been living like a mole
Now going down, excavation
Higher now, in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

A star lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you could educate my mind
Explain all these controls
I Can't sing but I've got soul
The goal is elevation

A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul
Now going down, excavation
Higher now in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

Love, lift me out of these blues
Won't you tell me something true
I believe in you

A mole, living in a hole
Digging up my soul now
Going down, excavation
Higher now in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation...
