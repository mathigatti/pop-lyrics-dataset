Baby's crying cause it's born to sing
Singers cry about everything
Still in the playground falling off a swing
But you know that I know


Walk through the room like a birthday cake
When I am all lit up I can't make a mistake
And there's a level of shallow that you just can't fake
But you know that I know

Oh you don't care
But you know I'm there

You think you look so good
A little more better
Look so good
Just a little more little more
Look so good
That's what's gonna get you
Look so good
Just a little more little more

You know you're chasing the sunlight
That's why I'm stayin' up all night
You think you look so good
A little more better
Look so good
A little more

It is what it is but it's not what it seems
This screwed up stuff is the stuff of dreams
I got just enough low self esteem
To get me where I want to go

The showman gives you front row to his heart
The showman prays his heartache will chart
Making a spectacle of falling apart
Is just the start of the show

Oh you don't care
But you know I'm there

You think you look so good
A little more better
Look so good
Just a little more little more
Look so good

That's what's gonna get you
Look so good
Little more, little more

I'll be chasing the sunlight
That's why I'm staying up all night
I lie for a living, I love to let on
But you make it true when you sing along

You think you look so good
A little more better
Look so good
Just a little more little more
Look so good
That's what's gonna get you
Look so good
Just a little more, little more

You think you look so good
A little more better
Look so good
Just a little more little more
Look so good
That's what's gonna get you
Look so good
Just a little more, little more
