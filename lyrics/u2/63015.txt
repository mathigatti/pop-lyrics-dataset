Summer stretching on the grass
Summer dresses pass
In the shade of a willow tree
Creeps a-crawling over me
Over me and over you
Stuck together with God's glue
It's gonna get stickier too
It's been a long hot summer
Let's get under cover
Don't try too hard to think
Don't think at all


I'm not the only one
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find
If you took a look inside

Not just deaf and dumb
I'm staring at the sun
Not the only one
Who's happy to go blind

There's an insect in your ear
If you scratch it won't disappear
It's gonna itch and burn and sting
Do you wanna see what the scratching brings?
Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach
Will we ever live in peace?

'Cause those that can't do
Often have to
And those that can't do
Often have to preach

To the ones
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'll find
If you took a look inside

Not just deaf and dumb
Staring at the sun
I'm not the only one
Who'd rather go blind

Intransigence in all around
Military's still in town
Armour plated suits and ties
Daddy just won't say goodbye
Referee won't blow the whistle
God is good but will he listen?
I'm nearly great but there's something missing
I left it in the duty free
Though you never really belonged to me

You're not the only one
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find
If you stepped back inside

I'm not sucking my thumb
Staring at the sun
Not the only one
Who's happy to go blind
