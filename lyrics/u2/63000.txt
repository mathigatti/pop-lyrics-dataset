Earth, sky, scenery
Is she coming back again?
Men of straw, snooker hall
Words that build or destroy
Dirt dry, bone, sand and stone
Barbed wire fence cut me down
I'd like to be around in a spiral staircase
To the higher ground


And I, like a firework, explode
Roman candle, lightning, lights up the sky
In cracked streets, trample underfoot
Side-step, sidewalk
I see you stare into space
Have I got closer now, behind the face?

Oh, tell me, Cherry you dance with me
Turn me around tonight
Up through the spiral staircase to the higher ground.
Slide show, seaside town
Coca-cola, football
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
