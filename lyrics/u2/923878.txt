Oh joy, love you bring
Oh joy, make my heart sing


And I drove across the desert
I was in my four wheel drive
I was looking for the Buddha
Then I saw Jesus Christ
He smiled and shrugged his shoulders 
And he lit a cigarette
Said jump for joy, make some noise
Remember what I said

My soul is a like a ruby 
And I threw it in the earth
But now my hands are bleeding 
From scrabbling in the dirt
And I look up to the heavens 
And a light is on my face
I never never never thought 
I'd find a state of grace

Hey joy, love you bring
Oh joy, make my heart sing
Oh joy, joy in everything
Joy joy joy oh joy
Joy joy joy oh joy

I was drowning in the darkness 
As I drove down to the sea
Joy joy joy oh joy
And I looked up to the mountain 
And the light burst over me
Joy joy joy oh oh joy
You make me sing

Oh joy, the love you bring
Oh joy, you make me sing
Oh joy, in everything
Joy joy joy oh joy
In everything
In everything

Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy

You make me sing
The love you bring
In everything
