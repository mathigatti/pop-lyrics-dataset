When I come home baby
And I've been working all night long
I put my daughter on my knee
And she say "Daddy, what's wrong?"
She whisper in my ear so sweet
You know what she says?


She say: daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why

You know I got a woman
And she live in a poor part of town
And I go see her sometimes
And we make love so fine
I put my head on her shoulder
She says, "Tell me all your troubles"
You know what she says?

She say: daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why

She say:  daddy you're a fool to cry
Oooo daddy you're a fool to cry
Oooo daddy you're a fool to cry
Oooo daddy you're a fool to cry

Even my friends say to me sometimes
And make out like I don't understand them
You know what they say?
They say Oo daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why

I'm a fool baby
I'm a fool baby
I'm a certified fool now

I want to tell ya
Gotta tell ya baby
I'm a fool baby
Certified fool for ya, mama, come on
I'm a fool, I'm a fool
