My heart is longing for you, love 
I cared for you more then you knew 
Though you have broken each promise 
And yesterday's dreams are untrue 


Alone, I'll be yearning tomorrow 
When sunshine brings memories of you 
My sunshine will turn into sorrow 
As I dream of the love we once knew 

Why should I always be lonesome 
When sunny and blue are the skies 
While shadows and loneliness linger 
I'm dreaming with tears in my eyes 

Why did you promise me sweetheart 
Never to leave me alone 
Yesterday's sunshine is faded 
Your love wasn't true like my own 

Alone, I'll be yearning tomorrow 
When sunshine brings memories of you 
My sunshine will turn into sorrow 
As I dream of the love we once knew 

Why should I always be lonesome 
When sunny and blue are the skies 
While shadows of loneliness linger 
I'm dreaming with tears in my eyes
