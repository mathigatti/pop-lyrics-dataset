There's a boy i know
He's the one i dream of
Looked into my eyes
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
(clouds above clouds above.....)
Take me to the clouds above
(clouds above clouds above.....)


Take me to.. take me to.. take me to..
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to.. take me to.. take me to..
Take me to the clouds above
(clouds above clouds above.....)
