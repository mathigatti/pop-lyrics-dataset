Well it's so hard to listen to these trains 
Outside my window here it comes again 
And it's calling me begging me 
Follow me down the track 
And it moans so dark and low 
Baby ain't comin' back 


Well I refuse to believe 
It could happen to me and you 
But it's lonesome and it's hard and it's true 

I got this whiskey to take care of my lips 
I got these long cool steel strings 
At my fingertips 
I ain't got nothing, I ain't got nothing 
To soothe my aching soul 
Except this screeching and screaming iron 
To tell me where I ought to go 

Well I refuse to believe 
It could happen to me and you 
But it's lonesome and it's hard... and it's true 

And I hear the train sigh 
And idle down below 
Why your love is so sweet and wild 
Is something I'll never know 

And it sounds like crying 
And it sounds like letting go 
Oh, breathing and lying 
Sinking and dying slow 
And I watch from my window 
Touching the cold glass sky 
And as the train rolls down the track 
I say... 
Goodbye 

Home, home 
You wanna take me home? 
Home, home 
'Cause I wanna go, I wanna 
Wanna, wanna, wanna go home 
Home, home, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-home 
I wanna go, I wanna love 
Take, take, take, take, take me home 
Home, no no no no no no no love 
Hey, hey 

Please... 
(Take me home) 
Home, home 
No no no no no no no love 
No no no, no no no, no no no love 
(Home) 

Ha hah home, home 
Home two three four
