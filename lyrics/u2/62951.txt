Like a desert needs rain
Like a town needs a name
I need your love


Like a drifter needs a room
Hawkmoon
I need your love
I need your love

Like a rhythm unbroken
Like drums in the night
Like sweet soul music
Like sunlight
I need your love

Like coming home
And you don't know where you've been
Like black coffee
Like nicotine
I need your love
I need your love

When the night has no end
And the day yet to begin
As the room spins around
I need your love
I need your love

Like a Phoenix rising needs a holy tree
Like the sweet revenge
Of a bitter enemy
I need your love

Like heat needs the Sun
Like honey on her tongue
Like the muzzle of a gun
Like oxygen
I need your love
I need your love

When the night has no end
And the day yet to begin
As the room spins around
I need your love
I need your love

Like thunder needs rain
Like a preacher needs pain
Like tongues of flame
Like a sweet stain
Need your love
I need your love

Like a needle needs a vein
Like someone to blame
Like a thought unchained
Like a runaway train
Need your love
I need your love
Need your love
I need your love

Like faith needs a doubt
Like a freeway out
Need your love

Like powder needs a spark
Like lies need the dark
I need your love
