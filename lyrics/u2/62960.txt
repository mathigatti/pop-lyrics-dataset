Tonight, the moon is playing tricks again
I'm feeling seasick again.
The whole world could just dissolve
Into a glass of water.


I've been good, 'cause I know you don't want me to.
Do you really want me to be blue as you?
It's her daylight that gets me through.

We've been here before
Last time you scratched at my door
The moon was naked and cold
I was like a two-year-old
Who just wanted more.

If you wear that velvet dress.
If you wear that velvet dress.

Tonight, the moon's drawn its curtains
It's a private show
No-one else gonna know
I'm wanting.

Sunlight, sunlight fills my room
It's sharp and it's clear
But nothing at all like the moon.

It's okay
The struggle for things not to say
I never listened to you anyway
And I got my own hands to pray.

But if you wear that velvet dress.
If you wear that velvet dress.

Tonight the moon is a mirror-ball
Light flickers from across the hall
Who'll catch the star when it falls.

If you wear that velvet dress.
