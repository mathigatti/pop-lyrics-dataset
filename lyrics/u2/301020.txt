Merry Christmas. This is Bono the singer with U2. 
This is a poem I'd like to, recite for you by another Irishman, John F. Dean 
It's about driving to midnight mass in Dublin on Christmas Eve: 


Five-thousand million years ago, this earth lay heaving in a mass of rocks and fire 
Wasting, burdened with its emptiness 
Tonight, when arthropods and worms and sponges have given way to dinosaurs 
And dinosaurs to working, wandering apes 
Homo erectus have given way to sapiens, and he to 
Homo sapiens sapiens (alias Paddy Mack) 

Look down on Dublin from the hills around 
And lights could be a million Christmas trees
Still firs standing, while in the sky a glow as if of dawn 
This day a light shall shine on us 
The Lord is born within our city 

Look along to the river toward O'Connell Bridge 
The lights, the neon signs, all stream on water like breathed-on strips of tinsel 
All is still...

Eleven-thirty, pubs begin to empty 
Men stop to argue, sway and say the name of Jesus 
For those who have known darkness 
Who have now seen a wonderous light 
Those who have dwelt on unlit streets 
To them the light has come 

Tonight, few cars go by 
The blocks of flats with windowed-plastic trees 
And fairy lights stand, watching for a miracle 
Here are no dells where fairies might appear 

Out from the dark an ambulance comes speeding 
Sickly blue lights search in siren-still 
The mystery of the night ticks slowly on 
It will pass and leave memories of friends and small, half-welcomed things 

In Him was life 
In Him, life was the light of man 
For neither prehistoric swans nor trilobites, the mesozoic birds 
Neanderthal, nor modern man had ever dreamt or seen what was our God 

The shops are gay with lights and bright things 
All save funeral homes, they dare not advertise their presence 
As midnight peels and organs start to play 
Two cars meet headlong in a haze of drink 
The crash flicks into silence 
Pain crawls like a slime through blood and into limbs 
God is revealed, a baby naked, crying in a crib 

In the church porches and out along the grounds 
Teenagers laugh and swear, smokin', watchin' girls 
So, once more, Christmas trails away 
Its meaning moves back into the mist and the march of time
