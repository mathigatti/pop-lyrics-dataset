Darkness falls and she
Will take me by the hand
Take me to some twilight land
Where all but love is gray
Where I can find my way
Without her as my guide


Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight falls, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn
And burn eternally
She's a mystery to me

She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

In the night of love
Words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear
A love so sharp it cut
Like a switchblade to my heart
Words tearing me apart

She tears again my bleeding heart
I want to run, she's pulling me apart
Fallen angel cries
Then I just melt away
She's a mystery girl

She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

Haunted by her side
It's a darkness in her eyes
That so enslaves me
And if my love is blind
Then I don't want to see
She's a mystery to me

Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn
And burn eternally
She's a mystery to me

She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

She's...a mystery girl
Mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's...a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
