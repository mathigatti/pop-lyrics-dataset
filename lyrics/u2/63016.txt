I've got no home in this world
Just gravity 
Luck and time
I've got no home in this world
Just you and you're not mine
Stateless
Weightless


There are no colours in your eyes
There's no sunshine in your skies
There's no race only the prize
There is no tomorrow only tonight
Stateless, what's the difference?
You can cover the world with your thumb
But it's still so big, so bright, so beautiful
Stateless
Weightless

(scat)

Pushing down on me
Feel your weight
Want to feel your weight
Pushing down on me
