Oh I talk to you, you walk away.
You're still on the down beat
You say you don't want my help.
But you can't escape if you're running from yourself.
I give you my love
I give you my love
Give you my love
Still you walk away.
Well


It's your own late show as you jump to the street below.
But where can you go to leave yourself behind?
Alone in the spotlight of this, your own tragedy.
I give you my love. 
Love.

I give you my love.
Give you my love.
I give you my love.
I give you my love.
I give you my love.
