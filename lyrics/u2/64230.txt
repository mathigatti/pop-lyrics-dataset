Happiness is a warm gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 


She's not a girl who misses much 
She's not a girl who misses much 

Mother Superior jump the gun 
Mother Superior jump the gun 
Mother Superior jump the gun 
Mother Superior jump the gun 

Happiness is a warm gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 

She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand 
Like a lizard on a window pane 
The man in the crowd 
With the multicoloured mirrors on his hobnail boots 
Lying with his eyes wide open 
And the hands busy working overtime 
A soap impression of his wife which he ate 
And donated to the National Trust 

Hey, I need a fix 'cause I'm going down 

Happiness is a, a warm gun 
Happiness is a, a warm gun 
Happiness is a, a warm gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 

Happiness is a warm gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 

I need a fix cause I'm going down 
I need a fix cause I'm going down 
I need a fix cause I'm going down 
To the bits that I left uptown 

I need a fix cause I'm going down, uptown 
Need a fix cause I'm going down, uptown 

Happiness is a, a warm gun 
Happiness is a, a warm gun 
Happiness is a, a warm gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 
(Repeat)
