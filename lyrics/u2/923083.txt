See reflections on the water
More than darkness in the depths
See him surface in every shadow
On the wind I feel his breath


Goldeneye
I've found his weakness
Goldeneye
He'll do what I please
Goldeneye
No time for sweetness
But a bitter kiss 
Will bring him to his knees

You'll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
You'll never know 
How it feels to be the one who's left behind
You'll never know
The days and nights
The tears, the tears I've cried
But now my time has come
And time, time is not on your side

See him move through smoke and mirrors
Feel his presence in the crowd
Other girls, they gather around him
If I had him I wouldn't let him out

Goldeneye
Not lace or leather
Golden chains take him to the spot
Goldeneye
I'll show him forever
It'll take forever to see what I've got

You'll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
You'll never know 
How it feels to get so close and be denied
It's a gold and honey trap
I've got for you tonight
Revenge is a kiss
This time I won't miss
Now I've got you in my site

With a goldeneye
Golden, goldeneye
With a goldeneye
Goldeneye
Goldeneye
Goldeneye
Goldeneye
