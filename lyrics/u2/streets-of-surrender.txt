Every man has two cities he needs to be
The one he can touch
And the one he can’t see
The one where a stranger’s a friend
Every man has got one city of liberty
For me it’s Paris, I love it
Every time I get lost down these ancient streets I find myself again


You’re free, baby, baby
Free now and forever
It’s Christmas time
You can decide to forget or to remember
You’re free, baby, baby
I didn’t come down here to fight ya
I came down these streets of love and pride to surrender
The streets of surrender

I heard a farfetched story
That nobody seems to know
I think it was about that stranger
It was youth, it was love and it was danger
It was winter with that warm it gets before the snow
It chilled my soul
Everybody’s crying about some kid
That they found lying on a beach
Born in a manger

You’re free, baby, baby
Free now and forever
It’s Christmas time
You can decide to forget or to remember
You’re free, baby, baby
I didn’t come down here to fight ya
I came down these streets of love and pride to surrender
The streets of surrender
