(Hear the spin...whoa!)

I was aching, the darkest night
To give up in the darkness of the night


So you enter to give me love
I'll be there when you get things on tonight

I...feel free
And I...I, I feel free
I feel free, yeah

I wanna hear you talk
Hear your sweet talk
I wanna love you talk
I wanna feel free
Yeah, feel free

Baby give me your love
Give it to me, you know
Your love...
I...feel free

Oh where did you go now
Oh where did you go
I couldn't tell you, love

Digging to love you, baby
Digging your love
I wanna took you down
I feel free

Isn't a not to baby
Don't you know that
I love it the time is on you know

And I...feel free
I...

I...feel free
I...I feel free
