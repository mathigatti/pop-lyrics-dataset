Thank-you, don't mention it.
I'm pleased to meet you.
I don't think I'm very good at this
Let me show you, I just wanna know, I just wanna know.


Falling… the world is by your side
Calling… to find a place to hide
I just wanna know
I just wanna know.

She said "The twenty second floor"
I said "I can't think what it's for"
And I just wanna know
I just wanna know.

Touching you, touching you, etc.
