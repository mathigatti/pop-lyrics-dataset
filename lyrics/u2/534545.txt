(feat with Andrea Corr)

You're everything I could want
There's no house you couldn't haunt
You're the key that could keep me in
You're the sense, under the skin


I won't bring you roses
I'll bring myself instead
Time only is time
For what is meant
Not what was said

Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, knock, knock, knocking
Don't come knocking no more

You're a dream I could wake up in
You're a fight I shouldn't try to win
You're the door, I'll always leave open
You're the heart that's always hopin'

Off a tree-lined avenue, in a college made of stone
I'll sit there not dreaming, I would rather live alone

Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, knock, knock, knocking
Don't come knocking no more

All the stars in the sky
They can't light our way, oh no
All the maps, and all the charts
All the dreams…
Dreams …won't… leave… you…
Home…
Home…

Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, don't come knocking
Don't come knocking at my door
Don't come knocking, knock, knock, knocking
Don't come knocking no more
