Weather 'round here choppin' and changin'
Surgery in the air
Print shirts and southern accents
Cigars and big hair.


We got the wheels, petrol's cheap
We only went there for a week
Got the sun, got the sand
Got the batteries and the handicam.

Her eyes all swimming pool blue
Dumb-bells on the diving board
Baby's always attracted to
The things she's afraid of. 

Big girl with a sweet tooth watches
Skinny girl in the photo shoot.
Freshmen, squeaky-clean she tastes of chlorine.
Miami, my mammy.

Love the movies, babe
Love to walk through movie sets
Get to shoot someone in the foot
Get to smoke some cigarettes.

No big deal, we know the score
Just back from the video store.
Got the car and the car chase. 
What's he got inside that case?
I want a close-up of that face. 
Here comes the car chase.

I bought two new suits
Miami
Pink and blue
Miami
I took a picture of you
My mammy
Getting hot in a photo booth
Miami.

I said you looked like a madonna.
You said maybe.
You said I wanna have your baby, baby.
We could make something beautiful
Something that wouldn't be a problem
We could make something beautiful
Something that wouldn't be a problem
Least not in Miami.

You know, some places are like your auntie
But there's no place like Miami
My mammy
Miami
My mammy.
