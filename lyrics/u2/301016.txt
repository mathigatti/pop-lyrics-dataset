I wanna blow my mind 
But I'm not the suffering kind 
You take your chances in no-go land 
I'm up all night on my baby's baby grand 


Hang on! 
(How?) 
Hang on! 

Hey, kill the jigs 'n reels 
I got the highest heels 
Baby's getting slicker 
With a quicker tongue 
Baby's getting bigger 
Oh mama! 
This is your song 

Hang on! 
Hang on! 

Moola, moola Billy Boola / Moola
Hula hula here-she-go-a / Hey, yeah Billy Boola
Oh pa coca cola E A O / Here chicky chicky 
Don't loose the coola
Moola, moola Billy Boola / Hey chicka
Hula hula here-she-go-a / Hey, yeah Billy Boola
Oh pa coca cola E A O / E suck-a-dick-a 
La da dee dee da 

Hang on! 
Check me out
Hang on! 

Moola moola moola

(Yeah Billy Boola)
(Amoeba amoeba)
(Goo goo ga ga gahba)
(My name is Billy Boola)
(Real coola)
(You know you gave me)
(She nothing to me)
(So let's go spend ??)
(Nothing real) 

Baby's a big flirt 
Nipples in a tee-shirt 
Took a boat across the drunken sea 
I'm still afloat, you're going down on me 
(How?) 

Hang on! 
Tell me how 
To hang on 

Moola, moola Billy Boola / Moola
Hula hula here-she-go-a / Hey, go now
Oh pa coca cola E A O / Here she got it
E like-a-dick-a 
Moola, moola Billy Boola / Ooohw
Hula hula here-she-go-a / Hey, Billy Boola
Oh pa coca cola E A O / Your chicka
