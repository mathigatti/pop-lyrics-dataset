Forty-five men
I used to know
Where we grew up
Where I wanna be
Beside you


Every song a precious face
No pretension
To hide yourself from blame

I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For it
I can't wait any longer
For your love

The birds still singing for you
As they fly above the good land
It's not a song of discontent
It's not like that
Up in the sky

Here I am, spaced out
All failed in the northern logic
Guided in the universe
Hey hey

I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For it
I can't wait any longer
For your love

And a day as it ends
And you watch as the sun goes down
Praying the night
Will go quickly now
Your hope
Your need
And the clouds make the sky alone
There's only one light that can guide you
Guide you

I can't wait any longer
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait any longer
For your love
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait any longer
For your love
For your love

Take me to your body
Show me that you want it
You want it
You got it
You want it
Child
