Bright morning lights
Wipe the sleep
From another day's eye
Turn away from the wall
And there's nothing at all
Being naked and afraid
In the open space of my bed


I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie

Just as I am
I awoke with a tear on my tongue
I awoke with a feeling of never before
In my sleep, I discovered the one
But she ran with the morning sun

I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie

Another time, another place
We lie
Another child has lost the race
We lie
Another time, another place
We lie
Your time, your place

We lie
Another time, another place
We lie
Another child has lost

We lie
Another time, another place
We lie
Your time, your place
