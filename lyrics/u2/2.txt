Lemon
See through in the sunlight
She wore lemon
Never in the daylight
She's gonna make you cry
She's gonna make you whisper and moan
But when you're dry
She draws water from a stone


I feel like i'm slowly, slowly, slowly slipping under
I feel like i'm holding onto nothing

She wore lemon
To colour in the cold grey night
She had heaven
And she held on so tight

A man makes a picture
A moving picture
Through light projected
He can see himself up close
A man captures colour
A man likes to stare
He turns his money into light
To look for her

And i feel like i'm drifting, drifting, drifting from theshore
And i feel like i'm swimming out to her

Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins

Lemon
See through in the sunlight

A man builds a city
With banks and cathedrals
A man melts the sand so he can
See the world outside                    
you're gonna meet herthere
A man makes a car                        
she's yourdestination
And builds a road to run (them) on       
you gotta get to her
A man dreams of leaving                  
she's imagination
But he always stays behind

And these are the days when our work has come assunder
And these are the days we look for something other

Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins

A man makes a picture
A moving picture
Through light projected
He can see himself up close
gotta meet her there
A man captures colour                    
she's yourdestination
A man likes to stare                     
there's no sleepingthere
He turns his money into light            
she's imagination
To look for her
She is the dreamer
She's imagination
Through the light projected
He can see himself up close.
