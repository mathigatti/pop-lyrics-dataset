Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love... with you


Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help
Falling in love... with you

Like a river flows
To the sea
So it goes
Somethings were meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
'Cause I can't help
Falling in love with you

I can't help
Falling in love...

No I can't help
Falling in love...

No I can't help
Falling in love...
