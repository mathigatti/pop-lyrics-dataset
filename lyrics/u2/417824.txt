All this weeping in the air, 
I can tell were about to fall through floating forests in theair
Across the rolling open sea.
Now I kiss and run through air. Leave the past find nowhere,
Floating forests in the air clowns all around you.


Clowns are here to let u know where u let your senses go.
Clowns all around you its a cross i need to bear. 
All this black and cruel is fair, this is an emergency 
Don't you hide your eyes from me, open them and see me now.

Can u see me now? Can u see? Can u see me now? 
Can u see? Can u see? Can u see? 
Can u see? Can u see me now? Can u see? 
Can u see? Can u see me now? 
Can u see me now? Can u see clowns all around you. 
Can u see? Can u see? 
Can u see? Can u see me now? 
Floating, floating, floating, floating.

See me here in the air not holding on to anywhere 
But holding on so beware I have secrets I wont share.
See me here wishing you if I don't deny I do contemplate our wishaway. 
If I ask u not to stay, clowns are here to let u know where u letyour senses go, 
Clowns all around you it's a cross I need to bare.

All this black and cruel is fair, 
This is an emergency don't you hide your eyes from me 
Open them and see me now.

Can u see me now? Can u see me now? Can u see? Can u see? Can usee?
