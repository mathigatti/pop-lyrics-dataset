Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
You think I'm no good, well I know I've been bad.
Took you to a place, now you can't get back.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.


Walked together down a dead-end street
We were mixing the bitter with the sweet.
Don't try to figure out what we might have had.
Just two shots of happy, one shot of sad.

I'm just a singer, some say a sinner
Rolling the dice, not always a winner.
You say I've been lucky, well hell, I made my own
Not part of the crowd not feeling alone.

Under pressure but not bent out of shape
Surrounded, we always found an escape.

Drove me to drink but hey, that's not all bad.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.

Guess I've been greedy all of my life
Greedy with my children, my lovers and my wife.
Greedy for the good things as well as the bad.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.

Maybe it's just talk, saloon singing
The chairs are all stacked, the swingers stopped swinging.
You say I hurt you, you put the finger on yourself
Then, after you did it, you came crying for my help.

Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
I'm not complaining baby, I'm glad.
You call it compromise, well what's that?
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.
