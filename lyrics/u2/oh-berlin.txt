Hasse, hasse, hasse, hasse

White snow turning to slush
A festival of brown in the city of my crush
If you walk around, you can step inside
Köthner straße achtunddreißig


Oh berlin
Who could think they would find you by just looking
Oh berlin
How many of us hide in you
Oh berlin
To think I could know you by your name

To stare and not be stared
To look and not be seen
To feel new feelings
Rather than understand where you've just been
Fame, huh

Oh berlin
Who could they would find you by just looking
Oh berlin
When you flap your angel wings
Oh berlin
To think that I could know you by your name

Chasing the ghosts of our heroes
Lou reed, david bowie, iggy, wim wenders, rilke
To change location rather than change yourself
To ask for directions rather than ask for help
To remain always a true friend

Oh berlin
Who could think they would find you by just looking
Oh berlin
When you flap your angel wings
Oh berlin
To think that I could know you by your name

Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angelic orders
And even if one to suddenly take me to its heart
I would vanish into its stronger existence
For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror
That we are still able to bear and we revere it so
Because it calmly disdains to destroy us
Every angel is terror

Every angel is terror
Oh berlin
Every angel is terror
Every angel is terror
Who would think they could find you by just looking
Every angel is terror
Every angel is terror
Oh berlin
How many of us hide in you
Oh berlin
To think that I could know you by a single name
