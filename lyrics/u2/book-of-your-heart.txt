Right at the start
You put this into words
How you think we should proceed, yeah
You wanted me alone
With the pictures that you've seen
Of where you haven't been
But where you want to go


Ask the leaf and ask the bird
Not to sing or speak a word
We are not fictitious characters
But we don't belong to this world

The book, the book of your heart
One tiny mark, an entry
In the book of your heart
It's written on skin
To even be in
The book of your heart

You can change your name, or even who you are
That's the beauty of the scar
That is the contract of the heart

This is our wedding day
This is the promise that we'll stay
Through the long descriptive passages
Where we don't know what to say

The book, the book of your heart
One tiny mark, an entry
In the book of your heart
It's written on skin
To even be in
The book of your heart

Babe I don't belong to you
Love is what we choose to do
Babe you don't belong to me
It's not that easy
