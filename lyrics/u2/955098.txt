La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie


Everybody:
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie

What's happened to you
You used to be so shy
You used to hang your head down
You wouldn't look in my eyes

Did you see some great vision
Did you finally break through
Did you shake the foundations
What's happened to you

La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie

What's happened to you
You used to look so tired
Now there's a spring in your step
And your words are on fire

Did you hear some great secret
Did the words ring of truth
Did you rise from the ashes
What's happened to you

Where the four winds meet
The world is so still
The waves are not pounding
And the hungry are filled

Our shadows have crossed here
Where the sun touched the ground
The gathered are singing (ooh)
What a beautiful sound

They're singing

La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie

Everybody sing:
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie

What's happened to you
You used to be so unkind
You used to curse at this poor world
So what changed your mind

What stirred such compassion
Is a mystery to me
I don't know what happened
Oh, but I like what I see

Where the four winds meet
The world is so still
The waves are not pounding
And the hungry are filled

Our shadows have crossed here
Where the sun touched the ground
The gathered are singing (ooh)
What a beautiful sound

They're singing
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie

(Go guitar)
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie

Come on, got it
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie

Oh sing it
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
La, la, la-la-la lie
La la la lie
