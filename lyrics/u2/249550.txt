Watching your bright blue eyes
In the freeze frame
I've seen them so many times
I feel like I must be your best friend
You're looking fine, so fine, oh, my
Dressed up like a lovely day


Babyface, babyface
Slow down child,let me untie your lace
Babyface, babyface
Cover girl with natural grace
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy?

Coming home late at night
To turn you on
Checking out every frame
I got slow motion on my side
Turning around and around
With the sound and colour
Under my control
Round and around,going down
Dressed up like a lovely day

Babyface,babyface
Tin foil hair all tied up in lace
Babyface,babyface
Bitter sweet girl won't you give me a taste
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy?

Do do do do do do do do do do...do do
Do do do do do do do do do do...do do

Babyface, babyface, slow down child
Let me untie your lace
Babyface, babyface
Open that door
Let me unpack my case
Babyface, babyface
You're everywhere child
You're all over taht place
Babyface, babyface
You're coming to me from outerspace
How could beuty be so kind
To an ordinary guy?
