City street lights 
And the multiple life 
But babe you gotta give and go 


Cigarette lights 
Then my finger alights 
I need to be alone 

She can take you tonight 
She can make you, that's alright 
She can break you tonight 
Don't misunderstand 

Cigarette girls 
Cause heaven and world 
To be a superman 

Open her booths 
There must be a bruiser
Drinking all I can 

We can take that tonight 
We can make them, that's right 
We can break them tonight 
Don't misunderstand 

The light... 
Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
In the sea of pain 

You can take it tonight 
She can make you, that's right 
She can break you tonight 
Don't misunderstand 
'Cause they cry and... 

Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
In the sea at night 

We rode the streets in the morning light 
We held our hate in our hands 

Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
In the sea at night
