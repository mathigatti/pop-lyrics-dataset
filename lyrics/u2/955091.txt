Through the fields of flame I ran with you 
Every blow you took I took with you 
I lied for you when you moved underground 
And covered you as the storm of rage came down 


But I will not wear you like a purple heart 
I will not wear you like a purple heart 

To the raging moon burning in the sun 
I held on to you, you held on to no one 
I followed you 'til you were out of sight 
And felt the pain as the bullets took the night 

But I will not wear you like a purple heart
I will not wear you like a purple heart

[Repeats, then Bono starts screaming in background
