Here today
And gone tomorrow
Crack the bone, get to the marrow
To be the bee
And the flower
Before the sweetness turns to sour


What we have we're gonna keep... always
What we've lost we don't need... always
What is it that won't let you sleep... always

Be the arrow
And the target
Put your head over the parapet
Be uncool
Yes, be awkward
And don't look in the obvious place
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate

Get down off your holy cloud... always
God will not deal with the proud... always
Well if you dream then dream out loud... always
Eternally yours... always

I want you
I want you
I want you

(Here she come)
Touching the other side
I wanted to be in love
I wanted to call
(Hey, soon soon)

You say come to know yourself... always
Don't find yourself in someone else... always
And always wear a safety belt... always
Wait for me I'm running late... always
This is the moment that we share... for always
Turn each song into a prayer... always

Now and forever
For always
For always
For always

For always
