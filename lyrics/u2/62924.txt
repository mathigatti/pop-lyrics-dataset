You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold


But all the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure, just to look upon it
All the riches in the night

You say you'll give me
Eyes in the moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest

But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all that I want is you

You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night

You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold

All the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
