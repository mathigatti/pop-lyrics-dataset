Calling, calling
The sun is burning black
Calling, calling
It's beating on my back
With a fire
With a fire.


Calling, calling
The moon is running red
Calling, calling 
It's pulling me instead
With a fire, fire.

But there's a fire inside
And I'm falling over
There's a fire in me
When I call out
You built a fire, fire
I'm going home.

Calling, calling
The stars are falling down
Calling, calling
They knock me to the ground
With a fire, fire.

But there's a fire inside
And I'm falling over
There's a fire inside
When I call out
There's a fire inside
When I'm falling over
You built a fire, fire
I'm going home.
