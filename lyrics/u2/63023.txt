Boy, stupid boy
Don't sit at the table
Until you're able to.


Toy, broken toy
Shout, shout, you're inside out
If you don't know.
Electric Co.
If you don't know
Electric Co.

Red, running red
Play for real
Talk and feel
Holding your head
You won't shout
You still beg
If you don't know
The Electric Co.

If you don't know.
Electric Co.
If you don't know
Electric Co.
