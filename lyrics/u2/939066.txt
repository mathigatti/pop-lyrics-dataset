Strawberries, cherries
And an angel´s kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made
From all these things


I walked in town
On silver spurs that jingled too
And sang a song
That I had sang just for a few
She saw my silver spurs
And said lets pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh summer wine

Strawberries, cherries
And an angel´s kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made
From all these things

Take off your silver spurs
And help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh summer wine

My eyes grew heavy and my lips
They could not speak
I tried to stand up
But I could not find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Oh summer wine

Strawberries, cherries
And an angel´s kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made
From all these things
Take off your silver spurs
And help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh summer wine

When we woke up the sun was shining in our eyes
My silver spurs were gone
My head felt twice the size
We took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
And left us craving for more summer wine
Oh summer wine
