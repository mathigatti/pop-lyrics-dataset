Take me to the house of rain
You know I'm gonna never be
Matches in a simple way
As the structure sits along the way


Hey that`s known as the flowering rose, a flowering rose that said my name
Kings and wine the flowering rose, the flowering rose of Glastonbury

Yeah, oh, rock and roll sunshine
Yeah, oh, a miracle will give you time

Some things you just can`t control
Sometimes you have to let go

Going to a brand new set
Music it will set me right
Nothing for the house of rain
Nothing that has ever been

Hey that`s known as the flowering rose, a flowering rose that said my name
Kings and wine the flowering rose, the flowering rose of Glastonbury

Yeah, oh rock n roll sunshine
Yeah oh a miracle will give you time

Living like a pilgrim sleeping
Under the flower of the American dream
Set the scene like a thought worth keepin
Livin in a dream jeez you can't be sleepin

Yeah, oh, rock n roll sunshine
Yeah, oh, A miracle will give you time
Yeah, oh rock n roll sunshine
Yo oh rock n roll sunshine
A miracle will give you time
A miracle will giv you time
A miracle will let you fly
A miracle
