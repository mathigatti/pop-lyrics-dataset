"In the Name of the Father" 

Come to me 
Come lie beside me 
Oh don't deny me 
Your love 


Make sense of me 
Walk through my doorway 
Don't hide in the hallway 
Oh love...step over 

I'll follow you down 
I'll follow you down 

In the name of whiskey 
In the name of song 
You didn't look back 
You didn't belong 

In the name of reason 
In the name of hope 
In the name of religion 
In the name of dope 

In the name of freedom 
You drifted away 
To see the sun shining 
On someone else's day 

In the name of United and the BBC 
In the name of Georgie Best and LSD 

In the name of a father 
And his wife the spirit 
You said you did not 
They said you did it 

In the name of justice 
In the name of fun 
In the name of the father 
In the name of the son 

Call to me 
No one is listening 
I'm waiting to hear from you love 

Stay with me 
It's cold in the ground 
But there's peace in the sound 
Of the white and the black 
Spilling over 

I'll follow you down 
I'll follow you down
