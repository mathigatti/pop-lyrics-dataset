This is one called Cartoon World. I think you know it, Mrs. Brown. Eventually, we will become one. Us, everybody.

Mr. Burk is off to work
He carries papers in his carrier bag
Mr. Postman takes his bag back
Those angry dogs, those angry dogs


It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world

There he is again

Mrs. Brown
You're bigger than me

Mrs. Brown is off to town
To carry shopping in her shopping bag
Mr. Brown is working hard
For some degree at university
A notion

It s a cartoon world
It s a cartoon world
It s a cartoon world
It really is
It s a cartoon world
It s a cartoon world
It s a cartoon

Mrs. Brown lied

Uncle Tony takes a drag
He didn´t give me a lot of beer
Jack and Jill go up the hill
Jack and jill
To pick some flowers and not some bills

It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon world
It´s a cartoon
