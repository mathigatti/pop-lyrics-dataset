Two Hearts Beat As One

I don't know, I don't know which side I'm on.

I don't know my right from left or my right from wrong.
Say I'm a fool, you say I'm not for you
But if I'm a fool for you oh, that's something.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts.


I can't stop to dance
Honey, this is my last chance
I said, can't stop to dance
Maybe this is my last chance.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts.

Beat on black, beat on white
Beat on anything, don't get it right.
Beat on you, beat on me, beat on love.

I don't know
How to say what's got to be said
I don't know if it's black or white
There's others see it red
I don't get the answers right
I'll leave that to you
Is this love out of fashion
Or is it the time of year?
Are these words distraction
To the words you wanna hear?
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts.

I try to spit it out
Try to explain.
The way I wanna feel
Oh, yeah, two hearts.

Well I can't stop to dance.
Maybe this is my last chance.
And I said, I can't stop to dance.
Maybe this is my last chance.
I said don't stop to dance
Maybe this is my last chance.
I said I can't stop to dance.
Maybe this is our last chance.
I said don't stop to dance.
Maybe this is our last chance.
Oh, oh!
