Cold outside, can anybody call
I see so many sides
I know each is through you gone


Take me, silver lining
Take me on my own
Save me, silver lining
Take me on my own

I play it in the hall, I can see you grow
You were always wishing and aching
So ever, always firezone

Take me, silver lining
Save me on my own
Soul the silver lining
Seeks your only zone

My song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song

You hold back but I can see you crawling
We always horse-shoed the nail
I can't hold this on

Take me, silver lining
Take me on my own
Take me, silver lining
And the garden grows

Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song

Call out my name
Call out today
Call out all same
