Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne?
And days of auld lang syne, my dear
And days of auld lang syne
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne?


We twa hae run aboot the braes
And pu'd the gowans fine
We've wandered mony a weary foot
Sin' auld lang syne
Sin' auld lang syne, my dear
Sin' auld lang syne
We've wandered mony a weary foot
Sin' auld ang syne

We twa hae sported i' the burn
From morning sun till dine
But seas between us braid hae roared
Sin' auld lang syne
Sin' auld lang syne, my dear
Sin' auld lang syne
But seas between us braid hae roared
Sin' auld lang syne

And ther's a hand, my trusty friend
And gie's a hand o' thine
We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne
