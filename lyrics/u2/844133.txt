City street lights
And the multiple life
But babe you gotta give and go


Cigarette lights
Then my finger alights
I need to be alone

She can take you tonight
She can make you, that's alright
She can break you tonight
Don't misunderstand

Cigarette girls
Goes head in and whirls
You will be a superman

Open her booths
Deal must to the bruiser
Drinking all I can

We can take that tonight
We can make them, that's right
We can break them tonight
Don't misunderstand

The light...
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
In the sea of pain

You can take it tonight
She can make you, that's right
She can break you tonight
Don't misunderstand
'cause they cry, and...

Alone in the light
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
In the sea at night

We rode the streets in the morning light
We held our day in our hands

Alone in the light
Alone in the light
Alone in the light
In the sea at night
