You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your live
See that girl
Watch that scene
Look at the dancing queen


Friday night and the lights go down
Looking for a place to go
Where they touch the right music, entering in the swing
You come find a king
Anybody could be that guy
The night is beggining end the music is high
With a bit of rock, everything is OK
And you are ready for a dance
When you have the chance

You are the dancing queen, young and sweet
Only 17
Dancing queen and you feel the tamborim
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene
Look at the dancing queen
