You don't have to break your heart in two my love 
You don't have to play a part, it's you I love 
You don't have to hide from yourself 
You don't have to be someone else, again 


You don't have to rescue me 
You don't have to watch me drown 
You don't have to give to me 
All I want is you 

Be there my love 
Be there tonight 
Be there my love 
Be there tonight 

You don't have to dress yourself up 
Or stay the same 
You don't have to smile 
If I say smile 

You don't have to be the best 
You don't have to give me rest 
All I want is all you have 
Nothing else 
Nothing  

Be there my love 
Just be there my love 
Oh.. mmm...  

If you want the whole of me 
That's all you'll get 
I sing this song 
I'd give my health, give it all 

You don't have to - 

(Ah, she whispered, she said 'I need you now') 
(Ah, she said 'don't worry, please me now') 
You don't have to worry, have to worry 
If I fall apart 
You don't have to wear strings
Or do those things 
You're enough in my heart  

You don't have to hide from yourself 
You don't have to be someone else 
All I want is all you have 
All I want is you 

Be there my love 
Be there tonight 
Be there my love 
Be there tonight 

Yes, you all see
