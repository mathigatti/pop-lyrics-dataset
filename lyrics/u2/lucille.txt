Oh Lucille, come sit you right down with me
Stay tonight until the morning sets you free
I know our love will last forever
But will our love, Lucille, last the night


Oh Francine, come sit you right down with me
Stay tonight until the morning sets you free
I know our love will last forever
But will our love, Lucille, last the night

Deep as a river, wide as the ocean
High as a mountain I'd climb for thee
I know our love will last forever
But will our love, Lucille, last the night

Thank you
It's a catchy one, isn't it
I'd just like to introduce you to my, the rest of the camp here
We got Luke Dalton on guitar, ladies and gentleman
Here's my sister, Betty Dalton
And over here on the drums we got Duke Dalton
My name is Alton Dalton, don't you forget it

Oh Lucille, come sit you right down with me
Stay tonight until the morning sets you free
I know our love will last forever
But will our love, Lucille, last the night
