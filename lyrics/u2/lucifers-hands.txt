Punk rock party in a suburban home
Everybody's famous here, but nobody's known
We got no music 'cos the speaker's blown... Apart
The spirit is moving through a seaside town
I'm born again to the latest sound
New wave, airwaves, swimming around my heart, uh huh


You no longer got a hold on me
Without a lucifer's hands
You no longer got a hold on me
You're no longer in control of me
I am
An enemy's spin from an inky page
St. John devine is going to take the stage
I can tell your talent is your rage, I'm in..

The player is on fire
You no longer got a hold on me
Without a lucifer's hands
You no longer got a hold on me
You're no longer in control of me
I am
Woah, yes I can change the world
Woah, yes I can change the world
The fool breaking bread is made out of stone
The rich man won't eat he is eating alone
That's easy
I can't change the world in me

You no longer got a hold on me
With lucifer's hands
You no longer got a hold on me
You're no longer in control of me
I am
