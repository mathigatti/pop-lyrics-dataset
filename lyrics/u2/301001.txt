All right, these are all new songs
We didn't wanna, you know, trot out the same old bollocks
Might be a good idea just to bring to this
Extraordinary shining country some new songs
Lift you up, not that you need us to lift us up
Thank you for lifting us up


Joe Strummer used to lift me up
When I was a kid listening to punk rock records
The Clash were our favorite group
And this is the last song that he ever wrote
With his wife Louise, and Elijah his daughter are here too
And I'm singing it for them too
I want you to sing it with me

It's a long (long)

It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom

When freedom rises from the killing floor
No lock of iron or rivet can restrain the door
And no kind of army can hope to win a war
It's like trying to stop the rain or still the lion's roar

It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom

It's like trying to stop the whirlwind scattering seeds and spores
Like trying to stop the tin cans rattling jailhouse semaphore
Like laying when your spins are manacled its your spirit that gets raw
It's not the small little patch of sky you see, but the spirit it, it soars

And long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom

My Man, Adbul Jamaica

When freedom arise from the killing floor
Can't stop the rain nor lions that roar
No matter whirlwind, scatter seeds and spore
From the sky, world visions of poor
Six waves come, then seventh break shore
We don't wanna distant, when you a killa boar
What I'm trying to say, this thing gone high, yay

What's in store, what's in store

Sing this one:
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4
4-6-6 6-4

In the ghettos of the colors don't forget the human core
In townships of humanity there would be no poor
From when the rock is heavy comes the purest ore
The first six waves might break in the bay, the seventh breaks on the shore

It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom

4-6-6 6-4 / It's a long walk
4-6-6 6-4 / Long walk to freedom
4-6-6 6-4 / It's a long walk
4-6-6 6-4 / Long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
4-6-6 6-4 / It's a long walk
4-6-6 6-4 / Long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom

Sing with me
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom
It's a long walk, long walk to freedom

Not just a president for South Africa
Not just a president for Africa
This is a president for anyone, anywhere
Who knows freedom
