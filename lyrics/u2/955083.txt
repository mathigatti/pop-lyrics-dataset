Here she comes like a child with a gun 
She makes you feel like you're the only one 
She smiles and it's dangerous...in a little black dress 
Superman and the filthy rich 
Get in the queue to scratch her itch 
Sticky fingers pulling at the hem 
Of her little black dress 


Baby don't mind 
She can leave it behind 
She don't want anything 
Baby's a star, she's gotta keep on shining 

She moves like an animal
The women sigh "It's Political" 
You could get arrested around here 
For that little black dress 
Not so simple, it's complicated... 
All this being loved and hated 
I wanna know what else she's hiding 
In that little black dress 

Baby don't mind 
She can leave it behind 
She don't want anything 
Baby's a star, she's got to keep on shining 

Don't pay me no mind, you're gonna leave me behind 
I don't want anything, baby you're a star 
I wanna hear you sing
