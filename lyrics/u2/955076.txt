Baby can't you see what you can do
Totally sure it is you
Feeling coming up another time
Never be the same without you
Putting out a feeling and then you go
Now I hurry up to see you
Seeing is believing baby
And I believe in you
And this feeling too


Just had another feeling
And for the same one, same one
Just had another feeling
And you're the same one, same one
Just had another feeling
And you're the same one, same one
Just had another feeling
You're back another time
Just had another feeling
That you're the same one, same one

I just had the same feeling again
I just had the same feeling again
I just had the same feeling again

Ahhh, alright another feeling
Ooh I've got a, got a feeling
Ooh I've got a, got a feeling
Ooh I've got a, got a feeling
Ooh I've got a, got a feeling

It's you, it's you, only you / Ah, yeah, it is
Coming up strong / Yeah
You're the one
You're in time / Baby, I take take baby
Never be the same / I am here cause you see me
Hold me up, to see you
Hold it up, to see you
