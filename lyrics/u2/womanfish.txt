Hangman hang, hangman hang for me
Hangman hang, hang from your tree
Hangman, Hangman
Hangman hang, hangman hang for me


One horse town, one wind coming down
One horse town, the breeze will come and blow us down
One thin man, help me if you can
One thin man, the breeze will come and blow us down

Love is all you're needing
Love is all
Love is all you're needing
Love is all
Love is all you're needing
Love is all
Love is all you're needing
Love is all

Hangman hang, Hangman hang for me
Hangman hang, Hang from your tree
One horse town, breeze will blow us down
One horse town, the breeze will come and blow us down
