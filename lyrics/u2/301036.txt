Heyo, I lost something 
My mind is telling me I can't go wrong 
I lost it, a single mission 
I want to worry, but it's never the one 


Wish you'd come and work it right 
And make the rounds with me 
You can tell me time and when I'm going south 
Everyone is with me 

Busy to live my life 
I've gotta live my life tonight 

Schooldays, I really run to 
I gotta move it, gotta move in my mind 
Loving, a single mission 
No one told me where to live in my head 

I get things mixed up and nothing's right 
And some days I go working 
One thing I consider to be right is to 
Just go around and choose it 

I've gotta live my life tonight 
I've gotta live my life tonight 
You...
