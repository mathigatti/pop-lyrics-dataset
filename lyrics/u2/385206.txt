I can't believe the news today
I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cos tonight
We can be as one, tonight


Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead-end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, bloody Sunday
Oh, let's go!

And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won?
The trenches dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

Sunday, bloody Sunday

How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cause tonight
We can be as one, tonight
Sunday, bloody Sunday

Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
I'll wipe your tears away
I'll wipe your bloodshot eyes

Sunday, bloody Sunday

And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die

The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won
On

Sunday, bloody Sunday
