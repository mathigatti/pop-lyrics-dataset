Take these hands, they're good for nothing
You know these hands never worked a day
Take these boots they're going nowhere
You know these boots don't want to stray.


You got my head filled with songs
You got my shoelaces undone.
Take my shirt, go on, take it off me
You can tear it up if you can tie me down.

Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?

Take the colours of my imagination
Take the scent hanging in the air
Take this tangle of a conversation
Turn it into your own prayer.
With my fingers as you want them
With my nails under your hide
With my teeth at your back
And my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies.

Do you feel loved? 
Do you feel loved?
And it looks like the sun
But it feels like the rain, oh.

Love's a bully, pushing and shoving
In the belly of a woman.
Heavy rhythm taking over
To stick together a man and a woman
Stick together man and a woman
Stick together. 

Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?

And it looks like the sun
But it feels like rain
And there's heat in the sun
To see us through the rain.

Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?
