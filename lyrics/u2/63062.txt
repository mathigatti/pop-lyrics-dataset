(What do you want? What do you want?)
(Watch your spell)


Zooropa...Vosprung durch Technik
Zooropa...be all that you can be
Be a winner
Eat to get slimmer

Zooropa...a blue kind of white
Zooropa...it could be yours tonight
We're mild and green
And squeaky clean

Zooropa...better by design
Zooropa...fly the friendly skies
Through appliance of science
We've got that ring of confidence....

And I have no compass
And I have no map
And I havve no reasons
No reasons to get back

And I have no religion
And I don't know what's what
And I don't know the limit
The limit of what we got

Zooropa...don't worry baby. It'll be alright
Zooropa...you got the right shoes
Zooropa...to get you through the night
Zooropa...it's could outsid,but brightly lit
Zooropa...skip the subway
Zooropa...let's go to the overground
Get your head out of mud baby
Put flowers in the mud baby
Overground

No particular place names
No particular song
I've been hiding
What am I hiding from?

Zooropa...don't worry baby. It's gonna be alright
Zooropa...uncertainty...can be a guiding light
Zooropa...I hear voices,ridiculous voices
Zooropa...in the slipstream
Zooropa...let's go,let's go...overground
Zooropa...take your head out of mud baby

(She's gonna dream up the world she wants to live in
She's gonna dream out loud)
