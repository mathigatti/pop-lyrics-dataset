When a boy meets a girl
Boy/Girl (girl)

Finding out
I'm finding out the things
That I've been talking about.
I'm finding out the things 
That I've been missing out.
Finding all the things
That blow my mind
I sometimes fall behind.

You and I
We live on the big ship
And time sails by.
You make up
And I believe milady's lie.
The skinheads call it strawberries and cream
Sometimes I scream.

When a boy meets a girl
Boy/Girl (girl)

We go out
A picture or a disco or a roundabout
I walk you home, 
I hold you there
You're giving out
I open doors so I can shut your face
Know your place.

When a boy meets a girl
Boy/Girl (girl)

You can take me in your hand
Stand back, leave me, come in.
Up and down and all around
Swinging sideways to the ground.
