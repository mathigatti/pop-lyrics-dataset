I saw an angel in blue jeans today
I felt that she melted all my bitterness away
You always tried so hard to hide your wings behind your coat
So let it be and let them free 
So you can't hoover low above the ground


You look so tired you've got moonbeams in your eyes 
And if I believed I know you'd be the first to fly
You always tried so hard to hide your wings behind your coat
So let it be and let them free 
So you can't hoover low above the ground

I'll find sunshine sometime soon
