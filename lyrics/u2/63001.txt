From father to son
The blood runs thin
Ooh, see the faces frozen (still)
Against the wind


The seam is split
The coal-face cracked
The lines are long
There's no going back

Through hands of steel
And heart of stone
Our labour day
Has come and gone

They leave me holdin' on
In Red Hill Town
See the lights go down on

Hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm still waiting
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to

The glass is cut
The bottle run dry
Our love runs cold
In the caverns of the night

We're wounded by fear
Injured in doubt
I can lose myself
You I can't live without

Yeah, you keep me holdin' on
In Red Hill Town
See the lights go down on

I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm still waiting
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
On to

We scorch the earth
Set fire to the sky
And we stooped so low
To reach so high

A link is lost
The chain undone
We wait all day
For night to come
And it comes like a hunter (child)

I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm still waiting
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to

We see love, slowly stripped away
Our love has seen its better day
Hangin' on
Lights go down on Red Hill
The lights go down on Red Hill
The lights go down on Red Hill
The lights go down on Red Hill Town
The lights go down on Red Hill
