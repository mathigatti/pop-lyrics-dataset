It's cold outside
It gets so hot in here
The boys and girls collide
To the music in my ear


I hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home

A painted face
And I know we haven't long
We thought that we had the answers
It was the questions we had wrong

I hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home

Say so, say so
Say so, say so
