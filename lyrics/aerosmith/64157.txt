Ruby red her lips were on fire
Do me with a kiss if you please
Tell me what your sweet heart desires
Tell me how you want it to be


'Cause if it's love you want
Then you won't mind
A little tenderness
That sometimes is so hard to find

(Lay it down)
Lay it down
Make it alright
(Lay it down)
Lay it down
I'll hold you so tight
(Lay it down)
Oh before the morning light
It's gonna be alright
Oh lay it down
Come and lay it down tonight

Tell me how you feel when we make love
Tell me is it real or just make believe
You will never know what you're made of
Til you open up your heart to recieve

'Cause if the love you got's that same old crime
We're talkin' tenderness
That's so hard to find
And I'm getting behind you

(Lay it down)
Lay it down
Make it alright
(Lay it down)
Lay it down
I'll hold you so tight
(Lay it down)
Oh before the morning light
It's gonna be alright
Oh lay it down
Come and lay it down tonight

Do you remember them times
Talkin' in your sleep
With a pocket full of promise
You never could keep
From your best friend's lover
You dreamt about in bed
When you pullin' up the covers
The voices in your head

Say if you want it bad
Don't ever let it slip away

'Cause if it's love you want and tenderness
Yeah

(Lay it down)
Lay it down
Make it alright
(Lay it down)
Lay it down
I'll hold you so tight
(Lay it down)
Oh before the morning light
It's gonna be alright
Oh lay it down
Come and lay it down tonight

Oh lay it down
Gonna lay it down tonight
Gonna come around tonight
You gotta lay it down
