I need a lady, not somebody shady
Need someone to be close to
Somebody cozy, not somebody nosy
Help me see my whole day through
Someone to share the load
Somebody to walk the road I live on live
Good lord send me, good lord mend me
Send me down someone for me


Said I won't be choosy, you
Could send me a floozy
Send me anybody you please

Somebody say you will
Somebody further still
Somebody, some-somebody for me
Now won't you send me somebody

Yeah, somebody
Won't you send me somebody
Now won't you send me somebody

Well, call for somebody, scream loud and bloody
Call woman, woman, come on to me
Save for tomorrow, share all your sorrow
Misery enjoys company (yes it does, yes it does)
