Spaced in time child of nine
Doin' twenty years on the way
Fire and steel earth unreal
Find another planet to stay


Papa died ma survived
Tellin' me about her ordeal
And the soul she could not feel
'Cause they made her so unreal

Lightnin' years disappears
Twenty million years on my brain
Synthesize overrides
Tryin' to keep from goin' insane
And my soul I can not feel
'Cause they made me so unreal

Spaced enough to know I feel there's nothin' out there
Spaced enough to know I feel I really don't care
Spaced enough to feel I'm really losin' my mind
And I'm never never never never ever goin' back

I'm off the track no one even knows I'm alive
Spaced without a trace
Waitin' for the word to arrive
I'm the last man to survive
