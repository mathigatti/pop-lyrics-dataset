It was a take it or a leave it
On a Saturday night
I wish I could love you 'til the cats come home
And make it right
If it's a make believe I say
I ain't tell you then
'Cause if it's a dream my memories wake me up
and start again


Oh, close your eyes and what do you see
Oh, look overhow you could do with your only believes

(Chorus)
She was a real top manner
Lots of nothing other
Hard Core biloozy
Late night rubber
A second hand clothes
Smiling like a Cheshire Cat

Well it was either now or walkin down the urchin' moon
Only a certain situation you could see I'm who
Putting the ring around the rose n' pull the daisy chain
Well, we are here, can tell me you ain't with that bachelor thing
Oh, close your eyes and what do you see
Oh, nothing but hammer to you with your only decease in me

(Chorus)

If you have wanna won with me
You're not to have be here tonight
Want you to hold it down
And let me lose a rock me right
Want you to get it on I'm your main man
Brother you never learned
Come on and rock again

Oh, close your eyes and what do you see
Rumbelin' happy to do with your only believes in me
