Checkmate honey, beat you at your own damn game
No dice honey, I'm livin' on the astral plane
Feet's on the ground, and your head's goin' down the drain
Oh, heads I win, tails you lose, to the never mind
Where to draw the line


An Indian summer, Carrie was all over the floor
She was a wet net winner, and rarely ever left the store
She'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right out of me
Oh, pass me the vile and cross your fingers, it don't take time
Nowhere to draw the line

Hi ho silver, we were singin' all your cowboy songs
Oh, you told Carrie, and promised her you wouldn't be long
Heads I win, tails you lose, lord it's such a crime
No dice honey, you the salt, you're the queen of the brine
Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got to choose
Where to draw the line

Checkmate
Don't be late
Take another pull
That's right
Impossible
When you got to be yourself
You're the boss
The toss
The dice
The price
Grab yourself a slice
Nowhere to draw the line
