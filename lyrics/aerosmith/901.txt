Young Lust Aerosmith

Young lust
Happy just to be in lust
Never have to eat no dust
Everybody talk about


Young lust
You're dyin' and you're screamin' inside
Oh, you're guilty way before you been tried
It's crazy but you're diggin' it

Young lust
You feel it in the summertime blues
Oh, easy when there's nothin' to lose
And baby you been missin' out

Young lust
Sometimes you need it so bad
It's enough to drive a young girl mad
So what you gonna do about it

A little bit o' nasty
You look a little sleazy
But don't get any on you

Young lust
You better keep your daughter inside
Or she's gonna get a dose of my pride
Yeah, everybody talks about it

Young lust
Once you had it you can never go back
Don't you ever let 'em give you no slack
When you're streakin' down the alleyway

Checkin' out the ladies
Who didn't bring their boyfriends
Who love to get in trouble
I got to say I'll see you later,
meet me in the elevator

Always gettin' stronger
Never gettin' weaker
My love is gettin' longer
I'll keep it in my sneaker
Never keep a secret
Never feelin' guilty
Never gettin' lonely
Never gettin' no peace, hidin' from the police

Sneakin' out the back way
Sneakin' down the alleyway
Gotta do it my way
Do it in the sunshine
Hangin' from the clothesline
Find another tree to climb

Young lust
There's no time for lovin'
Young lust
No, don't need one in the oven
Young lust
I'm a-pushin' and a-shovin' it

Young lust
Come on now I just can't wait
Are you fishin' or you gonna cut bait
Everybody body doin' it

Young lust
Honey now ain't it a bitch
Sometime you gotta scratch that itch
So what you gonna do about it
