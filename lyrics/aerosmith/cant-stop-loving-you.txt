I fell from Holy Moses mountain
Where love's a slippery slope
And all the others I've been hanging with
Never gave me too much rope


And then one day she came to me
Love at first sight, head to toes
I love her wild, my mountain child
And that's just how she goes
And here she comes

Hey I can't stop loving you
Cause it's all I wanna do
Yeah the world needs more of this
Tell me what you put into that kiss, yeah
Now keep that coming on, let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you're all I wanna do
Cause I can't stop loving you

Got me a good ole time-y cowboy
He got my picture on the fridge
And the first time that he kissed me
We was high up on the ridge
And when we came down from that mountain
On a ride with mama kin
And for all it costs, for getting lost, there ain't no better sin
Here we go again

You know I can't stop loving you
Cause it's all I wanna do
Yeah the world needs more of this
Tell me what you put into that kiss
Now keep that coming on, let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you're all I wanna do
Cause I can't stop loving you

When I wake up and see your face
All wrapped up in a pigtail lace
And that there's nowhere else would I rather be
Than all tied up in this rhapsody in blue

Hey I can't stop loving you
Cause it's all I wanna do
Yeah the world needs more of this
Tell me what you put into that kiss, yeah
Now keep that coming on, let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you're all I wanna do
Cause I can't stop loving you
