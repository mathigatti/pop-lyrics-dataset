I was a young man
Whose intentions were good
Kept my hands in my pockets
The way that I should


I soon found out
They got a mind of their own
Beginning to think
I had a heart
Made of stone

I keep falling off
I keep falling off
I keep falling off
I keep falling off

I try to remember
I try to forget
I´ll keep my promise
Is that what I said

I had your number
But I didn´t call
I got no excuse
I got my back to the wall

I keep falling off
I keep falling off
I keep falling off
I keep falling off

My eyes don´t want to see
My ears don´t want to hear
The things that make me feel
That keep me so endeared to you
It makes me think
Is that the best I can do

It doesn´t matter
The time that I fall
I'm up for the next one
Like I'm ten feet tall

I keep falling off
I keep falling off
I keep falling off
I keep falling off

I keep falling off
I keep falling off
I keep falling off
I keep falling off
