Ha ha ha ha...yea
We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live ain't a soul around
People start a' comin' all we do is just a' grin
Said we gotta move it out 'cause the city's movin' in
I said we gotta move it out 'cause the city's movin' in


Tell me who you know and i'll tell ya who to
Go see my friend he'll set you free
Tell me what you need and maybe I can go too
No one knows the way but maybe me

Nobody goes there
Nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me... yeahhhh....

Good mornin' glory allelujah to ya
What is the story
And what's been goin' through ya
Livin' like a king off the fat of the land
Workin' like a dog in a rock and roll band

We're movin'
We're getting out
We're movin'
Without a doubt
We're movin'
We're goin' far
We're movin'
Oh yes we are

'Cause nobody goes there
Nobody shows there
Nobody knows where you can find me
Nobody knows there
Nobody shows Where
Nobody knows where you can find me

Noooo... no no no no... it's all comin' down on you... yeah
Now now now oh...Wooa...

Level with God and you're in tune with the universe
Talk with yourself and you'll hear what you wanna know
Gotta rise above 'cause below it's only gettin' worse
Life in time will take you where you wanna go

Yeah... where you wanna go
Where you wanna go
Where you going
Where you going
Where you going
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh... oua oua...
Come on

Good mornin' glory allelujah to ya
What is the story
And what's been goin' through ya
Livin' like a king off the fat of the land
Workin' like a dog in a rock and roll band

We're movin'
We're getting out
We're movin'
Without a doubt
We're movin'
We're goin' far
We're movin' oh... yes we are... 'cause

Nobody knows where
Nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me
Nobody knows where
Nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me?

Well down and down round and down and better catch your mama
so you know where i'm goin?

We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live ain't a soul around
People start a' comin' all we do is just a grin
Said we gotta move it out 'cause the city's movin' in
I said we gotta move it out 'cause the city's movin' in...hey
