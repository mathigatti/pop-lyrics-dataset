She's right peculiar
She'll try and fool ya
But the Girl Keeps Coming Apart


She's so appealing
Right off the ceiling
But the Girl Keeps Coming Apart

What did I tell ya
She'll buy and sell ya
'Cause the Girl Keeps Coming Apart

She's so affected
I'm so rejected
And the Girl Keeps Coming Apart
Don't, don't, don't, don't let it get me down
Don't let it get me down

She's just a screamer
A nightmare dreamer
Yeah, the Girl Keeps Coming Apart

She's like a call girl
Loose ends and all girl
But the Girl Keeps Coming Apart

White lace and leather
She's so together
But still the Girl Keeps Coming Apart

I feel sedated
Boxed up an crated
'Cause the Girl Keeps Coming Apart
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let it get me down
Don't let it get me down

"So there she was
Buns up and kneelin'
I was a wheelin' and a dealin'
