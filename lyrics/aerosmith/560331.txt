Japanese girls i don't want to miss nothin'

Yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah yeah

Somebody set you off your rocker rocker
Just by the way that you look
Now pretty soon you'll need a doctor doctor
From all the shit that you took
I said now there ain't nothin' to it
And kinda looked the other way

But now you see it but now you don't
All that glitter's gone
Now you see it and now you don't
You got the right key baby
But you got the wrong wrong wrong key hole

I had 'em set you off your rocker right girl
You're as young as you are
He said he knew it from a shotgun shotgun
If you don't ever grow up
Said now there ain't nothin' too it
You can read my lips

Now you see it but now you don't
You have to sell your soul
If what you see is what you get
You got the right key baby
But you got the wrong wrong wrong key hole
Oh

Aaah aah aah
Aaah aah aah ah

Now you see it but now you don't
You have to save your soul
'coz what you see is what you get
You got no right key baby

But now you see it but now you don't
You have to save your soul
If what you see is what you get
You got the right key baby
But but you got the wrong wrong wrong key hole

Yeah-ah yeah-ah
Yeah oh oo-oo
