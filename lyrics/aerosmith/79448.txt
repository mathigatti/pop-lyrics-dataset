Uuh! Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write it today
I'm goin' away


Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write it today
I'm goin' away

Well I've been away forever
Suicide's crossin' my mind
But I'll never never never never never get so far behind

I said the ways of the night are evil
Without that Lord of Day
But I'll never never never never never get so far away

I said write me
Write me
Write me

I said write me
Write me
Write me

Well there's nothin' I can see that'd ever make
Me want to be without her she's good she's good to me
Said there's no way to explain the kind of feeling
That you get out in the rain she's good she's good to me
See this emptiness inside it makes me scream
It make me crawl out of my high she's good she's good to me
Oh no no

Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write it today
I'm goin' away

Well I've been away forever
Suicide's crossin' my mind
But I'll never never never never never get so far behind

Well I've been so many places
Hidin' from the wind and the rain
But you could write me a letter for to save me from a goin' insane... Ha ha

I said write me
Write me
Write me

I said write me
Write me
Write me
Don't fight me baby, yeah
