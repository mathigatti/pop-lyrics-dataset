(Chorus)
Shela, Shela, she like a hurricane
Shela, Shela, she like a ball and chain
Shela, Shela, she like a hurricane


Got myself a lady
Got down on my knees, yeah...
Hotter than Hades
Heaven if you please, yeah...

(Chorus)

Some girls put it to you
Make you scream in pain, yeah...
Some will say they knew you
And then forget your name, yeah...

Shela, real tight
Shela, that's right
Shela

She said she could do it
Love she could fulfill
There ain't noting to it
Backbone gets a chill
