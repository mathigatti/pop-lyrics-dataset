Gotta find a way
Yeah, I can't wait another day
Ain't nothin' gonna change
If we stay around here


Gotta do what it takes
'Cause it's all in our hands
We all make mistakes, yeah
But it's never too late to start again

Take another breath
And say another prayer

And fly away from here
Anywhere
Yeah, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams
Are out there somewhere

Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly, yeah

If this life
It seems harder now
It ain't no nevermind
You got me by your side

And anytime you want
Yeah, we catch a train
And find a better place, yeah

'Cause we won't let nothing
Or noone keep gettin' us down

Maybe you and I
Could pack our bags and hit the sky

And fly away from here
Anywhere
Yeah, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams
Are out there somewhere

Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly

Do you see a bluer sky now?
You can have a better life now
Open your eyes

'Cause no one here can ever stop us
They can try but we won't let them
No way, yeah

Maybe you and I
Could pack our bags and say good-bye

And fly away from here
Anywhere
No, honey, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams
Are out there somewhere

Fly away from here!
Yeah, anywhere
No honey, I don't I don't I don't care

Yeah, we just fly (away!)
