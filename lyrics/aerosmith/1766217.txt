First i go up,
And im down,
Then im up,
Then im down,
Then im up,
In your face...


My upside is down,
Well my downside is up,
And my cool ain't enough,
For the pace, getting rest...

You speak of truth,
But it roars like your lying
What goes around, comes around,
Double time...

Bridges are burning,
And then the world it ain't turning,
And is it you can be learning,
Untill im outta here, outta here, outta...

First i go up,
And im down,
Then im up,
Then im down,
Then im up,
In your face...

My upside is down,
When my downside is up,
And my cool ain't enough,
For the play, and that's the good share master lovin'...

He'll have no glory,
the queen's been deplored,
give up cuts rock, men your so overblown, ohhh...

Bridges are burning,
And in the face it ain't turning,
And is it you on the learning,
Oh my oh im outta here, outta here, yeah...

the Bridges are burning,
oh when the world keeps you turning,
oh was it you at the learning,
until the night, night, night in...

(solo)

My upside is down,
When my downside is up,
And my cool ain't enough,
And my love ain't enough for the play...

Bridges are burning,
oh when the world still turning,
oh will you even be learning,
and so i'm outta here, outta here,

Bridges are burning,
and the world it ain't turning,
and weather you have been learning,
well im out-ta here
