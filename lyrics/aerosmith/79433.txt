When I'm in heat
Someone gets a notion
I jump to my feet
I hoof it to the ocean
We hit a beach
Where no one gives a hoot
Nobody never ever wears a suit
The ladies there
They look so proud
That's 'cause they know
That they've been so well endowed


Now, I ain't much
For Fannie's conversation
Or care too much
About her operation
But every time Pandora comes my way
I get high
Can't explain the sensation
To get it on
I gotta watch what I say
Or I'll catch hell
From the women's liberation

Sweet Pandora
Can't ignore her
Smell like a flora
Open up your door-a for me
Sweet Pandora
Can't ignore her
Smell like a flora
Open up your door-a for me
Sweet Pandora
Mama crack a smile for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me

Now I ain't what
You'd call a city slicker
Or claim to fame
To be a slitty licker
But every time Pandora comes my way
I get high
Can't explain the sensation
To get it on
I gotta watch what I say
Or I'll catch hell
From the women's liberation

Sweet Pandora
Can't ignore her
Smell like a flora
Open up your door-a for me
Sweet Pandora
Can't ignore her
Smell like a flora
Open up your door-a for me
Sweet Pandora
Mama crack a smile for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me
