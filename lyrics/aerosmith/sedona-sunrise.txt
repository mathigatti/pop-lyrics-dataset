I was a city boy
Caught up in a city way
A nitty gritty boy
Was out all night
And always gettin' blown away


There ain't no breeze that cool the heat of love

She was a city girl
With no responsibility
A pretty little city girl
All fired up and what's
That got to do to me

'Cause there ain't no breeze that cool the heat of love

It's as clear as a
Sunrise in Sedona
Just what it is
That's blowin' in the wind
It's the fire in her eyes
It's the tear when she cries
It's the heat when I fall on my knees
That I'm thinkin' of

There ain't no breeze that cool the heat of love

It's as clear as a
Sunrise in Sedona
Just what it is
That's blowin' in the wind
It's the fire in her eyes
It's the tear when she cries
It's the heat when I fall on my knees
That I'm thinkin' of

There ain't no breeze that cool the heat of love
