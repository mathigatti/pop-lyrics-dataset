Ohh, when you cross that line
That you know you can't erase
To fall in lust not love
Ain't no sin at all


And tell me when your with your best friend's friend
Do you still feel outta place?

No, thanks, I took that ride
God only knows I tried believin'

I imagine everyone sometimes
Will cross their heart and hope to die
To tell: I love you lies!
I imagine everyone survives
For givin' up all that you got
To tell: I love you lies!

First time you look for love
You find you don't know jack, yeah
So much for mind games, you play to win
'Cause first you lose your heart's desire
Then you get it back

But ignorance ain't bliss
There's so much more behind the kiss
I'm feelin'!

I imagine everyone sometimes
Will cross their heart and hope to die
To tell: I love you lies!
I imagine everyone survives
For givin' up all that you got
To tell: I love you lies!

When loneliness and paranoia feeds me
God help the person who needs me, yeah

If ignorance is bliss
Then take me off the list
I'm leavin'!

I imagine everyone sometimes
Will cross their hearts and hope to die
To tell: I love you lies!
I imagine everyone survives
For givin' up all that you got
To tell: I love you lies!
