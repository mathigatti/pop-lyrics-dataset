I wake up
And wonder
How everything went wrong
Am I the one to blame?


I gave up
And left you
For a nowhere-bound train
Now that train has come and gone

I close my eyes and see you
Lying in my bed
And I'm still
Dreaming of that day

What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see
What was right in front of me

And now that I'm alone
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free
What could have been love will never be

An old friend told me
That you found somebody new
Ohh, you're finally moving on

Oh, you think that
I'd be over you
After all these years

Yeah, but time has proved me wrong
'Cause I'm still holdin' on, yeahh!

What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see
What was right in front of me

And now that I'm alone
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free
What could have been love will never be

We've gone our separate ways
Say goodbye to another day
I still wonder where you are
Are you too far from turning back?

You were slipping through my hands
And I didn't understand

What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see
What was right in front of me

And now that I'm alone
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free
What could have been love will never be

What could have been love will never be

What could have been love
What could have been love
What could have been love

What could have been
What could have been

What could have been love
