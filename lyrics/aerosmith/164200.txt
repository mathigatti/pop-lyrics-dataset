My baby gimme high temperature
Yeah... 101 when we... kiss and dance

103... 4 and 5... it get to hot to stay alive



My baby gimme high temperature
My baby gimme high temperature
When I see her comin'... down the street
I be the fever giver... high to the beat
103... 4 and 5... it get to hot to stay alive


My baby gimme high temperature
My baby gimme high temperature
97... 98 is just a... false alarm
My temperature 105 when I hold her... in my arms
103... 4 and 5... it get to hot to stay alive
