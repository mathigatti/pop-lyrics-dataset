I was a city boy
Cought up in a city way
A nitty gritty boy
Stayin' out all night 
And always gettin blown away


There ain't no breeze to cool the heat of love

She was a city girl
With no responsibility
A pretty little city girl
All fired up and what's 
That got to do to me

There ain't no breeze to cool the heat of love

It's as clear as a 
Sunrise in Sudona
Just what it is 
That's blowin' in the wind
It's the fire in her eyes
It's the tear when she cries
It's the heat when I fall on my knees
That I'm thinkin' of

There ain't no breeze to cool the heat of love

It's as clear as a 
Sunrise in Sudona
Just what it is 
That's blowin' in the wind
It's the fire in her eyes
It's the tear when she cries
It's the heat when I fall on my knees
That I'm thinkin' of
