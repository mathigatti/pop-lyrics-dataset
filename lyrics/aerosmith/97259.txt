I tell ya kinky
You foxy little flirt
I caught you in the biar path
Liftin' up your skirt
Well let me tell ya
What you been doin' in the Firepatch
What you been doin' with your little skirt
Got....


You've been foolin' with the Bitch's Brew
You know the things I told you not to do
You fell into the briar patch
Ain't nothing gonna save your ass

Remember the things you said
The saving and the screams for bread
And now you just walked away
So take it away, all the way

You're fooling with the Bitch's Brew
That ain't the thing you ought to fool with
Now you keep your fingers out of there, honey
You know that ain't no there

The way that you really feel
Down the parts on the way you deal
Where the witch is sight
And the things that you fight
(Oh God)

You've been messin' with the Bitch's Brew
Now don't you know who you're talking to
Say you're talking to the Bitch's who
Tell me you never really cared

The Voodoo man eyes of fire
The Hoodoo man most desire
The Bitches are out n' smooth
Tell from the light of the moon

(Yodle-lay-lay-lay, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)

I've been thinkin'
Had my hands through the sense of time
Yeah, and I've been drinkin'
Just to make this here song rhyme

You're foolin' with the Bitch's Brew
Now don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you...
