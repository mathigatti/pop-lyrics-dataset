(That, that) dude looks like a lady
(That, that) dude looks like a lady
(That, that) dude looks like a lady


Cruised into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced to grime on the door
She a long lost love at first bite
Baby maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right

That, that
That, that

Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody say
Forgive me if I seem out of line
Then she whipped out her gun
Tried to blow me away

(That, that) dude looks like a lady
(That, that) dude looks like a lady

So never judge a book by it's cover
Or who you're going to love by your lover
Love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a venus
Lord imagine my surprise

(That, that) dude looks like a lady
(That, that) dude looks like a lady
(That, that) dude looks like a lady
(That, that) dude looks like a lady

Baby let me follow you down
Let me take a peek dear
Baby let me follow you down
Do me, do me, do me all night
Baby let me follow you down
Turn the other cheek dear
Baby let me follow you down
Do me, do me, do me, do me

What a funky lady
She like it like it like it like that
He was a lady
