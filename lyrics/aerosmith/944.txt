Psychedelic sandwich
Any way that you can feel it
You shouldn't try to conceal it baby
You got to make up your mind
Any way I can steal it
Any way you can deal it to me
You know the pleasure's all mine
You gotta love it
You better own it
You gotta love it
And God knows it
You gotta shu uh shove it
I'm gonna make things happen
Goin' 'round'n, 'round'n, round
I wanna say you're a fire cracker
I wanna say you're a switch blade knife
You make sex a career
Comin' down from an all night tripper
Pull your foot from the ruby slipper
'Cause you can't get there from here 
You gotta love it
You better own it
You gotta love it
And God knows it
I'm gonna make things happen
Goin' 'round'n, 'round'n, round
That's it
I got thi feeling deep inside my gut
Overwhelming feeling of I know not what
One thing's for sure I ain't got time for those who can'trelate
You gotta learn to love the midnight madness
You gotta revel in the good and badness
If yin 'n yang is your thing
What I gotta do to try and reach ya
Is it for real or just a double feature
So let's go throw the I Ching
You gotta love it
You better own it
You gotta love it
And God knows it
I'm gonna make things happen
Goin' 'round'n, 'round'n, round
