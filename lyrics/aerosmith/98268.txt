Oh, She's On Fire
Oh, She's On Fire


Hot to trot, she's a bit insane
Little bit of pleasure
With a little bit of pain
I got to be smokin'
So I know without a doubt
Where there's the smoke
There's the fire, so I gotta boot it out

Say oh, She's On Fire
Oh, She's On Fire

Only child with a hang down lip
Starve for love and you pay your chip
Little by little, catch enough to me
She's more of a woman
And I thought she'd be to me
Hungry girl, she's a city slick
Sayin' the one, on a losin' stick

She's On Fire
She chop my head on a guillotine
She's my flame, she's a feather my chief
