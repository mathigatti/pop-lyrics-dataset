Good evening people, welcome to the show
Got somethin' here, I want you all to know
When life an' people bring on primal screams
You gotta think of what it's gonna take to make your dreams


Make it!
N' don't break it
I said make it!

N' don't break it if ya do
Then ya feel like the world's comin' down on you

You know that history repeats itself
What you just learned so has somebody else
You know you do, you gotta think up fast
You've gotta figure what it's gonna take to make it last

Make it!
N' don't fake it
Said make it!
N' don't fake it if ya do

Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catchin' the blues
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have ya got to lose?
You're only payin' your dues!

Yeahh, dues is the price that you gotta pay
If you don't they'll get you anyway
Although you know what you been goin' through
You're on the brink so think of what it takes to

Make it!
N' don't break it
I said make it!
N' don't break it if ya do

Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catchin' the blues
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to lose?
