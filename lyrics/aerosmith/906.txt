Hey, j-j-jaded
You got your mamma's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be?
You're gettin' it all over me
X-rated


My, my babe blue
Yeah, I been thinkin' 'bout you
My, my babe blue
Yeah, you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you

Hey, j-j-jaded
In all it's misery
It will always be what I love...and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side
We're thinking of
We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded

My, my babe blue
Yeah, I been thinkin' 'bout you
My, my babe blue
Yeah, I'm so jaded
And babe I'm afraid of you

You're thinkin' so complicated
I've had it all up to here
But it's so overrated
Love and hate it
Wouldn't trade it
Love me jaded...yeah...yeah

Hey, j-j-jaded
There ain't no baby please
When I'm shootin' the breese with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ecstasy's what you prefer

My, my babe blue (blue, blue, blue, yeah)
I'm a talkin' 'bout you
My, my babe blue (blue, blue, blue, blue, yeah)
Yeah, I been thinkin' 'bout you
My, my, babe blue (blue, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, you're so jaded
(Babe)
Jaded
(Babe)
You're so jaded
'Cause I'm the one that jaded you
