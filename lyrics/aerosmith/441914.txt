I SAW YOU STRANDED IN THE SECOND ROW
YA LOVE TA BOOGIE TO MY ROCK N'ROLL
TEASIN' THE BOYS WITH YOUR DRESS CREEPIN' UP YOUR LEG

YOU SHAKE YOUR HIPS DRIVIN' ME INSANE
YOU WET YOUR LIPS TRY TA RATTLE MY CHAIN
TO BAG YOUR BONES HONEY ANY STRAY DOG WOULD BEG

WILD CHILD YOU'RE SO RED HOT
YOU'RE GIVIN' OFF A LOT A HEAT
YOU'RE ONE STEP AWAY FROM WALKIN' ON DANGER STREET

YOU'RE MAMMA HATES THE WAY YA RANT AND RAVE
YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE HER TO AN EARLY GRAVE
YOUR SKIN TIGHT CLOTHES
YOU'RE DRESSIN' LIKE MY SEX MACHINE

THROWN OUT OF SCHOOL 'COZ YA BROKE THE RULES
YA KICKED THE TEACHER IN THE FAMILY JEWELS
STRUTTIN' YOUR STUFF YOU AIN'T NO TYPICAL SWEET SIXTEEN

WILD CHILD YOU'RE OUT ALL NIGHT
TEMPTATION IS AT YOUR FEET
RESTLESS AND BORED CRUISIN' ON DANGER STREET

YOU MESS WITH TROUBLE IN IT EVERY NIGHT
A SILVER SPOON AND SOME CHINA WHITE
YA GETTIN' YOUR KICKS WITH YOUR FRIENDS
JUST A LITTLE PUNK
  ooh

YOU'RE IN A STRAIT WHEN YOU FEEL SO SICK
YOU GOT THE HABIT 'COZ YOU JUST CAN'T KICK IT
LOOKIN' TA SCORE
LOOKIN' TA SCORE
LOOKIN' TA SCORE
  yee-hee

SAID WILD CHILD YOU GET SO HIGH
YOU'RE TRIPPIN' ON YOUR OWN TWO FEET
YOU'RE ONE STEP AWAY FROM CRUISIN' ON DANGER STREET
