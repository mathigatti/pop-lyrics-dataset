Looking through the looking glass
Looking back at me
I've got x-ray rear view vision
But I don't like what I see


Now, I should not bitch and moan
But there's not much I can do
When you're hangin' by a thread
And I'm hangin' on to you

Baby, we can fall apart or we can fall together
It's a long way down
We can make a new start, never say never
We can fall apart or we can fall together
Fall together
Fall together
Fall together

Now I know you feel compelled
When you're way down in the dumps
Every road can take some turns
Every road has got its bumps

Now you got to know yourself
You got to play it smart
'Cause you suffer for your sanity
If you suffer for your art

Baby, we can fall apart or we can fall together
It's a long way down
We can make a new start, never say never
We can fall apart or we can fall together
Fall together
Fall together
Fall together

Now, honey, I got this feelin' somethin' funny
I don't what it is
My knees are shakin', my heart is racin'
And the ground's about to give

Baby, we can fall apart or we can fall together
It's a long way down
We can make a new start, never say never
We can fall apart or we can fall together

Baby, we can fall apart or we can fall together
It's a long way down
We can make a new start, never say never
We can fall apart or we can fall together

(Fall together, fall together) fall together
(Fall together, fall together) fall together
(Fall together, fall together) fall together
(Fall together, fall together) fall together
(Fall together, fall together) fall together
