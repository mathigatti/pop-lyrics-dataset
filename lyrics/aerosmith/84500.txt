Well I tried everything
Just to get along with you
And I'm gonna tell you just
What I'm gonna do
Well I'm sick of all your cryin
When you should be leavin me alone
If you don't believe me
You pack me bags, I'm gone
Wontcha please
Don't that sun look good goin' down
You almost lost your love girl
When your ol man ain't around
chorus:
Won't you please
Don't that sun look good goin' down
When your ol man ain't around
Won't you please
Don't that sun look good goin' down
And you best believe I love ya baby
When your old man ain't around
chorus (repeat)
round and round
