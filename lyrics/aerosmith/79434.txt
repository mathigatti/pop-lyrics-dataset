If you believe in me
Like I believe in you
You wouldn't be tellin' me things
That weren't exactly true


Now everythin' changes
Ain't nothin' the same
I'm gettin' the strangest feelin', babe
I can't remember my name

'Cause the life I been livin'
And the love I been givin'
Would be sure to set you spinnin'
Witcha' feet never touchin' the ground
And I'm round and round

Well it was one for all
And it was all for one
And everything that we did
Never bothered no one

Look here
Now everythin' changes
Ain't nothin' the same
I'm gettin' the strangest feelin', babe
I can't remember my name

'Cause the life I been livin'
And the love someone give me
Would be sure to set you spinnin'
With you feet never touchin' the ground
Goin' round and round and round and round and round and round and round

Can you remember the days
When you were sweet sixteen
And always caught in the blaze
Of someone else's dreams

Look
Now everythin' changes
Ain't nothin' the same
I'm gettin' the strangest feelin', babe
I can't remember my name
I'm goin' round and round and round and round [...]

Goin' round and round and round and round [...]
