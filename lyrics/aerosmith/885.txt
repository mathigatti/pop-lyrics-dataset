moolah
bolt ons
fast car
quick fix
freak out
nose bleed
skull cap
pissed off
pissed on
I never seen a smile that looked so sad
'cause you make me feel so good 'cause you're so bad
hey little darlin'
your love is legendary
love's four letters
ain't in my dictionary
'scuse my position
but it ain't missionary
yeah, but I want to
walk on the water with you
boo-tay
hotpants
tan line
sweet
hookah
boo-yah
knocked-up
hose down
cool cat
hot flash
when it comes to makin' love I ain't no hype
'cause I practice on a peach most every night
hey little darlin'
your love is legendary
love's four letters
ain't in my dictionary
'scuse my position
but it ain't missionary
ah, but I want to
walk on the water with you
well, the cook's in the kitchen
and hidin' the spoons
I'm winking at witches
and howlin' at the moon
I'm afraid of the candle
but live for the flame
you know who I am
but you don't know my name
