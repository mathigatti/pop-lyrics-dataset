Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
don't get deep, shut up and dance


Love has got me down
a tear just hit the ground
so I started writing you this song
but the words I wrote came out all wrong

Yeah but it's alright

When you can't define the crime
then life ain't worth a dime
when they take away everything you've got
and they rub your nose in the funky spot

Not without a fight

When they work your fingers to the bone
now what does get you - nothing
in a crowd of people
you're still alone
you hope that tells you something
the road to heaven is paved in hell
and it makes you wonder

Why we're here at all

Check out the shape of the circumstance
he wears the dress and she wears the pants
here comes Jill and she needs romance
but you can't do jack so shut up and dance!
Sex is like a gun
you aim, you shoot, you run
when you're splittin' hairs with Mr. Clean
it's like getting head from a guillotine
and the night has just begun

Talk is cheap shut up and dance
don't get deep shut up and dance
