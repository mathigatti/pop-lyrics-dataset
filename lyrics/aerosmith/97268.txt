Remember when somebody 
Tried to tell you how to walk
And now they got the balls 
To tell us how we should talk


Oh no, glove love ain't cool
I must agree
So get outta my face
You ain't got nothing on me

Some say they do
Some say they don't
I take it in stride
And I can never get enough 
If I don't got to swallow my pride
I heard it all before and then 
She told me "gimme some slack"
Then she smiled at me and gave me 
The shirt right off her back

And that's when I took advantage of the situation

(Chorus)
Don't stop 
Rockin' your socks off
Don't stop 
Knockin' their blocks off
Don't stop 
Gettin' your rocks off
Don't stop
Takin' a hit, boy
Don't stop
Shakin' your fist, boy
Don't stop
I ain't got much to lose
I'm feelin' so confused

There's such a small thin line
Between pleasure and pain
And when you say don't
Then it's don't stop
I got to complain

Yeah, I think I may be getting
Real tired of all the steam
Because it's hard to get the way 
You move out of my dreams

Got to get it while you can

Whenever you're in doubt
You got to whip it out
When you keep hearin' no 
And your body says yes
But you can't hear a word 
That's been said
But you gotta confess 
Looking up her address
Got you thinkin' with your other head
