Totally out of control
She owns me
I didnt know that she'd know she stoned me
I think Ive got it bad and I cant let it go
I thought I knew me much better


Autumn and Cashmere all orange and green
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
Creme de gardenia and black vaseline
Shes naturally drop dead gorgeous
Its so not fair

Completely inside my head imagine pretending
She's the book that Ive read with a beautiful ending
It really drives me mad I cant leave her alone
'Cause I wont let me forget her

Rose colored glasses you know what that says
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
Her sweet molass' is all mine pasque frez
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous

Totally out of control
She owned me

Sweet almond eyes just to see and be seen
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
She tasted like cherries sweet loves grenadine
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
Makes love like a rabbit to my velveteen
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
A tem with a smile like a young Norma Jean
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
