Oh one, two, three, two, two, three

I let love die, broke a woman's heart
Have only myself to blame
Fate ran its course, I suffered a loss
I learned a lesson in pain
I cheated and lied, I took love for granted
Acting as cold as ice
But it's all in the past
I won't make the same mistake twice


Once is enough
It's one time too many
The change is rough
Ooo once is enough

Love went through such a sudden change
Takin' a turn for the worst
The joy turned to fear, the pain got so severe
Lord, I thought I was cursed
You get what you give, it comes 'round full circle
Ooo and I paid the price
I lost love so fast
I won't make the same mistake twice

Brrrr, hoo!

The change is rough
Ooo once is enough, yeah!
