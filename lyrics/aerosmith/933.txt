Got a '56 Cadillac
With a spare tire on the back
Got a charge account in my ol' bank
Said, I ain't got you


Got a classic and a pool
And a big hair ghoul
No matter who I fool
Said, I ain't got you

Chorus:
Got a baby and a liquor store
I played the number four-forty-four
Got a mojo and dontcha know
I'm all dressed up with no place to go

Got women to the left of me
Got women to the right of me
I got chicks all around me
Said, I ain't got you
I said, I ain't got you

Chorus
Mr. Whitford

Chorus
Go Joe

Chorus
You know I ain't got you baby
