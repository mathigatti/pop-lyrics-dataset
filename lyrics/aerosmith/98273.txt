When will the clouds all blow it away
When will the good people have their say
Now I hope you're still around to see the day


Take a while, Think About It
Take a while, Think About It
Take a while, Think About It

Who's gonna tell what is up or down
Who can be the king or be the clown
Then climb your tree, take a look around

Take a while, Think About It
Take a while, Think About It
Take a while, Think About It

Take it nobody out, if it in the tame
That which is now, will be again
Who can decide who is insane

Take a while, Think About It
Take a while, Think About It
