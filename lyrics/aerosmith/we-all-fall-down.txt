When your heart is breakin'
When your faith has been shaken
When the road you're takin'
Takes you nowhere at all


When it all, seems to all go wrong
Remember, nobody, can always be strong.

We all fall down...

I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go through it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall down

When your dreams are shattered
When you feel broken and battered
When every step on the ladder
Takes you nowhere but down

And you lose ground, like you can't hold on

Remember, nobody, can always be strong.

We all fall down...

I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go though it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall.
I will lift you, high above the rain
I'll be with you, we all feel the pain
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall down

Everyone breaks
You'll get hurt sometimes, in this life
You fly so high, you crash and burn sometimes
And I want you to know, you are not alone

We all fall down (we all fall down)

I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go through it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall.
I will lift you, high above the rain
I'll be with you, we all feel the pain
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall.

I will catch you.
I wont' let you.
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall down
