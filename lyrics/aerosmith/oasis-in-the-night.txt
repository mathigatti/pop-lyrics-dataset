These days there slipping away like thieves in the night
I try to hold on to them with all my might


Precious time spent with you goes by much too fast
Like snow in the sun it just never seems to last

Another tasteless coffee
Another empty day
Suddenly last night is just so far away
Too many talking heads, what was it that they said?

When we're apart
The days are dark
When I’m with you I’m in the light
You're my oasis in the night, yeah

You're my oasis in the night
You're my oasis in the night

You keep our love light shinning bright
You're my oasis in the night, yeah

When you're in my arms, you keep the world at bay
You stop it at the door, I don't care what they say

Time's too short, the fire's too hot, don't know what to do
'Cause I know in a flash it's just a memory too

Another tasteless coffee
Another empty day
Suddenly last night is just so far away
Too many talking heads, what was it that they said?

When we're apart
My days are dark
When I'm with you I'm in the light
You're my oasis in the night

You're my oasis in the night
You're my oasis in the night

You're my oasis in the night

I think I'll die
I just can't wait

'Til our next oasis in the night, yeah
Until our next oasis in the night
'Til our next oasis in the night, yeah

You're my oasis in the night
