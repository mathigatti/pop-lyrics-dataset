How many times can you turn away
You fall in love and then love falls away
You turn out the love when you turn out the lights
You hit the heavens when you hit the heights


How can I turn up the flame
You know how it kills me

Every time you say
Love is gone away
I get closer
It’s a give and take
Every time we break
I get closer

You get closer too, yeah

I love you, baby, ‘till death do us part
If love’s on the mend why not unbreak my heart
You start so many things, so why not let’s dance
Two times the love for a one time romance

How can I turn up the flame
You know how it kills me

Every time you say
Love is gone away
I get closer

It’s a give and take
Every time we break
I get closer

You get closer too, yeah

I don’t know why we fight
What’s wrong with always being right
It’s always those damnedest things
Can angels fly on broken wings

Every night when I’m alone in bed I still smell your perfume

Then I wake up in a sweat
I swear I still remember

Every time you say
I get closer

Every time you say
Love is gone away
I get closer

You get closer too, yeah
