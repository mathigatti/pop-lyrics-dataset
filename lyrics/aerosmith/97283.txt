Kickin' down the road
Feelin' mighty slowed
With the likes of you


Gettin' mighty spaced
Never had a taste
Of what you're goin' through

I can't bitch
Went from rags to riches
Then to ragtime screamin' the blues

(Chorus)
I Wanna Know Why
Everybody's good intention
Try to make a fool outta me
I Wanna Know Why
Everybody's good intention
Gotta make a fool
Gotta make a fool
Try to make a fool outta me

Swing low
Sweet cherry-o
When a strange love showed me the way

You see more
Can't keep a score
When the whore's comin' on for the play

(Chorus)

E. Poe
Eatin' crow
Wonder if he knowed that
Raven was mad

Time passed
And words lost the last
Of the thing he ever had

(Chorus)

Oh, play rough
Can't get enough
So the try to make a fool out of me

Lordy
Ain't foolin' me
Ya ain't ghoulin' me
Ain't foolin' me
