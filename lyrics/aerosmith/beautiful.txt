A friend of mine was talkin’
I was ear jackin’, eavesdroppin’
Down on my knees
So I could hear what she was sayin’


As I got closer
To her fire, her desire
Was to lead me on and on and on
And it was like

Beautiful!
We’re free again, we’re outta here
Beautiful!
You and me, my friend, let’s disappear

Now I got to thinkin’
’Bout the high speed dirty deed
Is what I want, what you need
I think you best believe it
Call it what you will
But you still gotta know
We can skin it, we can sin it, yeah, so baby let’s begin it
Saying

Beautiful!
We’re free again, we’re outta here
Beautiful!
You and me, my friend, let’s disappear
Beautiful!
Do all the things we never tried
Beautiful!
Just spread your wings and let it fly

Whoa whoa
(Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful) whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
(Beautiful, beautiful) whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

Beautiful!
We’re free again, we’re outta here
Beautiful!
You, me, my friend, let’s disappear
Beautiful!
Do all the things we never tried
Beautiful!
Just spread your wings and learn to fly

Whoa whoa
(Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful) whoa whoa whoa whoa
