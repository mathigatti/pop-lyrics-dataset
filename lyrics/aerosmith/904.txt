Walkin the live of a razor's edge
take it as far as she goes
slice of the sky on a silver wedge
higher and higher we go


ooo simoriah
ooo simoriah

ladies in black put a spell on me
feels like my head is going round and round
round and upside down
ladies in white ain't my cup of tea
so be it, I need it, long legs, big eyes
she drives me crazy

ooo simoriah
ooo simoriah

countin the eyes of the dragonfly
callin on dreams from within
she knows the way and she makes me high
so be it I need it
long hair, blue eyes
she drives me crazy
