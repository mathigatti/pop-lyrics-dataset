I got a hole in my heart
Lord I gotta do some patchin'
Got the seven year itch, girl,
We gotta do some scratchin'


Lay down momma
Got a holy resurrection
You got the oo-ee baby
That's sweeter than confection

You don't need no invitation
Grab the devil by the tail
If you got the fascination
Touch it, touch it, touch it
Make it red hot!

Wham bam - it was better than the first time
Love jam - had my fingers in the pie
Wham bam - we were swingin' from the grape vine
Wham bam - and I kissed her butterfly

You got me climbin' up the walls
Gotta scrape me off the ceiling
Slow down baby
we don't want to blow the feeling
We got the fiy-aa
like a burnin' volcano
I hope this feelin' never slips away
That is what I pray for

Yea, the train kept a rollin'
Screamin' all night long - Do it! do it!
We're gettin' down and dirty - do it! do it!
