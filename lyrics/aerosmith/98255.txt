1971, we all heard the starter gun
New York is such a pity
But at Max's Kansas City we won


We all shot shit in the bar
With Johnny O' Toole and his scar
And then old Clive Davis said
He's surely gonna make us a star
I'm gonna make you a star
Just the way you are

But with all his style
I could see in his eyes
That we is goin' on trial
and It was no surprise

The boys kept kickin' ass
As usual time would tell
But some bitch in the choir
Threw water on the fires of hell
She loved to shove and tell
Lord, she loved to tell

But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial
And it was no surprise
No surprise
No surprise
No surprise

Midnight lady
Situation fetal
vaccinate yo ass with yo phonograph needle

I say look it here
A friend of mine
Scratch like you need calomine
Flamingo boots, soles a creakin'
Still in love and Puerto Rican too

Ridin' on the wheels of hell
Smokin' in our axle grease
The backstage is rockin'
And we're copping from the local polica
That's right, the local police
Or the juctice of peace

But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial
Baby, it's no surprise
No surprise
No surprise
No surprise

Rock n' roll, junkie whore
Got my foot inside the door
Knock knock, knock knock, knock
Nobody's keepin' score

Bad time go away
Come again some other day
Topaz and sazzafraz
Will keep the blues away

Candy store, rock n' roll
Corporation jelly roll
Play the singles, it ain't me
It's programmed with insanity

You Ascap, if BMI
Could ever make a mountain fly
If Japanese can boil teas
Then where the fuck's my royalties
