Hey, look yonder
What's that I see?
Well, that old bogus, honey
Coming after me


I thought you told her
I was out of town
I wonder how she know'd
I was hangin' around

Say, listen babe
Don't go wasting your time
You keep a-comin' 'round
You'll hear the same old line

You got a thousand boys
You say you need 'em
You take what's good for you
And I'll take my freedom

'Cause a-lately
It's been so hard now to make ends meet
Ohh, yes it has
And honey
You're headin' it a one way street
And I gotta goin' the other way

I thought I knew her
My cagey lady
How could my sunshine
Be so damn shady

She'll say she love to talk
My conversation
But I'm the one who makes
Your situation

This one way city
That I thought I knew
It's such a pity, honey
That's it for you

Because a-lately
It's been so hard to make ends meet
And honey
You're headin' it a one way street
I gon' gotta on the other way

Hah-hah-hah
You know what I'm talking about, babe
I've seen that butterfly you tattoo'd on your pants
C'mon and ge' me some of that
Yeah-heh-heh

Ahh, there's nothin' over here
I never showed ya
I made it pretty clear
I'm glad to know ya

You know your brother Spike
He's on the level
But you always lookin'
Like you're mad at the devil

Don't say I copped a 'tude
It's all forgotten
It's just you're much too rude
Your fruits are rotten

You know I work so hard
To keep it alive
Now all I hear from you
Is nothin' but jive

Because lately
It's been so hard now to make ends meet, hey
And honey
You're headin' it a one way street
I gon' gotta on the other way
Yep I do!

Yeahh, ohh, lately
It's been so hard now to make ends meet
And honey
You're headin' it a one way street
And I really do feel that I gotta be movin' on

Hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey, oh, babe

I mean, you're headin' down a one way street
And you're foolin' everybody you meet
I said, your head's ju'like a one way street
And you're foolin' everybody you meet

I said, your head's like a one way street
And you're foolin' everybody you meet
I said, your head's like a one way street
And you're foolin' everybody you meet

I said, your head's like a one way street
And you're foolin' everybody you meet
I said, your head's like a one way street
And you're foolin' everybody you meet

I said, your head's like a one way street
You got to get yourself back on your feet

Ohh, no babe
Hummin' everybody yoo-hoo

Oh, babe
Hummin' everybody
Chewin' everybody
Foolin' everybody
Lovin' everybody
Lickin' everybody yoo-hoo
