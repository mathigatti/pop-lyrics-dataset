Here comes old flat-top
He come groovin' up slowly
He got Joo Joo eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please


He wear no shoeshine
He got toe jam football
He got monkey finger
He shoot Coca Cola
He say, I know you
You know me
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Chorus:
Come together
Right now
over me

He Bag Production
He got walrus gumboat
He got Ono side board
He one spinal cracker
He got feet down
Be-low his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease

Chorus

He roller coaster
He got early warning
He got Muddy Water
He one mojo filter
He say one and one
and one is three
Got to be good looking 'cause he so hard to see

Chorus
