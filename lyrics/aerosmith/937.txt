Down to who knows who
Just to socialize
I'm waiting for my girls
When you call my eyes
Uhh, you got no way to make a man, honey
You got to understand
I'm your man, child
Lord of the Thighs


Well, well, Lordie my God
What do we got here?
She's flashin' 'cross the floor
Make it perfectly clear
You're the bait and you're the hook
Someone 'bound to take a look
I'm your man, child
Lord of the Thighs

You must of come here to find it
You've got the look in your eyes
Although you really don't mind it
I am the lord your thighs

You must of come here to find it
You've got the look in your eyes
Although you really don't mind it!
I am the lord your thighs
