Love is the passion of the heart
Sometimes the arrow finds its mug
I wish i may i wish i might,
Somehow to make it be all right 


The light crisps in, the day begins
With voices in my head
The secret creep i can't forget
The sake of her in bed 

Every end my heart must bare
It's like a friend who turns and walks away
From here its like a tear
But sometimes pains to much

A parts today...

Love loves to high
In the roads of emotion
I couldn't die
In the roads of emotion

Sometimes the love you get ain't good enough
Although you love is tough
And cause it cows you floor
Is that what people say that love is for
Well i don't want no more
That is why I'm out the door...

Love is the passion of the heart
Sometimes the arrow finds its mug
I wish i may i wish i might
Somehow to make it be all right 

Love loves to high
In the roads of emotion
I couldn't die
In the roads of emotion 

Humm-ahh, humm-ahh, humm-ahh, humm-ahh
Humm-ahh, humm-ahh, humm-ahh, humm-ahh
Humm-ahh, humm-ahh, humm-ahh, humm-ahh aaahhhh... 

(hoo ahh humm ahh hoo ahh)

When your heart is torn
And your brose is torn
And your frozen in your fills...
Your nightmare dreams
Are a full of screams
No one ever feels... 

Love loves to high
In the roads of emotion
I couldn't die
In the roads of emotion

Sometimes the love you get ain't good enough
Although you love is tough
And cause it cows you floor
Is that what people say that love is for
Well i don't want no more
That is why I'm out the door...

Love is the passion of the heart
It's like a bridge into the dark
I wish i may i wish i might
Somehow to make it be all right...

shhaaahhh
