Somebody better call a doctor, doctor
Or wake me up with a shove
I'm gonna knock you off your rocker, rocker
Cause i think i'm in love
I tried to get a message to ya
But you walked the other way


I need your magic touch, don't you know
I got a habit and i can't let go
Feel the fire burnin slow
You better get it while it's hot now babe
Cause i can't let go

Don't need no wedding with a shotgun, shotgun
So don't you push me too far
Don't try to take me for a fool child, who child
Do you think that you are
You really got it coming to ya
It's gonna come as no surprise

I need your magic touch, don't you know
I'm after you and now i can't let go
Take it easy, take me slow
You better get it while it's hot now babe
Cause i can't let go

You never know what you got
Till they take it away
I'm comin ready or not
Gonna get you some day

I need your magic touch, don't you know
I'm after you and now i can't let go
Feel the fire burnin slow
I got a habit and i'm back for more
Your magic touch don't you know
I'm after you and now i can't let go
Feel the fire burnin slow
You better get it while it's hot now babe
Cause i can't, can't, can't let you go
