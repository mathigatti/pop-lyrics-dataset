Lady luck and the four leaf clover
Won't be as hurt as I feel all over
My life for one special occasion
'Til you leave in depth the situation


Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
Able to throw me a life preserver
'Cos I'm about to drown in my own tears

Well standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Well well well standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Well well well standing on shakey ground
Shaking, shakey ground
Standing, standing
Standing on shakey ground
