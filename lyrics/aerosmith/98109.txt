The boys and dukes are ready to rumble
The word on the street some heads are gonna tumble
Blades gonna flash when the street gangs clash
In this avenue tonight


When the lightning strikes

Zip gun Johnny's finger is itchin'
Oh, the lid's gonna blow up in hell's kitchen
It's an eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
They're so ruthless when they fight

When the lightning strikes
Ohh

And it's a free for all in the parking lot
Tell me who will rule the street
And the night explodes
When the cops bring down the heat

And the chains they crash like thunder
While the weak ones all retreat
Gotta draw first blood
Or they'll read your funeral rights

When the lightning strikes

It's dog eat dog when you're meetin' your rival
In the combat zone it's a means of survival
Gonna get last licks on a suicide blitz
On a cloak and dagger night

When the lightning strikes

It's a free for all in the parking lot
Over who'll rule the street
And the night explodes
When the cops bring down the heat

And the chains they crash like a thunder
While the weak ones all retreat
Gotta draw first blood
Or they'll read your funeral rights

Ohh, ohh

When the lightning strikes
When the lightning strikes

When the lightning strikes
Can't ya hear the thunder

When the lightning strikes
Can't ya hear the thunder

When the lightning strikes
Can't ya, can't ya, can't ya hear the thunder

When the lightning strikes
Can't ya, can't ya, can't ya hear the thunder

When the lightning strikes
Can't ya, can't ya, can't ya hear the thunder

When the lightning strikes
Can't ya, can't ya, can't ya hear the thunder

When the lightning strikes
