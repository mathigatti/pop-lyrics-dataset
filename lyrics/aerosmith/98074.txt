(Look out!)
We're gonna bring somebody
Up on stage now with us
A Mr David Woodford
Gonna blow some sax, yeah


(Watch this man!)

Some like 'em short
Some like 'em tall
Some like 'em thin
Skinny legs and all
I like 'em buttered
I like 'em proud
Now when they walk
They know they draw a crowd

See, well you gotta have a mother for me
Watcha say, whatcha say
See, well you gotta have a mother for me
One more, gimme, gimme
See, well you gotta have a mother for me

Popcorn, popcorn
Cheese cake, cheese cake (Uh! you heard it)
Hun' I can't see ya
There ya baby!
Listen here

Some like 'em short, some like 'em tall
Some like 'em thin, skinny legs and all
I like 'em buttered, I like 'em proud
And when they walk, you know they'll draw a crowd

See - well, you gotta have a mother for me
See - well, you gotta have a mother for me
See - well, you gotta have a mother for me
See - well, you gotta have a mother for me
Said you gotta have a mother for me
Said you gotta have a mother for me
And you gotta have a mother for me
Gotta have a mother
Said you gotta have, said you gotta have
Said you gotta have, said you gotta have

She got to give just what she got
To get just what she wants
She got to give just what she got
To get just what she wants
She got to give just what she got
To get just what she wants
What it is, what it is, just what it is

See - well, you gotta have a mother for me
See - well, you gotta have a mother for me
See - well, you gotta have a mother for me
Let's get outta here

See - well, you gotta have a mother for me
Gotta have a mother for me
Gotta have a mother for me
Said you gotta have a mother, gotta have a mother
Said ya gotta have, gotta have
