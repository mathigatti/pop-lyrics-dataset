Goin' downtown, goin' down, goin' down
'Neath the city, eatin' ground round
Underground is pretty gritty


I turned the screw she held the light
That's when I knew she was a
Sight for sore eyes
She was a sight for sore eyes

Playin' no fair, sleepin' under stairs
Downtown's a pity, takin' fair square
Under where it's pretty gritty

I turned the screw she held the knife
Oh holy Jesus, she's a sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes (she's a nitty gritty)

Turnin' in style, ride a mile for your titty
Naked foul while under there
Under where that's pretty gritty

Hey, don't you know people
She's a love lust hussy
She left, oh, she rust me
Dear old girl

She was a sight for sore eyes
But she was sittin' pretty
A sight for sore eyes
She was a nitty gritty
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes

Peeled back and parted
Even at the start it was delight or demise
I feel like a leopard king
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
