Johnny come late on a Saturday night
Singin' how de go
Backstage boogie in the house of delight
Where they steal the show
money comes sour but the ladies are sweet
it's a love affair
Whole place rockin', people stompin' their feet
When the gang's all there


He gets his woman every night for free
He's out there rockin' like you wouldn't believe
Singin' na, na, na...

Johnny like to gamble with his lady Louise
She was a black jack deuces are wild
He got to thinking 'bout his nose in the breeze
And there Johnny looked and he smiled
He started thinking 'bout the fortune and fame
with the young girls down at his knees
He dug the money but forgot all the names
So he knew just how to appease

Lick And A Promise
Lick And A Promise
Lick And A Promise
(He gave the ladies a) Lick And A Promise

Lick and a promise
(he gave the ladies a) Lick and a promise

Loose change clover in his early, early years
Had his poor mama pacin' the floors
He grabbed a guitar and a couple of beers
Now the crowd keeps screamin' for more

He gets his woman every night for free
He's out there rockin' like you wouldn't believe
