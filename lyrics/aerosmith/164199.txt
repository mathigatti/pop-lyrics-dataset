Everybody talkin' 'bout what it is and what it ain't
What kinda house and what kinda paint
Everybody seems to be steppin' in time
But it's much too fast and I gotta remind ya


Ooooo, we gotta take it easy
Ooooo, we gotta take it easy

Old kinda feelings, Saturday nights
God I'm afraid n' gotta pull out the stops
Everybody seems to be marchin' in time
But it's much too fast and I gotta remind ya

Ooooo, we gotta take it easy
Ooooo, we gotta take it easy, yeah

New kid smokin' in a bar tonight
Who be pullin on a peace pipe
Where you sit is where it's at
Gotta get off your ass 'cause you're gettin' too fat

Ooooo, we gotta take it easy
Ooooo, gotta take it easy

Ooooo, we gotta take it easy
Ooooo, we gotta take it easy

Sweepin' up the tombs with your paranoid yups
Later hop the stores when you clean your cups
Everybody's livin' in the middle of the line
But it's much too much and I gotta remind ya

Ooooo, better take it easy
Ooooo, we better take it easy
Ooooo, you better take it easy

Don't do it

Don't do, gotta take it easy
Gotta, gotta take it easy
Gotta, gotta take it easy
Gotta take it ea...

Ooooo, we gotta take it easy
We gotta take it easy
Ooooo, gotta take it, I gotta take it
I gotta take it, I gotta take it

Old kinda feelings, Saturday nights
God I'm afraid, gotta pull out the stops
Everybody seems to be marchin' in time
But it's much too fast and I gotta remind you
