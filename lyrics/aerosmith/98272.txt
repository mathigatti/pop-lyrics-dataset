Take a walk in the warm New England sun
Ain't no time to look for clues
You get the point from Uncle Sam's loaded gun
Who be the hand that light the fuse, ah


Take a look, take a look at my old billy goat
He used to raise all kinds of hell
He took a dose of radiation dope
Back in the barn is where he fell, like hell

Lucy, chromosone
Lucy, superdome

What makes you think you patronizin' my old friends
After you ride in my car, car
What do you do when your oil's mexican
OPEC boys, you went too far, to faar

Lucy, chromosone
Lucy, superdome
Lucy, papadum
Lucy, sing the song

(Ah), dig it up
(Ah), leave it up
(Ah), dig it up
(Ah), leave it up
