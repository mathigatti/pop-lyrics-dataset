It be night time when shadows fade
She was dressed like a chamber maid
All decked out in silk and I took her
Like a cat takes to milk
Come here little Queenie or...
Has the cat got your tongue?
Can't let nobody see me
Come on girl while we're still young
'Cause there's never been no lover's knot
Can tie you down 'cause you're so hot
Don't pinch me ass I may be dreamin'
Hope tonight that I'll be screamin'


Black cherry, black cherry, black cherry
I like it, I like it, I like it

She looked sheik in a funky way
Tongue in cheek baby all the way
Home girls they got pride, she said
'One time around' I said 'Let's go for a ride'
Come here little Queenie... or ah
Has the cat got your tongue?
My best shot for a C note baby she said
That's why this Janie's got a gun
Because there's nothin' like a good time girl
To take you twice around the world
I'm so in lust I think I'm trippin'
So in love I think I'm slippin'

Down to the river, down to the river of love
Where the love runs deep it's so sad it's a love you can't keep

Down to the river, down to the river
Abover 42nd Street it's so sad
That the bad don't come cheap

Because there's nothing like a good time girl
To take you twice around the world
Right to the land of milk and honey
Leave your troubles, bring your money

Black cherry, black cherry, black cherry
