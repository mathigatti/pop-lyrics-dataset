Stagecoach lady hourglass body
Makin' things glow in the night
Well she would if she could
And she'd be good if she would
Only be a lover she'd be out tonight
'Cause I'm a bad a lonely school-boy and I'm a rat
And it's too bad can't get me none a that


Salt Lake City salt lickin' biddies bogus honey stinkin' a gin
Well my daddy was hard his face was pretty scarred from kickin' ass
And playin' poker to win
'Cause I'm a bad lonely school-boy and I'm a rat
And it's too bad can't get me none a that

It's too bad

And it's too bad can't get me none a that

Loose old lady my mama Katie chivalry was born at her feet
Well she shoulda' thought twice when pa showed his dice
At night she put my daddy to sleep
'Cause I'm a bad a lonely school-boy and I'm a rat
And it's too bad can't get me none a that

It's too bad Lord it's too bad
I said it's too bad Lord it's too bad... yea
I said it's too bad it's too bad
You know it's too bad... aaahh it's too bad
