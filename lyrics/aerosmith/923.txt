You act like a prima donna
playing so hard to get
sittin' so cool and nonchalant
draggin' on a cigarette


you keep a wall all around ya
'n I'll get through some day
'n I want your love babe, if push comes to shove
gonna chip that wall away

chip away
chip away at the stone
I won't stop 'til your love is my very own
chip away
that's what I'm gonna do
sweet little mama I wanna get next to you

you stand like a marble statue
trying to look so hard
all decked out in your antique dress
while the boys all promenade

even a rock will crumble
if you strike it night and day
if hammer I must, I'm gonna get through your crust
gonna chip that stone away

chip it, I'm gonna nip it, all night long
