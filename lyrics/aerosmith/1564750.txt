Ooohhhhh waaaahhhh oooohhhhhhhh...

Whatever happened to the innocent man,
21 yrs later, he don't understand,
if god wanted him to fly, he would've given him wings,
now his life becomes a symphany without the strings,


Whatever happened to the innocent girl,
she became a victem of a fucked up world,
she didn't fit into the master plan,
because a woman shouldn't be a man,

Purgatory's waitin', hail mary take my breath way,
drinking flex my arms, smokin' 20 packs a day,
you can't sail in the needle and the spoon,
or give all the credit to the man on the moon,

Everyone complaining about the hand they're dealt,
cuz they lookin' for a feeling they never felt,
get off the pot, get off your ass,
try to be the 1st, but you'll wind up last,
aaaahhhhhh...

Whatever happened to the magical one,
he said, your hearts out of rythem and we come undone,
(on the ruuunnnnnnnnn)
hoping he can catch her and bring it back,
and ressurect the love before it fades to black,

Purgatory's waitin', hail mary take my pain away,
genueflecs? my arms, smoking 20 packs a day,
holy roll me overgetcha here to say?,
you can't sail in the needle and the spoon,
or give all the credit to the man on the moon,

Everyone complaining bout the hand they're dealt,
cuz they lookin' for the feeling that they never felt,
get off the pot, (yehhh) get off your ass,
if you try to be the first your gonna be the last..
