Well, she's the woman of the world
And God she know it
Turn my head
Every time she shows it
Yeah, nothing you can do
Nothing you can say
No way you can try to change her way
She might be gone tomorrow
Say what you gotta say


Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy what a woman

Well I tried, I tried so hard to please her
She'd give me a look if I beg to tease her
There's nothing you can say
Nothing you can do
No way you can try to coochie coo
She might be gone tomorrow
Oh, Lordy what you gonna do

And I tried with an open hand
And a heart of sorrow
Hoped that everything would be all right
Don't save too much lovin' for tomorrow
Get out all your lovin' here tonight

And I tried with an open hand
And a heart of sorrow
Hoped that everything would be all right
Don't save too much lovin' for tomorrow
Get out all your lovin' here tonight

She got big-eyed cats
She got coats of sable
She seats forty-four at her dinner table
And there's nothing you can do
Nothing you can say
No way you can try to change her way
She might be gone tomorrow
Oh, throwin' it all away
