My Girl, she breathes hellfire
And My Girl, she feeds my desire
My Girl Sadie, she's the wind in my sails
A puss'n boots lady with a cat o' nine tails
Comin' after you honey, feet don't fail me now


My Girl, she's bare back rider
And My Girl, she's Lady Godiva
She's a full time love no mon ami
Sweeter than honey from a honeybee
And it all rubs off on little old me, oh

Slippin' in and out of love
Slippin' in and out of love
Slippin' in and out of love
Slippin' in and out of love

My Girl, she smokes barbed wire
And My Girl, can't get no higher
I made it with the lady and a one track mind
Diamonds in the rought, they're so hard find
Day after day, the same old grind
And grind and grind and grind....

My Girl, My Girl, My Girl, My Girl....

My Girl, she's bare back rider
And My Girl, she's Lady Godiva
She's a full time love no mon ami
Sweeter than honey from a honeybee
And it all rubs off on little old me, oh

Slippin' in and out of love
Slippin' in and out of love
Slippin' in and out of love
Slippin' in and out of love
