I'm not talkin'
Well, that's all I got to say
If I said things were splendid
Our mom might be offended
If I said things were awful
It may just be unlawful
That's one thing I can do without


I'm not talkin'
Well, that's all I got to say
Used to think I knew it
Man I sure outgrew it
Ain't the things that matter
Things like idle chatter
That's one thing I can do without

I'm not talkin'
Well, that's all I got to say
If I say things at midnight
I ain't gonna say 'em in daylight
I reached the final conclusion
And all this persecution
Don't call me, baby, I'll call you

Whooo

Whoa

I'm not talkin'
That's what I gotta say
Well you could draw a conclusion
It only spreads confusion
Aw things like that'll get her
The little things that matter
Well that's one thing
I could do without

Awright.
