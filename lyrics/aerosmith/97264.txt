Now you say you're lonely
You cry the whole night through
Well you can Cry Me A River, Cry Me A River
I'll cried a river over you


Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can Cry Me A River, Cry Me A River
I'll cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can Cry Me A River, Cry Me A River
I'll cried a river over you

You drove me, baby, drove me out of my pain
Why, you never shed a tear
Remember all, remember all that she said
Told me love was to be in, you was, you was...

Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and Cry Me A River, Cry Me A River
I'll cried a river over you
I'll cried a river over you
