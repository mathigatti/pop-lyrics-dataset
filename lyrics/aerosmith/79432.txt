All the way back in history
Now a girl thinks is a mystery
We spend our lives cruising the bars
The venus girls and the men from mars


So in all this time did u ever think
Do the girl see red when a man sees pink?
And if your best lovin's in the past
'Cuz your somewhere slow is nowhere fast

[Chorus]
You're outta your head (yeah)
So outta your head (yeah)
Stay outta your head
You better get with if 'cause you're so without it
You're outta your head (yeah)
So outta your head (yeah)
Stay outta your head

Somewhere, somewhere underneath the rainbow

Bricka braka fiya kraka sis boom bah!
Here comes trouble in a push up bra
Your style is sharp as carpet tack
But you're out of your box and you're way off track

You can moderate on a mental binge
Your catastrophe's on a lunatic fringe
It's good for the gander, it's tit for tat
You say it's all good but it's more than that

[Chorus]

So in all this time did you ever think..

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Stay outta your head (yeah)
stay outta your head
You better get with if 'cause you're so without it (yeah yeah yeah)
You're outta your head (yeah)
So outta your head (yeah)
Stay outta your head

Somewhere, somewhere underneath the rainbow (2x)
