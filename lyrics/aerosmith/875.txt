I'm alone yeah I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears and the crying that I do is for you
I want your love let's break the wall between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light


Baby
You're my angel come and save me tonight
You're my angel come and make it alright

Don't know what I'm gonna do about this feeling inside
Yes, it's true loneliness took me for a ride
Without your love, I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do, I'm sleeping in this bed alone

Baby
You're my angel come and save me tonight
You're my angel come and make it alright
Come and save me tonight

You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give when I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why
Baby, baby, baby

You're my angel come and save me tonight
You're my angel come and make it alright
You're my angel come and save me tonight
You're my angel come and take it alright
Come and save me tonight
