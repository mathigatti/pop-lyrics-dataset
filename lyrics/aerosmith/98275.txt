Take me on your rockin' horse
Hit the lights and shut your doors
Grab your ankles, everyone
Ain't my way of havin' fun


(Chorus)
Can't give it up
Gotta give it up, give it up
C'mon Nancy
Can't give it up
Gotta Get It Up, Get it Up
For your fancy

Don't speculate
I'm just a slave your masters bait
I love fuck into the night
just waitin' for the bright light fright

Can't Get It Up,
Gotta Get It Up, Get it Up
C'mon Nancy
Can't Get It Up
Gotta Get It Up, Get It Up
Really have a good time
Really have a good time

Suckin' up the moonshine
Up underneath her clothesline
Really have a good time
Love me 'til the sun

(Chorus)

Get It Up and down and all around
Take a ride and paint the town
Slow me down and make it fast
Scream almost and make it last
You know you gotta
Really have a good time
You know you're really gonna
Really have a good time
Suckin' up the moonshine
Up underneath her clothesline
You know you really gonna
Really have a good time
You know you really wanna love me
