You say one thing then you do another
You got it all wrong so you blame it on your mother
You're kickin' the dog 'cause you can't get the cat
You know it ain't cool but'cha like it like that


Everybody talkin' 'bout what it is what it ain't
Kiss on the devil and ya piss off a saint
But it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
You say you don't need nothin' but you got to have it all

I wanna know
What kind of love are you on

Jelly roll jane rollin' on the rug
Tokin' on her lover like a brand new drug
Do the same thing every damn day
Do the same thing do the same thing
Never seem to get enough

I wanna know
What kind of love are you on
I've got to know
What kind of love are you on

Well when jack took jill up that hill
She charged his ass a quarter
Well he flipped his lid uh 'cause what she did
Aw she shouldn't hadn't oughta

Rockin' in the cradle with a high school vamp
Screamin' and hummin' like an old tube amp
Up down sideways goin' in and outta phase
Everybody ask me why i kiss the girls and make them cry

I wanna know
What kind of love are you on
Yeah, i wanna know
What kind of love are you on
I've gotta know
What kind of love are you on
