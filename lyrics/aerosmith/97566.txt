And what a stormy night
I met the pony
It was so dark that i could hardly see
It smelled so sweet you know who and Joanie
So many butterflies one could not see


We all could feel desire
Took off in flight
It was hotter than fire
Than came the light

Oh, oooh
Oh, Ah, Now smell the heat
The dancing pony unwrapped his wings
To try off Joanie
The pony he grew in size
In thunder and rain
And finally realize
What he was and what he does
And what he couldn't stay

And left to kiss the cheek of Mother Nature
Nobody here can denie such things
He's created as you look'm honey
No butterfly should be denied his wings

He was a kick ass rocking horse
He like a hell bent tied to the Gavin Pole
It was a one-time fantasy
I got to grab hold and fly into the Holy Land
Bare back, riding like like a butterplane
Nightmares, and he can hold the candle to my dreams

Oh we rode tonight
I talked to believe in
What I saw all right
It was everything
We flew into burning skies
The thunder and rain
And finally realize
What he is and what he does
And what he couldn't stay

Oh, no, no...
Took off in flight
Oh, no, no...

Bare back somethings coming over me
Not mess and he can hold the candle to my dreams

No live to breathe
No stable lights
No try to please
Nobody's eyes
We'll never see lust again
And tell me the pain
Bury it all again
We have a good time
Somebody shot him down

Now tell me, tell me, tell me never
We could really cause a course in time
Listen bissin' to your old pleasures
Bissin' listenin' be a king of spine

He was a keep grass rocking horse
He was a one time fantasy
A two two...?
