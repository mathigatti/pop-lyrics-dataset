Sitting at a stop sign
Lookin' for a friend of mine
Waiting to salute the flag
Talkin' to some he/she
Slidin' over next to me
Man, she said, this life is a drag


It's a shaky situation
I'm hangin' on my will
And I get no satisfaction
From a hundred dollar bill
But I got what I came for
And I'll do it 'till I drop
You do what you want to do
I ain't never gonna stop

(Chorus)
You say you got something that makes you feel good
And you can't stop messin' with it
All your life you've been so misunderstood
'Cause you can't stop messin'with it.

Sittin' by the seashore
Dreamin' 'bout a little more
Circlin' the classifieds
976
Man I need another fix
I'll never have to kiss the bride

Yeah, the city is a war zone
This country gone to hell 
And the beer cans in the alley
From the rich folks on the hill
They're screamin' hallellujah
But I don't givea damn
'Cause I got my own religion
Yeah, it's a right here in my hand

(chorus)
