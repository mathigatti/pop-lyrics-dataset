Pulled into town just to check out the sites
Chantilly Lace was head to toe in these tights
I smell that Perfume now here she come again
I can't believe this chick and a check out that grin
The way that you come yeah the way that you drool
Don't give me no nevermind I ain't yesterday's fool
You buzzin' round my hive some and reek of self conceit
Rubbin up and down my leg like a dog in heat


You're a dime store lover
A dime store lover
Just a back page cover
Yeah a dime store lover....

Now some object when I throw down my cool
But I'm judge and jury so uh... objection overuled
She did her best just to put on the charm
She said "I dare you", I said "twist my arm"
Donnez-moi un break honey then I paid the cheque
To some psycho chick who's talkin' out the side of her neck
I...I...I tipped my hat, she winked her scandle eyes
And cracked a smile - I was mofo suprised

She's a dime store lover
A dime store lover
Yea a back seat shover
Just a dime store lover....

We was rollin round and round and round
Chantilly took my breath away
Yeah when push came to shove
She gave me all the love
That she was savin' for a rainy day
We was rollin round and round and round
Chantilly was my cream brule'
I was ooh and ahh, she was ooh la` la`
Un do me Baby....

We did the wild thing, it was good stuff cheap
She made some promises she couldn't keep
I think I'm fallin' for this dime store lover
Can't help it yeah I just got to have it

You're a dime store lover
A dime store lover
Just a back page cover
