Savin' all your money
For a rainy day limousine
Teenage baby send you
Full friction magazine
I don't know how she do it


Up down turnaround
Four on the floor tonight
When she did what she was doin'
She was rubbin' me the wrong way right
Push come to shove
Give it one more try
Don't miss your water
Until the well runs dry

Love Me Like A Birddog
Never Learn to Fly

Bareback baby
Tell me what's on your mind
If it's the same old same old
Slap you on the back behind
I don't know how you do it
Tell me one time
About how it used to be
You got the judge and jury
Swinging from the highest tree
Push came to shove
Give it one more try
Don't miss your water
Until the well runs dry

Love Me Like a Bird Dog
Never learn to fly
Ask me no questions
I'll tell you no lies

Love Me Like a Bird Dog
Never learn to fly
Ask me no questions

Bass drum beating
Like a hot damn house on fire
Love lover's quarrels
Always seem to make the body cry
I don't know how she do it
Tell me one time
About how it used to be
She got the judge and jury
Swinging from the highest tree
Push came to shove
Give it one more try
You don't miss your water
Until the well runs dry

Love Me Like a Bird Dog
Never learn to fly
Ask me no questions
I'll tell you no lies
