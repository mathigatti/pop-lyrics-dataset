You breathe i breathe you in
I like alot where you've been
I maka you break the rules
You got me rockin' the blues


Give a little bit get a little bit take it for a ride, yeah
When you push love so far away it eats you up inside
There's a girl living under my skin
Theres this girl and she's wearing me thin
And you think shes the reason
That its open broken hearted season
Theres a girl theres a girl

I know you know you are ...
You are the oh in la la
Blow a little kiss get a little bit get a little high, yeah yeah
And i can't get you out of me cause your too deep inside

There's a girl living under my skin
Theres this girl and she's wearing me thin
And you think shes the reason
That its open broken hearted season
You could spend your whole life trying
You could never be more mine

Theres a girl theres a girl
Theres a girl theres a girl

Get a little bit get a little bit get little high, yeah
When you push love so far away it eats you up inside

There's a girl living under my skin
Theres this girl and she's wearing me thin
And you think shes the reason
That its open broken hearted season
Theres a girl theres a girl (yeah yeah yeah)
Theres a girl theres a girl (yeah yeah yeah)
And you think shes the reason
