Going under, rats in the cellar
Going under, skin is turning yellow
Nose is runny,  losing my connection
Losing money, getting no affection


New York City  blues
East side, West side lose
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you can

Believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart

Safe complaining, 'cause everything is rotten
Go insanity, and ain't a thing forgotten
Feeling cozy, rats in the cellar
Cheeks are rosy, skin's turning yellow

Lose it's party, looking rather lazy
See my body, pushin up a-daisies

New York City schools
East side, west side lose
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you can

Believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart
