You're making me wait like there's no tomorrow
You're taking from me what I can't beg or borrow


There's something that tells me your life has changed
There's something that tells me this isn't a game
There's something that tells me that you hit the floor
There's something that tells me that you got everything you need
But all you want is more

You knew there was dreams I had in my corner
I made you a dollar you gave me a quarter

There's something that tells me your life has changed
There's something that tells me this isn't a game
There's something that tells me that you hit the floor
There's something that tells me that you got everything you need
But all you want is more

There's something that tells me your life has changed
There's something that tells me this isn't a game
There's something that tells me that you hit the floor
There's something that tells me that you got everything you need
But all you want is more
