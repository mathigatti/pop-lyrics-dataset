Some girls awfully risky
And some girls kicking the stall
Give it up women and whiskey
Yeah you ain’t got nothing at all
But a sign on the wall that hung on the tack
Said liquor in the front and poker in the back
I got no more lonely nights
Ya-ya baby till out goes the lights


If you wanna take a lookie cookie tonight might be your lucky nighty night night

How they go déjà-booty
You’re a yaya baby tonight
Way to go thought you knew me
Yeah but you’re not getting it right
But it’s cool
Too cool for cat
A little bit of this and a little bit of that
Had a red hot maybe on a cold summer night
Ya-ya baby till out goes the lights

If you wanna taste the cookie lookie tonight might be your lucky

Roses are red, my lips on you
But you couldn’t tell by the things that we do
The things that we see are so out of sight
We’ll have to see when we turn out the light

Living in the land/lap of love

Living on coochie and romance
Waiting on cupid to call
Some people say that’s livin’
Yeah but that ain’t livin’ at all
And it’s cool, that’s how i roll
You get a little lovin’ if you got a lot of soul
And it’s for sure, when love’s just right
Ya-ya baby when out goes the lights

If you want a little nookie cookie tonight might be your lucky

Roses are red, my lips on you
But you couldn’t tell by the things that we do
The things that we see are so out of sight
We’ll have to see when we turn out the light

Ooh-aa-oo yeah yeah
