Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somn' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me


Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood
Girl, you been givin' me that line so many times
It kinda gets like feelin' bad looks good

That kinda lovin'
Turns a man to a slave
That kinda lovin'
Sends a man right to his grave

I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
You drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby

What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

You're packin' up your stuff and talkin' like it's tough
And tryin' to tell me that it's time to go
But I know you ain't wearin' nothin' underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show

That kind of lovin'
Makes me wanna pull
Down the shade
That kind of lovin'
Now I'm never gonna be the same

I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
You drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby

What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

I'm losin' my mind, girl
'Cause I'm goin' crazy

I need your love, honey
I need your love

Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
You turn it on
Then you're gone
You drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby

I'm losin' my mind
Girl cause I'm goin' crazy

Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
I'm losin' my mind
Girl cause I'm goin' crazy

Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
You turn it on
Then you're gone
You drive me
