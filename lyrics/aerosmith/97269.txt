(This is impossible)

Well, Downtown Charlie
Was a place on my daddie's and a
Well my pistol was a tripper
And I didn't feel so bad
Well be comin' round with roses
Put my hands on my feet
And my turnin' to the luck picture
I put my neat
Well, the gang's all here
And I'm feelin' fine
Ah, you gotta lose your mind
He was a countdown
Oh, that was a downtown


Said, swing low slicker
Future goin' lover
All is goin' good
I forgot my rubber
A pi-sa (never mind), my sexy
All I wanna do is get on my feet

Na, na...oh, the boy's coming home

(Around this time, Steven screams
something I won't even try to make out)
Downtown Charlie
Said, Downtown Charlie
(Repeat)
(And never mind the screamin' parts...impossible)

Just call him if you're good
