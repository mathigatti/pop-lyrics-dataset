(Woe is me
Well I've been dyin'
Got to get that monkey
Off my back)


The fortune teller looked into my eyeballs
The wrinkles on her face about to crack
She said you best believe it you ain't goin' nowhere
Unless you get that monkey off your back

I made believe the devil made me do it
I was the evil leader of the pack
You best believe I had it all and then I blew it
Feedin' that fuckin' monkey on my back

If you put it in a spoon man I would boot it
Some king whose mental house was just a shack
Where do you draw the line
When all your friends are dyin'
Got to get that mokey off your back
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Your crystal ball is where you chase the dragon
She said now bring me home his head inside a sack
But now you find your crystal balls are draggin'
Got to get that monkey off your back
