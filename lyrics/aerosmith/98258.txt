Yeah, woke up one mornin'
I'm a ram up for walls
Somethin' told my baby
You can have it all
Jump trough the window
Look my life in the den
Look out pretty mama
I'm On The Road Again


(Chorus)
I'm On The Road Again
(And you can do what you want)
I'm On The Road Again
(And you can do what you want)
Yeah, I came home last night
To get my dinner hot
Went to the door
But the door was locked
Jump through the window
And believe me or not
She hadn't even 
Put my dinner into the pot

(Chorus)

Yeah, never been evil
And I've never been shy
Every down a champ
And I'm a time by
Down un winner
With my apple in bed
Look out pretty mama 
I'm On The Road Again

(Chorus)

Yeah, never been evil
And I've never been sly
Every down a champ
And I'm a time by
Down in the window
With my apple in bed
Look out pretty mama
