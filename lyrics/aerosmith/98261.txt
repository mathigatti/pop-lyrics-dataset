Can you be in love
When you live alone
Push Comes To Shove
When you're bitchin' on


Now look at every
I'm tonne on you without a doubt
Said the music does the talkin'
But all we heard is talk about

The girls are left behind
When forty women all spend time
With me and the boys
And the toys, yeah

Rose said she was fine for two
With blonde hair, by crack it
Miles of blue
Sooge, she was on my side
'Cause she and Nancy
Ah they took me for a ride

The girls are left behind
When forty women all spend time
With me and the boys
And they do, yeah the toys

Talk about it
Walk about it
Talk about it
Talkabubi
Talk about it
Talk about it
Dedumdudidudi

Can you be in love
When you live alone
Push Comes To Shove
When you're bitchin' on

She looked, well, about 35 to me
When mine was still comin' on to you
But I was covered back, back then
'Cause me and the boys
Knew hot courior

The girls are left behind
When forty women all spend time
With me and the boys
And the toys in the attic

Her sister, she was lank a fin
Never tought I'd given in
Her candle of youth was burnin' low
But me and the boys
Knew something had to go

The girls are left behind
When forty women all spend time
With me and the boys
Dededudidudu

Talk about it
Walk about it
Talk about it
Talkabubi
Talk about it
Talk about it
Dedumdudidudi

Can you be in love
When you live alone
Push Comes To Shove
When you're bitchin' on

Can you be in love
When you live alone
Push Comes To Shove
When you're bitchin' on

Huh!
