Hey, hey you! Lift your face off down the ground
Hey, hey you! With the junkies all around
Hey, hey you! Would your feelings sound the sand? Ahh


Hey, hey you! With your face on the flame
Hey, hey you! This is all a silly game
Hey, hey you! Would your feelings sound the same?

Well, you know you got that love, baby insparation
And you got that old generation, with your feet down
Down on the ground, and then you sing songs baby, when you know who's around.
Say baby

Hey, hey wait! Whatcha gonna do with that whore?
Get your brains, scraped off the floor
Hey, hey you! what you got in the door?
Yeah, hey, hey you! you gotta let it go! Yeah! Hey, hey you! Whats on in the middle east?
Hey, hey you! why don't you take another piece
Hey, hey you! Would your feeling sound the same?

Thats it, stay around stay around!
Who, who who who?
Who, who who who?
Who, who who who?

one, two, three, four

Hey, hey you! With the face on the fire
Hey, hey you! Sing your ass off in the chior
Hey, hey you! Don't let things go to long! to long to long

Hey, hey you! With your ass on the ground
Hey, hey you! Never say you get the sound
Hey, hey you! What did you think of the sound?
Ooohhhh
