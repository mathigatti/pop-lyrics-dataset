Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Does whatever a Spider can
Spins a web, sweet surprise
Catches thieves just like flies
Look out, here comes the Spider-Man


Is he strong, listen bud
He's got radioactive blood
Can he swing from a thread
No escape from his spider web
Look out, there goes a Spider

When chill meets the night
And the scream of a crime
Like a laser edge
He arrives just in time

Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Doing the impossible
Why because he can
Spider-Man, Spider-Man

Doin' what he gotta do,
According to the plan
Look out, life is a great big bang-up
Wherever there is a hang-up
You'll find the Spider-Man
