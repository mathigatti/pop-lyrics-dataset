Darkness, Darkness, hungry to the bone
Darkness, Darkness, take my body home
God, I'm in love, I'm in love...


She like a pooker
She holy roller, love me like a song
She like a lightning
She roller coaster, 'til the break of dawn
She like a shadow
She all around me, nasty hearted dream
She got the sexy
She do it to me, wake me when I scream

God, I'm in love, I'm in love...
Now I lay me down to sleep
Goodnight
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Tonight
If I die before I wake
In your arms, my love can't break away

Darkness (she like a shadow)
Darkness (she all around me)
Nasty hearted dream
Darkness (she got the sexy)
Darkness (she do it to me)
Wake me when I scream
