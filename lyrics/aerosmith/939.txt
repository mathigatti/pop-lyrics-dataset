I got a letter from a friend the other morning
He say it's hot down in Montego Bay
I got the point and now I think it's finally dawning
Yeah, yeah, I got to get away


I got to take myself a permanent vacation
The sky's the limit but my plane won't fly
My nose is clean and lord it don't need no sedation
Yeah, yeah, and that's the reason why

I really need it, really really need St. Tropez
I want a tan where the sun it never shines
I really need it, really really need St. Tropez
You best believe it that I got to get away

I got a sister, man she really got a pinhead
She think she's kinky but she can't get straight
She say she livin' but I kinda think she's brain dead
Just excess baggage on a late night freight

Chorus

I gotta take me on a permanent vacation
The girl's be comin' down in Cayman Brack
I gotta hand it to a firm situation
Yeah, yeah I got to cut me some slack
