The street is cold, the dawn is grey
my heart says no but my head says stay
my work is finished, or so I've been told
can't part the three of us, once we got a hold


I forgot the name
I took a shot on the chin
I'm rearranging my game
tell by the shape I'm in

in line of fire, you know what to say
they gave us no choices, just one shade of grey
my legs keep movin', I don't seem to stray
but I know each step we take, they're one step away

I found the secret, the key to the vault
we walked in darkness, kept hittin' the walls
I took the time, to feel for the door
I found the secret, the key to it all

I got the Nouveauree
and dragged it home to bed
I traded you for me
I took it all and said

I find my own fun, sometimes for free
I got to pay it to come lookin' for me
walkin' on Gucci, wearin' Yves St. Laurent
barely stay on cause I'm so God damn gaunt
