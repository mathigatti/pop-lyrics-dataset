You wonder why you got holes in your shoes
You wonder why they got more money than you
You wonder why you got nothin' to lose
It makes no sense, don't try to figure it out


You gotta - Walk On Down
Walk On Down - Walk On Down
When you're shit outta luck
There's just one thing to do and that's
Walk On Down - Walk On Down - Walk On Down
When you're shit outta luck
There's just one thing to do and that's
Yeah, huh

Well, she says that she loves you
In your mind there's no doubt
You feel like a stranger
When the lights go out
As you lie there awake you think
'This ain't no gift'
Don't try to figure
That weight's to heavy to lift

You gotta - Walk On Down
Walk On Down - Walk On Down
When you're shit outta luck
There's just one thing to do and that's
Walk On Down - Walk On Down
'Cause I got no time to lose
It's my life if I choose
Put on my walking shoes

Walk On Down - Walk On Down - Walk On Down
When you're shit outta luck
There's just one thing to do and that's
Walk On Down - Walk On Down - Walk On Down
When you're shit outta luck
There's just one thing to do and that's
Walk On Down
