Cyberotic head explode
Information overload
And I just can´t take it anymore
And I'm gonna break


Something´s gotta give
Tell me when to turn the screw
Does the noise in my head bother you
Something´s gotta give
Comic books are comin´ true
Does the noise in my head bother you

Digerotic mass appeal
Feels like flesh but tastes unreal
And I'm gonna break

Something´s gotta give
Tell me when to turn the screw
Does the noise in my head bother you
Something´s gotta give
Don´t you like it, Tell me true
Does the noise in my head bother you
Something´s gotta give
Hold your breath ´til you turn blue
Does the noise in my head bother you
Something´s gotta give
Comic books are comin´ true
Does the noise in my head bother you

If love that seemed to fall from grace
Was sitting on your interface
Your megahertz she can´t forgive
Your love died before you ever lived

Something´s gotta give
Tell me when to turn the screw
Does the noise in my head bother you
Something´s gotta give
Don´t you like it, Tell me true
Does the noise in my head bother you
Something´s gotta give
Hold your breath ´til you turn blue
Does the noise in my head bother you
Something´s gotta give
Comic books are comin´ true
Does the noise in my head bother you
