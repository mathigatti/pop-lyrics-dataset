Baby, please stop messin' 'roundin
You'll be messin' around all the time
Baby, please stop messin' around
You'll be messin' around all the time
If you don't stop messin' 'round
You'll be somebody's baby
Instead of mine, yes sir


You rockin' me baby
Till my face is cherry red
You're rockin' so hard
I fall right out of bed

I said,
Baby, please stop messin' 'round
You'll be messin' around all the time
If you don't stop messin' 'round
You'll be somebody's baby
Instead of mine

You rockin' me baby
Till my face is cherry red
You're rockin' so hard
I fall right out of bed

I said,
Baby, please stop messin' 'round
You'll be messin' around all the time
If you don't stop messin' 'round
You'll be somebody's baby
Instead of mine
