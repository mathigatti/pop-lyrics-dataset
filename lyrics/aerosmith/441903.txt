I was walkin' down the street 
When someone called my name
She had spiked heels on her feet
And she was feelin' no pain


Chorus:
Ohhh must be Lizard Love

So I hid behind the newspaper
Turned to page six
She was in her birthday suit
Behind a crucifix
Chorus

She was hangin' big booty
She was puss n' boots way up to here
She's a little bit of heaven, a 24-7
A 10 every day of the year

Now there must be some mistake
I'm feelin' so high strung
She said 'I make love like a snake
I even got a forked tongue'

At first I thought I was dreamin'
That I'd wake up and she'd dissappear
But when I opened up my eyes
She was laughing and a screamin' swinging from the chandlier

You know I never seem to give
Or ever get enough
And I just can't seem to live without
That sweet bodacious stuff
Chorus
