Blood stains the ivories on my daddy's baby grand
Ain't seen the daylight since we started this band


No more No more
No more No more

Store bought clothes fallin' 'part at the seams
Tealeaf readin' gypsies fortune tellin' my dreams

No more No more
No more No more

Holiday Inn lock the door with a chain
You love it and you hate it but to me they're all the same

No more No more
No more No more
No more No more

Baby I'm a dreamer found my horse and carriage

Stalemate jailbait ladies can't refuse
You love 'em then you leave 'em with your sold out reviews

No more No more
No more No more

Sweet talkin' barroom ladies disease
Slippin' with her lips slidin' down your knees

No more No more
No more No more
No more No more

Me and my life a screamer bound to a wife in marriage
Baby I'm a dreamer found my horse and carriage

Ladies hold the aces and their lovers call it passion
The men call it pleasure but to me it's old fashioned
Times they're a changin' nothing ever stands still
If I don't stop a changin' I'll be writtin' my will
It's the same old story never get a second chance
For a dance to the top of the hill

Baby I'm a dreamer found my horse and carriage
