There's a candle burning in the world tonight

For another child who vanished out of sight
And a heart is broken, another prayer in vain
There's a million tears that fill a sea of pain


Sometimes I stare out my window
My thoughts all drift into space
Sometimes I wonder if thereÂ´s a better place

(Tell me)
Where do fallen angels go
I just don't know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling

Now the times in frightening
Can't ignore the facts
There's so many people
Just slippin' through the cracks

So many ashes are scattered
So many rivers run dry
Sometimes your Heaven is Hell
and you don't know why

(So listen)
Where do fallen angels go
I just don't know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling, falling, falling...

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Somewhere out there there's a shining light
And I got to be with you tonight

And with all we're nowhere
We still pay the price
Yeah the Devil seems to get his way
In downtown paradise

Where do fallen angels go
I just don't know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling, falling, falling...

Where do fallen angels go
I just don't know
Where do fallen angels go
They just keep falling, falling, falling...

There's a candle burning...
