Hey smokestack lightning
Can't ya hear me callin'?
Can't ya hear me callin', callin' your name?


Somebody callin my ol' girl
Somebody called ya dad
Somebody called ya mama
'Cause you're daddy's little baby

You're daddy's little ball an' chain
You an I is goin' over there
You an' I is goin' over there
You an' I

well smokestack lightning
Can't ya hear me callin'?
Can't ya hear me callin', callin' your name?
