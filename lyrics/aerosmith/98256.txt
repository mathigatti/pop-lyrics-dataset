Lord I must be dreaming
What else could this be
Everybody's screaming
Running' for the sea


Holy lands are sinking
Birds take to the sky
The prophets are all stinking drunk
I know the reason why

Eyes are full of desire
Mind is so ill at ease
Everything is on fire
Shit piled up to the knees
Out of rhyme or reason
Everyone's to blame
Children of the season
Don't be lame

Sorry, you're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known it
Now he's blown it
Up-side down and hell's the only way
We did an awful job
And now they say it's Nobody's Fault

Old st. Andres
Seven years ago
Shove it up their richters
Red light stop and go
Noble men of courage
Listen with their ears
Spoke but how discouraging
When no one really hears

One of these day's you'll be sorry
Too many houses on stilt
Three milion years or just a story
Four on the floor up to the hilt

(Chorus)
Out of rhyme or reason
Everyone's to blame
Children of the season
Don't be lame
Sorry, you're so sorry
Don't be sorry

Man has known it
Now he's blown it
Up-side down and hell's the only way
We did an awful job
And now we're just a little too late

Eyes are full of desire
Mind is so ill at ease
Everything is on fire
Shit piled up in debris

California showtime
Five o'clock's the news
Everybody's concubine
Was prone to take a snooze

Sorry, you're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known it
Now he's blown it
Up-side down and hell's the only way
We did an awful job
