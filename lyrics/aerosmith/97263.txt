I met a babe in a backseat drive-in
Back in the saddle she'd sit
Pulled on the reins just to keep me risin'
She loved to chomp at the bit


Daddy do it, oh, just do it
Daddy do it, please let me see
Do it, please just do it daddy
Do it, do it, drivin' me crazy

She walks away with her eyes
Down on her bootlace
She lives to give it away
She don't believe in the right or the wrong case
She's always liable to say

Daddy do it, oh, just do it
Daddy do it, please let me see
Do it, please just do it daddy
Do it, do it, drivin' me crazy

(Cheese Cake), looser than her sister
(Cheese Cake), her sugar gets me high
She knows I can't resist her (Cheese Cake)
Got my fingers in her pie (Cheese Cake)
(Cheese Cake), sneakin' out the back door
(Cheese Cake), rollin' down the lawn
Everybody kissed her (Cheese Cake)
At the crack of dawn (Cheese Cake)

Daddy do it, oh, just do it
Daddy do it, please let me see
Daddy do it, please just do it daddy
Do it, do it, do it, drivin' me crazy

(Cheese Cake), looser than her sister
(Cheese Cake), her sugar gets me high
She knows I can't resist her (Cheese Cake)
Got my fingers in her pie (Cheese Cake)
