Toys In The Attic

In the attic, lights
Voices scream, nothing seems
Real's a dream
Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years, voices scream
Nothing seems real's a dream


Toys, toys, toys, in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic
Toys, toys, toys, in the attic, lights

Voices scream, nothing seems
Real's a dream
Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years, voices scream
Nothing seems real's a dream

Toys, toys toys, in the attic
Toys, toys toys, in the attic
Toys, toys toys, in the attic
Toys, toys toys, in the attic
