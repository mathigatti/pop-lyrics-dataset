I'm dreaming tonight, I'm living back home

Right!

Take me back to a south Tallahasse
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
Can´t stand up on my feet in the city
Gotta get back to the real nitty gritty


Yes sir, no sir
Don't come close to my
Home sweet home
Can't catch no dose
Of my hot tail poon tang sweetheart
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer

Home sweet home

Get out in the field
Put the mule in the stable
Ma' she's a cookin'
Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feet in the ghetto

Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing
It ain't no good when the bossman
Stuffin' down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rockin' the street

Home sweet home

Mama, take me home sweet home
I was the last child
I'm just a punk in the street
