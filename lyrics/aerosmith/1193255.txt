I thought
You'd be out of my mind
And I'd finally found a way to
Learn to live without you


I thought
It was just a matter of time
'Till I had a hundred reasons
Not to think about you

Yeah, but it's just not so
After all this time
I still can't let go

I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Drawn upon my soul
Etched upon my memory, babe
And I've got your kiss
Still burning on my lips
Your touch on my fingertips
This love so deep inside of me, babe

I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Yeah, painted on my

I've tried
Everything that I can
To get my heart to forget you
But it just can't seem to

I guess it's just no use
In every part of me
There's a little part of you

I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Drawn upon my soul
Etched upon my memory, babe
And I've got your kiss
Still burning on my lips
Your touch on my fingertips
This love so deep inside of me, babe

I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Painted on my heart
Painted on my
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeahh, something in your eyes keeps haunting... me
And I try to escape you
And I know there's just no way to
No way to chase you from me

I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Drawn upon my soul
Etched upon my memory, babe
And I've got your kiss
Still burning on my lips
Your touch on my fingertips
This love so deep inside of me

I've still got your face
Painted on my heart

Painted on my heart!
Painted on my heart!

Painted on my heart
