Something cool went down
As I was walking with a fried of mine, and I
I still remember
How she was smelling like the summer time, and


Uhhh... How it changed my mind
Changed everything, about that
Come on girl

It feels so good, loving you, yeah
It's so good, the way you do the do
It feels so good, and I need oxygen
Little bit of heaven doin' 24-7 again
Yea, again and again

Like I was sain'
My little cupid was real super freak, by the
Time that I came down
I'll get locked in a room for a week

Uhhh, how she changed my mind
Changed everything, about this
Crazy world

It feels so good, loving you, yea
It's so good, the way you do the do
It feels so good, yea and by the way
Little bit of heaven 24-7 times a day
Yea, again and again
