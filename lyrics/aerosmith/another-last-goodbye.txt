Hey
Give my heart a break
You say it’s you that loves me more
And then you kick and slam your door.
Hey
While you’re on your way
I want to thank you for the ride
And pull the thorn out of my side


You call me your baby.
I kiss away the tears you cried
And then you go and leave me
Pissed off and alone
It’s all about your sweet thing
Or maybe it’s the devil in your eyes
Yeah, what it takes to make this love survive

Another last goodbye
Another last goodbye

You crash and burn
As the pages turned
In your black book full of names
And then you throw your frozen heart
Out in somebody else’s flames
And it’s a low down dirty, dirty shame.
Don’t let this love slip through the cracks
I miss your claw marks on my back

You call me your baby
I kiss away the tears you cried
And then you go and leave me
Pissed off and alone
Yeah, It’s all about your sweet thing
Or maybe it’s the devil in your eyes
Yeah, what it takes to make this love survive

Another last goodbye
(Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah)

I believe I’ve always been in love with you
Though we got caught up in the sway
Never know in where we left
Been off the hook and out of hand
Sometimes I feel that love is a crime
‘Cause I remember, yeah, the very first time

You call me your baby
I kissed away the tears you cried
And then you go and leave me
Pissed off and alone
It’s all about your sweet thing
Or maybe it’s the devil in your eyes
Yeah, what it takes to make this love survive

Another last goodbye (8x)
