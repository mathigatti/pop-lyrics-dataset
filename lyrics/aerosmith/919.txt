What ya gonna do when the angels come
Get movin', yeah movin'
I'm gonna get your kicks from the 911
It's movin', so soothin'


Your passion to be is just looking to feed your own fancy
The blind side of you is a bad dream come true that you can't see

Chorus:
From an angel's eye
Kiss your life goodbye
From an angel's eye
Ain't no place to hide

Tell me what you see through an angel's eye
The halo, on fire
You never really know till it's do or die
Your devil's desire

Your running in place like a rat in a race going nowhere
The evil you speaks from the tongue of a freak so don't gothere

Chorus

What ya gonna do when the angels come
What ya gonna do when ya come undone
I'm gonna get your kicks from the 911
Get movin', get movin'

From an angel's eye
Kiss your life goodbye
From an angel angel angel angel's eye
Ain't no place to hide

From an angel
From an angel
From an angel
