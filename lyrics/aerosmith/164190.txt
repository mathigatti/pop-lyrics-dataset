Yea I think I know
I really hate it when it gets too slow
I gotta try and keep myself amused
I love the way my rocket purrs
I like it best when I see blurs
You gotta love to watch me light my fuse


No more lookin' back to yesterday
I got the thing to blow us both away
All I need is you to navigate
So come and ride my Rocket 88

Call it chump change, I think not
'Cause I got sump'n no one else has got
It's no look like and it ain't no protege
Its nuclear my Rocket 88

Well get down on the darkside of the moon
And leave a little somthin' on the dune
This home by ten is gonna have to wait
'Cause we got a Rocket 88

Light years honey that's how far we'll go
Let's fire it up and watch the rockets glow
Gee suit, g-spot, gee I really must admit
I got my Rocket 88, honey this is it

So no more up against the wall
Just come with me and watch the earth get small
I swear you never will come down at all
So if you like it in your face
I'll rub your nose into outer space
