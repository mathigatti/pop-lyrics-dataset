I've been reading all about you in the sunday times,
I wanna be the punishment to fit your crimes,


Midnite downtown, you're walkin the floor,
you fell into the roses and you dress got tore,
you're hanging with "Ambresia" and you're gonna have a ball,
your monkey's up the river and it's ten feet tall,

It's a long way, gonna dig that hole to china,
Oh won't you blow that wimpy diner,
You're a man of the times Lorretta... yeah...

Your boyfriends in the closet with a girl named jack,
drinkin welfare whiskey, smokin food stamp crack,

You take it every nite till you get your fill,
you never get enough like you say you will,
you're wheelin and you're dealing but you gotta learn to chill,
you got a lot of "nada" so you take another pill,

It's a long way gotta dig that hole to china,
Won't you blow that wimpy diner,
You're a man of the times Lorretta,

It's a long way, gonna ride that train to ruin,
I'm gonna get there me and you and,
You're a man of the times Lorretta,

("Sweet Lorretta you're the men of the time" X2)

And in the morning, yeah, 
The walls of babylon come tumbling down,
and I'm hallucinating madley, 
I'm in the lust of sweet emotion cuz I like it,

(solo)

And in the morning the walls of babylon come tumbling down, 
I'm waiting for my "ex" to see me,
I'm in the lust of sweet explosion cuz I like it, like it, like it,
like it, like it, like it, like it... (scream)

(stop)

It's a long way gonna dig that hole to china,
Oh won't you blow that wimpy diner,
You're a man of the times Lorretta,

It's a long way, gonna ride that train to ruin,
I'm gonna get there me and you and,
You're a man of the times,

Oh the squeeze of the mind,
You're the 2 of a kind,
You were his before mine, 
Sweet Lorretta...

("Sweet Lorretta you're the men of the time" X6)
