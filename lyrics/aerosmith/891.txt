(Yeah, yeahh!)

If I could change the world
Like a fairy tale
I would drink the love
From your Holy Grail


Yeah, I would start with love
'N tell ol' Beelzebub
To get outta town
A-'cause you just lost your job!

How did we get so affected?
'Cause I think love
Is love reflected

Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise your drinkin' glass
Here's to yesterday!

In time
We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss heaven off
We got hell to pay

Come full circle

(And if) There's a spell on you
I could take away
I would do the deed

Yeah, and by the way
Here's to heaven knows
As the circle goes

It ain't right!
I'm uptight!
Yeah, and get on my toes!

I used to think that every little thing I did was crazy
But now I think the Karma cops are comin' after you

Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise your drinkin' glass
Here's to yesterday!

In time
We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss heaven off
We got hell to pay

Come full circle

Every time you get yourself caught up inside of someone else's crazy dream
Own it, yeah, that's a mistake

Everybody's gotta lot o' nada killin' them
Instead o' killin' time

Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise your drinkin' glass
Here's to yesterday!

In time
We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss heaven off
We got hell to pay

Time
Don't let it slip away
Raise your drinkin' glass
Here's to yesterday!

In time
We're all gonna trip away
Don't piss heaven off
We got hell to pay

Come full circle
