I got a wild thing for you
Were talking hoops you got me jumping through
You got those lemon drop martini eyes
And if my karma suits youd cross the line into another place and time


Tell me how pretty she is when she turns the colors of the rainbow
One more day with you Trip Hoppin'
One more night with you no stoppin'
Ain't no smoking fantasy 'cause loving you is trippin' to me

You got me cycled in size? you got my situation bonified
It took a sunset to get me to see
That I all really needed was your love to yeah forever shine onme
You promised promised you and me is like waiting for your ectasy

That one more day with you Trip Hoppin'
One more night with you no stoppin'
Get my way with you Trip Hoppin'
In my kaliediscope i'm looking thru my only color was a neonblue
I was hanging on to yesterday and now the only way i get thru
I'll be on my rainbow is my laying down your end of pillow

One more day with you Trip Hoppin'
One more night with you no stoppin'
Ain't no smoking fantasy cause loving you is trippin' to me
One more day with you Trip Hoppin'
One more night with you no stoppin'
Get my way with you Trip Hoppin'
One more day with you Trip Hoppin'
