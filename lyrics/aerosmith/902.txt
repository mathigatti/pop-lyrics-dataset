Met a woman, she had a man
couldn't help it, I had a plan
right around midnight he was gone
saw her red light, she left it on


and oh my heart's done time
and oh now she's mine

if there's a reason for these chains
it's like we suffer to ease the pain
now I got this feelin inside of me
my heart's in jail and I can't break free

and oh my heart's done time
and oh now she's mine
now she's mine
now she's mine
now she's mine
now she's mine

and oh my heart's done time
and oh now she's mine
now she's mine
now she's mine
now she's mine
