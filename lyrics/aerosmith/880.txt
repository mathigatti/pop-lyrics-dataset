Ch' dum dum dum, honey what have you done
Ch' dum dum dum, it's the sound of my gun
Ch' dum dum dum, honey what have you done
Ch' dum dum dum, it's the sound, it's the sound


Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Whole world's come undone
Lookin' straight at the sun

What did her daddy do
What did he put you through
They say when janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But man he had it comin'
Now that janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Dog days just begun
Now everybody is on the run

Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain

Run away, run away from the pain
Run away, run away from the pain
Run away, run away
Run, run away

Janie got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Dog days just begun
Now everybody is on the run

What did her daddy do
It's janie's last i-o-u
She had to take him down easy
And put a bullet in his brain
She said 'cause nobody believes me
The man was such a sleaze
He ain't never gonna be the same

Run away, run away from the pain
Run away, run away from the pain
Run away, run away
Run, run away

Janie's got a gun
Janie got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Everybody is on the run

Janie got a gun
Dog days just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Janie got a gun

Janie got a gun
Dog days just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Janie got a gun
