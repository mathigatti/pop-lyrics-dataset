Well, I'm ready, ready as anybody can be
I am ready, as ready as anybody can be
I'm ready for you
I hope you ready for me


Got an out of town pistol with the graveyard frame
It shoots tombstone bullets wit da ball and chain
I'm drinkin' TNT and smokin' dynamite
I hope some schoolboy pick a fight
'Cause I'm ready, ready as anybody can be
Well, I'm ready for you, I hope you ready for me

Now listen

All you pretty little chicks with'chor curly hair
Know you feel like I ain't nowhere
But stop what'chor doin' honey, come over here
I'll prove it to ya baby that I ain't no square
'Cause I'm ready, ready as anybody can be
Now I'm ready for you, I hope you ready for me

Look out
Look out

Well I been drinkin' gin like never before
I'm feelin' so good, honey that's for sure
One more drink, honey I wish you would
Take a whole lotta lovin' to make me feel good
'Cause I'm ready, ready as anybody can be
Well, I'm ready for you, I hope you ready for
A ready for
A ready for

Well I'm ready for

Oh baby
You know I'm ready for you
