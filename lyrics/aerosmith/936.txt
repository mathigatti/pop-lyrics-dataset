If you think that you're strong
Wanna fight well come on
And line up, line up
When the going gets tough
And your talk ain't enough
Line up, line up


We gotta get up, get out, before they get us down
'Coz livin up against the wall
Has got us locked up
Come on and line up, line up
So don't be surprised when they pull the wool over your eyes
You don't get funked up

If you gots all the stuff
And you can't get enough
Then line up, line up
If you're out on a limb
And you wanna come in
Then line up, line up

You're head's down, sittin' round
Pick your face up off the ground
And get yo self together baby
And learn to st-and tough
Come on and line up, line up

We better get to it instead of just standing around
It's time to get down

If you're playing to win
And you're only way in
Is line up, line up

If we all wanna live
Then we all gotta give
Line up, line up

We gotta get up, get out before they get us down
Cause livin' up against the wall
Has got us locked up
Come on and line up, line up

You better get to it instead of just standin' around
Yeah, it's time to get down

If you got all the stuff
And you can't get enough
Line up, line up
Line up, line up
If you think that you're strong
Wanna fight then come on
Line up, line up
Line up, line up

You gotta get yourself together
You gotta stand up and be counted
You gotta love, you gotta love, you gotta love, you gotta love
Uh
