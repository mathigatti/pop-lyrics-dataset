I was dancing down the sidewalk
Just some slam dunk 
That you might jive
And I wondered then 
About his old girlfriend
Was she still around - still alive


It's been years 
Since my gears have been turning
Since I asked her same dice dance
How the flames of my poor heart been burning
If it's hate then this must be romance

(Chorus)
Head first, baby
How the good time feelin' lingers
Oh, you can be alright 
On the wrong side of the street
I'm so hungry for love
I've been lickin' off all my fingers
Oh yeah, you got to learn to 
Take the bitter with the sweet

Yeah, I feel just like getting in trouble
By the hair on her chinny-chin-chin
And I love to get down on the stubble
With my teeth it will taste like your grin
