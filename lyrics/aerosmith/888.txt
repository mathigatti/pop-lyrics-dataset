You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad


You think you're in love
Like it's a real sure thing
But every time you fall
You get your ass in a sling
You used to be strong
But now it's, "Ooh, baby, please"
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees

You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad

We was making love when you told me that you loved me
I thought ol' cupid he was taking aim
I was believer when you told me that you loved me
And then you called me someone else's name

There ain't gonna be no more beggin' you, please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone
And your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees

You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad

Chip off the old block
Man you're so much like your sister
My fantasize it must be out of luck
My old libido has been blowing a transistor
I feel like I have been hit by a fuck

Yeah

I'm jonesin' on love
Yeah I got the dt's
You say that we will
But there ain't no guarantees

I'm major in love
But in all minor keys
Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees

What are you looking for
It's got to be hard core
Must be some kind of nouveau riche

Is this your only chance
Or some hypnotic trance
Let's get you on a tighter leash

Own it own it own it

You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad

You ain't that good
Is what you said down to the letter
But you like the way I hold the microphone
Sometimes I'm good but when I'm bad
I'm even better
Don't give me no lip
I've got enough of my own

There ain't gonna be no more beggin' you please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone
And your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees

I'm jonesin' on love
Yeah I got the dt's
You say that we will yeah
But there ain't no guarantees
I'm major in love
But in all minor keys
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
