Major!

Major Barbra
Sits in the fields
And waits for her crops to grow
She sits in a chair
That she made outa wood
So many many years ago


Major why won't they grow?
You've given them water and hope?
Major why won't they grow?

She waits all day
And she hopes through the night
For a new day that might show
A bright yellow sun
That will make the crops come
And let the old days go

Major why won't they grow?
You've given them water and hope?
Major why won't they grow? Ohh

And your fields will look after you

Yes they do!

Major
