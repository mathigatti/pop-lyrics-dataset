Blues hearted lady sleepy was she
Love for the devil brought her to me
Seas of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of Wither holdin me in


Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you
Ooh woe is me I feel so sadly for you

In time bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail

Fireflies dance in the heat of
Hound dogs that bay at the moon
My ship leaves in the midnight
Can't say I'll be back too soon
They awaken far far away
Heat of my candle show me the way
Seas of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of Wither holdin me in

Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you
Ooh woe is me I feel so sadly for you

In time bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail
