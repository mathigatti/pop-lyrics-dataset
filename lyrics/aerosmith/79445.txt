Mary Mac, dressed in black
Silver buttons up and down her crack
I know, 'cause I love her so
She-a broke a needle
Now she can't sew


Walkin' the dog
I'm just a walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog

Ask your mama for fifteen cents
To see the elephant jump the fence
It jumped so high it touched the sky
Didn't come back 'til fourth July

Walkin' the dog
I'm just a walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog

Mary Mary quite contrary
How does your garden grow
Well well silver bells and little bitty bitty white shells
Pretty maids all in a row

Walkin' your dog
I'm just a walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog, yeah

Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
