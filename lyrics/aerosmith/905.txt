John was bad he gave it everything he had
John he prayed for all the people ever made
John was cool he never did no afterschool


late at night when he praised the lord
he laid his hand down upon the sword

lay down upon the sword
lay down upon the sword
lay down upon the sword
lay down your bloody sword

John St. John be cool
tell the people they'll follow you
John St. John be cool
tell the people they'll follow you

late at night when he praised the lord
he lay his hands down upon the bloody sword
laid down upon the sword, down, down upon the sword
laid down upon the sword, getting down upon the sword
laid down upon the sword, laid it down upon the sword
laid down upon the sword, "late night tv roared"
