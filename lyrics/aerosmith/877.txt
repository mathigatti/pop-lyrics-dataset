I love to look into your big brown eyes
They talk to me and seem to hypnotize
You say the things nobody dares to say
And I'm not about to let you fly away


My lover with no jet lag
Stayin' up all night in the sleepin' bag
You got a heart-beatin' rhythm from the subterrain
I really love you, little girl, I don't need to explain

I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl
Like a double shot of lovin' so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child, girl
'Cause you and me is two of a kind

Like deja vu I feel like I've been here
Or somewhere else but you've been always near
It's you that's in my dreams I'm beggin' for
But I woke up when someone slammed the door

So hard I fell out of bed
Screamin' mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread
And the moral of the story, I can testify
I get stoned on you girl, that's the best reason why

I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl
Like a double shot of lovin' so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child, girl
'Cause you and me is two of a kind

I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl
Like a double shot of lovin' so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child, girl
'Cause you and me is two of a kind

I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl
Like a double shot of lovin' so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child, girl
'Cause you and me is two of a kind

I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl
Like a double shot of lovin' so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child, girl
'Cause you and me is two of a kind
