There is nothing wrong your perception of the reality
Do not attempt to adjust the illusion
We control the harmonics
We control your emotions
We will move you to the left
We will move you to the right
We can reduce the volume to a whisper
Or increase it to a deafening roar
Now is the time to submit quietly
We control all you hear and feel
You are about to enter a great adventure
And experience the odd and mystery
From your ultimate fantasies, to your deepest fears
From which you may never return


Hello-Hello-Hello
Come on, come on, come over
Hello-Hello-Hello
Until the storm blows over

Love three times a day
Love your life away
Love three times a day
And get yourself back into the jam

Love three times a day
There ain’t no other way
It’s in your DNA
Let everybody know who you are

Good bye-Good bye-Good bye
Nice of you to stop over
Good bye-Good bye-Good bye
Before you do, rollover

Love three times a day
Lock yourself away
Hate is so passe
And get yourself back into the jam

Love three times a day
No naivete
It’s in your DNA
And tell them that you came with the band

It's the same old same old, puddin in the tain
If you really need a lover honey
Call my name

You can lose your mind, lookin for a pearl
Like lookin for a diamond in a rhinestone world

There's one kinda lover that's a just my style
That's a downtown baby with an uptown smile

Top hat glovers kissin' lipstick girls
Kissin' high heel lovers with the cinnamon swirls

Love three times a day
Lock yourself away
Love three times a day
And get yourself back into the jam

Love three times a day
Ain’t no other way
And then a matinee
It's time that you be taking a stand

There's no other lover
In the whole wide world
That could love me like a lover yeah
But this kinda girl

Had a way that she loved that nobody else could
In a way that she could love that everybody understood

Butta too bad for you when you ain't got no

When you be getting out of jail
We're gonna all have fun

Where's you game face baby don't cha look so sad
I'm the best damn lover that you ever had
Love three times a day

I'm a ca-ching lover, I'm the cat's meow
I ain't never gonna stop, not never no how
It's like you done a lotta livin' in too few years
You don't wanna get drown in somebody else's tears
Love three times a day

Hot monkey sex on a hot tin roof
You be higher than a shot of a million proof

It's the same old same old, puddin in the tain
If you really need a lover honey
Call my name
