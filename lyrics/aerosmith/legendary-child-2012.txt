Making love at 17, yeah we had the luck
But we traded 'em toys for other joys
And we didn’t give a... (whoah oh oh)

I took a chance at the high school dance
Never knowing wrong from right
And that same show 40 years ago
Being televised tonight

'Cause journey from inside my head to the Taj Mahal
I went from never having none to want to have it all

And eat that honey from the hive
With all the noise and all the clamour
No surprise, you know I am a

I never wondered why she tried to drive us quite insane

And how we got that golden fleece
