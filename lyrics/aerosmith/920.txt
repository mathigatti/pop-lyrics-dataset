I had a friend who spoke of fate and he knew of another place inspace n' time
He told of how me and my lady
Could look but we would never find


He said if you please i beg your pardon
Sometimes the things you see they just ain't so
Your life can be an avant garden
'cause love's what makes your garden grow

The sun leads the way
The moon lights the sky
I see you and i
Lyin' in my avant garden

I dream of the day
When our worlds collide
We won't be denied
Here inside our avant garden

Sometimes my life ain't what it's seemin'
Right from the start
It's what your heart's believin'
Could always just be lucid dreamin'
But dreams just ain't enough for me

The sun leads the way
The moon lights the sky
I see you and i
Lyin' in my avant garden

I dream of the day
When our worlds collide
We won't be denied
Here inside our avant garden

Oo oo oo oo
You know it just ain't right
Oo oo oo oo
To deal with other's shite
Oo oo oo oo
No one should ever be
Oo oo oo oo
So broken hearted
Aaah
Don't never be afraid
Aaah
'cause when you've got it made
Aaah
Yeah you don't even have to try
Yeah

So i'll be waitin' in your garden
Watchin' all your flowers grow

The sun leads the way
The moon lights the sky
I see you and i
Lyin' in my avant garden

I dream of the day
When our worlds collide
You'll know we arrived
Here inside our avant garden
Yeah yeah yeah-ah

The sun brings the rain
The moon needs the sky
I see you and i
Lyin' in my avant garden

Beware of the lies
A word to the wise
There's sweet cherry pies
And truth inside our avant garden
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
