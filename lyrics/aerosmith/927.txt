Ahh-yeah

(She tied me up with a rope!)

Behind the walls of my temptation
That's when it all began
She tied me up with my frustration
And snapped my rubber band, ah


I remember a sweet patchouli
She absolutely adore
It's all about with who your hangin'
And she gave me too much rope

She's the queen of my delusion
She my zen from way back when
And the cause of my confusion
Is the face without a name

She lived on lucky charms and coffee
And crackerjack surprise
She had me all reborn and then
She killed me with her eyes

She's the queen of my delusion
She my zen from way back when
And the cause of my confusion
Is the face without a name

Tryin' an get little bit
There's nothing wrong with it
If no one see's ya

What ya gonna say
When I don't know her name
I'll blame it on the damned amnesia

Forgotten love's no doubt a waste
What's in a name without a face?

Ahh-yeahh

We did a little nip and tuck then
She whispered to my brain
I asked her if somethin' n' she said: lets fuck
Then I forgot her name

She's the queen of my delusion
She my zen from way back when
And the cause of my confusion
Yeah, I've come to that conclusion

(If she comes to me at all)

And the cause of my confusion
Is the face without a name
