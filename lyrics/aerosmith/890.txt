God I love the sweet taste of India
Lingers on the tip of my tongue
Gotta love the sweet taste of India
Blame it on the beat of the drum


God I love the sweet taste of India
Lingers on the tip of my tongue
Gotta know that´s what´s gotten into ya
Any cat man do when it´s done...

Oh yeah she´s got that kind of love incense
That lives in her back room
And when it mixes with the funk, my friend
It turns into perfume

When you are born you´re afraid of the darkness
And then you´re afraid of the light
But I'm not afraid when I dance with my shadow

This time I'm gonna get it right
To think of what I´ll get tonight

Just lookin´ for a little taste, a taste of India
She´ll steal the smile right out of your face

Her yin and yang, Is just the thing
She´s unpredictable my friend

God I love the sweet taste of India
Lingers on the tip of my tongue
Gotta know that´s what´s gotten into ya
Any cat man do when it´s done...

It´s like the first taste love of vindaloo
That sets your heart on fire
And if you let her stuff get into you
It will be all that you desire

When you make love to the sweet tantric priestress
Drinkin´ in the bliss of delight
But I'm not afraid when I dance with her shadow

The time I'm gonna get it right
She´s gonna whet my appetite
Just lookin´ for a little taste, taste of India
She´ll steal the smile right out of your face

She a friend of mine, She a concubine
The sweetest wine, I gotta make her mine

God I love the sweet taste of India
Lingers on the tip of my tongue
Gotta love the sweet taste of India
Blame it on the beat of the drum

God I love that sweet taste of India
Lingers on the tip of my tongue
Gotta know that what´s gotten into ya
Any cat man do when ot´s do

Just think of what I´ll get tonight
She´s gonna whet my appetite
Just Just lookin´ for a little taste, taste of India
She´ll steal the smile right out of your face
