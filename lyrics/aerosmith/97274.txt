Do you like good boogie
Like the real boogie woogie
Hear the juke box singin'
Get the dance hall swingin'
Won't you grab my shaker
Got to meet your maker


Get out the lead
Get out of bed
Get The Lead Out

(Get ready), I'll show you my fist
(Get ready), take hold of my wrist
(Get ready), we really can't miss
(Get ready)

Hey good lookin'
What cha got there cookin'
You a young spring chicken
Make your feet start kickin'

no no, no no, no no, no no

Oh, hey good lookin'
What cha got there cookin'
You a young spring chicken
Make your feet start kickin'
