I think about those better days
I didn't know these evil ways
Love and hate and jealousy
Came and got the best of me


Late at night I lie in bed
And fight the fight inside my head
I think it's time to put it down
Get myself back on the ground

Oh, no
Oh, no
This ain't what I came here for

I'm goin' up on the mountain
Up on the hill
Lay down by the river
Let the water be still

I'll open my eyes
And see what I see
I got to find out what is you
And what is me

I used to know how to feel
Somethin' tells me this ain't real
On the phone ain't nothin' said
It's off the hook the line is dead

Things you want and things you need
I ain't got and ain't guaranteed
I'm breakin' loose it's building up
And I can't leave here soon enough

Oh, no
Oh, no
This ain't what I came here for

I'm goin' up on the mountain
Up on the hill
Lay down by the river
Let the water be still

I'll open my eyes
And see what I see
I got to find out what is you
And what is me

Oh, no (oh, no!)
Oh, no (oh, no!)
This ain't what I came here for

I'm goin' up on the mountain
Up on the hill
Lay down by the river
Let the water be still

I'll open my eyes
And see what I see
I got to find out what is you
And what is me
