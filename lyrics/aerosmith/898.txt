This girl that I knew
She loved me and blew me away
We made love, no doubt
But she never went out of her way


I keep wonderin´, I keep wonderin´ why
Do the wings of your butterfly
Lightnin´ thunder
I keep wonderin´ why

Hey I think you need an attitude adjustment
Knock-down drag out
I got to make myself a latitude adjustment
With or without

I was rather naive
So I didn´t believe when you said
Our love is in jail
Honey you hit the nail on the head

Well, I keep wonderin´, I keep wonderin´ why
Do the wings of your butterfly
Lightnin´ thunder
Ain't no wonderin´ why

Hey I think you need an attitude adjustment
Knock-down drag out
Don´t you ever baby, wonder where the lust went
With or without

Now I know what it is
Cause I know what you are
No more cryin´ eyes my friend
Excuse fuckin´ moi

No more wonderin´
I got news for you

Hey I think you need an attitude adjustment
Knock-down drag out
I got to make myself a latitude adjustment
I'm headin´ south

Yeah I think you need an attitude adjustment
From inside out
