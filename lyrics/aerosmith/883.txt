Rag doll, living in a movie
Hot tramp, Daddy's little cutie
So fine, they'll never see ya
Leavin' by the back door, man


Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby won't you do me
Like you done before

I'm feelin' like a bad boy
MMM Just like a bad boy
I'm rippin' up a rag doll
Like throwin' away an old toy
Some babe's talkin' real loud
Talkin' all about the new crowd
Try and sell me an old dream
A new version of the old scene
Speak easy on the grape vine
Keep shufflin' the shoe shine
Old tin lizzy
Do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery

Rag doll, living in a movie
Hot tramp, Daddy's little cutie
So fine, they'll never see ya
Leavin' by the back door, man

Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby won't you do me
Like you done before

Yes, I'm movin', Yes, I'm movin'
Get ready for the big time
Tap dancing on a land mine
Yes, I'm movin', Yes, I'm movin'

Sloe gin fizzy
Do it till you're dizzy
Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery

Rag doll, living in a movie
Hot tramp, Daddy's little cutie
So fine, they'll never see ya
Leavin' by the back door, man

Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby won't you do me
Like you done before

Yes, I'm movin', Yes, I'm movin'
Get ready for the big time
Get crazy on the moonshine
Yes, I'm movin', I'm really movin'

Sloe gin fizzy
Do it till you're dizzy
Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery

Rag doll, living in a movie
Hot tramp, Daddy's little cutie
So fine, they'll never see ya
Leavin' by the back door, man

Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby won't you do me
Like you done before

Rag doll, living in a movie
Hot tramp, Daddy's little cutie
So fine, they'll never see ya
Leavin' by the back door, man

Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby won't you do me
Like you done before
