You tellin' lies thinkin' I can't see
You can't cry, 'cause you're laughing at me


(Chorus)
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down

Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens every day

(Chorus)

We're all alone and there's nobody else
You still moan 'keep your hands to yourself'
