You hear them people talkin'
About the Man above
There's too much talkin' trash
And not enough love


Now, I believe in rainbows
I gotta make it clear
That I told everyone you know
That you were my idea

You're the love of my life and a keeper
Head over heels and a we're fallin' deeper
I got a feeling it's time and so maybe
I got that something in mind so babe

Take me to your sunny side of love
That's right where we belong
Take me to your sunny side of love

You're one of a kind girl
And I just can't get enough
A needle in a haystack
A diamond in the rough

Your perfect imperfections
You know you got that right
It's all that lovin' all day long
Keeps me up all night

No doubt about it she rhymes for no reason
We're talkin' love yeah the kind you know she's in
You want a kiss and you know that you ought to
Yeah, you can't miss and you know you've got to

Take me to your sunny side of love
That's right where we belong
Take me to your sunny side of love
You know that it won't take long

Take me to your sunny side of love

You're the love of my life and a keeper
Head over heels and a we're fallin' deeper
I got a feeling it's time and so maybe
I got that something in mind so babe

Take me to your sunny side of love
That's right where we belong
Take me to your sunny side of love
You know that it won't take long

Take me to your sunny side of love
Yeahh!

Take me to your sunny side of love
