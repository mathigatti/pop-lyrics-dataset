Workin' like a dog
For the boss man (whoa)
Workin' for the company (whoa, yeah)
Bettin' on the dice
I'm tossin' (whoa)
I'm gonna have a fantasy (whoa, yeah)


Where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an open book
To read between the lines

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm going down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground

Shakin' in the elevator (whoa)
Lingerie second floor (whoa, yeah)
She said can I see you later (whoa)
And love you just a little more (whoa, yeah)

I kinda hope we get stuck
Nobody gets out alive
She said "I'll show you how to
Fax in the mailroom honey
And have you home by five"

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm going down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
In the air, in the air
Honey one more time now it ain't fair

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm going down

(Love in an)
Elevato-o-o-o-o-o-or
Going down

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm going down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I hit the ground

Gonna be a penthouse pauper (whoa)
Gonna be a millionaire (whoa, yeah)
Gonna be a real fast talker (whoa)
And have me a love affair (whoa, yeah)

Gotta get my timing right
It's a test that I got to pass
I'll chase you all the way
To the stairway honey
Kiss your sassafrass

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm going down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I hit the ground
In the air, in the air
Honey one more time now it ain't fair
