Yeah...

I just have to read the paper,
Its from change up on the news,
If your single, feel the fever in my pants,


We just sits n' talkin trash 'bout whats going on,
Or you can have a conversation that never seem to stop,

You wanna get hi, but you cant get stoned,
You wanna have sex, you got to do it alone,
Ya live is big bussines,
Like catch it moncler,
All you want in your chamber,
Is a class of buleee,

Trouble, it's everywhere you look,
Trouble, it's got everybody shook,
Trouble, if it wasn't for trouble,
I wouldn't be nothing at all...

All this rules of regulations,
You can stik them up your ass, please,
Don't belive a word i could relate to,

I need to have some private move,
Before i serve the beer,
But the the mover has its way and its too late to,

Oh we cure an outgoing,
And the food can relate,
To steak an streek,
To streek and streak,
This current situation,
Got me wrapped up so tight,
I'd rather pull them wrong,
Big brother your right,

Trouble, it's everywhere you look,
Trouble, steals you like a crow,
Trouble, if it wasn't for trouble,
I wouldn't have nothing at all... Mary,
