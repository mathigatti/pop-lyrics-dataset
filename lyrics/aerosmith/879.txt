(Yeah!)

Well, I woke up this morning
On the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin'
About all those things you said


About ordinary people
And how they make you sick
And if callin' names kicks back on you
Then I hope this does the trick

'Cause I'm a sick of your complainin'
About how many bills
And I'm sick of all your bitchin'
'Bout your poodles and your pills

And I just can't see no humour
About your way of life
And I think I can do more for you
With this here fork and knife

Eat the rich!
There's only one thing they are good for
Eat the rich!
N' take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich!
I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich!
N' take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh huh

So I called up my head shrinker
And I told him what I'd done
Said you'd best go on a diet
Yeah, I hope you have some fun

And a don't go burst a bubble
On the rich folks who get rude
No won't, you won't get in no trouble
When you eats that kinda food

Now they're smokin' up their junk bonds
And then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club
With muff and uncle biff

But there's one good thing that happens
When you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes they may taste like shit
But go real good with wine

Eat the rich!
There's only one thing they are good for
Eat the rich!
N' take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich!
I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich!
N' take one bite now, spit out the rest

Believe in all the good things
That money just can't buy
Then you won't get no bellyache
From eatin' humble pie

I believe in rags to riches
Your inheritence won't last
So take your grey poupon, my friend
And shove it up your ass!

Eat the rich!
There's only one thing they are good for
Eat the rich!
N' take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich!
I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich!
N' take one bite now, spit out the rest

Eat the rich!
There's only one thing they are good for
Eat the rich!
N' take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich!
N' don't stop me now I'm goin' crazy
Eat the rich!
That's my idea of a good time, baby
