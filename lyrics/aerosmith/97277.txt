When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the side
Wher I stop and I go for a ride
'Til I get to the bottom
Where I see you again


Do you, don't you
Want me to love you
I'm comin' down fast
But I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover
But you ain't no dancer

Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter

Will you, won't you
Want me to make you
I'm coming down fast
But don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover
But you ain't no dancer

Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter

When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the side
Wher I stop and I go for a ride
'Til I get to the bottom
Where I see you again

Do you, don't you
Want me to love you
I'm comin' down fast
But I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover
But you ain't no dancer

Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter
