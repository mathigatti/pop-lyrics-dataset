I think it’s time to realize it’s done
I guess I have to accept it
I was never the one
Yeah, it was so good
I thought I fell into someone else’s dream
Yeah, but I let it be mine, thought you let it be yours
No nothin’s ever what it seems
I thought I felt it all around
But now it’s lying there on the ground
Why was it there for me, but not for you?


Tell me
Tell me
Because it´s been so long
Now I’m sitting here
And you’re so far gone

I’m staring down at the page in a magazine
I looked up at the TV, but it’s just an empty screen
When we were together, I thought it was ecstasy
Oh I can tell the sun’s still shining
But shadows are all I can see
And everywhere I go
I never see a face I know
What could I say that could make you come back this way

Tell me
Tell me
Because it´s been so long
Now I’m sitting here
And you’re so far gone

Now I know I should have known
And I see I could have seen
You got a restless soul
Need to know and want to find out
If your fields are still green... Whoaaaaa


Now I hope that what I hope for
Could somehow be true
Why is it such a long long way to you?

Tell me
Tell me
Because it´s been so long
Now I’m sitting here
And you’re so far gone.
