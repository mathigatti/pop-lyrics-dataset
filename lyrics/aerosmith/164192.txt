It's deep insignus 
That knows me well
It's all around me
My mind can tell


And all the children
They know my name
They scream forever
I know the pain

Oh, feel the pain
Oh, feel the pain
Oh, feel the pain
Oh, feel the pain

It's a sleep insignus
That knows me well
She's got the fever
She's hot as hell

And all the children
They know my name
When night is coming
They'll scream in pain

Oh, scream in pain
Oh, scream in pain
Oh, scream in pain
Oh, scream in pain
