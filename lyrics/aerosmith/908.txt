I sold my soul for a one night stand
I followed Alice into Wonderland
I ate the mushroom and I danced with the queen
Yeah we danced in between all the lines


I followed daylight right into the dark
Took to the hatter like a walk in the park
But then I met her, yeah, she felt so right
No child of the night, yeah, was she

They call her Sunshine
The kind that everybody knows (yeah yeah)
Sunshine
She's finer than a painted rose (yeah yeah)
Sunshine, yeah

Her kinda love's what I adore
What kind of trouble am I in for
My kind of Heaven lies at Hell's back door
And I got more than I need

'Cause I need Sunshine
The kind that everybody knows (yeah yeah)
My Sunshine
She's finer than a painted rose (yeah yeah)
Sunshine, yeah

I got the karma but it don't come free
I chased that rabbit up the old oak tree
The caterpillar's tryin' to cop a plea
But the smoke ain't got nothin' on me (yeah)

Ya gotta have my Sunshine
The kinda that everybody knows (yeah yeah)
my Sunshine,
She finer than a painted rose (yeah yeah)

she's Sunshine
The kind that everybody knows (yeah yeah)
Sunshine
She's finer than a painted rose (yeah yeah)
Sunshine
Sunshine, yeah
