Ah, don't you know that she loves you a lot?
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got?
I even know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know that she loves you a lot?
Ah, don't you know that she loves you a lot?
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got?
I even know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know, don't you?


Ah, there's a chill in the summertime air
You get a thrill from the smell of her hair
You get a high from the taste of her wits
It's certified, but, but, but you ain't getting there yet
Still can't forgive, but baby, cut me some slack
Still got a feel you ain't never coming back
You don't want the karma, but you won't commit
You'll be spanking your monkey when she's all up in your shit

Ah, don't you know that she loves you a lot?
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got?
I even know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know that she loves you a lot?
Ah, don't you know that she loves you a lot?
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got?
I even know that she loves you a lot
I know you do 'cause I told you

Is that your girl in a lily white dress?
How come she's so fucking passive-agress
I hear you say with your adorable tongue
And that you just don't care how especially, yeah
While the night is still young
Still you raise your imagination
Do that ration, generation, single patience
Contamination, suffocation

Ah, don't you know that she loves you a lot?
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got?
I even know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know that she's hot?
Ah, don't you know that she loves you a lot?
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got?
Ah, don't you know that she loves you a lot?
I even know that she loves you a lot
I know you do because

Ah, don't you know that she loves you a lot?
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got?
I even know that she loves you a lot
Why don't you know, don't you know that she's hot?
Ah, don't you know that she loves you a lot?
Why don't you know, don't you know what you got?
I even know that she loves you a lot
Ah, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know what you got?
