It's the dawn of the day and I'm crashed and I'm smashed
As it is I'm feelin' like my chips are cashed
All of my clothes strewn all over the room
The crisis at hand is I'm all out of zoom


chorus: I got the sunlight blues
I can't find my shoes
The only thing on TV
Is the Good Morning News

The tricks of the night
Keepin' me in a daze
Open a bottle and I'll pull down the shades
Glance in the mirror
Back into bed
Forget that it's day, time to party again

chorus
Bright Light Fright, Bright Light Fright, Bright Light Fright, gimme the knife (Give me the night?)
Bright Light Fright, Bright Light Fright, Bright Light Fright, gimme the knife(Give me the night?)

chorus (repeat and fade)
