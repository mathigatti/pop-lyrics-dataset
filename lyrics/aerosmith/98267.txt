Somebody tryin' to take my soul
Nobody gotta hear my rock n' roll


Shame, shame, shame on you babe
Shame, shame, shame on you babe

No leader, steady as a ghost
Tooth sweeter, powdering her nose

Shame, shame, shame on you babe
Shame, shame, shame on you babe

A-smith, old hank pank
Pulling down your knickers
Ah, who you gonna spank

Shame, shame, shame on you babe
Shame, shame, shame on you babe

Joe Perry, Oh, Mr Style
Some kind of killer bee
Buzz a while

Shame, shame, shame on you babe
Shame, shame, shame, shame on you babe

Shame, shame, shame on you babe
Shame, shame, shame on you babe

Bogus honey, square dance close
Grab your partner, bring it home 'n dosey, dosey

Shame, shame, shame on you babe
Shame, shame, shame on you baby

Seemin' jazzy bein' shipped in
Wilds of the Stanley
Try to given' in

Shame, shame, shame on you babe
Shame, shame, shame on you baby

Seven or eleven
Go to roll the dice
Am I in heaven
Or am I in Miami Vice

Shame, shame, shame on you babe
Shame, shame, shame on you baby
