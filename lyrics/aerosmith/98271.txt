You keep knockin' but you can't come in
The way you love I adore
You always come never know where you been
But a-now I'm here baby to even the score


You're up, you're down
You're always running in place
Triathlon if you please
You're always beggin' me for a taste
But I ain't up to snuff if you sneeze

Yak yak yak

Lord you give me the bends
Heads and tails
You're all out of love
Like The Reason A Dog
Has so many friends
He wags his tail instead of his tounge
Your older sister
She's a lot like you
She likes to grab my mircophone
Now there ain't too much she won't do
Especially when we're all alone

You're up, you're down
You're always runnin' in place
Triathlon if you please
Her mind's on rewind and erase
You might get shot, babe
When you're shootin' the breeze

Yak yak yak

Lord you give me bends
You're heads and tails
Are calling for love

Like The Reason A Dog
Has so many friends
He wags his tail instead of his tounge
(Repeat)

Your older sister
She's a lot like you
And there ain't too much she won't do

There's always something
That you got to say
I lose my mind and then I surely fade away, yeah

Yak yak yak

Lord you give me the bends
You're heads and tails
Now look what you done

Like The Reason A Dog
Has so many friends
He wags his tail instead of his tounge
