Eeeyeaaha!

Get yourself cooler
Lay yourself low
Coincidental murder
With nothing to show


With the judge constipation
Will go to his head
And his wife's aggravation
You're soon enough dead

It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend

Gotcha with the cocaine
They found with your gun
No smoothy face lawyer
To getcha undone

Say love ain't the same
On the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't
Gonna find it around

It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old story
Same old song and dance!

Fate comes a-knockin'
Doors start lockin'
Your old time connection
Change your direction

Ain't gonna change it
Can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain
When it's all the same to you, my friend!

When you're low down and dirty
From walkin' the street
With your old hurdy-gurdy
No one to meet

Say love ain't the same
On the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't
Gonna find it around

It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old story
Same old song and dance!

(Yes!)
