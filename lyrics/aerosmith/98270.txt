Thinkin' 'bout the night life
In the ladies powder room
Brother's like a howlin' wolf
By the light of the silvery moon
Joey's like a pavlos dog
When he starts to salivate
A hardly man himself
Is hard to shake his rattle snake


(Chorus)
Me, I got a brand new babe
You know something just ain't right
I say yeah, yeah
Can't stop rockin' tonight

Hangin' at the shopping mall
With a watchman full of sash
Leave your smile outside the door
'Cause the kids be kickin' ass
My old boot heels be smokin'
You really got to understand
We're burning down the town tonight
When the new shit hits the fan

(Chorus)

Yeah, yeah, can't stop rockin' tonight

Lyin' on your back tonight
Watch the moon eclipse
Mabye eatin' out tonight
But you just ain't leavin' tips
So you best watch out what you do
And who you do it with
'Cause you'll be kickin' ass tonight
