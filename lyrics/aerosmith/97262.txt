Flatbush boy cruisin' Sheepshead Bay
His boardwalk mama just a sniff away
Underground DMT, ridin' thunder train
The Cone Island White Fish Boy is on the run again


Oh, runnin' with the pack
Oh, never lookin' back
Oh, know just where he's been
That Coney Island White Fish Boy's
Been there and back again

Sixteen years with his boardwalk queen
And at steeplechase, she used to wet his dreams
She combs her hair, that flamin' jewel
Streaked with clorox bleach
Coney gettin' down and dirty
Snortin' up the beach

She'd be screamin' (Coney)
She'd be screamin' (Coney)
Go get 'em Coney

(Coney), Bone To Bone screamin'
(Coney) She be screamin' (Coney)
Get down
Get back in town
Get back, get down
Get back in town
Get back, get down
Coney!
She'd be screamin' (Coney)
