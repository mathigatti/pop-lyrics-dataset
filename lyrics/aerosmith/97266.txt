Sweet Susie Q, she was a rebel
No angel wings, born like the devil
She was so hot, so cool and nasty
Believe it or not, here's what she asked me...
'If you need love with no condition
Let's do the Do, honey, I'm on a mission'


The girl's so bitchin', my backbone's twitchin'
Cause down in Hell's kitchen, the Devil's Got a New Disguise
I'm on a mission, a proposition
It's intuition, 'cause the Devil's Got a New Disguise

If you see Kay tell her I love her
She did me in, but I'll recover
She said LOVE was her desire
All that she touched, she set on fire
She was so diss, I couldn't slake her
She blew a kiss, I threw the dagger

The girl's so bitchin', my backbone's twitchin'
Cause down in Hell's kitchen, the Devil's Got a New Disguise
I'm on a mission, a proposition
It's intuition, 'cause the Devil's Got a New Disguise

We came from the wrong side of town
Got nothing to lose when you're upside down
We gotta get out of this place
Got nothing to lose cus...

It ain't no surprise
When your big ol' silver eyes
Got me feelin' tranquilized
When she lets me have her prize
'Cause Monday night
She's Tuesday wild
On Wednesday night
She's Thursday's child
But Friday night, night, night, night, night, night, night
You gotta give me all of your love

We came from the wrong side of town
Got nothin' to lose when you're upside down
We lived on the side of the tracks
Got laid in the shed of an old smokestack
We gotta get outta this place
Or we got a heel gonna smash your face
We came from the wrong side of town

The girl's so bitchin', my backbone's twitchin'
Cause down in Hell's kitchen, the Devil's Got a New Disguise
I'm on a mission, a proposition
It's intuition, 'cause the Devil's Got a New Disguise

The girl's so bitchin', my backbone's twitchin'
Cause down in Hell's kitchen, the Devil's Got a New Disguise
I'm on a mission, a proposition
It's intuition, 'cause the Devil's Got a New Disguise
