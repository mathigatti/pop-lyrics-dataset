Uncle Salty told me
Stories of a lonely
Baby, with a lonely kind of life to lead


Her mom she was lusted
Daddy he was busted
They left her to be trusted
Til the orphan bleeds

But when she cried at night
No one came
And when she cried at night
Went insane

Uncle Salty told me
When she was just a baby
That she'd get by and maybe
Someday she'd see

Soon she found her mother's
Love for all the others
The pushers and the shovers
Was the life to lead

But when she cried at night
No one came
And when she cried at night
Went insane

Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah

Now she's doin' any
For money and the penny
A sailor with a penny or two or three

Hers is the cunnin'
For men that come a runnin'
They all come for fun and it seems to me

That when she cried at night
No one came
And when she cried at night
Went insane

Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oh, it's a sunny day outside my window
