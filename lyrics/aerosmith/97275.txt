(Chorus)
Gypsy, gypsy, dancing feet
Gypsy, gypsy, bittersweet
Screamer, dreamer, idsarray
Gypsy, gypsy, why don't you fly away


No good, papa's no good
Sister's no good and that's a drag
Sometimes you feel like
Your head's on the ceiling
When you scream your mama rag
When your daddy come home
With an old soup bone
And take all your money away
And your mama's in the kitchen
On the phone she be bitchin'
And your girlfriend who called to stay

(Chrous)

High school lover, with ya cops undercover
And gettin high, drank Lebanese
Hey mama, choose what you been through
And hit righ between your knees
Hair case, shotgun, rock on
Chewing gum, take it to the dance tonight
Your love child with wild child smile
And don't care wrong from right

(Chorus)

Nobody but nobody baby
Knockin' my socks off
Rock, rockin' baby
I'll be gettin' my rocks off
Nobody but nobody
Shootin' never get a shot off
