It ain't easy, livin' like a gypsy
Tell ya, honey, how I feel
I've been dreaming
Floatin' down stream and
Losin' touch with all that is real
Whole earth lover, keepin' under cover
Never knowin' where ya been
You've been fadin', always out paradin'
Keepin' touch with Mama kin


Well you've always got your tail on the wag
Shootin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpertual drag
You better check it out
'Cause someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon

It ain't easy, livin' like you wanna
And it's so hard to find piece of mind
Yes it is
The way I see it, you've got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

Said you're as bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for you dad is just a drag
He still stuffs your mouth with your dreams
You better check it out
'Cause someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon

Keepin' touch with Mama kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea

It ain't easy, livin' like ya wanna
And it's so hard to find piece of mind
Yes it is
The way I see it, you've got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

Said you're as bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for you dad is just a drag
He still stuffs your mouth with your dreams
You better check it out
'Cause someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon
