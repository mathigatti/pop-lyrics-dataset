Seems like the other day,
My baby went away,
She went away,
Across some sea.


It's been two years or so,
Since I saw my baby go,
And then this letter,
Came to me.

It said that we was through
She found somebody new,
Oh, lemme think, lemme think,
What shall I do?

Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no.
Remember,
Walking in the sand.
Remember,
Walking hand in hand.
Remember,
The night was so exciting.
Remember,
Her smile was so inviting,
Remember,
And then she touched my cheek,
Remember,
With her fingertips.
Remember,
Softly, softly we met with a kiss.

Whatever happened to,
That girl that I once knew.
That girl that said she'd be true.
Whatever happened to,
That night I gave her to you.
What will I do with it now.

Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no.
Remember,
Walking in the sand.
Remember,
Walking hand in hand.
Remember,
The night was so exciting.
Remember,
Her smile was so inviting,
Remember,
And then she touched my cheek,
Remember,
With her fingertip.
Remember,
Softly, softly we met with a kiss.

Whatever happened to,
That girl that I once knew.
That girl that said she'd be true.
Whatever happened to,
That night I gave her to you.
What will I do with it now.
