Up in smoke
You've lost another love
You take a hit
Off your last cigarette, yeah


Strung out, burnt out
Yeah, you're down on your luck
And you don't give a huh
'Til the best part of you starts to twitch
Ain't that a bitch?

Freak out!
I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
'Cause love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find

You think you're high and fine as wine
Then you wind up like a dog in a ditch
'Cause love is like a wrong turn
On a cold night

Yeahh, ain't that a bitch?
Ain't that a bitch?

In a daze
In the throes of emotion
You see God in the Devil's eyes

Then you fall so far from grace
You wouldn't know a kiss
If it was on your face
You could tell it to the jury
But you ain't got no case

Freak out!
I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
'Cause love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find

The gal was fine as calamine
But not enough to scratch a seven year itch
'Cause love is like the last licks
Outta Hendrix

Yeahh, ain't that a bitch?
Ain't that a bitch?

Then you feel so out of place
Lickin' up the arsenic
From the same old lace
You know the stuff is poison
But you gotta have a taste
You gotta!

Freak out!
I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
'Cause love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find

You think you're high and fine as wine
Then you wind up with your face in the ditch
'Cause love is like a warm gun
On a cold night

Yeahh, ain't that a bitch?
Ain't that a bitch?
