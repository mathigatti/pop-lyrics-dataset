Sitting on a castle
On the floor with Esmorelda
Waiting for the Geezer
Captain Crunch to come around
Feeling suicidal
´Coz of certain situations
Hanging from the stairs
Too long
I think I'm coming down


It´s time to crash
Losin´ my mind, losin´ my mind, losin´ my mind
Yeah it´s time to crash

Doin´ tons on colon blow
Stuffing it in every hole
Miles high so am I
Watching Jimi kiss the sky
Salle diner becomes a blur
With everybody jammin´
Republicans begin to sin
The batwings start a slamming

It´s time to crash
Losin´ my mind, losin´ my mind, losin´ my mind
Maybe it´s a little late but it´s time to crash

You drive me crazy

Captain Billy Beemish
Put a lamb up on a rack
Thanks for coming Billy
And we hop you´re coming back
The castle will be waiting
For next bangers and mash
Blanche and Marsha Reznick
Put their marmite with their hash

It´s time to crash
Losin´ my mind, losin´ my mind, losin´ my mind
Yeah it´s time to crash
