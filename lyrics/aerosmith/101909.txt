I never thought a first time love would ever last
How could a kiss like that
Knock me flat on my ass


The burnin' bed, the roses dead
And now I'm dancin' with myself

Yeahh, I'm missin' you
Just like you want me to
You made me trip into the grind
Now I can't get you off
O' my mind

(Yeah!)

Your sweet talkin' hip shakin' wobble gonna blow a man away
Kiss butt, and guess what
Even double crossin' dogs have their day, hah

So forget about, regret about
You're right I ain't afraid to say

Yeahh, I'm missin' you
Just like you want me to
You made me trip into the grind
Now I can't get you off

And the more I try
Leads to the same old why

You made me slip into the grind
Now I can't get you off

Of the cloud we was on
And now it's all gone
Tell me why, why, why, why

Why ain't I getting thorugh
Ain't no lie there out

Tell me was it good for you
Tell me what you want!

Yeah, cause I'm missin' you
Just like you knew I'd do
You made me trip into the grind
Now I can't get you off

And I know I tried
Leads to the same old why

You made me trip into the grind
Now I can't, can't, can't, yeah

Get you, get you, get you
Get you, get you

Get'choo, get'choo
Get'choo off o' my mind
