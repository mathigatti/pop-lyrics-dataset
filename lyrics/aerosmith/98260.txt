At first we three thought
'Twas the biblical cord of life
Then noticing 'twas connected to his head


How strange, not to believed
I reached out to feel, and the pony's eyes opened
The cord got hard, the head looked around
And you know who pushed and gushed
The waters of life
First two hooved feet, then the shine of his fur

But at first to my eyes only
Feather - feathers - wings
The butterflies flew up in such colors
Exploding all around us

The rest I did not see - till there he stood - All eyes in
wonder

Who me - Who you
