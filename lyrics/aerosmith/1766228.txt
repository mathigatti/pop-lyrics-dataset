Harder than a ferns,
The whether it turners,
Boba, joke it lies,


She dropped to the hill in a 70s still,
The one world to the wide,

A little meditation,
A good vibration,
And you wont know who you are,

She could be your lover,
And take you to another place beyond the stars...

And make you wanna come,
Your dream above,
A shadow in the sun,
Were all out here,
I aint no here to stay,
And i dont wanna see no light of day...

I go out of my mind,
Where the sun never shines,
Yeah, The pleasure is all mine,
Where the sun never shines,

Im back on that line,
Where the sun never shines,
Its the end of the line,
Where the sun never shines...

Love to love to love you,
I wouldnt have it any other way,

And if you heat to tease me,
Your love could see me and that would be OK,

Love was great, but I couldnt relate,
Till the Saturday love of the night,

Its delapor, its has no way of working out all night...

And make you wanna come,
Your dream above,
A shadow in the sun,
Were all out here,
I aint no here to stay,
And i and will be getting on our way...

I go out of my mind,
Where the sun never shines,
Yeah, The pleasure is all mine,
Where the sun never shines,

Im back on that line,
Where the sun never shines,
Its the end of the line,
Where the sun never shines...

(solo)

Uuu, uuu, uuu, uuu...

I go out of my mind,
Where the sun never shines,
Yeah, The pleasure is all mine,
Where the sun never shines,

Im back on that line,
Where the sun never shines,
Its the end of the line,
Where the sun never shines
