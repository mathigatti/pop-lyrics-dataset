Ridin' a hurricane
Tied to a ball and chain
Too much of a good, good thing
It kinda stops you in your tracks
How did you ever get this far
Now honey, don't look back
And you best believin' 
That all that's good is inside of you
Inside of you, yeah


Ride on a carpet ride
High on the tears you cried
One's just too many 
But a thousands not enough
And you can't make up your mind 
Playing blind mans bluff
And you best beleiving 
That all that's good is inside of you
Yeah, inside of you

It Ain't Enough
I take it all but still it Ain't Enough
Ain't Enough
I got to have it now ain't it tough
It ain't enough
You got no misery 'cause it Ain't Enough
Ain't Enough
You got to have it cause it ain't enough
Oh shit

You know another touch is easy
Try and reach the sky
And though you can't get much more higher 
Than you ever tried
When you die you're not forsaken
Best be taking tries 
Of all the things that you're not taking

Ain't Enough
I take it all but still it Ain't enough
I got to have it ain't it tough
I got to have it
Ain't Enough
I take it all but still it Ain't enough
I got to have it

Ain't Enough
You got no misery 'cause it Ain't Enough
Ain't Enough
You got to have it cause it Ain't Enough
I got to have it

Ain't Enough
I really got to have it
Ain't Enough
I really got to have it
Ain't Enough
