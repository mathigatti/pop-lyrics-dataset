Well on a train I met a dame
She rather handsome, we kinda looked the same
She was pretty from New York City
I'm walkin down that old fair lane
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her soI said train kept a rollin all night long
Train kept a rollin all night long
Train kept a rollin all night long
Train kept a rollin all night long
With a heave and a ho
But I just couldn't tell her so, no no no


Well get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
I'm in heat I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so, no no no
