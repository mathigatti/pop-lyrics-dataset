Well well well
I feel just like I'm fallin´ in love
There´s a new cool
Some kind of verbooty
That fits me like a velvet glove


And it´s cool
Shu bop a doo ba
She´s talkin´ to me Juba to Jive
Yeah, the girl´s in love
No doubt about it
The moment of truth has arrived

And in a wink
The funk was all around me
And I think, I'm dead in love again

Nine Lives - Feelin´ lucky
Nine Lives - Live again
Nine Lives - It ain´t over
Nine Lives - Live for ten

I got good luck
In certain situations
I'm feelin´ like I hung the moon
And then at times
I'm so weak from lovin´
I couldn´t even carry a tune

But now I'm back
Oh yes I am
I maybe fall apart at the seams
I had a nightmare
Believe me when I tell you
Nobody ever dies in their dreams

I think I need a stay of execution
In a wink, I'm dead in love again

Nine Lives - Puss &amp; booty
Nine Lives - Live again
Nine Lives - It ain´t over
Nine Lives - Live for ten

Well well well
Engine room to bombardier
Is the dream
I died and went to Heaven
She´s enough to make you
Cry in your beer

How can a good thing
7 come 11
Slip a fare-thee-well
And how can one man´s
Little bit o´ Heaven
Turn into another man´s Hell

I think I need a stay of execution
Yeah I know, I'm dead in love again
Nine Lives - Hello lucky
Nine Lives - Live again
Nine Lives - It ain´t over
Nine Lives - Try for ten

Nine Lives - Takin´over
Nine Lives - Live again
Nine Lives - It ain´t over
Nine Lives - Live for ten

Nine Lives - Hello lucky
Nine Lives - Live again
Nine Lives - It ain´t over
Nine Lives - Live for ten
