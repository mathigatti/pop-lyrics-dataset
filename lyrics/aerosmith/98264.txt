Well, if you wanna rock
I got to be your rockin'horse
And if you wanna roll
Lord, I could blow you right out the door
Yes I could
We'll shake the world
When it's time to crash
But when I get home tonight
Lord, I guess I got to shake myself
A-look a-here


You need some lovin'
You must have the blues
You fucked your mind baby
Now that's a good thing to do

Now do the shake
The Rattlesnake Shake
Now do the, do the shake
Yeah, chuck away 'em blues

You need some lovin'
You must have the blues
You fucked your mind, baby
That's a good thing to do

Do the shake
The Rattlesnake Shake
(Repeat)
