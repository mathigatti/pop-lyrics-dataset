All night long 
Hollywood
All night long 


You're saddle sore
And on the grind
Just pushed you a little bit more

Don't mind if I do
It's Hollywood
Hot damn - hands in a jam
Never say can't 
'Cause you know you can
In Hollywood

Don't be mesmerized
What goes on here
Ain't no surprise
As long as you'll be cool
In Hollywood
Oh, wee set the pace
Fill your nose 
Despite your face
They'll make you Babylon
In Hollywood

Now you see it
Now you don't
Someone's gonna take it away
Now you see it
Now you won't
Every dog has it's day

Oh wee I got the cools
A brand new car 
And the family jewels
And they won't stop me now
In Hollywood

Oh wee boogedy shoe
Got myself a new hairdo
I'm makin it somehow 
In Hollywood

Now you see it
Now you don't
Someone's gonna take it away
Now you see it
Now you won't
Every dog has it's day

All night long
Hollywood
All night long

Hollywood
In time they'll build you up
And then they'll bring you down

Hollywood
You're a dream machine
Some day they'll burn the king for sellin out
Chew you up and spit you out
Just like heaven when things are good
But there ain't no hell like
Hollywood

Would you guess 
What it's all about
You may be a lady
But I'll knock you out
Wrap my knuckles upside your head
Make you take back 
Every damn thing you said
You play with me 
Gonna pay the price
No ghost of a chance
I'm holdin the dice
You lie about this and
lie about that
Don't wanna hear 
Nothing about no more crap

Now you see it
Now you don't
Someone's gonna take it away
Now you see it
Now you won't
Every dog has it's day

All night long
Hollywood
