Her daddy musta been a millionaire... 'cause I can tell by the way she walk 
Every time she start loving... the deaf and dumb begin to talk 
Yeah... you know what they say 

I remember one Friday morning 
We was lying down across your bed 
Man in the back room was dying... eyes were sad... and I stroked his head 
And I said... Lordy... ain't she pertty... and the whole state knows shes fine... yeah 

And every every every time she start to loving... she bring eyesight to the blind

Man... I declare she pretty... Lordy Lordy I declare she's fine 
Every every every every time she starts to loving... she bring eyesight to the blind
