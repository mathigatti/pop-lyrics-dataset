Don't wanna close my eye's
I don't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thingYou know what I was thinkin'
What
I I really don't think that the animal cracker qualifies as a cracker
Why
Well 'cause it's sweet which to me suggests cookie... and you know
I think putting cheese on something is sort of a defining characteristic
Of what makes a cracker a cracker
I don't know why I thought of that I just...
Baby... you have such sweet pillow talk
If you had like little animal cracker Discovery Channel thing
Watch the gazelle as he graze's through the open plains
And now look... as the cheetah... approachs
Watch... as he stalks his prey
Now the gazelle has looked spooked
And he could head north... to the mountainous peeks above
He could go south...
The gazelle now faces man's most perilous question
North... or... South
Way down
Tune in next week
Baby
Do you think it's possible that anyone else in the world is
Doing this very same thing at this very same moment
I hope so
Otherwise what the hell are we tryin' to saveDon't wanna close my eye's
I don't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
