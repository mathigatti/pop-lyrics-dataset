Long ago in days I'm told
Were ruled by lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold they dared
To bare their wombs that bleed
Kings and queens and guillotines
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive


Oh, I know I lived this life afore
Somehow know now truths I must be sure
Tossin, turnin' nightmares burnin'
Dreams of swords in hand
Sailin' ships the viking spits
The bold of father's land
Only to deceive

Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death
Fear only loss of pride

Living other centuries
Dejá vù or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die

Screams of no reply
They died
Screams of no reply
And died
Lordy lordy they died
Lordy lordy they died

Live and do or die
They died
Live and no reply
They died
