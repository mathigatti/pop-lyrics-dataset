Put your biscuits in the oven
Honey, put your buns in bed
I wanna come inside your kitchen
Wanna taste your shortening bread


I want to jump into your skillet
Honey, tickle your home fries
I gotta hambone working fill it
Won't you try it on for size

Uh uh uh uh uh
Baby ask me no questions
I'll tell you no lies
Put your biscuits in the oven
Honey, watch my dumplin

Rise up - early in the morning 
Rise up - late at night
Rise up - gotta get me a warning 
Rise up - gonna whet your appetite

Gonna shake and bake you honey
I want a catcher in the rye
I wanna sop up all your gravy
From your deep dish apple pie

So open up your menu
I wanna slice your honey dew
I love it honey when you
Do me like you do

Uh uh uh uh uh
And if you ask me no questions
And tell me no lies
Put your biscuits in the oven
Honey, watch my dumplin

Rise up - early in the morning
Rise up - late late late at night
Rise up - giving me no warning
