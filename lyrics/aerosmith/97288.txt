Take me, take me...

Take it or a-leave it on a saturday night
And what you see is what you get so give me a bite
Here are lots of ladies, they are so insecure
Leave it to the boys and the fool on the hill


Hello baby, yeah it's me
There'll be no judge, no third degree no Jailbait
Play the fool and you play the punk
Wake up babe, I'm a-don't know Jailbait

I believe in someone talkin'
Can't let go you don't get hold no Jailbait
What it is, but you believe it
What you got, got up the sleeve and Jailbait

(Look here!)
Oh, J-j-j-Jailbait
Oh, J-j-j-Jailbait
Oh, J-j-j-j-Jailbait

Take it, leave it, roll the dice
You're hard as hell, I'm cold as ice no Jailbait
Tell your daddy how you do me
Put the woodcheck, do it to me Jailbait
What you see in daddy's eyes
Check the boys, no surprise no Jailbait

Oh, J-j-j-Jailbait
Oh, J-j-j-j-j-j-Jailbait
Oh, J-j-j-Jailbait
Oh, J-j-j-Jailbait
Oh, J-j-j-j-j-Jailbait

Do me, do you, tell me what you see in me too
Do me, do you

I ain't complainin' the Bitch's Brew
There's a lover who never knew she's Jailbait
Steep the chase, call the sweat
You steep the feet, oh gracer bed, oh Jailbait

Oh, J-j-j-j-j-Jailbait
Oh, J-j-j-j-j-Jailbait
Oh, J-j-j-j-j-j-Jailbait
J-j-j-j-j-j-j
