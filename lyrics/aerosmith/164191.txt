I wanna jump but I'm afraid I'll fall
I wanna holler but the jones' too small
Young man really got the hold to it too
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu


Want some lovin', baby, that ain't all
I wanna kiss her but the girl's too tall
Young man really got a hold on it too
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu

I wanna scream, I want you all to know
I would be runnin' but my feets are too slow
Young man really got a hold on it too
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu

Baby callin' me now hurry home
I know she's leavin' 'cause I'm takin' too long
Young man really got a hold on it too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and Joe Perry too, oh

Want some lovin', baby' that ain't all
I wanna kiss her but the girl's too tall
Young man really got a hold on it too
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu

I wanna scream, I wanna scream
Young man really got a hold on it too
