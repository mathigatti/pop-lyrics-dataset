She's not a bad girl because
She made me see, hmmm...
How love could be
But she's a bad girl because (bad girl because)
She wants to be free, hmmmm... (bad girl because)
she wants to be free (bad girl)


She's not a bad girl (bad girl)
Bad girl to look at, finer than fine (finer than fine)
Hmmmm... since she was mine, mine, mine (since she was mine)
But she's a bad girl because (bad girl because)
It was only a line 

I-I-I bragged to the boys about the girl I had
It broke me up to find out she was bad
And my only wish is that I wish I could
Make a (bad, bad girl be good)

She wasn't a bad girl, girl at first, (a bad girl)
So good at the start (so good at the start)
Hmm... but now, now we must part (now we must part)
Oh yes, she's a bad girl because (bad girl because)
She's breaking my heart (bad girl because)
Ooooh my, she's breaking my heart (she's breaking my heart)
So, so, so bad she's breaking my heart (bad girl because)
(she's breaking my heart)
