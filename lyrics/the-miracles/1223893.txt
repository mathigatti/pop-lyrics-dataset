I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Though, whoa
You treat me badly
I love you madly


You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Though, whoa
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby (I love you)
And all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me


Tighter (tighter)

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Though, whoa
I want to split now
I can't quit now

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby (I love you)
And all I want you to do
Is just (hold me) please
(Hold me) squeeze
Hold me (hold me)

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
I said
You really got a hold on me
(I said)
(You really got a hold on me)
I Know
You really got a hold on me
