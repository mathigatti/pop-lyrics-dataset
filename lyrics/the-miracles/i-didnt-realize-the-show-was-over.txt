Tell her that I loved her (tell her that I loved her)
Tell her that I need her (tell her that I need her)


And I didn't realize that the show was over
No, I didn’t realize that the show was over
I didn't realize that I was wrong
My baby's gone (gone, gone, gone, gone)
Oh, how she’s gone (gone, gone, gone, gone)

Ooh, baby, I've hurt you too much
I broke our vows of love
I was playing alone but I couldn't stop
But you walked out on me, girl, in the middle of the block
Ooh, and as I stand here
As they slowly brought down the curtain, girl

I didn't realize that the show was over
No, I didn't realize that the show was over
I didn't realize that I was wrong
My baby's gone (gone, gone, gone, gone)
(Oh, baby won't you come back, come back, come back?)
Baby, baby, won’t you come back for me?

Ooh, baby, I didn’t really mean it
When I said I didn't care what you do
Just come in before us, I’m number three
Instead of winning an Oscar, it was just heartbreak for me
Ooh, oh, I need you, baby
And I

I didn't realize that the show was over
No, I didn't realize that the show was over
No, I didn't realize that I was wrong
My baby’s gone

And I didn't realize that the show was over
No, I didn't realize that the show was over
I didn't realize that I was wrong
