If ever I have a son in life, I'll call him in one day
Sit him down upon my knee and here is what I'll say


You might lose your lover, people do sometime
Oh, but it won't make sense for you to sit around cryin'
Son, don't you know that when you fall in love
Sometimes, you're gonna have the blues
Well it may take years, but you're gonna shed some tears
'Cause everybody's got to pay some dues, now, now
Everybody's got to pay some dues

You might have money, yeah, and a big fine car
It don't matter what you look like, no, no it don't matter who you are
Son, dont you know you can't win all the time
Sometime you're gonna have to lose
Just as long as you live, you got to take as well as give
'Cause everybody's got to pay some dues, now, now
Everybody's got to pay some dues

Whoa whoa whoa (Whoa whoa whoa)
Yeah yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah hea hea hea hea hea (Yeah hea hea hea hea hea)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)


Well now (everybody's got to pay some dues)
Yeah, don't you know it now,
(Everybody's got to pay some dues)

Make no mistakes now son about the things I told you
I don't want you to think, yeah yeah, that I'm tryin' to scold you
Son, because I know you got to fall in love sometime
Be careful who you choose
'Cause it's sure my son before your life is done
You'll find that (everybody's got to pay some dues)
Yeah, don't you know it now,
(Everybody's got to pay some dues)

(Dues, got to pay some dues, got to pay some dues)
I've got to pay, he's got to pay
(Dues, got to pay some dues, got to pay some dues)
You've got to pay and she's got to pay
(Dues, got to pay some dues, got to pay some dues)
No matter what you do, I say
(Dues, got to pay some dues, got to pay some dues)
There is gonna come a day
(Dues, got to pay some dues, got to pay some dues)
When you gonna have to pay
(Dues, got to pay some dues, got to pay some dues)
Can't nobody get away from dues
(Dues, got to pay some dues, got to pay some dues)
Yeah yeah yeah now
