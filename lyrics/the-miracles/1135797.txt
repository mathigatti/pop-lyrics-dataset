You know, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town


You know that he's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He knows when you're asleep
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

One more time now,
Santa Claus is coming to town
(Santa's coming, Santa's coming)
Oh, Santa Claus is coming to town
(Santa's coming, Santa's coming)
