What's so good about goodbye?
All it does is make you cry
Well, if leaving causes grieving
And depart can break you heart


Tell me (what's so good about it)
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?

Since you said goodbye to me
All I've known is misery
Well, if everything goes wrong
And lovers say so long

Tell me (what's so good about it)
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?


Won't somebody tell me, now
How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares?
And another thing I would like to clarify
Is how can farewell be fair?

Won't you please tell me why
You would have the nerve to say this is goodbye
Girl, when it makes me so sad then it's got to be bad
Tell me (what's so good about it)
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?

Baby,
What's so good about goodbye?
