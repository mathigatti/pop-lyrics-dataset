My darling, all I want is

I don't want to pretend
And I don't want gold, yeh
I just wanna you
To have and to hold, now
I don't want glory
And I don't want fame
I just wanna hear you
Callin' my name


And in this wide
Wide, wide world
All I want is you

I don't want my name
Up in bright lights
I just wanna you
To hold me tight
Don't, don't wanna be
Loved by no other girl
Baby, you are my
My rock of this world

And in this wide
Wide, wide world
All I want is you

I don't want diamonds
Thrown at my feet
I just wanna you
To always be sweet
I just wanna my whole life long
To always do right
And to never, never, never do wrong

And in this wide
Wide, wide world
All I want is you
