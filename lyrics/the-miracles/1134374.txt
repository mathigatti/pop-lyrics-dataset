Broken hearted since we parted
I don't go nowhere, but what do I care
I'm just broken hearted since we parted


I'm so blue, baby, without you
Yes, I don't have no one, ain't been havin no fun
Since you been gone (since you been gone)
I can't go on (since you been gone)
I keep on cryin' (since you been gone)
My hope keeps dyin' (since you been gone)
Oh, I'm broken hearted, baby since we parted

Maybe you don't know it, girl
So let me just remind you
That I still love you, girl
And I'm gonna find you
But until, I hope that you 
Will leave the past behind you
And come on and let me know
That you've been so

Broken hearted, ooh since we parted
Just say you will (say you will)
Give me a thrill (say you will)
Come on, come on home (say you will)
Nevermore to roam (say you will)
I'm so broken hearted, baby, since we parted

(broken hearted)
I don't have no one (broken hearted)
I ain't havin' no fun (broken hearted)
'Cause I need you (broken hearted)
You bet your life (broken hearted)
You bet your life I do (broken hearted)
So come on, come on, come on (broken hearted)
