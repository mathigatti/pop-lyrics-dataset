I wish I would've rained
And take the smog away
So that we can have
A bright and sunny day


The sky is gray when the smog fills the air
I need the light that shines through you hair

When a smoggy day
Devolves into the night
The air begins to clear
Because the traffics' light

We might have to use electric cars
To keep the smog from the sky
So we can see the stars

We breathe in the smoke everyday
With impurities leading the way
To sickness and hope that one day
I whish the smog will drift away
To space

The sky is gray when the smog fills the air
I need the light that shines through you hair

The sky is gray when the smog fills the air
I need the light that shines through you hair

The sky is gray when the smog fills the air
I need the light that shines through you hair

The sky is gray when the smog fills the air
I need the light that shines through you hair

The sky is gray when the smog fills the air
I need the light that shines through you hair
