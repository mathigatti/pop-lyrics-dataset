When I became of age, my mother called me to her side
She said: Son, you're growing up now
Pretty soon you'll take a bride
And then she said


Just because you've become a young man now
There's still some things that you don't understand now
Before you ask some girl for her hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now
My mama told me
You better shop around
Ah, woah, yeah, you better shop around

Aah, there's some things that I want you to know now
Ah, just as sure as the wind's gonna blow now
The women come and the women gonna go now
Before you tell 'em that you love 'em so now
My mama told me
You better shop around
Woah, yeah, you better shop around

Ah, try to get yourself a bargain, son
Don't be sold on the very first one
Ah, pretty girls come a dime a dozen
Ah, try to find you one who's gonna give you true loving

Before you take a girl and say I do now
Make sure she's in love with you now
My mama told me
You better shop around


Ooh, hey, hey
Try to get yourself a bargain, son
Don't be sold on the very first one
Ah, pretty girls come a dime a dozen
Ah, try to find you one who's gonna give you true loving

Before you take a girl and say I do now
Make sure she's in love with you now
Make sure that her love is true now
I hate to see you feelin' sad and blue now
My mama told me
You better shop around

Uh, huh, don't let your first one get 'cha
Oh, no, cause I don't wanna see her wit' 'cha
Uh, huh, before you let her hold you tight
Ah, yeah, yeah, make sure she's all right

Uh, huh, before you let her take your hand, my son
Understand, my son
Be a man, my son
I know you can, my son
I'd love ya, ah, shop around
