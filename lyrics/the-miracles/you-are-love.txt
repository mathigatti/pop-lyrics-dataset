Everyday I catch the same old bus
Baby, love you all the time
I hurry on to fight the morning rush
You are always on my mind
Baby, then I settle down
And do the same old rhyme
You are the reason it's all right
When my days are gone


You're my Sun
When I'm feeling on
You're my young
You're my dreams
You're the songs I sing
You're everything
You are love
You're the world to me
You are love

I were caught to do
The best I can
Thinkin' of you all the time
I struggle on to meet the man's to man's
You're always on my mind
When the day is through
I come home, a weary man

You're the reason it's all right
When my days are gone
You're my Sun
When I'm feeling on
You're my young
You're my dreams
You're the songs I sing
You're everything
You are love

I wanna thank you girl
For showing me a love I never knew
I know how I can face
Anything the world puts me through
As long as I have you
When my days are gone
You're my Sun
When I'm feeling on
You're my young
You're my dreams
You're the songs I sing
You're everything
You are love
