Sleigh bells ring, are you list'nin?
In the lane, snow is glist'nin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland


Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can built a snowman (yeah)
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say "are you married?"
We'll say "no man!
But you can do the job when you're in town"
Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
