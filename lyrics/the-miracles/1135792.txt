You better beware, my friends all told me
When they saw that I was falling for you
You better beware they told me that girl ain't gonna be true
She'll have you walking with your head in the air
Have you thinking that she really, really care
Then-a, then she'll let you down, she'll really let you down
She's a girl with no understanding
And when she's getting tired of you hanging around
She'll let you drop and say... have a happy landing (happy landing)


Oh but I fell for you anyway
I didn't care what my friends have to say
'Cause I was so glad that I had found you
I build my whole world right around you
You had me hope on a lie for awhile
Have me thinking you'd be mine for awhile
Oh, then you let me down, you really let me down
'Cause you're a girl with no understanding
And when you're getting tired of me hanging around
You let me drop and said... have a happy landing (happy landing)


So now you want me to take you there
Staying away for a long, long time
You won't call it a lost of loving
Now ya coming back to the scene of your crime
Gonna keep you in suspense for awhile
Keep you hanging on a fence for awhile
Then-a I'll let you down, then I'll let you down
I ain't gonna have no understanding
And when I get tired of you hanging around
I'll let you drop and say... you have a happy landing (happy landing)
Have a happy landing, now (have a happy landing)
I've got to put you down (have a happy landing)
Don't want ya hanging around, now (have a happy landing)
You know that you better (have a happy landing)
You know that you better (have a happy landing)
So come on and have (have a happy landing)
Don't you know that I ought to...
