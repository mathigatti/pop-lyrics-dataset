Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow


It doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And i brought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow


When we finally kiss goodnight
Oh i hate to go out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home i'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbyeing
For as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
