How neat 
I'm impressed
How did you come to be so blessed?


You're a star
You blaze
Out like a sharp machine
Like a whale's moan
Well I'm here if that's what you want

Here we are
You're pins
I'm needles
Let's play

Here we are
You want this?
Then come on

Tune out everyone in the crowd 
Because now it's just me and you
Come fall in love with the sound
Make a pact to each other 
When no one's around
put the cross between me and you
Who wants to fuck with us now?

Here we are
You're pins
I'm needles
Let's play

Here we are
You want this?
Then come on

Tune out everyone in the crowd 
Because now it's just me and you
Come fall in love with the sound
Make a pact to each other 
When no one's around
put the cross between me and you
Who wants to fuck with us now?

Who wants to fuck with us now?
Who wants to fuck with us now?
