I carve my name
Across your towns
When I'm set
Cut inside before
The trends begin
I spend my time perfecting
Waves of contrast
Cutting out all
The same shit I've outgrown
I?m bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease no sweat
I see the crowns
And I forget the couture
Two at a time
I watch the kingdoms fold
I'm bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease no sweat
I'm breaking in with all my friends
So are you in?
Designed for you...designed by me...
Before we get down
We must prepare the heart strings
To cut all the ties
And watch the trends begin
I'm bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease no sweat
I'm breaking in with all my friends
So are you in?
Designed special for you by me
