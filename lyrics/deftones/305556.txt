Hey yall I'm marryin' that girl
With the pain and don't lie
Liquify your meaning, but wont
Tell her you miss her, she's with me


'Cause I'm done - you know
But it tastes like mud

Don't tell her you love her
She's with me
I know you may make her feel a whore
I wont tell her I miss her
She's not feeling sore

'Cause I'm gone - inside
But it tastes like MUD!

But I know you hate me
But that's ok cuz' I hate you too
Leaving here and you won
Shut the fuck UP!

Leaving tomorrow
I'm gone leaving to God
You might be my girl
Leave to God
You're my little girl
Even to God

I'm gone - inside
But it tastes like MUD!

But I know you hate me
But that's ok cuz' I hate you too
Leaving here and you won
Shut the fuck UP!

Leaving to God - you were a girl
Leaving to God - he might be a girl
Leaving to God - he find a girl
