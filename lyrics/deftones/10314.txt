It's so simple to look at every little thing I do wrong
It's so simple to overlook every little thing I do right, right?


I think too much
I feed too much
I'm gone too much
I sleep too much
I snore too much
I'm bored too much
I ate too much
I'm way too much too stuck up

You're probably right
This time but I don't want to listen
You're probably right
This time but I don't even care

I dream too much
I think too much
I step too much
Those things too much
I am too much
I'm pissed too much
I need too much
I'm not one to trust!

You're probably right
This time but I don't want to listen
You're probably right
This time but I don't even care

And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't say it
And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't speak

I'm bored too much
I need too much
I think too much
Throw fits too much
I'm free too much
I'm pissed too much
I sleep too much
I step too often

You're probably right
This time but I don't want to listen
You're probably right
This time but I don't even care

And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't say it
And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't speak
