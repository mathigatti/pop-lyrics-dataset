A sea of waves
We hug the same plank
Just as i rehearsed over in my brain


The waves suck you in and you drown

Its like you to stay down with me
And i'll swim down..
Would you..you


You have the anchors over my neck
I liked it at first
But the more you laugh the crazier i came

The waves suck you in and you drown
Its like you to stay down with me
I'll swim down with you

Is that what you want
With you
Is that what you want

Waves
Waves

Its like you to fade down with me
I'll swim down with you

Is that what you want
With you
Is that what you want
You

Escape... the alarm... escape....be alarmed...
