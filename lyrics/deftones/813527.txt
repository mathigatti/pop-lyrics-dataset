I've looked outside
But I've never wandered out


I'd like to pull you into me
Intercept you, in between
But I never walk without, outside

That way, I'll always, stay away from you
That way, I'll always, stay away from you

I've looked inside
but I never wandered in

I'd like to pull you into me
Intercept you, in between
But I never wandered in, inside

That way, I'll always, stay away from you
That way, I'll always, stay away from you

(Serj)
The universe, breaking us down
The universe, breaking us down

(Chino)
That way, I'll always, stay away from you
That way, I'll always, stay away from you
yoouuuu, yooouuuu, yoooouuuu....

(Serj)
Universe, Breaking us down
