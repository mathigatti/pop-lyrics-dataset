This town don't feel mine
Fast to get away


Far

I dressed you in her clothes
Now drive me far

Away
Away
Away

It feels good to know you're all mine
Now drive me far

Away
Away
Away

Far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care

Far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care

Far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care

Far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care where, just far away
I don't care
