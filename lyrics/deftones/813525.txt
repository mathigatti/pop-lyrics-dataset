This time you get the finger pointed right at you
Which side are you on? Which side are you on?
I asked you what side you wanted on
Which side are you on? Which side are you on?


A waste of time
If you don't believe
Can't decide to
Hit the ground
Make your mind
But you're holding me down
And over again
Down
And over again
Down

This time you think it pointed right at you
Whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
I asked you what side did you point it at?
Whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
On? Huh? Why?

A waste of time
If you don't believe
Can't decide till you've
Hit the ground
Make your mind
Or you dont believe
Can't decide till you
Hit the ground
Make your mind
Cause you're holding me down
Down
And over again
Down
And over again
Down
And over again

And don't think that i don't know
'Cause I do
Nice try
'Cause that's what you really like, like, like, like

This all came out,
you said,
Say something else.
Decide, who's side you're on!
Whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
C'mon
Whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
Decide one.
