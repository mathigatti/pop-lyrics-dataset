Excellent schemes,
Been watching you now,
You've got perfect style
(Perfect found, i dont wanna)???
Fuck it!
Who cares


Don't want to
Fuck your lies your lies
Then turn your back on me!

It slows......
Everything

I'll let you take me
And fix your own self
You pave the way through
Now make it stop

Excellent scams
Being watching you now,
You've got perfect style
Lies by lies, you wouldn't
Fuck it any dare,
No one can't deny your lies
Your lies
Went back on my word!

It slows....
Everything

I'll let you brake me
And fix your own self
You pave the way through
Now make it stop

Nothing makes us stay the same
Nothing makes us hate
Nothing makes us take a break
Nothing makes us burn

Excellent scams
Being watching you all, you won't
Perfect style
Lies by lies, you wouldn't
Fuck with it
Any dare

No one can deny
Your lies, your lies
Went back on my word! (Ain't Bound by my word)

I'll let you take me
And fix your own self
You pave the way through
Now make it stop

Excellent schemes,
Been watching you now,
You've got perfect style
