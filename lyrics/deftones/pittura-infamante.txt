I kneel at the altar
Carve your name
And hail to the gods
I've climbed your trees and I peeled your fruit
When I tasted your kiss


How amazing that you were sent
Like you were molded out of thin air
And I don't want you to disappear
But I want you to carry us out here

We sail through arc light
Attach the wings
And wait for the gods
We found your grail we drank your juice
And we tasted your gift

I will wait here a thousand years
I will choose to immerse in your eyes
I've seen the truth and I know your strength
I have watched your great ascent

Now we sing
Now we sing your praises
And now we face the sky

On top of the crux
I've climbed every rung
To bathe in your sunlight

I kneel at the altar
I promised you I would stay to the end
I will hold and praise and feel your truth

Now let us drink to the gods
I will sing
I will sing your praises
I will scream
I will scream your praises
