I feel soon
I will sink
Into you
What do you think?


'Cause there's still blood
In your hair
And I've got the bruise
Of the year

But there's something about her
Long shady eyes
I'm all about her
Shade tonight

I hate
Your tattoos
You have weak wrists
But I'll keep you

'Cause there's something about her
Long shady eyes
I'm all about her
Shade tonight

Well, it's too bad
It's too bad
It's too bad
You're married to me
