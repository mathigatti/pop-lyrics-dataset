First you smile at lord, I found you first
Liquified inside you, But it hurts if I even see you
Make you smile, I look over and cry, I get by!!
But that's to bad you get stuck with all alone!
Look at yourself you ain't no genius!!!
You want to find, you won't find me,
I'm coming home, but I
First you raining for, It can't be seen
Liquified him more and more, F*ck you b*tch!
-gibberish- to go and I go and I and
I don't know Cause I'm sick
and this ain't fun at all!!!
But that's too bad you get stuck with whores
Look at yourself you ain't no genius
you want to fly, you won't find me I'm coming home I
But that's too bad you get stuck with whores
Look at yourself you ain't no genius
you want to find you won't find me I'm coming home,hurt
You got hair, clothes,the fashion, the cash flow
How the fuck you gonna tell me what you don't know
You got hair, clothes,the fashion, the cash flow
How the fuck you gonna tell me something
Your this close to fashion, the cash flow
How the fuck you gonna tell me what you don't know
Your this close to fashion,the cash flow
How the fuck you gonna tell me something Tell me something
Say your prayers
But that's too bad you get stuck with all alone
Look at yourself you ain't no genius
you want to find, you won't find me
I'm coming home I
