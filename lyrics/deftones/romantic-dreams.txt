Process
You’re constant changing phases
I watch them
Releasing right on cue
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours


So why wait to discover your dreams?
Now here’s your chance
I promise
To watch and raise your babies
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours

I’m hypnotized by your name
I wish this night would never end

So why wait for the colors to bleed?
What do you expect?
So heartless we march into the fumes
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours

I’m hypnotized by your name
I wish this night would never end
I wish this night

I’m hypnotized by your name
I wish this night never end
I wish this night
I wish this night wouldn't end
I wish this night
