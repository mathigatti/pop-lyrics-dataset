Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna take you home
And watch the world explode
From underneath your glow


Yeah, I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

You slowly enter
Because you know my room
And then you crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb

I wanna watch you close
I need to see for sure
After the taping through
Who do you think we can show?

I wanna to watch the way
You creep across my skull

You slowly enter
Because you know my room
And then you crawl your knees off
And then you shake my tomb

I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

You slowly enter
Cause you know my room
And then you crawl you knees off
Before you shake my tomb

You enter slowly
You know my rule
You crawl your knees off
And then you shake my tomb
