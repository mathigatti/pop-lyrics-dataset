I relate to your kind
Your design, your devotion to wait
Does it get your brain on the prize
Then die inside


Mindset of a killer
With your mind
Out think

It's a game that we like
We crave
Yet nobody waves
Any way you decide
You try but you die

Mindset of a killer
With your gaze
You paint the room
Blood red with tears
Born from the stage

And you cant stop now
Room by room
One more town
Covered in black and gold
No one cares, no one knows

My gift to the world outside
Its ok, im alright
Now open your empty hands
Here comes the flood
Here comes the end

Click erase the device
Give face
Then you clear out the room
Blow kisses wave them good bye
Good night

(death screams)

Mindset of a killer
With your gaze
You paint the room
Blood red with tears
Born from the stage

And you cant stop now
Room by room
One more town
Covered in black and gold
No one cares, no one knows

My gift to the world outside
Its ok, im alright
Now open your empty hands
Here comes the flood
Here comes the end
