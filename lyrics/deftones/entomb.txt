From the day
You arrived
Iâ€™ve remained by your side
In chains, entombed
Placed inside
Safe and sound
Shapes and colors are all i see
On the day
You arrived
I became your device
To name and soothe
Placed inside
Safe and sound
Shapes and colors are all i see
Shades of colors are all i feel
From the day you arrived
I have stayed by your side
Placed inside
Safe and sound
Shades of colors are all i see
Shapes of colors are all i feel
Placed inside
Safe and sound
Shades of colors are all i see
Safe inside
