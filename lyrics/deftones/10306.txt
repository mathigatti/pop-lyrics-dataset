Got back out back off the forefront
I never said or got to say bye to my boy
But it's often I try I think about how I'd be screaming
And the times would be bumping
All our minds would be flowing
Taking care of shit like hey holmes
What you needing sometimes life will be coming off whack
And will open your eyes


As I proceed to get loose
I feel you next to me fiending
Getting spacey with the common
Love of music think of this as the
Sun and the mind as a tool but we
Could bounce back from this one
With attitude will and some spirit
With attitude will and your spirit
We'll shove it aside

Soulfly
Fly high
So fly
Fly free

Shut your shit please say what you will
I can't think side step around
I'm bound to the freestyle
Push It down to the ground
With a nova dash
But they watch you
Now climb up superslide
Our spirit so low it's coming over you

Soulfly
Fly High
So fly
Fly free

You walk into this world

Walk into this world with your head up high

Headup
