Take
Out the stories
They’ve put into your mind and brace
For the glory
As you stare into the sky.. The sky beneath
I know you can’t be tired


Lay there
Stare at the ceiling
And switch back to your time
Just go ahead now try and taste it
I know it should be ripe
Thrust
Ahead

Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival
Cut to the end
I’d like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

I wonder just how you shaped it
To get back to your prize
Thrust
Ahead

Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival
Cut to the end
I’d like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

Wake for the glory
I know you can’t be
TIRED

Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival
Cut to the end
I’d like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

Inside

Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
I want you to take me
Apart from the inside
Right to the end
