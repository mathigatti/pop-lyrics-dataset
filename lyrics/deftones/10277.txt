I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away
You were on fire


I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed

I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

It's like you never had wings
Ahh-ah-aaah

I look at the cross
Then I look away
Give you the gun
Blow me away

I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change
And you feel alive
You feel alive
I've watched you change

It's like you never had wings
Ahh-ah-aaah
You change
I'm over
