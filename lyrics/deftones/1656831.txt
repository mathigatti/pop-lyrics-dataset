You arrive in my dream
Beside me every night
You and me, we explode through the scene
We try to drain the night empty


No one goes off in every way
Like you do
We go out together
We weave our own web
Tangled in the waves
With you we spray the scene in red

We both erupt in colors
Then carve out our names
You keep me aroused
I know you feel the same

You arrived in my dream
Beside me every night
Just you and me, we explode through the scene
We try to drain the night... empty

No one else has a hold over me
Like you do
You open up the covers
You lure me in
Tackle me anxious back into bed
Well I hope to discover all of your waves...
This place is death
I know you feel the same

You arrived in my dream
Beside me every night
Just you and me
We explode through the scene
We try to drain the night
