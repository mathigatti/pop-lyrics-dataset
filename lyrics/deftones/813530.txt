Decide, decide
Is this safe to say?
Decide
Is that your style?
Is this decided?
Decide
Is this it?
Is this decided?
Decide
Really?
Fine
You walked in here
Was it like a dream?
You got in here
Was it like it seemed?
I won't say nothing, nothing
Not a fucking thing
Wish you would've said something, something
Something
Decide, decide
Is this safe to say?
Decide
Is that your style?
Is this decided?
Decide
Is this it?
Is this just fine?
Decide
Just fine
Everything is fine
Everything's just fine
Everything is fine
Everything's fine
You walked in here
Was it like a dream?
You got in here
Was it like it seemed?
I won't say nothing, nothing
Not a fucking thing
I just wanna say something, something
Something
And I wish one thing, one thing
Just one fucking thing
I heard her say something
Something, something
Decide, decide
Is this safe to say?
Decide
Is that your style?
Is this decided?
Decide
Is this it?
Is this just fine?
Everything's fine
Everything is fine
Everything's just fine
Everything is fine
