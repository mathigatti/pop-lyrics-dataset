Who's gonna tell you when,
It's too late,
Who's gonna tell you things,
Aren't so great.


You can't go on, thinkin',
Nothing's wrong, but bye,
Who's gonna drive you home,
Tonight?

Who's gonna pick you up,
When you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up,
When you call?

Who's gonna pay attention,
To your dreams?
And who's gonna plug their ears,
When you scream?

You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothing's wrong, but bye,
(who's gonna drive you)
(who's gonna drive you)
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?
(who's gonna drive you home)

(bye baby)
(bye baby)
(bye baby)
(bye baby)

Who's gonna hold you down,
When you shake?
Who's gonna come around,
When you break?

You can't go on, thinkin',
Nothing's wrong, but bye,
(who's gonna drive you)
(who's gonna drive you)
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?
(who's gonna drive you home)

Oh, you know you can't go on, thinkin',
Nothing's wrong,
(who's gonna drive you)
(who's gonna drive you home)
Who's gonna drive you home
