Out on the tar plains
the glides are moving
all looking for
a new place to drive
You sit beside me
so newly charming
sweating dewdrops glisten
freshing your side


And the sun drips down
bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress
all shadowy lined
and the droning engine
throbs in time
with your beating heart

Way down the lane away
living for another day
the aphids swarm up
in the drifting haze
swim seagull in the sky
towards some hollow
western isle
my envied lady
holds you fast
in her gaze

And the sun drips down
bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress
all shadowy lined
and the droning engine
throbs in time
with your beating heart 2X

Sing Blue Silver

And watching lovers part
I feel you smiling
what glass splinters
lie so deep in your mind
to tear out from your eyes
with a word to stiffen
brooding lies
and I'll only watch
you leave me
further behind

And the sun drips down
bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress
all shadowy lined
and the droning engine
throbs in time
with your beating heart

Sing Blue Silver
Sing, Sing Blue Silver
