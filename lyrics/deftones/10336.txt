Somebody's heine is crowdin' my icebox
Somebody's cold one is givin' me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes
oh yeah......it feels good
Flip on the tele'
Wrestle with Jimmy
Something is bubbling behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a lifetaker
I can't confront you I never could do
That which might hurt you to try and be cool
When I say
This way is a waterslide away from me
that takes your further every day so be cool
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a lifetaker
Dear Daddy, I write you in spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good or so I hear
This bottle of Steven's awakens ancient feelings
Like father stepfather the son is drowning in the flood
