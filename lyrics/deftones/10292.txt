To be forced under I look unto your home because
We gave our eyes but no one will yes I know because
To heed the cause I will be barred but you won't
He get, He gets real high
He's up inside, We start to cry
Just because I'm really poor
Living in me is so poor
Deliver me-there to be judged by one or licked by three
And your holes enclose
We gave our eyes no one will yes I know because
To heed the cause I will be barred but you won't
He get, He gets real high
He's up inside, We start to cry
Just because I'm really poor
Living in me is so poor
Deliver me-up!
Cannot fuck to be me and you won't find me
And you won't find me and you will don't know me
psycho
I don't believe you will find me
And you won't find me and you will so come from
a psycho
I don't believe you will find me
And you won't find me and you will don't quit
psycho
I don't believe you will find me
I'm in trouble because
I and me we go with Jesus in a bowl of dirt
Yeah, yeah, so poor, I will fly
