We are beggers, where blown
And I will meet you fourth floor
Then we'll make up-no
No fist to fucking save you from (3x)
You knock me out
I'll take the burden full blown
And then we'll, I'll be there-no
Do you think I care
No fist to fucking save you from (3x)
You knock me out
No fist to fucking save you from
I'm going home (3x)
Everything felt good
Everything was right at first
When I was so curbed to know-maddog
Life before I would shine down unshy
It comes from the first one I
While I watched you
Makes me sick, makes me go
I would shine
I want to be much than more
While I watch you
Life before I would shine down unshy
I want to be much than more
While I watch you
Life before I would shine down unshy
I want to be much than more, while I watch you (4x)
I, much more while I watch you
I want to be much than more, while I watch you
