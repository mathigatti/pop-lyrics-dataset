It’s a mistake
But go ahead and take a side
But watch how you choose
Or be headed for a ride
‘cause i, i just don’t know if i could


I can’t stop what you began
I can’t fight for what you began

You’ve opened the gates
Now face the other side
Just go on it’s cool
Now head into the fire
I, i just don’t know if i could

I can’t stop what you began
I can’t fight for what you began

I know what’s in sight
For you again

Switch on your game
Stop wasting all your time
‘cause — surprise! it’s you
Who’ll face what you decide
Well, i, i think i’d have known about you

I can’t stop what you began
I can’t fight for what you began

I know what’s in sight
I know your fate
I know i can’t stop what you began
