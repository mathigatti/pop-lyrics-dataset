Somewhere, outside
There are tricks and evil
Holler downstairs
While I drive


(I make a plan just to get you back you're bored doing
What a girl do I, wanna watch you
You think again, deep within, keep it deep inside
While I serenade, buttercup, yeah buttercup
And what you can do is go down
Slow again and how we’ll do it again and again
And make the best of a simple thing
To be like this, bound, coming through the fog)

Dying of boredom
I'll try it all

Sixteen, olive
Bound by a voice

(Bleed again like a girl that can make ‘em turn
Don't want to go, but I want it
Too much blood to my stomach it's because it's sick
Passed by you break the bands between us
I can dare to go but never what you can't do
What you get is never what you want to get
Now to pray your sigh is over like a doped drug
Like a voice well at least you fucking care)

Dying of boredom
I'll try it all
I'll be faint
Like a crook

(It looks and feels great, but look at what it's doing to you
But that's okay, look at how it feels
It looks and feels great, but look at what it's doing to you
But that's okay, look at how it feels
It looks and feels great, but look at what it's doing to you
But that's okay, look at how it feels)

(Burn god down, starts to stir again
Fucking heretic, I’ve opened up this for me
Like to stare up, I’ll stack the bricks down
Hurt you too much, working 'round to
I can punch through it, make the hair stick
Don't wanna hurt you, just to fuck you
I'm out of time so I tell her to rest and to
I’ll rely on these two and be fine)

Dying of boredom
I'll try it all
I'll be faint
Like a crook

(It looks and feels great, but look at what it's doing to you
But that's okay, look at how it feels)
