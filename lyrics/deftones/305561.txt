Standing on the edge of the quay
No light flashes on the water for me
Fog in my mind darkness in my eyes
Silently screaming for a distant sound


Ripple river yellows
Rising for a breath of breeding and drowns
Stillness overcomes me in the night
Listen to the rising water moan

I'm waiting, waiting for the nightboat 
I'm waiting, waiting for the nightboat!

Shadows all through me shudder away
Echo me echo me 
Am I alone or is the river alive cause it
Echoes me echoes me echoes me

I'm waiting, waiting for the nightboat
Waiting, waiting for the nightboat!

I'm waiting...
I'm waiting for the nightboat
Waiting for the nightboat! 
Waiting for the nightboat!
I'm waiting...
I'm waiting for the nightboat
For the nightboat!!!
