I won't stop following you
Now help me pray for
The death of everything new
Then we'll fly farther
Cause you're my girl
And that's all right
If you sting me
I won't mind
We'll stop to rest on the
Moon and we'll make a fire
I'll steal a carcass for you
Then feed off the virus
Cause you're my girl
And that's all right if you
Sting me I won't mind
Now look at em
Look at em now
Look at em sting
I see a red light in June
And I hear crying
You turn newborn baby blue
Now we're all the virus
