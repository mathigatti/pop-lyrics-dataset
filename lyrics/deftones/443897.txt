You're so sweet
Your smile
Your pussy
And your bones
You're on fire
You move me
Like music
With your style


Let me think (and you think about what?) about girls
(And what else?) and money, and new clothes
(And what do I get?) thirty nights (uh huh)
Of violence (yeah), and sugar, to love

Come here come here
closer to the lung
So I can I can
Shove her over railing

You're sweet
but I'm tired
Of proving
This love
See you're a bore
But you move me
Like a movie
That you love
