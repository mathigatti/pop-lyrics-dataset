No more gold lights
For the queen earth
To keep you warm
In your kingdoms


High... On the waves you make for us!
But not since you left have the waves come!

The bar is dead
And the rockets rain is keeping you wet in your deathbed

So high... On the waves you made for us!
And not since you left have the waves come
High... On the waves you made for us!
Not since you left have the waves come
(Have the waves come)
To Nadja, Love - Jesus
