It's not that I care
Truly
But you're that girl
With sharp teeth
Who grabs at the walls
And pulls meat down


Well here's my new address
664, oh I forget

It's not like I care
Truly
But you're that girl
With gold teeth
Who snaps at the walls
And won't calm down

Well here's my new address
615, oh I forget
There's all your evidence
Now take it home and run with it

Now, write it down
Now did you get it, get it?

Well here's my new address
6654, oh I confess
There's all your evidence
Now take it home and fuck with it

Now, write it down
Now did you get it, get it?
