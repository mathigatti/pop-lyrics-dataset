I can't breathe and arrive
with style
i'm still a sucker
feeding it pills
with wine, it's tricky how
i'm pushin you back but still you ain't gone
pushing you back but still you ain't gone
pushing you back but still you ain't gone
it makes some sense look
i can't breathe and her eyes are dry
but still i will fuck her to keep alive
plus my arms are still broke
but watch me
push you back but still you ain't gone
(go)
pushing you back but still you ain't gone
pushing you back but still you ain't gone
it makes so much sense oh g-d
she's gone
gone
gone
it's so sad
wait up
i'm a wait right here
right here
it's just gonna wait for me right here
it's funny how it goes
think i'll... sometimes...
yes to all the fuckin world
one minute
one minute ago
there's just one minute ago
i remember
i was all that
gone
say you ain't still
gone
gone
gone
gone
i can't breathe and arrive
with my style
so watch you watch me
fuck her just one more time
wait till my arms heal and i'll
push you back but still you ain't gone
pushing you back but still you ain't gone
pushing you back but still you ain't gone
i'll fuckin push hard
pushing you back but still you ain't gone
pushing you back but still you ain't gone
pushing you back but still you ain't gone
it makes no fuckin sense
