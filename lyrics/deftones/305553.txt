Pohhh!
Murderer!
Covered in sangre 
Murderer! 
Blood on your shoulders 


Karma! 
How does it feel? 
Karma! 
I'll take a life 
Wailing! 
Wailing in vein
Wailing! 
You'll reap what you sow! 

Thou 
Shalt not kill! Shalt not kill! Shalt not Kill! Shalt not kill!

Shalt! Lie to yourself 
Lie to your friends
Now lay and wait you fucking
Rapist! 
You'll have no redemption 
Burn! Burn... 
Burn muthafuckas! 

I might just come after you 
I just might come after...but you'll never know...
Broke the first commandment

Thou 
Shalt not kill! Shalt not kill! Shalt not kill! Shalt not kill!
Face your judgment!
