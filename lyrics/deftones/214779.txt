Like these pistols
And your hair hangs
Blanket over hollow mirror,
We hold black mans hands spy glass
We carefully mold like water lovers


No!!! hear (hear) you changing, and I change you, tattood forever
Make me assist her and i...

When we lay down by our favorite
Ones who scares me and who could hate her
Likes to degrade our own band aid
While we disown mother nature

No!!! hear you changing, and I change you, oh!! and you save
Me...

In my room we're can dance on the floor,
In my room we're can dance on my walls,
In my room we're can dance on my bed...yeah
In my room we're gunna dance on my....head!!!!!

No!! hear you blame me, and I blamed you, no!! hear you changed
Me...(bye? ) i!!

No!! hear you blame me, and I blamed you, no!! well you changed
Me, but I made you!!
Remember her...did (when, and, ? ) I stop!! (x6)
