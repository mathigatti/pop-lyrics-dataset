Let's go away for a while
You and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway
Holiday
Far away
to stay
On a Holiday
Far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat!
Don't bother to pack your bags
Or your map
We won't need them where we're goin'
We're goin' where the wind is blowin'
Not knowin' where we're gonna stay
We will write a postcard
To our friends and family
In free verse
On the road with Kerovac,
Sheltered in Bivovac,
On this road we'll never die...
Let's go away!
