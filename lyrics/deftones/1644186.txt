You're red soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red soaking wet
Let's writhe
Let me see you trip
One move that will keep you wet
Let's fall in a long sadistic trance
Put the keys in our hands


Guns! Razors! Knives!
Fuck with me.
Guns! Razors! Knives!

You're red soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You arrive soaking wet
Let's sail in this sea of charms
Let's drown underneath the stars
Let's drink with our weapons in our hands
Let's sleep in this trance

Guns! Razors! Knives!
Fuck with me.
Guns! Razors! Knives!

You're red soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red soaking wet

Guns razors knives
Fuck with me.
Guns! Razors! Knives!

You're red soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red soaking wet
