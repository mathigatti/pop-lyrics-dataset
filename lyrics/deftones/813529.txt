Two different times
The same kind of thread
Different needles 
Of the world hey! hey! hey!


(and) It's rapture
But it's a different style
(and) It's rapture
The same kind of thread
Go ahead

I can't
I can't feel like
I can't difuse
It feels like

What's inside of me?
I will curse you out from me
It's just two different tools, different pieces
Can't choose one
With power

I know how you are now
You twist everything else around
Now are you fucking with me

Waste...of time

you said you won again, and swear god
you said you swear to god, you won again
you said you swear to god, you won again
you said "I just won again, and I swear to god!"


Instead, you just waste
Waste
Waste my time
Instead you just waste
Waste....my time

What takes it away?
And what makes up for it?
It's just two different views
Different pieces
Can't choose one
With power

I know how you are now
You twist everything else around
Now you're fucking with me
Waste of, waste

I can't
I can't feel like
I can't difuse
It feels like

You said you swear to god, you won again!
You said you won again, you swear to god!
You said you swear to god, you won again!
You said I just won again, and I swear to god!

Instead, you just waste
Waste
Waste my time
just stay just waste
Waste
Waste my time

Two different times
The same kind of thread
Just different needles
The whole world
(and) It's rapture
But it's a different style
(and) It's rapture
Same kind of thread
