I woke up cant wait to eat
Got my cereal boy was I beat
Opened up my fridge and to my dismay
There was no more milk my mother will pay


I want some milk!
My coffee grows cold!
I want some milk!
I should've been told!

I wish I had some God damn milk!
My cheerios just ain't the same
I wish I had some God damn milk!
Too bad the fuckin' milk man never came
I cant go out to the store
I'll just wait till my mother buys more
I'll just have wheat thins and beer
If I get sick the toilet is near

I want some milk!
My coffee grows cold!
I want some milk!
I should've been told!

I wish I had some God damn milk!
My cheerios just ain't the same
I wish I had some God damn milk!
Too bad the fuckin' milk man never came

I want some milk!
My coffee grows cold!
I want some milk!
I should've been told!
