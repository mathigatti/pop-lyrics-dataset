What can I say?
I think I had enough
I think you keep playing to play
Knowing that I feel sick
C’mon just say it
Just say you like to play
This game
Just to drive me wild
I let
You pretend
But you know
Truth is that
I love you to death
Like you love this game
This time, there’s a common thread
And so I sit
And watch you play dumb I’d like to see
You play with the odds
On your plate instead
Come on just say it
Just say you like to keep this pace
Just to drive me wild
I let
You pretend
But you know
Truth is that
I love you to death
Like you love this game
It keeps me hanging tight
What can I say
I think your head’s fucked
Go on drive me wild
This time
There’s a constant thread
This time
There’s a common thread
That keeps me hanging tight
And it
Tells me something’s right
What can I say
I fuckin had enough
I think you just play what you play
Knowing that I feel sick
C’mon just say it
Say you like to play this game
Cuz it drives me wild
