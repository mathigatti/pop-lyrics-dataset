Nothing can save me now
It's what I believe
The slit in the sky when you left
Is all I see


Nothing to sing about
I've bared all my leaves
No vision or dreams about you
Came true for me

Cut through
This razor wire
And dine on your heart
Mine 'till the end

Stuck with illusion now
I drown in your sea
I hope that you first save yourself
And then come for me

Cut through
This razor wire
Dead on your heart
Mine 'till the end

Break through
Collect the wires
And writhe in your heart
Mine 'till the end

Away, a way out, away

Down deep into your veins
All the way, all the away
Down deep in your heart
All the way, all the way

Cut through (a way out)
This razor wire
Mine 'till the end

Break through (away)
Collect the wires (a way out)
And dine on your heart
Mine 'till the end
