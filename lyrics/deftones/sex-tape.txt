Floating on the water ever changing
Picture hours out from that
Into with all our dreams


The ocean takes me into watch you shaking
Watch you weigh your powers
Tempt with hours of pleasure
Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight.. ah
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight

Cruising through the city after hours
With me fusing all our powers
Heres to all our
Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight...ah
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight
