Hear I lay - Chino
Still and breathless - Maynard
Just like always - Chino
Still I want some more - Maynard
Mirrors sideways - Chino
Who cares what's behind - Maynard
Just like always - Chino
Still your passenger - Maynard


The chrome buttons, buckles on leather surfaces - Maynard
These and other lucky witnesses - Maynard
Now to calm me - Chino
This time won't you please... - Maynard
Drive faster! - Chino

Roll the window down - Maynard
This cool night air is curious - Maynard
Let the whole world look in - Maynard
Who cares who sees anything? - Maynard
I'm your passenger - Maynard
I'm your passenger - Maynard

Drop...these down - Chino
Then...and put them on me - Chino
Nice...cool seats there - Chino
To cushion your knees - Chino
Now to calm me - Chino
Take me around again - Maynard
Don't pull over - Chino
This time won't you please - Maynard
Drive faster!!! - Chino

Roll the window down - Maynard
This cool night air is curious - Maynard
Let the whole world look in - Maynard
Who cares who sees what tonight? - Maynard
Roll these misty windows - Maynard
Down to catch my breath again - Maynard
Go and go and don't just - Maynard
Drive me home then back again! - Maynard

Here I lay - Chino
Just like always - Chino
Don't let me - Chino
Go... (9x) - Maynard
Take me to the end... - Chino
