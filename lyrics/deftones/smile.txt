We move, together
We cruise 'till the end
Screwing and shooting our way out


You went to know what it's like?
Then watch this!
You want to feel it again?

You wanted this
Welcome to my world
Now, you want feel it again!

Smile you're born again
Smile you're born again
Do you feel wet?
Do you feel love?

We've sailed through hell knows
They sank, but we float on

You want go for a ride?
It's over, you want feel it again?
You've always said that you knew my worth
And now you want to feel it again!

Smile you're born again
Smile you're born again
Do you feel wet?
Do you feel love?

We cruise, together
It's me and you 'till the end

Smile you're born again
Smile you're born again
Smile you're born again
Smile you're born again

Do you feel wet?
Do you feel love?
