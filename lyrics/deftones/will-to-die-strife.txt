Emptiness again
left alone again
left to question all
that's happened...
and no one cares
and no one cares
all that's left is
the will to die...
try... try to hold
on what's left
inside... empty (and
this emptiness i'm
left with)
reaching (has me
reaching for a
reason)  lonely
(this loneliness
consuming)
searching (i'm
searching for the
answers)  will you
do the same? ...
try... try to find
peace
