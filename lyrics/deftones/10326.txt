Bender (Chino With Sevendust)
Chino: Sweet, contain me around
Only To.. I Spit!


Rose: Step on my disease,
So nice to see me bleed
Step on my disease,
I cannot contain

Chino: Slow it Down.. I'm

Witherspoon: So winded,
I've fallen down… again

Chino: Taste.. The numb of my teeth
Forever it makes me.. Sick!!

Rose: Step on my disease
So nice to see me bleed
Step on my disease
I cannot contain

Chino: Slow it Down.. I'm

Witherspoon: So winded,
I've fallen down… again
I follow the walking dead
Now that you found out somewhat about me,
I wonder how long it will be before you leave

Chino: Slow it down.. I'm

Witherspoon: So winded..

Chino:
Slow it down..

Witherspoon:
I've fallen down.. Again

Chino: Slow it Down, I'm

Witherspoon: So winded,
So end it,
I've fallen down.. Again
I follow the walking dead

Spit!
Stupid Fuck..
