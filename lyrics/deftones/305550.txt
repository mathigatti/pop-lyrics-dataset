The bye byes, die
I swear to god
It'll be done right!


Oh, God (3x)

You come and cry!
I don't really care nowhere
I wish I'd be nice to you
Well its time to fight

I meant it all...
Hide your own way
God....
I will find you...
Your own way...
Go...

You come and cry
I wish I'd be nice!
Oh God...that's somebody shame
Unless you fuck it!
I will watch'em...watch'em...
Go, bye, go, bye...
Now!
Oh good that your late
Pouting back at me
Come on
Over and over
Just don't fight back!

I meant it all...
I live away...no...
I will find you...no...

Oh yeah!
Right!
I meant it all...
I live away...no...
'Cause I will find you...
Your on your way
And there you go...tonight...
