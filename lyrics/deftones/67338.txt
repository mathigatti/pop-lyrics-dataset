I want to sleep if you are awake
Still making believe that you aren't at all crazy


And if you don't believe I think you should
You make me so proud!
Still you love to think you have always been this way, but you're all wrong

And you only sleep when you've lost cause
Well I still believe that the cause was always me

And if you don't believe I think you should
You make so proud!
Still you love to think you have always been this way

Well I'd love to think you will someday feel the same
And you love to think it will always, always
Always
If you still believe it will always be this way...well you're allwrong
Yes you are, insane
