You cannot face the crowd all by yourself
Embrace the power we have


Raise your eyes slowly
Place your faith into me

Your body, it aches to be draped in our delight slowly

Take me in
Face the lights
Free yourself and writhe in them

Sound asleep, hunting
Wide awake, moaning
This body aches to be
Draped in you tonight
Slowly

Take me in
Face the lights
Free yourself and writhe in them
Take me in
Face the crowd
Let yourself, just writhe in them

You cannot face the crowd all by yourself embrace the power we have
This record's ours to break the more we build, the crowd goes wild
Goes wild

Take me in
Face the lights
Free yourself and writhe in them
Take me in
Face the crowd
Let yourself, just writhe in them

You cannot face the crowd all by yourself embrace the power we have
This record's ours to break and the more we build, the crowd goes wild
Goes wild
