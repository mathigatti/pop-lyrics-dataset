I like you when
When you take off your face
Put away all your teeth
And take a swing underneath
Cause you could die if you take it alone


I watch you taste and I see your face
And I know I'm alive
Your shooting stars from the barrel of your eyes
It drives me crazy
Just drives me wild

I kinda like you when
When you make up them real
Take the phone in your room
Stop the tape I'll resume
Well you could try if you think it will load

I watch you taste and I see your face
And I know I'm alive
Your shooting stars from the barrel of your eyes
It drives me crazy
It drives me wild

Every time, every time you try
While
It's a beautiful ride
While
It's a beautiful ride, ride

I watch you taste and I see your face
And I know I'm alive
Your shooting stars from the barrel of your eyes
It drives me crazy
Just drives me wild
