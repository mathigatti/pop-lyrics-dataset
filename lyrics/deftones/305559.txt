Oh, when I think now
It's so unreal
What did I just imagine
Was I awake was I asleep god
Please tell me if it was a dream now
Do you know? That I've been through all this one time before
I forget cuz', I've been drinking,
Too much god damn ale
I can't stand up, I keep falling
God I wish I could go back now
Do you know that I've (I) been through all this one time before
For
Dream
Once again are you okay?
It's just a stupid game we play still don't matter anyway
'Cause we all die anyway, Hey, Oh
We all fall down
Well that's what they tell me
When they tell me yes my ego bleeds
I don't care 'cause we can't be fair
Go!
Oh!
