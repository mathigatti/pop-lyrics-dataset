ah caca, scale skin, left alone
revise me longing
my sister she's my waiting owl
don't stop believing


i'm just the last to kick the cup
you think you know me oh, just shut the fuck up
i keep my word cuz i'm bound to get it right
standin up tall, and i'm jack, i'm jackin, im bustin balls
to get back, and up again, i know my mind is set
why is you still talkin and the world just got to me today
oh, what we say, love and adore yea

my child your child, let him go
leave her believe her my sister she's a waiting owl
ya cant stop believing

i'm just the last to kick the cup
oh you dont know me oh, just shut the fuck up
I keep my word, cuz i'm around to get it right
standin up tall, and i'm jack, i'm jackin, i'm bustin balls
to get back, and up again, i know my mind is set
why is you still talkin and the world just got to me today
oh, what we say, love and adore
what's stolen, oh, when it's over
