You can't talk
I'm anxious
Im off the walls
I'm right here
Just come outside and see it
But pack your heart you might need it


I'll find a way
I'll confuse them
But think i can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you

You're locked up
You exhaled you did it before i seen it
Come outside and breathe in
Relax your arms and let me in

I'll find a way
I'll confuse them
But i think i can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you

I know what to say to take you
Higher, higher
No one else can take you higher
But i will try

I'll find a way
I'll confuse them
But i think i can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try

I'll find a way
I'll confuse them
But i think i can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you
For you
