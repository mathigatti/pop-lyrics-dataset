You surprised me with a kiss
Underneath the crashing waves
You advised me with your tears
Then release your hexes


Right back where you began
Torn apart from the inside
Race back into your skin
By the crawl you bring

You invite me to your face
In between the acid rains
Hypnotize me with your kiss
Then release your hexes

Right back where you began
Torn apart from the inside
Race back into your skin
By the crawl you bring

By the crawl, by the crawl
By the crawl, by the crawl
By the crawl
