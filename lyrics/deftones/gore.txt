Deep in this dream we are locked in
I've pulled you in
Now our bodies are wet
There is blood on the beaches
I brought you into this don't deny yourself


Smile, now you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise. You're now running the game

We lay in the gore of our voices
Oh we writhe in them
At night we assemble the hunt for out prizes
I hooked you in the way
You should try yourself

Smile now you're all set
Surprise you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise not you're running the game

We'll slip right through these gates together someday

Lost in these dreams we arrive in
I know you well
Develop the taste that will tie us together
I put you in this game
Just remind yourself

Smile, now you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise, you're now running the game
Smile, now you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise, you're now running wild

We'll slip right through these gates together someday
We'll slip right through these gates together forever

Smile, now you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise, you're now running the game
Smile, now you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise you're home
