Goddamn you half-Japanese girls
Do it to me every time
Oh the redhead said you shred the cello
And I'm jello baby
But you won't talk, won't look, won't speak to me
I'm the epitome, of Public Enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me


I'm a lot like you so please
Hello, I'm here I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

I asked you to go to the Deftones concert
You said you never heard of them
How cool is that?
So I went to your room and read your diary:
Watching grunge leg drop New-Jack through a presstable
and then my heart stopped:
Listening to Cio-Cio San, fall in love all over again

I'm a lot like you so please
Hello, I'm here I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me
