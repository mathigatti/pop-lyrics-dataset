(So)

You know what you can't come floppin' dat shit
If you run up guess what i'm stoppin' dat shit
Still can't figure out nothin' or find flaws
Take the pauls better recognize bodies on the lawn
If you see such, might touch, home is the crutch
Roll the dutch with the bunch of we never have enough
Hold steady for the lyrical melee with deli-cate rhymes
An alphabetical order of one at a time
Should we break it up welcome the true while you fearin' it
And looking at the youth whatcha gonna do they hearin' it
Don't hate your face still in the air lookin at
You made me twist you up your all crooked now
Take a step back sucker you got spit on
Payback comin' from all those you shit on


(Why)

Whatcha gonna do
I got mad crew
You on the camera
Guess what? I see you

(So What)

Whatcha gonna do
I got mad crew
You on the camera
Bitch what? I see you

Check the mic cord every place I roam
And all the bullshit cease when I pull my chrome
It's automatic, drastic the way I blow you
Incredible and unforgettable
I make you bounce to the rhythm what counts I hit em
Straight ounce of venom and great amounts of visim
I'm the psycho lookin' for the prey
All the way out in the boondocks with the AK on

(Why)

Whatcha gonna do
I got mad crew
You on the camera
Guess what? I see you

(So What)

Whatcha gonna do
I got mad crew
You on the camera
Bitch what? I see you

The hand on the clocks tickin', the plot thickens time
Runnin out you can't hide from the gat clickin' punk
Hit the floor rhyme to even the score people
We'll be hearin' about the way ya were in folklore cuz
(MC's) amaze and the people you knew were rippin' up
Rollin' em up with weed then spliff em I got the need
Say (WHAT WHAT) on something to pump up
Jump up just like a record that cut up
Try to nut up think it's funny
I'll wrap your ass up like the mummy
With rhymes, suckas they run from me
Wanna get away, that's a better way, ya heard
Tell me the word and kilts comin' with poison verbs
And vocab sucka's be leavin' out on the slab

(why)

Whatcha gonna do
I got mad crew
You on the camera
Guess what? I see you

(so what)

Whatcha gonna do
I got mad crew
You on the camera
Bitch what? I see you

(So what)
Whatcha gonna do
I got mad crew
You on the camera
Guess what? I see you

(so what)

Whatcha gonna do
I got mad crew
You on the camera
Bitch what? I see you

(So What, So What)
