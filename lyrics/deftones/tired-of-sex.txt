I'm tired of having sex
I'm spread
so thin
I don't know who I am
Monday night I'm makin' Jen
Tuesday night I'm makin' Lyn
Wednesday night I'm makin' Catherine oh, why can't I
be makin' Love come true?

ashamed of what I said
I'm sorry,

I know I'm a sinner but I can't say no


Thursday night I'm makin' Denise
Friday night I'm makin' Sharise
Saturday night I'm making Louise oh, why can't I be
making Love come true?
