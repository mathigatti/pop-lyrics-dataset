Gracie, we're makin babies, yea, we're barefoot on the tiles
we make 'em soft and small and tender,
it's the biggest hazard of your gender
gotta hold it by yourself
Gracie, hold yourself together, it's bad now but it gets better
we're all here to help


everything is swollen, everything is swell... everybody's watching

they all wanna see it kick

pleasure is your crime, junior is your punishment
happens all the time, everybody rub it in.

It ain't hard to find fault in any thing you do,
we learned to love the hard way, you're gonna learn it too.
