Emptiness again left alone again
Left to question all that's happened...
And no one cares and no one cries
All that's left is the will to die...
Try... try to hold on what's left inside...
Empty (And this emptiness i'm left with)
Reaching (Has me reaching for areason)
Lonely(This loneliness consuming)
searching (I'm searching for the answers)
Will you do the same? ...
Try...
Try to find peace
