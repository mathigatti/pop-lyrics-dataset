Yeah!
This ain't no motherfuckin' stick up, put the stick up
And watch it roll real close, rolling out of my hand 'til
It cracks to that fucking dome, living off the curb
I bet you fuck up, I tell it so why, Do you dig many in '93
Been making them fools go 'bout, bumping around me
You'll want to see from underground
To that was the live from the verb
On the beats I won't see your fuckin' head


Peers - Hi whore - and mother she
Won't drain herself, And won't be caught in
And live in a big world - say just because

My life's unrise wipe
Lyrical did
Because my life's unrise wipe
Lyrical did
I get more shit out
Bringin' in because
My life's unrise wipe
Lyrical did
Because my life's unrise wipe
Lyrical badaba did

Get straight quickly
Making fools go down, bumping around me
You'll want to see from underground
To that side five blocks from the verb
Now 'cause he can't see you fuckin' head

Peers - Hi whore - and mother she
Won't drain herself, And won't be caught in your stick
She did what, She did what, She did what, She did...

Because my life's unrise wipe
Lyrical did
Because my life's unrise wipe
Lyrical did
I get into shit
Bringin' in because
My life's unrise wipe
Lyrical did
Let me to
Lyrical did
Bringin' to the
Wipe Did, Wipe Did
Love mother...in
Cut it in!

That's why lyrical (2x)
Bringin' in because
My life's unrise wipe
Lyrical did
Motherfucker wipe
Lyrical did
Make it to the
Wipe Did, Wipe Did (2x)
No More!
