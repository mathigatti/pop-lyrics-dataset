Born in another world that i thought, was my life a completed lie??
Why this chimes i hold inside are chillin' an innocent mind??
Grow the truth behind all lies and my isms are gettin' blind!!
Lust ya life, i feel proud inside 'cos i just begin to fly...


-say!! i can fly!! chillers!!! among tha sky.
I grab your world, i jump thru the sky...
I feat my life and i provoke you to fly...

Born to lick the tongue from the heaven that's flaming away!!!
A subtle passion of da "snowboard" ... ripen in ya heart a'liked a cursed;
Since the loose procesed of the times 'n the iced falls, i feel fuckin' rage,
Another trick to bleed the plague that hunts me until the end... and its a vague pain that
Influences me to fuck fly ya sequel!!!

-pray!! let me fly!! chillers!!! that burn the sky...
-pray!! i can fly!! chillers!!! tear the sky.
I grab your world, i jump to the sky...
I feat my life and i provoke you to fly...

Method.real life to loose...
Method.ostentate a new life...
Method.real life to loose...
Method.ostentate a new life...
