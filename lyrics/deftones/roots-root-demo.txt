He knows all this time
Yeah keeps em worrying
Till the diest of the time begins
No one begins ahead
No one to get tired
My soul repays
He caught him dead, because


He doesn't seem to know where he's tired
And some days I'm not all, it's
It's so shallow
Pushing fast ahead
I'm already dead
We go under

For means he choosed at that moment
No one inside
Is giving me not the dead
I love the way
She reaches out to people
They were groveling indoors
They will lick you in the bed
Saying please come home

Just be, Tried breaking free, but the tops still up
But don't look like that, they teach in forgetting what, what
Tire long, wrong with me, leave me going insane
They need this head bang, they leave up,
They come out, they don't get mine
To all the people who knows what thing's fakin' her,
They're dead right, they got the tape, but they know what
Blessed for me, but in it for no, I like to see me other than the own

Do look across
Inside the days I'll bring
We celebrate now
And bring
Can't you?
Yeah
Bring..
Away
