You should know (by now) really
That this could end, really
You should know i could never make it work
Wake up
Let's pretend, really
Really
Babe


Do you like the way the water tastes
Like god's fire
For you but you could never say
Then come forth cause its coming round
Round the water

Beware the water

You should know
Babe
At least pretend you did know why
Its not like you watch so go on take a drink, really babe

Do you like the way the water tastes
Like gunfire
You knew but it was never safe
Take one more cuz its coming round
Round the water

Beware the water

Beware the water

Teeth are dry
From wind blows
If you come drinkin
There you go

Beware the water

Beware the water

Beware the water

Do you like the way the water tastes
Do you like the way the water tastes?
