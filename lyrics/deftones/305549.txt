Remember that one time
I bit you on the arm
I was just afraid of
The solitude of being in love
I want to be in your house
Right now
Make you stand by the sink
I swear to keep away
I can show you things
Like fire and more
Remember that time
I kicked the TV over


For months
I'm sharing lungs
I cant talk to her
Cause she'll throw rocks at me

I might never see you again
I hope we fix
And stay special plus
I ain't trying to start a fight
But if only I could pull you in
For a moment I know this
That's so sweet
Battle stations please guard us
To marry me me
Don't lean on me
Cause I'll fuck you till the morning
so stick

For months
I'm sharing lungs
I cant talk to her
Cause she'll throw rocks at me

Spinning in her arms inside
And be listening to know
She knows when I look
My music
My lung is in the top drawer
By now I've got her inside of me
As long as we sleep right now
As long as we sleep right now

For months
I'm sharing lungs
I cant talk to her
Cause she'll throw rocks at me
She'll throw rocks at me

For months
I'm sharing lungs
I cant talk to her
Cause she'll throw rocks at me
