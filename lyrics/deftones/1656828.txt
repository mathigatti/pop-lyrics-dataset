Floating under water
Ever changing
Picture hours out from land
In tune with all our dreams
The ocean takes me
In to watch you shake it
Watch you wave your powers
Tempt with hours of pleasure


Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I’m out of my head

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight, I
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight, we ride

Cruising through the city
After hours
With me fusing all our powers
Here’s to all our dreams

Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I’m out of my head

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight, tonight, I
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight, we ride
