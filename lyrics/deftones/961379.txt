The earth
Will see our eyes
Go blank tonight
The earth will rot away
Go blank tonight


I
I really wish these snakes were your arms
I
I really wish you'd make up your mind

The earth
Disguised a way
Don't blink tonight
The earth
Will see our eyes
Don't blink tonight

I
I really wish these snakes were your arms
I
I really wish you to make up your mind

I
I really wish these snakes were your arms
I
I really wish you'd make up your mind
