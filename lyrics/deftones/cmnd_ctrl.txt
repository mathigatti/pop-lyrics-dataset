I can't tell
how fish aint on my floor
it's a department
and i feel like they should


and I take commands just because I can
oh I can just imagine the difference at all

straight out of your mind
you see im well aware
you're out of your mind
its straight

I said your name
it slipped off my tounge
pointed at the camera laughing at you
haha
once again you see no one cares
its how you wear it, not why it hurts

straight out of your mind
you see im well aware
you're out of your mind
straight out

i can't tell, how's this shit not your fault
bitch you're barbaricing off this earth
switching command just because i can
i'd like to see you wear it
why can't I stare

Switching command just because I can
and if I let my guard down
who knows what day
once again
just because I can
just because I can
