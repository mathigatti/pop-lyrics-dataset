Paint the streets in white!
Death is the standard
Breach for a complex prize!


I think it's sweet of you
And your parents are proud
But I would expect it from anyone
Now to protect life's indigenous sound!

Worship! Play, play
Worship! Play! Worship! Play
Worship! Worship!
Worship! Play, play
Worship! Play! Worship! Worship!

How the streets they swell!
While the animals make their way through the crowds!

If you keep listening you can hear it for miles
God, I trust everyone quicker with every faint smile!

Worship! Play, play
Worship! Worship!
Worship! Play, play
Worship! Worship!
Worship! Play, play
Worship! Worship!
Worship! Play, play
Worship! Worship! Worship!

And the crowd goes wild!
And the camera makes you seasick!
God it's so sweet of you and I know you're proud
And the car bomb hits quick click, faint smile!
It's the same sound... It's the same, same sound
And the crowd goes wild!
And the camera makes you seasick!
God it's so sweet of you and you know I'm proud
And the car bomb tick ticks with the same sound!
Its the same sound! With the same sound
