They'll come soon 
I keep waiting...and I wait...
Won't somebody...save me.... 


And if you're feeling lucky...come and take me home 
And if you feel loved
If you feel lucky, if you feel loved 
If you feel lucky, if you feel loved 

You've crossed the walls - Excelled 
Further along through their hell 
All for my heart, I watch you kill 
You always have, you always will 
Now spread your wings and sail out to me.... x2

So if you're feeling lucky...come and take me home. 
Come and take me home. x4

Yeah if you feel love...
(If you feel lucky, if you feel loved) x6

Crossed the walls - Excelled 
Further along through their hell 
For my heart 
I watch you kill 
You always have 
You always will 

You always have and always will 
You always have 
You always will 
Spread your wings and sail out to me...
