Universe surrounds
When you're ready
It waits for us to leave this earth
Come on
Their calling the name out


I don't know I could stay or leave
Either away
'Cause a comet could take us all away through

Goodbye
Say heaven, no noo-ohhhh
I'll be waving, goodbye

Return to see everything looks the same
I dont know if the change made was great
'Cause the craving was made the same

Goodbye
Say heaven, no noo-ohhhh
I'll be waving, goodbye

I'll be waving

Goodbye
