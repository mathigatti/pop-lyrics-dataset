To the edge
'Till we all get off
I will take you away with me
Once and for all


Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
And shower me into the same
Realm

Calculate our embrace, hold on
Come with me now
Run away outer space with me
Once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
And shower me into the same
Realm

Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
And I will lead us to the same
Realm

Get set

When the coffin shakes
And the needle breaks
Come, run away with me
Come on, you'll see, once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
And shower me into the same
Realm

Time will lead us to the same
Realm
I will lead us to the same
Realm
