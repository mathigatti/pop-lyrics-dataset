She breaks her horses
With strange distant voices
That travel through the air
She tames me with her voices
As she plays around with her forces
That travel through the air
Ooh the distant howling out
Keeps you floating around
Ohh distant howling out forces
Floating around
She breaks her horses
With strange distant voices
That travel through the air
