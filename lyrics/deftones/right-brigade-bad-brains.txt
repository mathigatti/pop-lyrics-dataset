You can't disappear anymore
I see your face lurking outside the window
You say you're a trife I'm a bore
You touch yourself put your face in the pillow
But the funny thing about you is
You remembered to leave it behind
And the funny thing about me is
I'm a member of the Right Brigade
Makes no difference to me what side you choose
What side will lose
All there is to perceive is what I want
And I Know how to get it
But the funny thing about you is
You remembered to leave it behind
And the funny thing about me is
I'm a member of the Right Brigade
Right Brigade!
Right Brigade!
