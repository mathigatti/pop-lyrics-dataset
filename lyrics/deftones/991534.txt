Through the air and time 
We came to see her 
Where the sun collides 
She carried us all 


For the first time 
I wish she'd call 
I wish she'd come 

And to blame or thanks ??? 
You could bury us all ??? 

For the first time 
I wish she'd call 
I wish she'd come 
I wish she'd come 

The more you wait 
The more you burn 
Before we break...through 

For the first time 
I wish she'd come 
For the first time 
I wish she'd come (x9)
I wish she...
