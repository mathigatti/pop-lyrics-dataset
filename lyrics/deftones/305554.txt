Ready?
Huh, okay my dick is small this time
My dick is messin' up your call
So, make her think that maybe you'll survive
Well, if you can't do that at least I take a little to the bridge
Yes shit that straight up,
Yes, they're pissin' me off to the point to get it out,
And screw all the fats that doing shit,
Fuck, what, its getting body going down what, what
What it, it's nothing but crazy shit, so we're gonna say..


And too many people
And too many freaks
And too many eyeballs starin' at me

Well they're too many people
And too many freaks
Too many eyeballs starin' at me
Go!

Well okay maybe if I'd a give it what you'd got,
And say what's true yo, but if it is a note, let's get it on flow,
I've got to wait for mine, they say which you gotta which you don't know,
It don't matter to me, say, a girls about to wet her thing,
Won't smile for gus, but don't give fuck,
Singin' about the word, the bounce to get down and it's all,
But then get that your mouth with it hey for one more time..

Because there's too many people
And too many freaks
Too many eyeballs staring at me

Huh there's too many people
And too many freaks, yeah
And too many eyeballs staring at me

And too many freaks
Too many eyeballs staring at me

And too many freaks, well
And too many eyes balls staring at me

And too many freaks
Too many eyeballs staring at me

Huh and too many people yeah
And too many people freaks
And too many eyeballs staring at me

And too many eyeballs staring at me
