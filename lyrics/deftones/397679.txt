So run!
Right!
Right back to school!
Check it
Look back I sift through all the cliques
Roaming' the halls all year, making me sick
While everyone's out tryin to make the cut
What?
And when you think you know me right — I switch it up
Behind the walls smokin' cigarettes and sippin' vodka
I hop a fance to catch a cab, ain't no one can stop us
Give me a break about some other mess
What were you?
Act like it's everything you got!


Push back the square
Now that you need her — 'cause you don't
Well there you go!
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all
So

Stop that, quit! — All that, quit!
Who ruined it? You did! Now grab a notebook and a pen
Start taking notes, I'm being everyone who's on the top
You think we're on the same page — but, no we're not!
I'll be the man, watch your backpack and the pencils
Just like Keith, I'm flipping it, while you just keep it simple
You just can't go wrong rocking' the clothes
Copying the stance
'Cause really is everything that you got!

Push back the square
Now that you need her — 'cause you don't
Well there you go!
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all
So

Transpose
Or stop your lies
It's what you do
Transpose
Or stop your lies

So run!
So why don't you run, so why don't you run!
So why don't you run back to school!
So why don't you run, so why don't you run!

'Cause
All you are - Now I'm on the next page (page, page, page)
All you are - It's time to close the book up (book up, book up)
All you are - I'm on the next page (page, page, page)
All you are - Close the book up now!

Push back the square
Now that you need her — 'cause you don't
Well there you go!
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all
So

We are
We are the leaders of all
We are
We are the leaders of all

So run!
So why don't you run, so why don't you run!
So why don't you run back to school!
So why don't you run, so why don't you run!
