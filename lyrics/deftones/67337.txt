"...it's hella sensitive..."

Always the same old taste just new injury 
Well I'll wear the claws if you'd like that 
Yeah if you'd like that we can ride on a blackhorse 
A great new wave Hesperian deathhorse 
I can call you when I get back 


Yeah when I get back I will call 
But don't speak don't say nothing 
In case we ever do meet again 
Something's wrong with you 
Well I hope we never do meet again 

You always sharpen your teeth cause you're like that 
And you're like that everytime you pull heart back 
And her compacts carving deeper in your lap 
I would call but I forget where the phone is at 
Guess I'll talk to you when I get back 

Yeah when I get back I will talk 
But don't speak don't say nothing 
In case we ever should meet again 
There are some things wrong with you 
I hope we never do meet again. 
I hope we never do meet again. 
I hope we never do meet again. 
Something's wrong with you...and I hope we never do meet again.x3

Don't speak don't say nothing 
In case we ever do meet again 
Something's wrong with you...and I hope we never do meet again.
And I hope we never do meet again. x7
