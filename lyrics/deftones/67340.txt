In waves the ships have all sailed to the sea 
Well do you wanna wait or leave with me tonight 
Cross your heart and pray 
The ocean will take us all the way in... 


First we are ever to fall off of the earth... 
We must be the...
First ones in the world to fall off of the earth

We could be...soon as our needs are fed 
You'll give in to me and the whole heartache 
Makes me feel alive, same typical offering 
And you always knew we make it all the way in... 

First we are ever to fall off of the earth... 
We must be the...
First ones in the world to fall off of the earth

It could be soon...as.... 
The carnivals empty, I need you to take me home...
God help! x10 - octavian
