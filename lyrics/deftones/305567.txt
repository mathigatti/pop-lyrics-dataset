Long goes the night
Longer the day
Teclo your death
Will send me to my grave


I learned to beg
I learned to pray
Send me his love
Send him to me again

Let me ride (x2)
Let me ride on his grace for a while
Let me ride (x2)
Just let me ride on his grace for a while

Long goes the night
Longer the day
Teclo your death
Will send me to my grave

Let me ride (x2)
Just let me ride on his grace for a while
Let me ride (x2)
Just let me ride on your grace for a while

Just let me ride
