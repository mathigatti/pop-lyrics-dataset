Sleep in this hole
Stinging in your eyes
Ashamed
For you, cause


So far, I've been down thats true

Shake in lie
About to fall
Ashamed
For you, cause

So far I've been down thats true
Except for your arms

You start, stand still
And shove regret back at me
Ask you why
Whats up?
Ask you why
One, two
Why, why
Why, why

Soon I've been you
Laughter, sigh
Im so ashamed
For you, cause

So far I've been down thats true
Except for your arms

You start, stand still
And shove regret back at me
Ask you why
Whats up?
Ask you why
One, two
Why, why
Why, why

This feeling gets old
And so do your eyes
This is why
I hate you, cause

So far, I've been down thats true
Except for you're arms, you just

Smile, stand still
While you look right back at me

You start, stand still
And shove regret back at me
Ask you why
Whats up?
Ask you why
One, two
Why, why
Why, why
