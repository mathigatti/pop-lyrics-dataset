In the winds of your cape
I’ve sailed with you
From the shore to the gates
We sway…
We’re alive somewhere else
Far ahead of our time…
In a game of display we break in two
We perform the ornate escape…
We’re alive somewhere else
Still asleep someplace new
We’re ahead of our time
Floating through…
The sky is falling down
This night belongs to you
Forty years in the winds
I’ve played with you.
For the rest of our days i’ll remain
The sky is falling down
The night is calling you
A star is burning out
The sky belongs to you
We’re alive somewhere else
Still asleep someplace new
Far ahead of our time
