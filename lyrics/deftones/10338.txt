The Chauffeur
Out on the tar plains the glides are moving
All looking for a new place to drive
You sit beside me so newly charming
Sweating dewdrops glisten freshing your side
And the Sun drips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart
Way down the lane away living for another day
The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze
Swim seagull in the sky towards some hollow western isle
My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze
And the Sun drips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart
Sing Blue Silver
And watching lovers part I feel you smiling
What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind
To tear out from your eyes with a word to stiffen brooding lies
But I'll only watch you leave me further behind
And the Sun drips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart
Sing Blue Silver
Sing, Sing Blue Silver
