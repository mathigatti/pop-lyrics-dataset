she halts the roads, she waits for a new face
The arms red and injured she wants to rise
she can't till we have faced
I'll cut your armies down, and turn your heart!!!


You wait, I'll wait
I'll lie awake for you

I'll cut your armies down, and turn your heart!!!

You wait, I'll wait
I'll fly away
I'll break
dowwwwwnnnnnn

She halts the road, she waits for a new face
