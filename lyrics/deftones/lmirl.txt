I don't miss you
I don't care where you are now
You're a ghost to me
Left with my taste in your mouth
Take it away somewhere new


I am used to it
This body is here, but I'm gone
When I rewake
I'll rewake anyway

In a new realm
Just to stray myself
You might just get used to it

And you smile (smile)
And I descend on these waves
Slip into the calming waves

You'll notice
That you strained my will
So I'll put this gun to my head

And I'll smile (smile)
And I'll descend on these waves
Slip into these calming waves
Deep into the calming waves

We have created
Now we're gone

And I will reawake again
Never found myself
I've come right out of my shell

Slip into the calming waves
Deep into the calming waves
Slip into the calming waves

Deep into right now
Bare witness
Free burn right now
