Inside of this hole you create
You hide from yourself
You separate every belief
That is true and


You spent your life
Attached to this poison
You don't feel anything out of your way
And it's true that

You spent your life
Trapped in this void where
You will stay away

Can't rid of this part of you rotting in
The same cold space
You don't want to feel anything new
You've decided

To spent your life
Safe from emotion
This way you'll never be harmed again
Or confused now

You spent your life
Trapped in this void where
You will stay away

You waste your life
Relaxed in your void and
You will drain all of it

You spent your life
Trapped in your void where
You will stay away

You waste your life
Relaxed in your void where
You will stay away

You spent your life
Trapped in your void where
You will stay away

Always wasted your life
Attached to this poison
You were to blame all of it
