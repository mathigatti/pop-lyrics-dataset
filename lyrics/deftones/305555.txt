Oh, I try
They can't say I didn't try
I waited by a smaller child, Oh...
Tried to leave her
When she says I'll never love again
I wave my head in shame
In memories
And more
This love, I share
I share it, with you
Drunken
Water, water
Please stay
I wanna love again
Only...
Feeling stuck
Into my shallow public choice
I wave my head in shame
In memories
And more
This love, I share
I share it, with you
Drunken
Water, water
Stop sittin' and passin' on everything that I'd ever do
It's not worth to


I made the chance right by you
Oh.. Oh Oh!!
So tired of lettin' go
So tired of lettin' go and check
So tired of lettin' go
I'm so tired
It's so alright
Alright
