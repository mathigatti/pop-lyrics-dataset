Carrying prose
Broke my real friend
The devil might steady
We wax and we wane
The devil might steady
We wax and wane
(x4)
Licking alms
The devil might steady
Rattling we'll taste
We wax and we wane
The devil might steady
We wax and wane
(x4)
Caring is a bury gin shot
The devil might steady
Up 'till the wee wanes
Oh, we laugh in their faces
The devil might steady
We wax and wane
(x8)
