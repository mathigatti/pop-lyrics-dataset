I'll stick you
A little
Enough... to take your oxygen... away
I'll... set you on fire
'Cause I'm... on fire
And I'm with you alone
I'm so... into... this whore
Be afraid
I might... lose her
So forget about me
'Cause I'll stick you


Pushed back the square
Now that you kneed her - in the throat
Well there you go!
Cause back in school
We are the leaders of all

Transpose
Or stop your life
It's what you do

Pushed back the square
Now that you kneed her - but you don't
So there you go!
Cause back in school
We are the leaders of all

So transpose...
Or stop your life
It's what you do
Transpose
Or stop your life
... what you do

Pushed back the square
Now that you kneed - in the throat
Now there you go!
Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all

You are
All you are
Is meat
Now pass the flask
