Can you explain to me how
You're so evil how
It's too late for me now
There's a hole in the earth
I'm out


There's a hole in the earth
I'm out

Can you explain to me now
If you're still able while I stay
I think you know the truth
There's a hole in the earth
I'm out

Hey all of my friends
They are lost in (sometimes)
There's a hole in the earth
I'm out
There's a hole in the earth

Let's take a bow
This is the end
Somewhere
This is the end
Somewhere

There's a hole in the earth
There's a hole in the earth
Hey all of my friends
I'm out
There's a hole in the earth
Away somewhere
