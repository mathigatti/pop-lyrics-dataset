Hey princess, lay back in your chair
Show us your geometry, see if I stare


Pink cigarette, white see-through dress
And a black-gold veil
Ornate headdress, my temptress
Wield your staff and your grail
Vows, secrets, wake me when
It's my turn to walk through

Caught deep in your every curve
Primed and ready for battle
Lift your veil now formulate
With the sound by yourself

As her words draw you in
Our faith reconnects

And our hearts they collapse
At the words

Now come to me in your glitz and your glam
Place your heart down step back
And watch this

Blank featured, vile creatures
Collapse at your ankles
Fire breather, snake eater
Relax as we hail her
Vows, secrets, guide me when
It's my turn to walk through

Don't turn around, look back to see it
Just hang on and formulate
And believe it by yourself

As her words draw you in
Our faith reconnects
And our hearts they collapse
From the words we intake
And now relate like I relate
Until your faith reconnects
Now relate like I relate
To the words

We are enlightened
We stare and behold
We commit to your being
We belong, we belong
Deep in your circle
Trapped in your grace
Wrapped in your prism walls
We will stay
