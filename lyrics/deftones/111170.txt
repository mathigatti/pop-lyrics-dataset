If only tonight we could sleep
In a bed made of flowers
If only tonight we could fall
In a deathless spell


If only tonight we could slide
To deep black water
And breathe
And breathe... Ohhh...

And an angel would come
With burning eyes like stars
And bury us deep
In his velvet arms

And the rain would cry
As our faces slipped away
And the rain would cry
Don't let it end...[x2]
