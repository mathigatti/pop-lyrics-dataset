(verse1)
"some people think that they can get behind your back and
they
can say whatever they wanna, 
but you see I can't let em get away whether because it's wrong
or no I'm not gonna


you can sit and lie in your bed, you can think and think then
come
up with an answer, but people who say foolish things they say
you said words that I'd rather not mention 
(chorus1)
well it won't get to me the right way is the way that I see it
won't
bring me down it won't 
(verse2)
the people learn that the people that think that they can get
right
behind your back and do what they wanna,
but you see I can't let em get away whether because it's wrong
or no I'm not gonna

you can sit and lie in your bed, you can think and think then
come
up with an answer,
but people who say foolish things they say you said words that
I'd
rather not mention

(chorus2) 
well I will not let it be, judging from the way that I see it
won't
bring me down, it won't

(bridge)
and they can get behind your back and say what they want and
think it's right when til the time, 
when you get sick of putting up with all them,
well now I'm here in my home I'm (in my own mind) thinking about
the way
I've been accepting this youth (these views) i've always took,
am
I wasted ?

SO NOW I FALL, DOWN TO MY DEATH.
YOU CAME AND TOOK IT UPON YOUR OWN.
BUT YOU CAN'T TAME A DOG THAT'S DEAD.
YEAH."
