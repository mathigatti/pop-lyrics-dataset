I taste you much better
Off teeth taste
Of white skin on red leather
Check the claws we got


Night time, cavity, come in
Downtown, pony, work your pitch

I came to in feathers
Like leaves taste
You rub me together
With claws like we go

Night time, cavity, come in
Downtown, pony, work your pitch

Day time, dancer, I'll come inside
Got my, teacher, now carve your niche

Check the claws

It's yours
It's yours
Your turn to come inside

Night time, cavity, come in
Downtown, pony, work your pitch

Daytime, dancer, I'll come inside
Got my, teacher, carve your niche
