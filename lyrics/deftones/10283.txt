I climbed your arms
Then you pulled away
A new cavity moved into
My heart today
The more she sings
The more it seems
Now


Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
New you

I drove you home
Then you moved away
New cavity moved into
My heart today
The more I scream
The more it seems
Now I'm through

Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
New you
