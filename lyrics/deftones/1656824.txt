I can't tell
How's this shit all my fault?
It's a department I fill but they should
And I send commands
Just because I can
Oh, I can just imagine the difference it has


Straight out of your mind
You see I'm well aware
You're out of your mind
Straight

I said you name
It slipped off my tongue
Pointed at the camera, laughing at you (HAHA)
Once again
You see, no one cares
It's how you wear it, not what it says

Straight out of your mind
You see I'm well aware
You're out of your mind
Straight out

I can't tell
But how this shit not your fault?
Bitch, you're barbaric, King Kong, get some!
Switching command
Just because I can
I like to see you wear it, why can't I stare?

Switching command
Just because I can
And if I let my guard down
Who know what then?

Once again
Just because I can
Just because I can.
