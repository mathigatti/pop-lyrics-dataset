I meant to come
Back, to put out bliss but the style's
Crumbling, covered, canned
It was sick and now you donâ€™t even know
How it comes shifts
Then gets ruined by you fucking slobs


It's classical
Anyway

I can't help it
It makes me so sick over and over
It sits stiff, bound with no heart
Fine 'cause this is where the separation starts
Arising
I can see it coming over your cloud

It's classical
Anyway
How cool are you?
I remember

I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick

Just a bad call
It's so funny how you think I'm so serious
But that's not it, the thing is
I don't give enough just to give a fuck
You're just plain boring
And you bore me asleep

It's classical
Anyway
How cool are you?
I remember

I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick

I feel sickened
I feel sickened
I feel sickened
I feel sickened
I feel sickened
I feel sickened
I feel sickened
I feel sick

And who the fuck are you anyway, you fuck?
It's making sick sense seeing how you're sticking out
Hardly and hoping money
Please arise up off the fucking knees
And hop off the train for a second
And try to find your own fucking heart

It's classical
Anyway
How cool are you?
I remember

I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick

Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened

I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here

I feel sick
