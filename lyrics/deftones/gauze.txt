It's a mistake
But go ahead and take a side
But watch how you choose
Or be headed for a ride


'Cause I just don't know if I could
I can't stop what you began
I can't fight for what you began

You've opened the gates
Now face the other side
Just go on it's cool
Now head into the fire

I just don't know if I could
I can't stop what you began
I can't fight for what you began
I know what's in side

For you again
Switch on your game
Stop wasting all your time

'Cause surprise it's you
Who'll face what you decide

I think I'd have known about you
I can't stop what you began
I can't fight for what you began
I know what's in side
I know your fate
I know I can't stop what you began
