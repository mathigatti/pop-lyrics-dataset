Universe surrounds
When your ready
It waits for us to leave this earth
Come on
They're calling the name out


I don't know I could stay or leave
Either away
Cause a comet can take us all away through

Goodbye. Safe. Heaven. New. New world
I'll be waving
Goodbye safe. Heaven. New. New world
I'll be waving goodbye

Return to see everything looks the same
I don't know if the change made was great
Cause the craving remains the same

Goodbye. Safe. Heaven. New. New world
I'll be waving
Goodbye safe. Heaven. New. New world

I'll be waving

Goodbye...
