It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade
(Jonah doing Boy George)
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time
(Jonah doing George Michael)
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard


(Chino doing Simon LeBon)
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
(Jonah doing George Michael joins in)
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing is
(Jonah doing Bono joins in)
The bitter sting of tears
(Jonah doing Bono)
And the Christmas bells that are ringing
Are clanging chimes of doom
Well, tonight thank God it's them instead of you.

(Jonah) And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time.
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
(Chino) Oh-oh
(Jonah) Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

(Grady)Here's to you
(Jonah)raise a glass for everyone
(Grady)Here's to them
(Jonah)underneath that burning sun
(Everyone)Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Chorus (Everyone)
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again
