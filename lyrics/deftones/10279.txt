You like attention
It prove to you you're alive
Stop parading your angles
Confused? You'll know when you're ripe

With all this space
Thick with honey
But I lost my taste

You're into depression
Cause it matches your eyes
Stop the faux to be famous
Confused? You'll know when you're ripe

When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control

With all this space
Thick with honey
But I lost the taste

You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control

You're pregnant
With all this space
Thick with honey
But I lost the taste

You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control

When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control

When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control

When you're ripe
