One of these days you'll break me of many things.
Some cold white day, but you're crazy if you think I would leaveyou this way...


You should wake up (wake up) before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off (take off) before the wrathcomes...soon

And one of these days I pray it will be sometime soon.
On a day like today, you'd be crazy not to want me to teach youthe way...

You should wake up (wake up) before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off (take off) before the wrathcomes...please

Well I know what you're like
I've read it on the walls
You're too tired, you choose heaven over the earth and me butcome on please...

You should wake up (wake up) before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off (take off) before the wrath comes...
Well maybe you should take off
Yeah you should take off (take off).
