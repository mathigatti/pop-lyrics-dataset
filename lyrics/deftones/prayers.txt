There's a new strange
Godless demon awake, inside me
There's a force divine
Terrorizing the angels I keep
While we dream


Prayers (prayers)
Lay on the line (lay on the line)
You'll never be free
You'll never be free
(Free, free, free)

I'm a true slave
To the fire and the air around you
While this curse divine
It's slowly rotting away, inside me
While we dream

Prayers (prayers)
Lay on the line (lay on the line)
You'll never be free
You'll never be free
(Free, free, free)
Triangles (triangles)
Placed in your mind (placed in your mind)
You'll never be free
You'll never be free

Beware

I will never walk this street again!
The only time I feel I'm not alone!
I pull my heart out, I wave it in the air

Prayers (prayers)
Laid on the line (lay on the line)
You'll never be free
You'll never be free
(Free, free, free)

Placed in your mind (placed in your mind)
You'll never be free
You'll never be free

I will never walk this street again!
The only time I feel I'm not alone!
I pull my heart out, I wave it in the air
I pull my heart out, beware!
