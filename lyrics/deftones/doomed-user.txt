Their, bring your time
Say goodbye now leave here
My fuse has expired
Fucking die just leave him


Powerless stuck in your web of shame
Open your eyes you only play yourself
Whoever’s watching I hope they catch the dream
Collect your crown you’re now the queen of him

Their that’s your life
Go and retire from me
Loose, and defiled
You define the need in

Their delusion
Don’t deny it

Don’t make this out to be something about you

I’ve been scarred
Fucking repulsed by this
My only tale is one that I can’t stand
Now I become tore I rot and wilt
My heart is black and I will never fail

Their, say goodbye
Just retire from me
Used, been exiled
Take your body elsewhere

Their delusion
Don’t deny it

Don’t make this out to be something about you
Go waste your breath somewhere to someone new

Your castle is burning, down on you
Your kingdom is burning, down

Their delusion
Don’t deny it

Don’t make this out to be a thing about you

Their delusion
Don’t deny it

Don’t make this out to be a thing about you
Go waste your breath somewhere to someone new
