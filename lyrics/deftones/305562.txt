Speak up - you know what is up
Code of silence? Who set you up!?
Some shit so wrong in this world
All fucked up now you're gone
Speak up - you know what went on
How could you let it go?
It's murder you covered up
Stained blood on your soul
It's your day...


(Gary Avenell)
Down on my knees
Hands stretched to heaven above
Christ this pain is hard to live with
Don't fill my heart with love
Engulf my heart with vengeance
You need to see our pain
Don't fill this heart with love
The truth needs to be told!!!

(All)
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!

(Chino Moreno)
How the fuck am I supposed to sit still?
All you motherfuckers out there throwing a rock
Better get at this shit why don't you back off quick?
What's - the - body - on my skin?
You won't find what's wrong, we got it back on
One slept under the covers...
That's cause of your life!!!

(All)
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!

"Fuck you...
Friday I was freaking out..."
(sample: Dana's voice)

(All)
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
You can't mask - Pain!
My pain, Our Pain!!!
