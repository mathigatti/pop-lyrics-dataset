My knife it's sharp and chrome
Come see inside my bones


All of the fiends are on the block
I'm the new king, I taste the queen
Cause in here we're all anemic
In here anemic and sweet, so

Go get your knife, go get your knife
And come in
Go get your knife, go get your knife
And lay down
Go get your knife, go get your knife
Now kiss me

I can float here forever
In this room we can't touch the floor
In here we're all anemic
In here anemic and sweet so

Go get your knife, go get your knife
And come in
Go get your knife, go get your knife
And lay down
Go get your knife, go get your knife
Now kiss me

I could float here forever
Anemic and sweet
I could float here forever
Anemic and sweet so

Go get your knife, go get your knife
And come in
Go get your knife, go get your knife
And lay down
Go get your knife, go get your knife
Get filthy
Go get your knife, go get your knife
Now kiss me
