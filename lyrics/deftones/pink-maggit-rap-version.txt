so run
right
right back to school
check it, look back I sift through all the cliques
roamin' the halls all year, makin' me sick
while everyones out tryin to make the cut
what, and when you think you know me right, I switch it up
Behind the walls, smokin' cigarettes and sippin' vodka
I profess to catch a cab no one can stop us
give me a break about some other mess (what were you) go practice everything you got!
chorus:
now push back the square, not that you need him, cause you don't, well there you go
cause back in school, we are the leaders of it all


so...

stop that quit, all that quit
who ruined it? you did, now grab a notebook and a pen
start taking notes, I'm bein' everyone who's on the top
you think we're on the same page but, oh, we're not
I'll be the man watch your back packs and the pencils
Just like he now flippin it, why you just keep it simple
you just can't go on rockin' the clothes, coppin' the stance
it truly is everything that you're not

(chorus)

transpose or stop your lies
it's what you do
transpose or stop your lies
so run
so why don't you run, so why don't you run
so why don't you run back to school
so why don't you run, so why don't you run

(cause)
all you are, now I'm on the next page
all you are, it's time to close the book up
all you are, I'm on the next page
all you are, close the book up now

(chorus)

transpose or stop your lies
it's what you do
transpose or stop your lies
so run
so why don't you run, so why don't you run
so why don't you run back to school
so why don't you run, so why don't you run
