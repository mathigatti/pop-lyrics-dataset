Hey vanity
This vile's empty
So are you
Hey glamorous
This vile's not God
Anymore, yeah


Speak, I don't get it
Should I ignore the fashion or go buy the book
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me

Coming back, oh
Coming back around the fur

Prostitute
Climb back down
Through the floor
Please don't fuck around
And die like this
'Cause I love her

Speak, I don't get it
Should I ignore the fashion or go buy the book
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me

Coming back, oh
Coming back around the fur

Speak, that's so sad you're back
I don't wanna get pissed off but anyway
Come on, came so far
I'm here to stay just one more vagabond

Speak, you're a liar
You're lying, I don't care about
Wrong, wrong
Wrong
