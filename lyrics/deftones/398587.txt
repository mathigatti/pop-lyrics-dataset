I get all ... numb
When she sings it's over
Such a strange numb
And it brings my kness to the earth


And God bless you all
For the song you saved us ...

You're the me ... numb
When she sings it's over
Such a strange numb
It could bring back peace to the earth

So God bless you all
For the song you saved us ... oh ...
For the hearts you break, everytime you moan ...

I get all ... numb
We're the same numb
And it brings our kness tothe earth

So God bless you all
For the song you saved us ... oh ...
For the hearts you break, everytime you moan ...
And God bless you all on the earth.
