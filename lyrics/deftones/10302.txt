No means no lie now find out what you get, you're no good
You'll sit around and throw a fuckin' fit
We are here onto you
You're so far, you're fucking gone


You won't get to me 'til you cover me
I don't need this shit 'til you cover me

No means no lie now find out what you get, it's so good
You'll sit around and throw a fuckin' fit
We are here onto you
Give me more, you fucking liar

You won't get to me 'til you cover me
I don't need this shit 'til you cover me

We are here - Mother - in your fear with you
We could be perfect in your world I know

But I will come
I will come
and I will come
Go

I will come
I will come
and I will
come

I will come
I will come
I will come
I will come

Disapear
Disapear
Disapear
Disapear

You won't get to me till you cover me
I don't need this shit fuckin' liar
