I wont stop following you
Now help me pray for
The death of everything new
Then we'll fly farther


'Cause your my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I wont mind

We'll stop to rest on the moon
We'll make a fire
I'll steal a carcass for you
Then feed off the virus

Cause your my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I wont mind
Cause your my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I wont mind

Now look at em
Look at em now
Look at em - sting
Now look at em
Look at em now
Look at em - sting
Now look at em
Look at em now
Look at em - sting
Now look at em
Look at em now
Look at em - sting

I see a red light in June
And I hear crying
You turn newborn baby blue
Now we're all the virus

Your my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I wont mind
Cause your my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I wont mind

Now look at em
Look at em now
Look at em - sting
Now look at em
Look at em now
Look at em - sting
Now look at em
Look at em now
Look at em - sting
Now look at em
Look at em now
Look at em - sting...

Sting...
Look at em now, look at em now
Look at em now, look at em now...Sting
Look at em now, look at em now
Look at em now, look at em now
Look at em now, look at em now
Look at em now, look at em now...Sting
Look at em now, look at em now
Look at em now, look at em now
