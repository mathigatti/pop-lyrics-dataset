You're floating out astray
This cold and lifeless body
At this moment what you taste
Is the key of your evolving


We're the lions at the gates
We're the diamond in your brain
The desire in your veins
For the violence'
And the writers of your fate

Keep riding on this wave
The desire sweeps your body
Oh we're watching now we wait
For another sweet departing

We're the lions at the gates
We're the diamond in your brain
The desire in your veins
For the violence'
And the writers of your fate
We're the sirens to your raid
The desire to remain
In the violence
The deciders
Of your fate

The desire in your veins for the violence
The diamond in your brain
The desire partake in the violence
We're the sirens to your raid
The desire to remain
Remain
Remain
The writers of your fate
