The earth
Will save our arms
Go blank tonight
The earth will Rot away
Go blank tonight


I, I really wish these snakes were your arm
I, I really wish you'd make up your mind

The earth disguised the lake
Go blank tonight
The earth will save our arms
Go blank tonight

I, I really wish these snakes were your arm
I, I really wish you'd make up your mind
