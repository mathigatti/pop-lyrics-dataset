From the day you arrived
I've remained by your side
In chains, entombed
Placed inside, safe and sound
Shapes and colors are all i see


On the day you arrived
I became your device
To lay and soothe
Placed inside, safe and sound
Shapes and colors are all i see
Shades of colors are all i feel

From the day you arrive
I'll stay by your side
Placed inside, safe and sound
Shapes of colors are all i see
Shapes of colors are all i feel

Placed inside, safe inside
Shades of colors are all i see
Safe inside
