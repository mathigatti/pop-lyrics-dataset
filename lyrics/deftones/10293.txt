I'll never be the same, breaking decency
Don't be tree trunk, don't fall on my living roots
I've been humming too many words
Got a weak self esteem
That's been stomped away from every single dream
But it's something else that brought us peace
Keep it all inside 'til we feel we can unleash
I think that you made it up
I think that your mind is gone
I think you should't glorify, now you're wrong


Suck (x12)
And fuckin' my head
Suck (x11)
You bitch

You and me are here alone face flat along the edge of the glass
But I'm not here to preach
I'm just sick of this
My parents made me strong to lift up that glass
So why should I try
Act like I'm a little pissed off
With all that shit that needs to stay back in the shelf
Your punk ass made it up
Your fucking mind is gone
Should've never glorified, now you're right

Suck (x12)
And fuckin' my head
Suck (x11)
You bitch

You realize you don't know me, shut up you don't know me
Squeal like a pig when you big fucking big fucking ape
Well I'm talking about my false dad
What's coming back jack, well turn back
Curse for in their words
Whether not your fucking with
I'm making no sense
What's coming as I jump in ya
I think I'm something, naughty or most anybody
So thinking of me by now but you go grab it
And I can't think of who I am and shit
I belong where they be cause we cannot give back those lives
We exist to cease understand
That god hates blacks shades and all the players
Mr P.I.G. could I fucking see
Sure already done crushed down my brother's dignity
And to the jury cant be no turns on my skin this color
Doesn't mean I'm burned
Cause your punk ass made it up
Your fucking mind was gone
Should've never glorified, wrong!

Suck (x11)
And fuckin' my head
Suck (x10)
You bad boy!
