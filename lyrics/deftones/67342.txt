Somehow calm as she walks on stage
Her entire empire becomes your taste
Your taste, show me, come!


Let me know what you're like, let me
Know what you're like
What's your taste?

I bet she carves your heart when she walks onstage
Her empire slowly becomes your place
Your place, show me, come!

Let me know what you're like, let me
Know what you're like
In your place, your place (place)

Somehow calm as she walks offstage
An entire empire recall your face
Your face, show me, come!

Let me know what you're like, let me
Know what you're like
Your face, your face
(Hopelessly devoted)
