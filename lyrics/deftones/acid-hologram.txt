In the haze of your light
We bathe and wane
You've surrounded
Our hearts again


You smother me in shapes
In a secret praxis

You've showed me your charms
And revealed your name
Blow the clouds
From your mouth again

And smother me in shapes
You'll reveal your secret side
Your light will fade
And our hearts will sync
In time your disguise
Will shift and reverse

In the wave of your plume
We bathe and drink
You remind me of her again

Smother me in shapes
You'll reveal your secret side
Your light will fade
And our hearts will sync
In time your disguise
Will shift and reverse
