You move like I want to
To see like your eyes do
We are downstairs where
No one can see
New life breakaway


Tonight I feel like more
Tonight I

You make the water warm
You taste foreign
And I know you can see
The cord breakaway

Cause tonight I feel like more
Tonight I feel like more
Feel like more

You breathed
Then you stopped
I breathed then dried you off

And tonight
I feel like more
Tonight
