Nerve, here I borned feeding on his lung
Verve, is his curse because he wanted to meet Christ alone


Bitch, you're no good, we could be so flown
Misunderstood, we could be your God

There in my bones we could be so flown
Misunderstood, because he wanted to meet Christ alone

But you will

No you will never find me, breach unborn
Never, come here watch me burn
Never, bitch cause your scars show
Never, will I burn

Under, beneath the floor
Before his face, 'cause you're no good
We could have been like one
Fuck it

Bitch you feel sore, we could be so flown
Misunderstood, because he wanted to meet christ alone

But you will

No you will never find me - breach unborn
Never sit and watch me burn
Never bitch cause your scars show
Never will I burn

Will I burn
Will I burn
Will I burn

Beg, don't even try and you will never
Beg, don't even try and you will never
Beg, don't even try and you will never
Beg, don't even waste your time
