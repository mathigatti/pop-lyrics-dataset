She haunts the roads
She waits for a new face
The arms red and injured
She wants to rest
She cant 'till we have faced


I'll cut your armies down
And torn your heart

You wait
I wait
Outside, awake

I'll cut your armies down
And torn your heart

You wait
I wait
Outside, awake

She haunts the road
She waits for a new face
