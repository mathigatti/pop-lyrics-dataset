Hey angel consider your position
Framed to be consumed savory savoring
Your sympathy
Hey angel fly over and bless me
See you feign surprise
And I'm all eyes
You're all you
Need to be.
Hey angel whatever position
We consider fit to put you in
You'll protest your complicity
Easy now one hand will wash te other
