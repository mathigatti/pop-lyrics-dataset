Hey you
Big star
Tell me
When it's over (cloud)


Hey you
Big mood
Guide me
To shelter

'Cause I'm through
When the two
Hits the six
And it's summer (cloud)

Come (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Shove (shove it, shove it, shove it)
The Sun (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Aside (shove it aside)

I think God is moving Its tongue
There's no crowds in the street and no Sun
(In my own summer)

The shade
Is a tool
A device
A savior

See, I try
And look up
To the sky
But my eyes burn (cloud)

Come (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Shove (shove it, shove it, shove it)
The Sun (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Aside (shove it aside)

Come (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Shove (shove it, shove it, shove it)
The Sun (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Aside (shove it aside)

I think God is moving Its tongue
There's no crowd in the street and no Sun
In my own summer

Come (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Shove (shove it, shove it, shove it)
The Sun (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Aside (shove it aside)
