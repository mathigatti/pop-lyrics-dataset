I'm getting very edgy
Cos you're trying to take this from me
And it's something that I wanted so bad
Cos you're the definition


Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
Cos you're a jealous girl
And all I can say is

It's your fault but partially mine
For losing hope
For not treating you right
But that will disappear in time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what's wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you

How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I'm losing sleep
I live only for the week

I've grown to ignore you
Cos when I seem to bore you
You pretend that you're not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle

Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do
But I don't care as long as you're mine
It's happening every time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what's wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you

How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I'm losing sleep
I live only for the week

And I'm falling harder now it seems
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams
And I can't sleep although I think I can
It's insomnia I think I have
But who cares when I'm not your man?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you

How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I'm losing sleep
I live only for the week
