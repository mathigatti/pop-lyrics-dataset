It's such a beautiful night, to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talking about love and life
Oh how lucky am I, when I look in your eyes?


What a wonderful way, to spend a moment or two
To be lying awake, and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I gotta do
To be making a change, now the moment of truth

Why am I feeling so nervous?
When things are going so perfect
But I know that it's worth it
To spend forever with you

So I count to three, and get on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right
So I'll ask you, tonight, will you marry me?
Just say yes
One word, one love, one life

A gentle touch of the hand, fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh I was caught unaware
Oh so many times, I gazed in both of her eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of a life

Some will reappear, burning auburn and red
I'll chest the pill, bring us home to bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
What a wonderful way, to fall in deeper in with you

Why was I feeling nervous?
Things are going so perfect
Now I know that it's worth it
To spend forever with you

So I count to three, I get on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right
So I'll ask you, tonight, will you marry me?
Just say yes
One word, one love, one life

Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh, you and I
Some things were just meant to be

Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh, you and I
Some things were just meant to be
