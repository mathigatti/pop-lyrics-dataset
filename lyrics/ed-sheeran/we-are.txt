Leaves have fallen to the ground
And now there's no one else around
To hear the cry


I saw your body
I saw your face
Loss of presence
Loss of grace
Behind those eyes

And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone

I miss your laughter
I miss your tears
I miss your rambling
About your fears
Your smile
The crowed has gathered
All around
No ones speaking
No one makes a sound
And I

And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone

We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
Alone

Alone now

They're never gonna change you
They're never gonna change me
They're never gonna change us
We'll always stay the same

They're never gonna change you
They're never gonna change me
They're never gonna change us
We'll always stay the same

They're never gonna change you
They're never gonna change me
They're never gonna change us
We'll always stay the same

They're never gonna change you
They're never gonna change me
They're never gonna change us
We'll always stay the same

They're never gonna change you
They're never gonna change me
They're never gonna change us
We'll always stay the same

We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone
