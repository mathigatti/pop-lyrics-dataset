I met you when I was a teen, but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers play
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat, is where we used to stay


Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites, we needed to breathe
We'd used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'd say you were beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us

And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane
Or make a mistake, so say it again

Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?

And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now? Now

And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With draw strings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish
Back to borough with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can't help it

I put my job before everything, except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
So I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain, or wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?

And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now? Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?

People grow and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?

Oh, Nina
(Love will come and love will go)
You should go, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(Sing that song, go)
Oh, won't you leave me now?

And I've been living on the road, Nina
(People grow, and fall apart)
But then again you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina
(Take it back, go)
Oh, won't you leave me now? Now

Oh, Nina
(Love will come and love will go)
You should go, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(Sing that song, go)
Oh, won't you leave me now?

And I've been living on the road, Nina
(People grow, and fall apart)
But then again you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina
(Take it back, go)
Oh, won't you leave me now? Now
