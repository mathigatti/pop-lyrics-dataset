It's too cold in this downtown apartment
No furniture so we sit on the carpet
Heating's gone so we fill the bath with boiling water from the kettle
What a beautiful way to start this


I just met you today for the first time
All I know is your birth sign
I've not got any curtains to draw, only a mattress sat on the floor
Won't you lay with me darling, all night

And I've got a movie we can watch
And we'll eat popcorn from a coffee cup
Not the fanciest place, but it's home

Down in this downtown apartment
Is where two broken hearts went
To see what it feels like to fall for a stranger
Caught in a landslide of something
Darling I might ask you one thing
Is this what it feels like to fall for a stranger?

I feel love in this Newfoundland flat
Only God knows where I found it at
Maybe faith pulled me into the pub
Just to meet someone who'd give me their love
I just liked how you kissed me like that

Never thought I'd be taking you home
I assumed I'd be sleeping alone
Apologies for the mess that I made
I wasn't expecting you to stay at my place
What a beautiful way to start this

And I've got a t-shirt you can wear
And just a blanket that we both could share
Not the fanciest place, but it's home

Down in this downtown apartment
Is where two broken hearts went
To see what it feels like to fall for a stranger
Caught in a landslide of something
Darling I might ask you one thing
Is this what it feels like to fall for a stranger?

Darling, I need to see what's meant for you and me
But all along I've been falling for a stranger
