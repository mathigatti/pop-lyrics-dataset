Now I’m in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud


And I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now

See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I’m like glue, I stick to other artists
I’m not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures

See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

‘Cos you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

I sing, I write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don’t need another wordsmith to make the tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing

I sing fast, I know that all my shit’s cool
I will blast and I didn’t go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last if I’m smoking on a crack pipe

And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia

And musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
Young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi, yeah

‘Cos you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

‘Cos with the lyrics I’ll be aiming it right
I won’t stop till my name is in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice, on red carpets, now I’m on Arabian nights
Because I’m young, I know my brother’s gonna give me advice

Long nighter, short height and I’m going hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
Yeah, the game’s over but now I’m on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I’m bound to blow up
I’ve done around about a thousand shows
But I haven’t got a house, plus I live on the couch
So you believe the lyrics when I’m singing them out, wow

From day one, I’ve been prepared with VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I’m back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds 'cos it’s another day
Plus I keep my last name forever, keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people’s tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper’s shoes using new laces

I'm selling CD’s from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD’s from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, I still had to get the bus back
Clean-cut kid without a razor for the moustache

I hit back when the pen hurts me
I’m still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I’m still the same as a year ago but more people hear me, though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos

I’m always doing shows, if I’m not, I’m in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I’m up-and-coming like I’m fucking in an elevator

‘Cos you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
