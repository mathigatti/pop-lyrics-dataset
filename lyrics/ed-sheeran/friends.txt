We’re not, no, we’re not friends
Nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in the light
But if they find out, will it all go wrong?
And heaven knows, no one wants it to


So I could take the back road
But your eyes will lead me straight back home
And if you know me, like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don’t treat me like you do
Well, I know that there’s a limit to everything
But my friends won’t love me like you
No, my friends won’t love me like you

We’re not friends
We could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out
If it all went wrong
They’ll never know
What we’ve been through

So I could take the back road
But your eyes will lead me straight back home
And if you know me, like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don’t treat me like you do
I know that there’s a limit to everything
But my friends won’t love me like you
No, my friends won’t love me like you

But then again
If we’re not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again
If we’re not friends
There will be nothing I could do

And that’s why friends should sleep in another bed
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
And I know that there’s a limit to everything
But my friends won’t love me like you
No, my friends won’t love me like you do
Oh, my friends will never love me like you
