No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely


Another night, another club
Another room, another one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
I don't know why, you're not enough

No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
'Cause maybe you could just be the one, ayy

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark

Another night, another day
Been thinking 'bout it wide awake
I never thought I'd be alone
While everybody blowing up my phone
Don't trust no one, no, so don't want to get close
I get mine, I walk away

No lie, yeah, my mama always told me to be a bad girl
Never let anybody get in the way of what I'm trying to do now
This ain't man's world, thank you next, I'ma go my own way
Sometimes being solo is the way to go
When you need to figure shit out
And if I want you boy, I'ma tell you so
'Cause I'm the one in control, yeah

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark

No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely (no lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely (no lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely (oh, yeah)

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me, yeah
My love is a flickering candle (flickering candle, yeah), in the dark

No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark (no lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (love for the lonely), no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark
