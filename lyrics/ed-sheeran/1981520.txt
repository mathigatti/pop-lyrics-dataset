You’re not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I’m searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes
And I saw her staring back at me
So I will try and find another one
Who suits me as well as her


I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you

She was mine
I was hers
And all that’s in between
If she would cry, I
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that would be

If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you

Don’t drop me in
It’s not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn

Don’t drop me in
It’s not my turn
And if you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you
