You've got scars on your body &amp; your soul
Bruises on your back now
Broken heart with nowhere to go
Living in a high-rise flat
Torn apart, so keep on keeping it together
Nothing is forever, you know
You can start again like this, like this


Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, color the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today

I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up and take away your scars

And you can never be alone
If you're bleeding with the skyline
Waiting for the right time
When the night's already gone
It's been traveling without your mind now
Let it let go and fuel you
Like petrol you find so much
Beauty in what makes you mental
Your friends know it's only
A state of mind, you're only getting by
By always getting high, that's why

Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, color the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today

I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up and take away your scars

You can take away your scars
You can take away your scars
