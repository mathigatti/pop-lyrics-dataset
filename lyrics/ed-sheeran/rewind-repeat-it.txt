Rewind repeat it
Stay for the night
Call it what you want
And I'll call it mine
To have you in my arms
Is this what you needed?


'Cause I'll find the faith in anything
Don't fight the feeling
Rewind repeat it
Rewind repeat it

If the world ends tonight
You'll me in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My love is streaming

This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind repeat it
Rewind repeat it

Just close your eyes
All you need to see
It's your heart and mine
Underneath the sheets
Don't fight your demons
Cause they will tell you apart from the sins
If the darkness creeps in
Rewind repeat it
Rewind repeat it

If the world ends tonight
You'll me in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My love is streaming

This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind repeat it
Rewind repeat it
