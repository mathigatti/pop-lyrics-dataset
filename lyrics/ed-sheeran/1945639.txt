Sara, what you do is enlighten my mind
Oh wow, I said
Sara, what you do is make my soul unwind


Hey now
'Cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood
So I thought I'd write a song for you

And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
'Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that

Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of strongbow
Oh wow, I said
Sara, you say that you don't look good when you do
Even with that soul

Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood
So I thought I'd write a song for you

And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
'Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that

May I say, you look great
May I play this to make your day
