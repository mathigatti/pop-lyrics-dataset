If take this bird in with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lay down with me
If we fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing


But when I wake up
And your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if lay down
Would you stay now and et me hold ya?

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And its not complete yet
Mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird

If we take a walk out in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least you're next to me
And if I wake up, I'll say: It's late love get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And its not complete yet
Mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird
My little bird
My little bird

And of all this things I'm sure of
I'm not quite certain of your love
You made me scream
But then I made you cry
When I left that little bird
With it's broken leg to die

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And its not complete yet
Mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
You're my little bird
