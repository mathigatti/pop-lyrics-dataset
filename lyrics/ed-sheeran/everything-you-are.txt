I didn't mean to break your heart
I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight?


I wish I never called you up
But nobody told me
They don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
Won't you just hold me tonight?

And I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I'm not anything like it was
'Cause you were the only one for me, yeah

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are

I never meant to sleep around
I was just lonely
And you did the same
Again and again and again
Oh, I know

So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight

Oh, I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I'm not anything like it was
'Cause you were the only one for me

Maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
But maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are

When I see my future, it is with you
We'll get there
I want my children to be with you
We'll get there

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are

Behind my truth lies
Everything you are
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are
