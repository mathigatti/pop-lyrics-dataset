My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too


But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you, oh
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
With you

Baby, the best part of me is you, oh
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
