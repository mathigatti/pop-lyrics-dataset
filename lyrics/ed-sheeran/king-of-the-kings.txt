Born with a heart
That could ache more than beat
The mind of a killer
The soul of the meek


Flock with no shepherd
Is a vulnerable game
I can live without heart, without love
But I do need a name

Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
King of the kings do you feel any pain?
Do you feel any pain?
Do you feel any pain?
