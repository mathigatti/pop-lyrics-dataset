Strings on my guitar are rusty
Even my best friends don't trust me
Everybody thinks I must be crazy
'Cos, I'm your typical average teen


If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
'Cos, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean

(Typical average teen)
Everything's in a haze
Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze
Everything's blurry

Oh, what's happened to me?
Say, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)

Now, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
