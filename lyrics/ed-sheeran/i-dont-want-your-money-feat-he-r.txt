Hey
I waited for you all day


I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm heading home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin' back, and sayin': There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not saying that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pulling out my hair, getting mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in our home
And she keeps telling me over and over

(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time

I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, working my ass
I'm tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I couldn't be more present, but I was in a mess
I remember being on tour, staying up on the phone
Thirty minute conversation: Boy, when you coming home?
I can't be building a family life here on my own
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why take that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stacking up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm popping right now, but there will come a day when I won't

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in our home
She keeps telling me over and over

(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I want all of your love, your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I just want your, I just want your time)

You know you're my baby (you know you're my baby)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy
Why you gotta mess with my mind?
You know you're my baby (you know you're, oh)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy you drive me crazy, you know, you know

I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (yeah, I want, yeah, I want your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (time, time)

And I love, and I love, and I love you
Yeah, I love, and I love, and I love you
And I love, and I love, and I love you
But I want your time, oh, yeah
Oh, your time, time
