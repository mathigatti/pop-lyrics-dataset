I've been spinning out of time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind, sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded, how'd I get so faded


Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Oh, colour crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Oh, colour crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
And I saw scars upon her
(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
Broken hearted

(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
And I saw scars upon her
(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
Broken hearted

(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
And I saw scars upon her
(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
Broken hearted

(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
And I saw scars upon her
(All the voices in my mind)
Tell me when it kicks in
(Calling out across the line)
Broken hearted

So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted

Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted
