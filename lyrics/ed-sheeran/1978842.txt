This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one that make me lose it all
You are the start of something new


And I’ll throw it all away
And watch you fall into my arms again
And I’ll throw it all away
And watch you fall, now

You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing

And I’ve thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I’ve thrown it all away
And watched you fall, now

And take me back, take me home
Watch me fall down to earth
Take me back

For this is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new
