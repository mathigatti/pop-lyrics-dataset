Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I'm so frustrated, so dilated
And she's telling me I've wasted my time
And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night


Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat

Still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we're asking for so much more
Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor

Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I'm so frustrated, so dilated
And she's telling me I've wasted my time
And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time, 'cos I won't mind
I doubt if I even know that I'm awake

And still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we're asking for so much more
Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
