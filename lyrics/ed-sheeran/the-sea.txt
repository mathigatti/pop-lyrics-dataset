Pass me a drink
You say it’s gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile


You’re wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don’t reach
Your smile

You’re holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You’re eating your fears
In a cigarette

You’ve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea

I’ve taken the blow
It’s all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no "see you later"

You’re wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don’t reach
Your smile

You’re holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You’re eating your fears
In a cigarette

You’ve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea
