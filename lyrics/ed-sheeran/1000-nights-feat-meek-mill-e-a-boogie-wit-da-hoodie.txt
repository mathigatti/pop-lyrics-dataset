[Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I've been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up fifty thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights


[Meek Mill]
This the type of shit we used to dream of (yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like: What now?
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Look like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda pop
And I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold the rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadium, tell 'em: Play my shit
And they gon' sing like this

[Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I've been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up fifty thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but what does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of a splitter van
Two hundred a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Weatherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
Two pound pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world

Oh, I've been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up fifty thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded (gettin' faded)
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

[A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
Mmm, I'm so faded
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on, pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make it seem unfair
Saint-Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh, yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Celine, oh, yeah
And she wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh, yeah
From New York out to London, she wish she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so I know she couldn't call my line
And I see she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes

[Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I've been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up fifty thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
