I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See, I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter, I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder


And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way?
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a Blu-ray, true say
And I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I'd go all across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me, and be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always tryna get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe
To feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now

'Cause maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love
When you woke me up
