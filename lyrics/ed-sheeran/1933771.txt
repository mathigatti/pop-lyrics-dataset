This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it’s late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can’t close my eyes
Don’t control what I’m into


This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can’t control what I’m into

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I’m used to

The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don’t think I’m gonna make it past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two

And my lungs hurt, and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
