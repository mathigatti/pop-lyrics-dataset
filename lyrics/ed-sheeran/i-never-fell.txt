If you wanna put this on me, that’s fine
I never blamed you for anything at all, in my life
Things we try to do won’t work
So can you help me out?
Things we try to do won’t work
So can you help me out?


And say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it’s true
'Cause I have fallen for you
Say if you love somebody new

See and I don’t wanna take it to the get gate
Where I came fly show
I could have taken anyone there
But I like the way she brushed her hair back

I never trust, begin to realize
How fast I would turn and I
I was blind to all
Yeah, I saw all

Say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it’s true
Cause I have fallen for you

Say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it’s true
'Cause I have fallen for you
Say if you love somebody new

Seeing this fake heart break
And stomach ache has got me
Acting like a pregnancy

I never fell for you, you tripped me
'Cause even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind it’s true, in my mind now

I never fell for you, you tripped me
Even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind now, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
