All you cool people you better leave now
'Cause it's about to happen


[Ed Sheeran e Travis Scott]
Friday night and I'm ridin' solo (yeah)
When I touchdown, keep it on the low-low (it's lit!)
I don't mess with your energy (no)
No photos
So antisocial, but I don't care
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though
Got my hat low, don't talk to me (straight up)

I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud easin' my pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (straight up)

Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night

[Travis Scott]
(I need, I need, I need)
I need room, I need room
When you're standin' way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes
When I zoom, when I zoom
Pass out, wake up on by myself
Right past noon, right past noon
And I'm doomed
(Occupied and moving dolo)
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues (drown)
Right before I leave, she give me more than just a: Miss you
That thing got more back, just like my engine, I can hit it (in the back)
Seen a vision in the boy, then we committed

I've been lost out in outer space (it's lit!)
You left me right in my place
I put you down on my name

[Ed Sheeran e Travis Scott]
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (straight up)

Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night
