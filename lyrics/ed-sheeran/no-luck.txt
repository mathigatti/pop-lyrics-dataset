I’m screaming out upon my face
Followed footsteps catch my pace
Broken windows fall in place
Now shattered lovers find their place


We’d flirt
And you’d treat me like dirt
All the pain and the hurt
Just to make matters worse

And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
You’re better off with me

We’re stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass

All I ever felt for you
Went up in a cloud of smoke
How I could I be such a fool
To ever think that we were close?

And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
You’re better off with me

We’re stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass
