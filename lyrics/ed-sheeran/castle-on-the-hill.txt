When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then
Take me back to when


I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon I did it right
But I was younger then
Take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed

One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
