I found your hair band on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days never sleep with the light on


Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got
My mind’s with you but my heart’s just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

That's why you and I ended over U.N.I
And I said that's fine
But you’re the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U.N.I
And I said that's fine
But you’re the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever
But I know that I never wanna settle down
Come around, break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts and I dance with my views
Everything’s great, not everything’s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus

Now I'm in position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect
But we were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

You and I ended over U.N.I
And I said that's fine
But you’re the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U.N.I
And I said that's fine
But you’re the only one that knows I lied

Because if I was gonna go somewhere
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down
And I’m thinking that I’m unaware
I keep my feet on the ground
And keep looking around to make sure
I'm not the only one to feel low

Because if you want
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

‘Cos you and I ended over U.N.I
And I said that's fine
But you’re the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U.N.I
And I said that's fine
But you’re the only one that knows I lied
