Made of clay
Shoot me down
I’ll ricochet to the ground
Words of paint
Draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know it’s over before it’s begun


I lost my way
So help me out
And lend your hand ‘til I am found
My voice is mute
Not to be heard
So it’s up to you
For you to bring those words

I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time

This grief you give
It takes it’s toll
It dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree
Whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned stones, oh

I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time

I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time
