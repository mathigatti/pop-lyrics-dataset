Yeah, Slumdon Bridge
Mr. Red, Catfish
Light me up
Let's go


I’m out to bark again, ball cracked on the target, demolish it
Don’t jump out your seat, nah, take a squat and then
Think while I jump back on the beat, like I need audiences
To speak too like a leech, needs to retrieve blood

Should I creep into these ambient sounds with the speech? Obvious
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy, that's several pauses
You might need a coffin with holes in the top, with these tubes to receive oxygen (yeah)
You're buried alive like a freak, six feet

Clawin' and snatchin' and all
And like a cat, and a dog
And a rat, and a hog
In a pen

With a frog and all there is to eat
Is frog and they
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth, and jaws and then

They fight to the death for at least a piece off of him
See that, you back two bars again
He's asleep in a coffin, man
I’m all thee all that’s been, ever was, I'm the start of it

You mention the squad and then
You mention the God of pens
Not of men, but of harder than
Flesh, I’m harder than titanium, brass plates that are polished in

Sticking emcees up like a fly-trap, or a bobby-pin
When I rap, I’m astonishing
I attack tracks like a train-track strapped to a bomb and send
Shockwave’s that's what I made, got this bastard popping then

I spit on my pop's grave without apologin'
Take shits on shihtzus
Pisses on igloos
Throw it up til the whole fucking world is sick too

Vomitin' stomach-fluid like you just ate shit-stew
Did I say shit again? Do I give a shit, dude?
Neither does Little Johnny give a shit if he sniffed glue
Or Bethoveen care if you like his hair or the stick used

To orchestrate, or does a porpoise hate when you dip through
Swimming in his ocean, no, he just moves
What I’m trying to say is, it’s my motherfucking ocean
And I crossed it
Built the bridge, Slumdon Bridge, holla!
