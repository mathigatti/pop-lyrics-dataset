It's alright to cry, even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight, hold on


So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake, even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage, against the dying of the light
It's alright to say, that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today, hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, hold on

Live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, hold on
