Settle down with me
Cover me up, cuddle me in
Lay down with me, yeah
And hold me in your arms


And your heart’s against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I’m falling for your eyes, but they don’t know me yet
And with a feeling I’ll forget, I’m in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love, we're falling in love

Settle down with me
And I’ll be your safety, you’ll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I’m cold as the wind blows
So hold me in your arms

My heart’s against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I’m falling for your eyes but they don’t know me yet
And with this feeling I’ll forget, I’m in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love, we're falling in love

Yeah, I’ve been feeling everything
From hate to love, from love to lust, from lust to truth
I guess that’s how I know you
So hold you close to help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love, we're falling in love

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love, we're falling in love
