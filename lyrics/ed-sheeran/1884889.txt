Little lady
This is just the worst way
To spend your birthday
It's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late
You was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady the word 'rape' sums up events
That take place every night
You wanna get up
But you, no, your legs, will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror
To check face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington
Were they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business, for sure
They'll know your fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But, young woman
The pimp see's you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal
'Cause the cunt wouldn't ever let a doctor
Near someone that's getting dough for him
'Cause next you got proxy authorities
Sticking their noses in


[Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
'Cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

[Mikill Pane]
Little lady
Your mind you've made up
Your injurys you can't hide with makeup
You need some medical advice
You make up
A little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes
And don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude
Who stiched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cos all the heroin is making you age
But your a heroin for taking the strain
Of being a prostitue and punching bag
The funds you have left go
Where you're from using moneygram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have
A single daughter with the upper hand
Little, does she know you're never coming back
She put you in her brother's hand
Only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, the summer fans
See that you came to London
To get pimped by your uncle, damn

[Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
'Cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Now an angel will die, covered in white
With closed eyes
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Mikill Pane]
Little lady
Your trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles the dear
Your sitting facing the detective
Oh, dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it?
She's only gone and made it much worse
Calling police and
She'll never know the gravity
Of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal
Going mad in the ward now
The coppers trying to calm you
Telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you
"Who you working for?"
He's talking to like your worth more than a dirty whore
Your having a conversation
You could be murdered for
Your learning more about exactly why
You need to help bring him or her to court
It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he reassures you
That he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number
You can phone on his card
Begs you to use it
He's useless if your gonna be stupid
'Cos an answer hasn't come from
Your bruised lips, your on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you own
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel
A cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says
"Where you been bitch? I wanna know."
No prizes for guessing who it is
Resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door
He boots you in
There's something new in him
He's silent now that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight
You could be killed for an error
He towers over you
The 6 inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbags dropped
And all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing
That's caught his eye
And in the moment of rage
He brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body
In the boot of his Merc in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her 13th birthday

[Ed Sheeran]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside tonight
'Cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
