It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you


You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them, too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing Chasing Cars and I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love

So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So, can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh, I know
And oh, I know, oh
I can see the stars
From America
