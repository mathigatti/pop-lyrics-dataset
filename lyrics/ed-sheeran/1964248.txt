I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
But there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you


And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers, and colour you in
If things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it, but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart, and swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I’m out of touch, I’m out of love
I’ll pick you up when you’re getting down
And out of all these things I’ve done
I will love you better now
