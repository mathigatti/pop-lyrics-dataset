[Young Thug]
Bada boom, bada bee
Yeah, you knocked me right off of my feet


[Ed Sheeran &amp; Young Thug]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (bada boom, bada bee)
I waited most my life for somethin' real (yeah, you knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

[Young Thug]
Drop it to the ground, lean your hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no lend
Gotta trust your crowd, got her layin int he cloud, baby
Baby, I got the feels (woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why you do this to me
I try to tell 'em not to do it as loud
I try to tell 'em not to buss it out the rap' 'til we leave
I was bangin' suicide for the rivens
I done went and bought a car with a title
Told the promoters: Have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

[Ed Sheeran &amp; Young Thug]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (bada boom, bada bee)
I waited most my life for somethin' real (yeah, you knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

[J Hus]
Used to be a playboy heartbreaker
But for you, I'd travel a thousand acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers (alright)
One day we'll get married in Las Vegas (nah)
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin (alright)
This love give you protein and vitamins (yeah)
See you wigglin', jigglin' (mmm)
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon? (One)
This is one in a million
So I'll never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I ever already seen
You give me this feel, if you know what I mean

[Ed Sheeran &amp; Young Thug]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah (bada boom, bada bee)
(Yeah, you knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
I waited most my life for somethin' real
Baby, I got the feels for ya
