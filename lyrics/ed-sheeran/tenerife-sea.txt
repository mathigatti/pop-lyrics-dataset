You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back


We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out as you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know that's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love
So in love

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you were back
