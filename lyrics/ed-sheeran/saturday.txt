On Saturday I know that you’re coming up to see me
When I go away things will change
And you’ll never know it was easy
It won’t help pretending that we’ll stay close
I can’t help thinking that
I try to pretend that it’s your loss
And I never know, oh I’ll never know if it will work


There’s no better time
She’s still thinking I’m too far away
Understanding why she’s not thinking I’m a fool to wait
And I left her today
And I left her today

Come Sunday I’ll see that one day you’ll rescue me
And when I leave again I’ll feel strange
And I’ll never know, oh I’ll never know if you’re in love again
I can’t stop being a fool for you
I won’t help thinking that
Still I am falling for her and she did too
Oh I’ll never know, oh I’ll never know if I’m in love

There’s no better time
She’s still thinking I’m too far away
Understanding why she’s not thinking I’m a fool to wait
But I left her today

There’s no better time
She’s still thinking I’m too far away
Understanding why she’s not thinking I’m a fool to wait
But I left her today
