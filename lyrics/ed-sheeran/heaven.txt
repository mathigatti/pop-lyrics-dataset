We gotta fix up
Face the rain
Taste the pain
Oh, we need the pain
To know we're alive
To know we're alive


I put my hands up to the jury
Oh, I plead guilty
For something I have done
For something I have done
Too many times

Could we call it a mistake
If we did it again and again and again and again
There's nobody left to blame now
It's happening again and again and again and again

Oh, heaven
It's gonna haunt us
'Till it takes us
Heaven
It's gonna haunt us
Until it takes us

We're scared
It's out of our hands
So lets make the most
Of the time we've got
The friends we have
Or the friends we lost

And maybe now we'll know
That there is someone
Waiting for us
Up there, yeah
And the bright lights in the big city
We'll never compare
We'll never compare

But I'm going when my
Time's up, yeah
So pretty pretty
So giddy giddy
Baby now we'll know that
There is someone watching
Us up there

Could we call it a mistake
If we did it again and again and again and again
There's nobody left to blame now
It's happening again and again and again and again

Oh, heaven
It's gonna haunt us
'Till it takes us
Heaven
It's gonna haunt us
Until it takes us

Save me
And only you can take these
Wings and make them fly
And help me
Come and catch me
When I'm falling apart

There's nobody left to blame now
It's happening again
And again and again
And again and again
Just give me something heavenly
Just give me something heavenly

Oh, heaven
Just take me there
So take me there
Take me there
oh, yeah
Heaven
It's gonna haunt us untill it takes us

Oh, heaven
Heaven
Oh, heaven
Heaven
Oh, heaven
Heaven
