You give me life like lots of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight, tight enough to know
That you are mine, I'd never let you go


And it's you I miss, and it's you I miss
So let it out, let it out, now
I let it out, I let it out now, now

You speak me to me behind your dublin [unverified] step
And you let me be as if I wasn't there

It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

It's you I miss and it's you I miss
So let it out, let it out, now
I let it out, I let it out, now, now

It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn part, you see we were just like glue

We're like glue
So let it out, let it out, now
Let it out, let it out, now, now

It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue
