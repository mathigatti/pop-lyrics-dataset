I keep my hopes and dreams inside of you amongst the other things
My mother seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering
Never been known as my government name
My foster home is where I've been placed away from the pain
And now you sit before me with a folder holding my story
You're my savior with nothing on me but power and glory


And surely you'll never ignore me, 'cause when the the call came
The court date was made to disappear for me
You think you understand me, but never what I went through
But you were never meant to, I won't hold it against you

I take a ballpoint pen to play dot to dot
With the cigarette burns etched in my forearms
Forget me not, never let me stop
You'll just sit and watch, it's your job to be patient, so you'll let me off

So come with me, take a walk on the wild side
See life in a day through a child's eyes
And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleep's the only thing that I want to take me away, away

Okay, session's over, time to get back to the classroom
I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard too
You told me I should try my best, but guess what?
I still find this trigonometry a head fuck

Constantly told I won't pass my GCSE's
I'll end up in Micky D's serving burgers and cheese
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em

Lately classmates think I'm crazy
Turn up daily resembling Bill Bailey
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it
Without new clothes or shower it's hard to do
So after school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes
But they'll get taken off me when I get back to the group home

So come with me, take a walk on the wild side
See life in a day through a child's eyes
And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleep's the only thing that I want to take me away, away
