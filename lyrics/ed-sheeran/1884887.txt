Hey, can you hear me?
I was just wanting to let you know, hmm
I hope you can hear what I write to you
How can I say goodbye to you


When I'm a life that came out of a life that was inside of you
I got to respect the way you provided food for the whole fam
You came over in a Moon rush, supporting an old man
Cold double 8, eight kids, bare wheels

Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
Three jobs in a day, rest in life in you working
But you were never stress-free
Just locked in a cage slaving

They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart but still you were prone to last
And your sorrow was over fast

I hope you're listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkest times you held us all up

Because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it, anyone tells me that they knew you

Said you were beautiful and your words
You would stand strong with it
Because they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it

And there some things I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try and say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you
And of the pieces of my soul because I need a sign

I hope this pain will heal in time
You know I never want to be alone, oh
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?

Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you, oh?

I think of you older, I was younger
With the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you: Nan can I go out?

Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warren, Lauren, and Alex are fine and living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths

I miss seeing and being a family and us agreeing with smiles
How it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny

In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I'll never forgive the way she betrayed us

There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect

She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no one's surfing
Since you're gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step

I got all the bricks and the cement
But it's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do and I ask because I trust you

It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you
And of the pieces of my soul because I need a sign
I hope this pain will heal in time
You know I never want to be alone

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face

Or feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you, oh?
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough

I'll see you when I see you
But I miss you, oh, how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough

I'll see you when I see you
But I miss you, oh, how I miss you
There ain't enough words to describe how sorry I am
For the pain that I caused

Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young, he said I was wrecked and he broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth

Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I've never been able to say this before
Because I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally

And I took advantage of it like an idiot
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment

But I won't let go, I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me
You see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?

Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
Feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you?

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you, oh?
