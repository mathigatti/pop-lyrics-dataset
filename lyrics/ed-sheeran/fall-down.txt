In hotel rooms far away from home
I miss you, more than you will know


Shine a light
Just one side
To think again
That your mine
It's high time
I'm far away from home

Tell me that there's no were left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down
Oh, I need you, without you I'll fall apart
And last winter, I need you to feed my heart

But all the night
Sky blue
Stars are bright
Shine through
Like you
And I'm far away from home

Tell me that there's no were left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down
Tell me that there's no were left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down
