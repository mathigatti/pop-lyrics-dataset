Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Say what)
I think about the girl all the time (wow wow)


East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, ain't no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Quick when it comes to the gas
By no means average
It's always she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Let me come in, so I can win

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, bout to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

She's got class and style
And balance by the pound
Shorty never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curves the words, spins the verbs
Lovin' it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You never quite know what the half is
You got to pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Top notch, Trumped tight, every day
You're blowing my mind, baby in time
Maybe, I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I'm bout to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I'm bout to bag it, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I'm to bag it up

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo, damn that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on play on
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Damn that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
No no no

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a commer
This is freaking awesome

Now I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a commer
This is freaking awesome
Now, now I'm gonna pop some tags (I like the way you work it)
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up now
