She’s like cold coffee in the morning
I’m drunk off last night’s whisky and coke
She’ll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh, as if I’m in on the joke


And you can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

And tell me if I’m wrong
And tell me if I’m right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love
The way you want me to

I’ll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside, the day is up and calling
But, I don’t have to be
So, please go back to sleep

And stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

And tell me if I’m wrong
And tell me if I’m right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love
The way you want me to

'Cause I love the way you wake me up
For goodness sake, will my love not be enough?

And tell me if I’m wrong
And tell me if I’m right
And tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
And tell me if I know
And tell me if I do
And tell me how to fall in love
The way you want me to

And tell me if I’m wrong
And tell me if I’m right
And tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
