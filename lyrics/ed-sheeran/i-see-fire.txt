Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons


If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side

And if we should die tonight
We should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

Oh, should my people fall in
Surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain holes, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father, oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then, my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire
Oh, you know I saw a city burning out (fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (fire)
And I see fire
Uh (fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
