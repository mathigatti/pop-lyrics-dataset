Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room


Now this bar has closed this doors
I found my hand just holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?

Or maybe we should take a ride
Through the night
And sing along to every song
That's on the radio
In the back of taxi cab in Brooklyn, no, no, no
The Sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3am
So DJ, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
And we'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kiss you darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

A new love
In New York

Yesterday you gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
The world is moving too fast

You don't know where to begin
Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon the Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know
So DJ, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
And we'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kiss you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

A new life
In New York

And every song that plays
It's just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying maybe
That's a waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight

In New York, it's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
And we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start of everything you want

A new love
In New York
