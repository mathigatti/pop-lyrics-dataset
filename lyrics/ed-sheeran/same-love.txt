When I was in the 3rd grade
I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was
And I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like: Ben, you've loved girls since before pre-K
Tripping, yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math, like
Yeah, I'm good at little league
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition, playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And "God loves all his children" it's somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know


And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm

If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately
"Man that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're saying
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots
Behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate
Yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water that you soak in is then poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it!
I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm

We press play, don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Till the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever God you believe in we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath, it's all the same love
About time that we raised up

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm

Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient, love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (I'm not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (I'm not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (I'm not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (I'm not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient, love is kind
