Just lay it all down on me
It’s getting harder for me to breathe
Just want to know if it will be
Just want to know if it is me


And you know I’ve learned from my mistakes
And how much have I got to lose?
You find my heart is hard to break
Can’t keep playing the fool

Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what’s there beyond the pale

I feel like I’ve gone to the end of the world
What do I have to do?

You know I’ve learned from my mistakes
How much have I got to lose?
You find my heart hard to break
Can’t keep playing the fool

Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what’s there beyond the pale

What can I do
Just to let you know
That you’re in my mind?
To try and justify
The way you liberate me
Every time
