[PnB Rock]
Anything she need, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, dawg, that's all me
Just know if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you (it's FRED again)
Anything she need, she can call me
Don't worry about her, that's my seed, dawg, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you


[Ed Sheeran]
And she ain't messin' with no other man
Me and her have something different
I really need all you to understand
That nobody's comin' close
And I don't ever wanna run around
I spent my youth jumpin' in and out
But you know I fuckin' love her now
Like nobody ever could

And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh no
I'm stickin' with my baby for sure
Together or solo
It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no
So if you hear about my lady, just know
That she ain't the one to play with, oh no
And I'll be standin' so close
So you know that, ayy

[PnB Rock]
Anything she need, she can call me
Don't worry about her, that's my seed, dawg, that's all me
Just know if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you

[Ed Sheeran &amp; PnB Rock]
If you cross her
Then you cross me
And nobody's comin' close, yeah
And I think that you should know that
If you cross her (anything she need, she can call me)
Then you cross me
(Don't worry about her, that's my seed, dawg, that's all me)
So come on, and let it go
Oh, I think that you should know

[Chance The Rapper]
That she ain't messin' with no other man
Now, what you not gon' do
Is stand there, crouched for me, like you got kung-fu
Death stare, cross-armed, runnin' your mouth like a faucet
But you don't know that my girl been doin' CrossFit
Pew, kung pow, hit your ass with a cross kick
Pulling air out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a lil' blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit, ayy
No one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the HBIC
Couple of things that you need to know
If you still wanna be friends with me

[PnB Rock]
Just know if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you

[Ed Sheeran &amp; PnB Rock]
If you cross her (anything she need, she can call me)
Then you cross me
(Don't worry about her, that's my seed, dawg, that's all me)
And nobody's comin' close, yeah
And I think that you should know that
If you cross her (anything she need, she can call me)
Then you cross me
(Don't worry about her, that's my seed, dawg, that's all me)
So come on, and let it go
Oh, I think that you should know

[Ed Sheeran]
She stay trippin' and she crazy, oh no
Quit messin' with my baby, for sure
Together or solo
It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no
So if you hear about my lady, just know
That she ain't the one to play with, oh no
And I'll be standin' so close
So you know that
