It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time we let in light and banish shade
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time


But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time, it's hard, but while you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

Where a kiss of love can kill you
And there's death in every tear
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well, tonight we're reaching out and touching you

No peace and joy this Christmas to west africa
A song of hope and there's no hope tonight, ooh
Why is coming first to be feared?
Why is to touch to be scared?
How can they know it's Christmas time at all?

Here's to you
Raise a glass to everyone
Here's to them
And all their years to come
How they know it's Christmas time at all?

Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feel the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feel the world, let them know it's Christmas time again

Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feel the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
