Well, I've walked this street
Well, I've walked this street before
And everyone's locked up their door
'Cos they heard me coming


And I've been running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she's cares

It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery

You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running

From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see

You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
It's taken you a long time to see

In misery
And everyone's locked up their door
'Cos they heard me coming
And I've been running

From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she's cares
It's taken you a long time to see

You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
You said we went too fast

And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what

I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory

This song's for you, not for me
In misery
It's taken you a long time to see
In misery
