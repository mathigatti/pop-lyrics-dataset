I stole a car last night
Don't know where we're gonna go
But go ahead and drive
I will take you home


Honey, it's cold outside
And your jumper's torn up
But darling, hold on tight
I will keep you warm

And we will cry 'till this fire is drowned
And we will write all our memories down
And we will drive 'till these tires wear out
But darling I
I will take you home

If we could drive all night
Until the Sun is showing
I see it in your eyes
They will take me home

Honey, it's so damn bright
Daylight's taking over again
Just follow the signs
They will lead us home

And we will cry 'till this fire is drowned
And we will write all our memories down
And we will drive 'till these tires wear out

But darling, I
I will take you home
And we will drive 'till the tires run out
And we will write all our memories down
And we will cry 'till this fire is drowned

But darling I
I will keep you warm
Darling I
I will keep you warm
Darling I
I will take you home
