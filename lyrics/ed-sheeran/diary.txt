Your love is the strongest thing I know
I reckon its been doing weights
Eating raw eggs and cereal
And running ten miles a day
And your love as I'm driving vans
I try to steer intoxicated with another love inside lands
And your love is a friend of mine
So we'll take care tonight


If you could only say the words
I'll take it and I'll write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Untill the day you found me out
But I know your love
And thats why

I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words

And your love
Has never my enemy
Used to hold me
And pormise it would never leave
Never been better since all the therapy
To read the words between the lines
And take away my melody
And your lo-o-ve
Told me it was fell into a different page
And you know if I let you go
I'll still keep you safe

If you could only say the words
I'll take it and I'll write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Untill the day you found me out
But I know your love
And thats why

I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words

You are the one I fall asleep with
But never wake up to
Coz work is something you must do
I trust you like you trust me
It must mean true love
It does exactly what it says on the tin
Let me begin
You are the one I watch the movies with
For recognising my love for kiera knightley for what it truly is
Just an excuse so I dont have
To watch love actually again but you're actually the same
Its just to spite me
And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it
Untill the dishes finish
Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it
I tried to make tea once for you in bed
But all I did was spill it
So you made it for me instead
Let me in bed
If you get in ahead of me
Its better to do
Yep love is ahead of the truth
That in love
We are better in two
I'll be the newcomer
Stuck in heaven with the devin you

Diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
Yeah
