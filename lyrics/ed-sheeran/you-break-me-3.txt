Well my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you


‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you’re too cold
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies
And show you there’s no surprise in me’

Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that’s what’s going on

‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left
You break me
