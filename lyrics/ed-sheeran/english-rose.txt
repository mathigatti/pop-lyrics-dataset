Across the sea
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me
I’d find my hopes and my dreams
But I long to be in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
She’s waiting for me


So I’ll make my way
Through long, winding country roads
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose

I told my dad
On the phone, it’s amazing
From the straight to the crazy
These places I’ve been
But I long to be
In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother
He understands me
I spend my days just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose

I met a man
In a bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
And he told me, “son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea”
And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose

My heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
My heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
