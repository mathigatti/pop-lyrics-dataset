The life I live is a fast one
But even if I'm getting home-pies, I would have some
Course I think I'm top of the sport I do bar-none
Won't change a thing and I can still have a chart run, still be a gargon
You grow up as a kid; you're looking up to your older
And then you lose respect because you see what they show ya
I wish I didn't have to be the one that they looked to
I don't condone the war that the young ones are put through
Things have changed now but I come from the hood too
People say they never see me there but I'm hood dude
Say the word lemon, I'll be there with the good food
Certain man you see and they are not in a good mood
I just let the world go by and I'll pace it
If I draw a good picture then another can trace it
Mother dropped me in the world only for me to grace it
I'm gona leave my mark on this earth place it, advanced not basic


If I could, I would change
Life's a battle I'm only one somebody I can only do so much
And even I ain't worry but I still stay strong
I am the only one, ohh
I tell them no man is an island, well you will think we are but I'm breaking the silence

I wanna see us all on one time
But if I'm on the bill then someone gotta spit one rhyme
What they tryna do is light the show with me one sign
Can't help the world will your only one mind, only got one life
If you don't reverse and take it serious; one mic
Deny you of your legacy and they ain't got one right
Well I record a batch of nine tracks in one night
I work through the hours and then I meet with the sunlight
I know I got power but I'm tryin to channel it
I know that we can make the music, money, and manage it
Even starting from the floor I'll find the flow and unravel it
Every time I watch the news blud it's making me sad a bit
I really need to change the channel over to happy vibes
N-dubz, fazer, tulisa, dappy vibes
Whoevers in the lime-light's got a good apetite
I rate ya, how am I gona hate ya? Harry right, huh

If I could, I would change
Life's a battle I'm only one somebody I can only do so much
And even I ain't worry but I still stay strong
I am the only one, ohh
I tell them no man is an island, well you will think we are but I'm breaking the silence

If I could, I would change
Life's a battle I'm only one somebody I can only do so much
And even I ain't worry but I still stay strong
I am the only one, ohh
I tell them no man is an island, well you will think we are but I'm breaking the silence
