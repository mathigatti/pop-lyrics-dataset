I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, why don't you turn off the lights
So I don't wanna leave here ever no?
She was like: Damn
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance, hey
You and I, Whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Oh, my, my, my


[Ed Sheeran &amp; Paulo Londra]
I was rolling off something with you
Kickin' back in the way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (prr)
But they ain't got nothing on you (uh, uh)
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones con flow)

[Paulo Londra]
Mami, suelo acobardarme, pero hoy tomo alcohol, uh
Quiero comentarle que no sé que pasó, uh
Desde que salimos por la tarde los dos
A besarnos los dos hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemos los dos no se puede igualar
Parecemos ficción cuando entramos en acción
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeah
Pero lo que mata
Es que esta noche nos vemos ya en mi casa
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar

[Dave]
Yuh, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need: You and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the Rover
Casa Cruz, Casablanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
That outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? 'Cause that's something to do
I got a million and two, but they're nothin' on you, nah

Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
She was like: Damn
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
And I just want to be your man
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
She was like: Damn
And you ain't got nothing on you
