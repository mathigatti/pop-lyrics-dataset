Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them


And my father told me: Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
You're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing

Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while, here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love

And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when

My father told me: Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing

Darlin', hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while, here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love

To the love we love, we love, we love

And my father and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
(And all of my brothers and my sisters, yeah)
And my father and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah

To the love we love, we love, we love
To the love we love, we love, we love
To the love we love, we love, we love
