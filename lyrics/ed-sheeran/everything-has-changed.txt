All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something, know something know I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago is green eyes
And freckles and your smile in the back of my mind, making me feel like


I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes looked like coming home
All I know is a simple name and everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

And all my walls stood painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you
And I feel in my stomach is butterflies, the beautiful kind
Making up for lost time, taking flight, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes looked like coming home
All I know is a simple name and everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
Oh, and meet me there tonight
Let me know that it's not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

Cause all I know is we said hello
Your eyes looked like coming home
All I know is a simple name and everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is my new found brightness
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
