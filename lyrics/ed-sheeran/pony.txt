I'm just a bachelor
I'm looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even fallin' off
Gotta be compatible
Takes me to my limits
Girl when I freak you out
I promise you, won't want to get off


If your horny, lets do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
Come and jump on it
If your horny lets do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddles waitin'
Come and jump on it

Sittin' here, flossin'
Peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I would do to you
You and your body
Every single portion
I'll send shivers up and down your spine
And fluids flowin' down your thigh

If your horny lets do it
Ride it my pony
My saddle's waitin'
Come and jump on it
If your horny, lets do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddles waitin'
Come and jump on it

Wanna get freaky, baby
And feel you next to me
And you can join jockey team
Wanna get nasty, baby
And feel you next you me
And you can join my jockey team
Oh

If your horny, lets do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
Come and jump on it
If your horny, lets do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddles waitin'
Come and jump on it
