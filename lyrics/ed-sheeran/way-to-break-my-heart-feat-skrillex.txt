Star sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinking about her


And her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

Oh, why, oh, why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone elses arms?
Well, that's the way to break my
Heart

That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That’s the way to break my

First love never dies
Guess I'll see you in another life
Twelve years down the line
There's just one thing I remember

Her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don’t know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

Oh, why, oh, why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, oh, yeah, you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone elses arms?
Well, that's the way to break my heart

That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart

That's the way to break my
That's the
That's the
That's the

Did I, did I?
That's the
That's the
That's the way to break my
