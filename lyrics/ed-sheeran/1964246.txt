Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Pain splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go


And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me
Or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek
To turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love

My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love

Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me
Or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek
To turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh, give me love

Give a little time to me
Or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek
To turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh, give me love

My, my, my, my, oh, give me love
My, my, my, my, oh, give me love
My, my, my, my, oh, give me love
My, my, my, my, oh, give me love

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (love me, love me, love me)
