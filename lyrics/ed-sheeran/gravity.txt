Lay me down covered with nothing but your duvet on
We could be in love if love was a reality
Take me down to where your heart and where your soul came from
And we can fall in love cause love is only gravity
I fell in love with a chick who's a no go


Running around the town like an old bloke
Where back out cause you know though
We used to be so solid oh no
Everybody in the scene risked it
Deep down I dont know how I coulda missed it

If the balls in your court and she swings by
Then your the one that hits it
I dont know if we'll make it now
She dont know so ima break it down
Every time that I'm lying down

Shes out there getting bossed around
She dont know if we'll make it know
Oh look your naked now
Even though I like your smile
This is the last time ill take it down

Lay me down covered with nothing but your duvet on
We could be in love if love was a reality
Take me down to where your heart and where your soul came from
And we can fall in love cause love is only gravity
Look now I'm back where I started

Running around the town, pissed off
Angel see you got what you came for
Then like canerow parted
I aint scared of your boo-tay
Just see you in a new way

I dont care what you dude say just get out my duvet
I dont know if we'll make it now
She dont know so ima break it down
Every time that I'm lying down
Shes out there getting passed around

She dont know if we'll make it know
Oh look your naked now
Even though I like your smile
This is the last time il take it down
Lay me down covered with nothing but your duvet on

We could be in love if love was a reality
Take me down to where your heart and where your soul came from
And we can fall in love cause love is only gravity
Its not what you are doing
Its not what you have done
Its more that I'm persuing
But you are only one

Lay me down covered with nothing but your duvet on
We could be in love if love was a reality
Take me down to where your heart and where your soul came from
And we can fall in love cause love is only gravity
