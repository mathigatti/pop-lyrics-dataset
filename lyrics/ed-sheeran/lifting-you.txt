I know you heard this before
I know you heard this before
It's working for sure
Gonna be hurting tomorrow


But tonight, hey hey
We're going for it (don't judge me)
Tonight, we're going for it (come touch me)
Tonight, we're going for it (like you love me)
Tonight, we're going for it (hear me out)

We've come to have a good time
And we won't comprise
We wanna hear the fellas
We wanna feel the lights

Automatic wine
My money stacked so high
Takes the smallest slice
It'd still touch the sky

Tonight we're going turbo
We're gonna eat a lot of merlot
But the question is

So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name
They're lifting you
So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name
They're lifting you

I know you heard this before
I know you heard this before
It's working for sure
Gonna be hurting tomorrow

But tonight, hey, hey
We're going for it (don't judge me)
Tonight, we're going for it (come touch me)
Tonight, we're going for it (like you love me)
Tonight, we're going for it (hear me out)

You ever seen one girl take over the night?
Take over the city and restore its pride
If you're gonna roll a blunt
Then roll a blunt right

The room is too dark
Someone spark up the light
[?] Got the strap on the side
My people still fly the kite

But I learned from my grandma
To master my eye
Oh shit I'm talking too much
I'm too fucking hyped

Tonight we're going turbo
We're gonna eat a lot of merlot
But the question is

So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name
They're lifting you
So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name
They're lifting you

I know you heard this before
I know you heard this before
It's working for sure
Gonna be hurting tomorrow
But tonight, hey, hey

Blood, blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
