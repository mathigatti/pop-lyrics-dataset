Shock horror I'm down
Lost, you're not around
There's a lump in my chest that
Sends cold through my head and


My mind shuts sound out
I'm an auto pilot
And my tounge's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down
Next to me

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
Ooooohh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
You said you said you said
That I miss you
And I miss you

These words mean nothing to me
I'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching
Come strip and suffocating

My mind is racing
With the picture I'm painting
My belly sick to its stomach
When I remember all the time
He was with you when I lay it down
You lay down
Next to me

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
Ooooohh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
You said you said you said
That I miss you more than I let on
I kissed you, far too long
I'll let go, as soon as you do see I know
We're not through

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
Ooooohh
I don't when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
You said you said you said
That I miss you
That I miss you
