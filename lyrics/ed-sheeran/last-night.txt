I went out late last night
And cold air met me
Lost a grip on my shoes
Walked home in bare feet


And I'll stay awake
Till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away, out

Tonight, this day won't end
The fire keep burning now

I'm never gonna leave here, tonight
I'm here again, the fire keeps burning now
I'm never gonna leave here

Let the dark cover me
And hold me tight
Hear the words in my sleep
Close your eyes for a second life within

And I'll stay awake till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away out, tonight

This day won't end, the fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight I'm here again
The fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here

Outside, in the winter, in the cold, I have not been asked where to go, and so, oh
I am here alone, waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
And day, to end, the fire is burning now
I ain't ever gonna leave here now, and I'm here again
Oh, oh I ain't ever gonna leave here

Tonight, I'm out to meet ya
Tonight, I will feel no cold
Tonight, I'll ignore that my feet hurt
And I'll be no more, without you
