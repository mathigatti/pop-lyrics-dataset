Met her smoking a cigarette
In a toilet cubicle
Ripped dress, tattooed chest
She's beautiful


Say the time and place to start a future
And, darling, I don't care
Broken hearts can find a love
To make them whole anywhere

Oh, darling, here we go again
We are only man or woman
And we all make mistakes
Don't you know we're only human?
It's what our hardships say
And when I heard those words and knew them
I could feel your pain
'Cause I have felt disabled

Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?

She told me about her mum and dad
And they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchanging names
We're two souls intertwined

We have both got it wrong
From time to time and let that go
With each other, hand in hand
As we mend broken souls

Oh, darling, here we go again
We are only blood and bones
That cover beating hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones
But we know who we are
I could put you back together
When you come apart
We should make a start now

Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?

And it feels like we felt serenity
And some things are not what they seem
My love, right now it's only you and me

Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?
Can you feel the love in mine?
