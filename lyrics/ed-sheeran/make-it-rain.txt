When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so and just the same


Make it rain
Make it rain down, low
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain down, low
Make it rain
Make it rain

A seeds needs the water
Before they grow out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting harder
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so and just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down, low
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain down, low
Just make it rain
Make it rain

The seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur
Never reach the poor
Let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
And fill the sky with all that they can drop
When it's time to make a change

Make it rain
Make it rain down, low
Make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain down, low
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain down, low
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
