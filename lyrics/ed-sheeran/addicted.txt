I think I took too much
I'm addicted to your touch
But I'm crying
In shame again


And now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
Oh well, we've come this far

You're my Venus
And I'm your Mars
And we've passed the Moon
And stars

And I'm gone
But now I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm might be gone
When you get home

I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm almost gone
When you get home
So please come home
