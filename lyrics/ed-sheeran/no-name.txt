Born with a heart
That could ache more than beat
The mind of the killer
The soul of the meek


Born aimless and angry
Ran hard from the day
Left love at the crossroad
Into a man that I hate

Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I jump to my knees?

Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?

I fight for the hope
That blood has a face
To give me a kiss
For the faith that I wait

Flock with no shepherd
Is a vulnerable game
I can live without heart, without love
But I do need a name

Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I jump to my knees?
Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?

King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
