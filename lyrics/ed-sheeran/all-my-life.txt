Darling, I've been waiting for you
All my life
Crossed towns and hills and river for you
All my life
But I'm wondering in the dark now, 'cause we need to make it through
So please walk beside me in all I do


I'm really cant pull out the thorn, love
All my life
And not having you pressed to my chest
All my life
This storm is playing out now, and we need to make it through
Of all our incompleteness in the wars we do
So won't you come here?

'Cause it's written on my hand
I wanna print it on your body yeah, print it on your soul
Singing, your love makes me a different man
I want its soul into my body, I want its soul into me

I'm drinking evian from your lips, darlin'
Evian from your hands
I wanna drink evian from your heart
Evian from your pants, darlin'
Evian from your lips, darlin'
Evian from your hands
I wanna drink evian, evian

And I'm singing songs of love like getting jolly all my life
And we'll find the truth out, finally
In the heart of our lifes
Now this song is playing out now, and we need to make it through
So please walk beside me in all I do
Won't you come here?

'Cause it's written on my hand
I wanna print it on your body yeah, print it on your soul
Singing, your love makes me a different man
I want its soul into my body, I want its soul into me

Drinking evian from your lips, darlin'
Evian from your hands
I wanna drink evian from your heart
Evian from your pants, darlin'
Evian from your lips, darlin'
Evian from your hands
I wanna drink evian, evian

It's written of my eyes
I wanna print it on your body yeah, print it on your soul
Singing, your love makes me a brand new man
I want its soul, I want its soul

I'm drinking evian from your lips, darlin'
Evian from your hands
I wanna drink evian from your heart
Evian from your pants, darlin'
Evian from your lips, darlin'
Evian from your hands
I wanna drink evian, evian

Darlin', darlin'
Darlin', darlin'
