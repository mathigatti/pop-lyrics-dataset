Are you with me? Just me?
Would you let me in?
Would you let me over?
Like a bottle of gin
Are you with me? Just me?
Would you let me in?
Would you let me over?
Like a bottle of gin


You know I love it when you dance for me
(Just me)
But I hate it when you make plans for me
'Cause a younger wanna do what he want to do
Girl, now you want the baddest in life
Make me take a shot and swallow my pride
I wanna push all them other hoes to the side
Two seats in the whip if you're ready to ride
So fly, that your lows in my Sun yeah

Just wanna buy you heels and give you sexual headache
Pedal up beside me, understand that I'm too winner
Now I like to argue, and smoke some?
'Cause nowadays niggas crazy as self
But operates well on the sound of machine
I'd rather be a??? Taught over the town
Slept well, so now my name don't ring a bell
Bring you some by next joint
We all gon' be on it, so if you don't get it
Still act like you know me
I'm only 23 with the whole world in front of me
Right here is where you want to be, yeah!

Are you with me? Just me?
Would you let me in?
Would you let me over?
Like a bottle of gin

Would you let me over?
Like a bottle of gin

You know I love it when you dance for me
(Just me)
But I hate it when you make plans for me
'Cause a younger wanna do what he want to do
Now, you're sad, and I know you better than you know yourself
You say I give you feelings that you never felt
Cool nigger but in seconds I can make you melt
So you buy me Gucci belt, so we bells???
We were slow dancing in a burning room

I was tryina sweet the past you, you were tryina brighten up the room
Dirty game, the moment that we found the fame
Instantly, you knew that this was gon' bring you pain
But the sad thing is the game was repeatedly kept coming
Good to know that you wasn't with just for the money
Can we make this official? I was already tearing
Did I not let you kick it with your girlfriends every weekend?
I know you used to smoke together, now you're tricking
Yeah, I had my time with shawty and you know know she dissin'
Okay, you know she bad, yeah I know you're mad
But when we crossed pass I'd be missing every time we had
Yeah!

When I see you, just me
What's a boy to do?
Please come back to me
Make my dreams come true
When it comes to heartbreak
What's a little girl like you?
When I'm close to you
Make my dreams come true
You with me? Just me?

Would you let me in?
Would you let me over?
Like a bottle of gin
Are you with me? Just me?
Would you let me in?
