Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't've let you go
'Cause now you're out of sight, yeah


Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me stranded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Oh, tell me, babe, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't've let you go

Oh, I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
