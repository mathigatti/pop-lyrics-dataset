You are the one, girl
And you know that it’s true
I’m feeling younger
Every time that I’m alone with you


We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It’s just something that I want to do
I’ll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend’s roof
I had both of my arms round you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It’s just something that I want to do
I’ll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
