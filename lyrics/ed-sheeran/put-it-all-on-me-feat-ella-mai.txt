Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feeling low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul


I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you? I need a
Strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you who can be taking away
The shit that I go through each and everyday
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say

Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darling, I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darling, put your worries on me
Can't judge because I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me

All on me, all on me
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
All on me, all on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
All on me, all on me
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me

Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby

I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you? I need a
Strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you that can be taking away
The shit that I go through each and everyday
Baby, I can't wait, in love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now

Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My, darling, I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darling, put your worries on me
Can't judge because I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me (babe)

All on me, all on me
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly (slow)
All on me, all on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
All on me, all on me
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whatever you need (need)
So put it all on me

I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you? I need a
Strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
