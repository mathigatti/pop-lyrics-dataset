[Ed Sheeran]
I'm feelin' like a bullet
Jumpin' out a gun
I'm feelin' like a winner
I feel like the one
You're doing something to me
You're doing something strange
Well, jump back, talk to me, woman
You make me wanna make a baby, baby


[Chris Stapleton]
A supernatural woman
A supernatural freak
Don't know what you're doing
Got me feelin' weak
Oh, I wanna call you fever, baby
You could set a fire on me
Hot damn, pop it like a pistol, mama
You got me down on my knees, begging please

I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you, hey
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind

[Bruno Mars]
You red leather rocket
You little foxy queen
Everybody's watching
Pretty little thing
Baby, tell me what's your fantasy
Come closer, let's talk about it
You want white lines in a limousine
Whipped cream, and everything in between, yeah

I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind
I'm comin', baby

[Ed Sheeran]
I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm comin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind
