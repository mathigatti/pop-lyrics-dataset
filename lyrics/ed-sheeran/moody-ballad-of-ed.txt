Come on now
Dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you


Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags

You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)

My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
You'll never leave me alone

Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again
And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you

I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still gone to pack my bags
You didn't know me

(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
