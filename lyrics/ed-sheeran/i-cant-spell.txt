I found the words to say how I feel
But I just can’t spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field


So you can tell them
That I’m a different man with a different tune
I didn’t find love until last June

But I lost it, just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
‘Cos I need something, anything to replace you
Or something close
