Come ye masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks


You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it’s your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
As the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young people’s blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

And you’ve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, you ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I’m young
You might say I’m unlearned
But there’s one thing I know
Though I’m younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could?
Well, I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
And I'll follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I’ll watch as you’re lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I’ll stand over your grave
To make sure that you’re dead

Cool
He's an intense guy, isn't he?
