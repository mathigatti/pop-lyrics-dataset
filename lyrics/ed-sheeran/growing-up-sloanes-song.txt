They say boys don't cry
But your daddy shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear


Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea

They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know

I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong

I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album

Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad, that's living in FaceTime
But I've got a world to sing to and you at the same time

I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet 16, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that

Get back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest a raising in the Sun
Listen to Sam Cook, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love

Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

I recommend that you read The Alchemist
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment

Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak around after but boy, you better tiptoe

Don't wake your mom up, do yoga, learn 'bout karma
By God, believe the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less

Steady David Bowie, James Bowen and 2Pac
Watch the Sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid
Jaywalk, but look before you do it

If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends till it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become

If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
I'm still growing up
I'm still growing up, ooh
I'm still growing up
I'm still growing up
