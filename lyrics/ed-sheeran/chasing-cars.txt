We'll do it all everything, on our own
We don't need anything, or anyone
If I lay here, If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world


I don't quite know how to say how I feel
Those three words are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here, If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
That's bursting into life

Let's waste time chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace to remind me
To find my own

If I lay here, If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
That's bursting into life

All that I am, All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes
They're all I can see, I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never
Change for us at all
