I live in two different worlds
Like lots of other boys and girls
One's at home with my family and the other's school
Where I learn all that I can be


I live in two different worlds
I live in two different worlds
In home I can speak whenever I please
I can talk real loud and shoot the breeze
At school I raise my hand in the air
When thereâ€™s something that I want to share

At home we go
At school we go
At home we go
At school we go

I live in two different worlds
I live in two different worlds
At home I can sit here and there
In the couch, my bed or easy chair
In school I have a special place
My desk, and that's my learning space

At home we go
At school we go
At home we go
At school we go

I live in two different worlds
I live in two different worlds

School got more rules
Because learning is a goal
Learning takes focus, so you need self control

In home I move wherever I like
I can run around and ride my bike
In school we have a different way
We stand in line everyday

At home we go
At school we go
At home we go
At school we go

I live in two different worlds
I live in two different worlds
Home and school are two different worlds
Two awesome worlds
