They call me young gun like I was a pistol in the primary
Speaking codes no binary
Irony, is that I don't have a beautiful mind at all
I'm not tired at all
There's no time to pause
Deep thought, with my feet sore from walking
Not a lot of money for a cheap Porsche
Though I don't drive but I'm known by the guys
That are design to make you go hype
Like Devlin and Grim with the chillin' chillin'
Bring Yasmin for the singing, killin'


And I'm keeping the melody where it better be
I'm deadly and readily burning within the evergreen of enemies
Higher than a feather with Amphetamines
Only my head top could be ahead of me
Voice hoarse but guess what? It's never Ketamine
Making noise from Brent Cross
Head in the hedge tops
Giving up my soul again for the guest spot
Four young guns in London
When we're coming
When we're coming
Are we coming
Are we coming

And the feelin' of thunder
Storming from my hunger
And I'm travelin' higher
Should we wake up the fire
That's why they call me a young gun
And now my name is getting bigger
Press the music like a trigger
I'm a young gun
And now my future's looking brighter
Never stop cause I'm a fighter
I'm a young gun

Yeh, me and Devlin young gunnin'
Clean up, delete you with one button
If you don't know, somebody best tell them
Burn everything red like Ed Sheeran
I'm so good, I already went heaven, let's get them
I'll rip em in ten seconds
Till I gotta Hollaback like Gwen Stefani
Follow that 'cause I'm transcendin'
You get better than stop and hope they're getting the message
I put in lesser the effort, I'm still better than most
Come around try break double getting them home
I've been ten out of ten for 11 years old
Try rap for me, but I leave 'em alone
I'm back with a title like I leave it at home
Oh, see me at the O2, no gaspin'
Know that I'm coming up next like Yasmin

And the feelin' of thunder
Storming from my hunger
And I'm travelin' higher
Should we wake up the fire
That's why they call me a young gun
And now my name is getting bigger
Press the music like a trigger
I'm a young gun
And now my future's looking brighter
Never stop cause I'm a fighter
I'm a young gun

Young guns
I'm a young gun like a brand new weapon
I will stand any stand and I'll tell 'em what I reckon
To be a part of the arsenal presence
You'd have to be better than Devlin, Yasmin, Griminal and Ed is
So in that case forget it
If you don't make the cut like a radio edit
You'll get left beheaded then deaded
When Devs takes you out like a direct debit
1, I went away for a minute or 2 but now I'm back in the booth
I got 'em all pissed like I poured cognac on the tune
I ain't nobody's son 'cause I stand on the Moon
Young guns with the class a lines
That'll heighten your mood like chasin' spirals with a spoon
You aren't safe like a baby inside of the womb
Any time we arrive in the room

And the feelin' of thunder
Storming from my hunger
And I'm travelin' higher
Should we wake up the fire
That's why they call me a young gun
And now my name is getting bigger
Press the music like a trigger
I'm a young gun
And now my future's looking brighter
Never stops cause I'm a fighter
I'm a young gun
