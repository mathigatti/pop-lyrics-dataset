I'm standing on a mountain
Waiting for you to come
You were sitting counting
The days that I had gone


The note I wrote
I wrapped up in a cigarette
Burned away the memories
I tried to forget

But not yet
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you

My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
I love you

How can I tell you?
I don't know what to say
This chance that I won't miss
But I miss you anyway

I feel your pain
It's turning me insane
Thrown away
I had to take the last train home

But then you came
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you

My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
Wishing my life away

These three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
You know it's true

I love you
I love you
I love you
