'Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
'Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don't like it
When you and I getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby


I'm not a rapper just a singer with a game plan
I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my drake hand
80, 000 People in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the Sun to shine just to rock these ray bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub

My mate Jason at the bar screaming: Who want what?
Now, please be warned
That every song I feature on has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type
Now I'm in the lime light
Tryna get my mind right
Body clock is in the clouds
So often guess it's high time
Hoodie sing the line like

'Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
'Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don't like it
When you and I getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

I'm not a singer, I just rap pretty
So now my fan base is full of Megan's and Ashley's
And they're wondering
If there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like: Naturally, baby
Let me find a spot in the front
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, we can pretend
Oh, typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to paula my patent
Young prince of manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is yeezus

One for the money
Two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold, not everybody is winning
I'm larry david plus miles davis
So, everybody hating and fuck it, I hardly blame 'em

'Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
'Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don't like it when you and I getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

And they don't know anything about us
Or anything about us
Or anything about it
No, no, no
