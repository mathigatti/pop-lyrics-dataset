I’m at a party I don’t wanna be at
And I don’t ever wear a suit and tie
Wondering if I can sneak out the back
Nobody's even looking at me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say: Shall we dance? Hell yeah!
Y’know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that


Don’t think I fit in at this party
Everyone’s got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I’m nobody
Who wants to fit in anyway?

'Cause I don’t care
When I’m with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh)

'Cause I don’t care
As long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you making me feel like I’m loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh)

We at a party we don’t wanna be at
Trying to talk, but we can’t hear ourselves
Read your lips, I’d rather kiss ‘em right back
With all these people all around, I’m crippled with anxiety
But I’m told it's where I’m supposed to be
You know what?
It’s kind of crazy coz I really don’t mind
When you make it better like that

Don’t think we fit in at this party
Everyone’s got so much to say, oh, yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said: I’m sorry
But now I think that we should stay

'Cause I don’t care
When I’m with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause I don’t care
As long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you making me feel like I’m loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh) (no)

I don’t like nobody but you
It’s like you’re the only one here
I don’t like nobody but you
Baby, I don’t care

I don’t like nobody but you
I hate everyone here
I don’t like nobody but you
Baby, yeah

'Cause I don’t care (don’t care)
When I’m with my baby, yeah (oh, yeah)
All the bad things disappear (disappear)
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody (maybe I’m somebody)
I can deal with the bad nights (with the bad nights)
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh) (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

'Cause I don’t care
As long as you just hold me near (me near)
You can take me anywhere (anywhere, anywhere)
And you making me feel like I’m loved by somebody (loved by somebody, yeah)
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh)
