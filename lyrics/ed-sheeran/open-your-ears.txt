Can't get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
I'll say what I don't mean


In your world we were the same
In mine now you're the one to blame
You can't remember my name
We're lost, it's such a shame

Listen to me (yeah, yeah)
Stop making me see
What I've been waiting for
Listen to me (yeah, yeah)
Stop making me see

I'm strong yet proud
I'm quiet yet loud
And I'm everything
You want in me
I'm small yet tall I have it all
And I'm everything
You want me to be

Listen to me (yeah, yeah)
Stop making me see
What I've been waiting for
Listen to me (yeah, yeah)
Stop making me see

And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
I'm on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you still

Listen to me (yeah, yeah)
Stop making me see
What I've been waiting for
Listen to me
Making me see
