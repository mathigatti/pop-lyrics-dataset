I stare at my reflection in the mirror
Why am I doing this to myself
Losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
No, no, no, no


Don't lose who you are, in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are

(Who you are, who you are, who you are)

Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?
I forgot what to do to fit the mold
The more I try, the less it's working
Cause everything inside me screams
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
There's nothing wrong with who you are

Yes, nos, egos
Fake shows like woo
Just go, and leave me alone
Real talk, real life, good luck, good night
With a smile
That's my home, yeah
That is my home

No, no, no, no, no
Don't lose who you are, in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are
Yeah, yeah
