I found the cure to growing older
And you're the only place that feels like home
Just so you know, you'll never know
And some secrets weren't meant to be told
But I found the cure to growing older


I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again
And I've got arrogance down to a science
And I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends now

Douse youself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up
So douse youself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up

Find a safe place, brace yourself, bite your lips
I'm sending your fingernails and empty bottles you've sipped
Back to your family cause I know you will be missed
So you can find a safe place, brace yourself

They call kids like us vicious and carved out of stone
But for what we've become, we just feel more alone
Always weigh what I've lost against what I left
So progress report, I am missing you to death

Douse youself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up
So douse youself in cheap perfume it's
So so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up, no

Someone old
No one new
Feeling borrowed
Always blue

Someone old
No one new
Feeling borrowed
Always blue

Someone old
No one new
Feeling borrowed
Always blue

Someone old
No one new
Always borrowed
Always you

I found the cure to growing older
I found the cure to growing older

So douse youself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up
So douse youself in cheap perfume it's
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up
