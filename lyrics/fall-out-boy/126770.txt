Drink down that gin and kerosene
And come spit on bridges with me just to keep us warm
And light a match and leave me be
Light a match and leave me


I keep my jealousy close cause it's all mine
And if you say this makes you happy then I'm not the only one lying

Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
(The hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday)
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
(The hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday)

And I keep my jealousy close cause it's all mine
And if you say this makes you happy then I'm not the only one lying

Drink down that gin and kerosene
And come spit on bridges with me just to keep us warm
And light a match and leave me be
Light a match and leave me

So wear me like a locket around your throat
I'll weigh you down
I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue
You look so good in blue
So wear me like a locket around your throat
I'll weigh you down
I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue
You look so good in blue
So wear me like a locket around your throat
I'll weigh you down
I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue
You look so good in blue
