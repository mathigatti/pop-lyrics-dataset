When they say, you and what army?
I guess they're talking about you and me
Baby, nobody will love you
Nobody will love you like-like I do
I guess that's half true


Come down, come down
Come down from your holy mountain
I'm down, I'm down
So put your shame on a billboard for a second
Sometimes, sometimes
The only way out is through, through

'Cause everyone loves Bob Dylan
I just want you to love me like that, yeah
Would you bury me next to Johnny Cash?

I'm obsessed, do you love me like that? Yeah

So what fates do we share?
Windows down, wind in your hair
Baby, no one ever thinks of you
No one ever thinks of you as much as I do
Not, not even you

Come down, come down
Come down from your holy mountain
I'm down, I'm down
So put your shame on a billboard for a second
Sometimes, sometimes
The only way out is through, through

'Cause everyone loves Bob Dylan
I just want you to love me like that, yeah
Would you bury me next to Johnny Cash?

I'm obsessed, do you love me like that? Yeah

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh

'Cause everyone loves Bob Dylan
I just want you to love me like that, yeah
Would you bury me next to Johnny Cash?

I'm obsessed, do you love me like that? Yeah
