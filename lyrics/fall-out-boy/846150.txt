We take sour sips
From life's lush lips
We shake shake shake the hips
In relationships
Stop by this disaster town
You'll put your eyes to the sun and say "I know"
You're only blinding to keep back what the clouds are hiding
And we might have started singing just a little soon
We're throwing the stones in a glass room.


Whoa ah oh we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa ah oh lovesongs so genuinely cunning

We keep the beat,
With your blistered feet
We bullet the words at the mockingbirds, singing
Slept through the weekend
And dream
Sinking with the melody of the kiss of eternity
Get house calls from a pharmacist, saying "how you been"?
We might have said goodbyes just a little soon
(Somehow this disaster town)
Our beliefs of kissing beats over this room

Whoa ah oh we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa ah oh lovesongs so genuinely cunning
Whoa ah oh we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa ah oh lovesongs so genuinely cunning

It was ice cream headaches and sweet avalanche
When the pearls in our shells came out to dance
You call me a bad tipper of the cradle
But I'm tired yawns for fawns on hunter's lawns
We're the has-beens of husbands
Sharpening the knives of young wives
Take two years and call me when you're better
Take teardrops of mine, find yourself wetter

Whoa ah oh we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa ah oh lovesongs so genuinely cunning
Whoa ah oh we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa ah oh lovesongs so genuinely cunning
