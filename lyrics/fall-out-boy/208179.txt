Are we growing up or just going down
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears and put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light


We're the therapists pumping through your speakers
Delivering just what you need
We're well-read and poised
We're the best boys
We're the chemists who've found the formula
To make your heart swell and burst
No matter what they say, don't believe a word

'Cause I'll keep singing this lie if you'll keep believing it
I'll keep singing this lie 
I'll keep singing this lie 
Are we growing up or just going down
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears and put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light 

We're traveled like gypsies
Only with worse luck and far less gold
We're the kids you used to love
But then we grew old
We're the lifers here til the bitter end
Condemned from the start
Ashamed of the way
The songs and the words own the beating of our hearts

'Cause I'll keep singing this lie I'll keep singing this lie 

Are we growing up or just going down
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears and put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light
There's a drug in the thermostat to warm the room up
And another around to help us bend your trust
I've got sunset in my veins
And I need to take a pill to make this town feel okay

The best part of "Believe" is the "Lie"
I hope you sing along and you steal a line
I need to keep you like this in my mind
So give in or just give up

The best part of "Believe" is the "Lie"
I hope you sing along and you steal a line
I need to keep you like this in my mind
So give in or just give up

Are we growing up or just going down
Are we growing up or just going down
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears and put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light
