You already know what it is (you already know what it is)

She wants to dance like uma thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like uma thurman
And I can't get you out of my head


The stench, the stench, of summer sex
And ck eternity, oh hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
I can move mountains
I can work a mira- I can move mountains
Work a miracle

She wants to dance like uma thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like uma thurman
And I can't get you out of my head

The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions, but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
I can move mountains (ah ah)
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
I can move mountains
I can work a mira- I can move mountains
Work a miracle

Ahaha, young khalifa, man, yeah
I can move mountains
Joint in my hand rocking jewels
My job I do it too well
I take care of my crew well
I just cancelled that old show so I'm bout to get a new girl
My new girl is too dull
I'm brad pitt in the cool world
Ain't nothing left to do but call your friends and bring 'em through
You feeling me, I'm feeling you
You be the teacher, I'm the student
And I can beat it up but just don't think that I'm abusive
I'm nothin' like her ex, I'm more exclusive
Than the flesh it's no illusion
Young khalifa
Uh, yup yup

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle (oh oh)
I can move mountains
I can work a mira- I can move mountains

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle (I can move mountains
I can work a miracle)
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
