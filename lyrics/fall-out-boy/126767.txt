Last night I saw a movie
And I thought about many movies ive seen at your house
Excuse me if I'm rude
But id rather that we just strike from the record ones I'd see again without you
Leaning on my shoulder
Distracting me from the plotline


Where can I go when I want you around
But I cant stand to be around you
Go home
Ill walk myself to you
Ill walk myself away from here

Go to hell is all I thought for seven weeks
But I grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people
Looking glossed just like a summer ago

Where can I go when I want you around
But I cant stand to be around you
Go home
Ill walk myself to you
Ill walk myself away from here

Call me back, I'm pleading with a cork in my head
It wouldnt be the first time
My pillow has been mistaken

Where can I go when I want you around
But I cant stand to be around you
Go home
Ill walk myself to you
Ill walk myself away from here

Cant stand to be around you
Around you, around you
Cant stand to be around you
Cant stand, I cant stand
To be around you
Around you
Around you
Around you
Around you
