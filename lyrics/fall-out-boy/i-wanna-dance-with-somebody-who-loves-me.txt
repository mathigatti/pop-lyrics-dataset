Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls


Oh, wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need someone to take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody oo somebody oo
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody oo somebody oo
To hold me in his arms oh
I need someone to take take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
