Last year's wishes
Are this year's apologies
Every last time I come home
I take my last chance
To burn a bridge or two
I only keep myself this sick in the head
Cause I know how the words get you


We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof and loneliness
At best, at best

Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you

Collect the bad habits
That you couldn't bare to keep
Out of the woods but I love
A tree I used to lay beneath
Kissed, tear-stained and vain
From a sour bottle baby girl
With eyes the size of baby worlds

We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof and loneliness
At best, at best

Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you

The best way
To make it through
With hearts and wrists in tact
Is to realize
Two outta three ain't bad
Ain't bad

Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
(Honeymoon)
Setting in our honeymoon
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I wake up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I wake up next to you
(Honeymoon)
