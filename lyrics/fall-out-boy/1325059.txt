Sometimes
When I'm in heaven
I get the key for loving her
Until I hear you bickering like boys and birds
The heat is off, gate's open, the shade is down


I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother, come get my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

I got the skyline in my veins
Forget your night times
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel
And joke us, joke us
'Til Lakeshore Drive goes back into focus
I just wanna come back to life
Spark my crazy head to keep you warm at night

I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother, forget my head
At the dead end called unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun, fun

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
