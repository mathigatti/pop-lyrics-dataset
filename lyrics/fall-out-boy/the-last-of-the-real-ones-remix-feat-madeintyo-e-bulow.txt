I was just an only child of the universe
And then I found you, and then I found you
You are the sun and I am just the planets
Spinning around you, spinning around you


You were too good to be true, gold plated
But what's inside you?
But what's inside you?
I know this whole damn city thinks it needs you
But not as much as I do, as much as I do, yeah

'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me

I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from

You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones

(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones

Go slow, yeah, take your time
Never, never, never wanna call your line
Yeah, yeah, last of the real ones
Yeah, yeah, baby can you feel some
In the pool like a spaceship
Stoned like an ancient
Gotta learn to have patience
Countless nights, baby girl just lay there

But my feelings are swaying
And you keep me hanging
Baby, gonna just wait on my phone

'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me

I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from

You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones

(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones

I make heart eyes, I sacrifice, I break my neck
For you I'd die, for you I'd die
Roll over, I'm a puppy dog
But I treasure you as all I've got
As all I've got (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Jealousy, my worst enemy
I try to escape, but it gets to me
My one and only, so I'll be there
Like I need to be

'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me

I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from

You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones

(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
