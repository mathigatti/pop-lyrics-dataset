This might just be a waste of time 
but theres no one i'd rather 
waste my time with than all my best friends 
to stop this horror 


we'll all take turns not for the worst 
we're all has-beens and never-weres 
we're all in the back singing roxanne 
just once in my passersby (passersby) 

as if we had enough to try to kiss her 
enough to make up for lost time 
enough to make up for lost time 

we been down, we been out, we been hanging round.
we been to the no time left in the game. 
stop moving, get me out of this one horse town. 
wasted star 

whoo 
we been down, we been out, we been hanging round. 
we been to the no time left in the game. 
stop moving, get me out of this one horse town. 
wasted star, wasted star
