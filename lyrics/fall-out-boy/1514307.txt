Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh

Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can’t be sure when they’ve hit their mark
And besides in the mean, meantime
I’m just dreaming of tearing you apart
I’m in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage
I’m a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite


My songs know what you did in the dark

So light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
I’m on fire

Light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
I’m on fire

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
In the dark, dark

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
In the dark, dark

Writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I’ve got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you’re the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
I’m on fire

Light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
I’m on fire

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
In the dark, dark

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
In the dark, dark

My songs know what you did in the dark
(My songs know what you did in the dark)

So light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
I’m on fire

Light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
Light ‘em up, up, up
I’m on fire

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
In the dark, dark

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
In the dark, dark

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
