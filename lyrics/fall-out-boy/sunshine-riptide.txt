I don't even have my own attention
You say: Please don't ever change
But you don't like me the way I am
The sign says don't tap the glass
But I read it in reverse, ssalg eht pat t'nod syas ngis ehT
The world tried to burn all the mercy out of me
But you know I wouldn't let it
It tried to teach me the hard way
I can't forget it
Driving down the coast again
The pills are kicking in
The pills are kicking in


She said I love you till I don't
I'm just playing house
No idea what I'm doing now
There are no atheists in foxholes
The pressure's getting to me
It's time to throw the towel

'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came in like a wave when I was feeling alright
The sunshine

They call me OluwaBurna
I fell in love, but I didn't further
Them say me nuh normal
Drinkin' messy, me nah drink water
Make me stumble upon me (Air Jordan)
Ain't no slowin' down
You know I keep it rollin' now
Smokin' in my fuckin' brain
Passin' through my fuckin' town
Feel like I'm bulletproof, bulletproof, baby ooh
The sun's shining through
Got the blunt and the juice ooze
Riding through

The sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came in like a wave when I was feeling alright
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun (I'm stuck in the sun)
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun

You are my truest feeling yet
I love you so much
It's just like oxygen
And it's getting to my head
A public meltdown
Petulant but irrelevant

Take all your possibilities and take away the limits
Take your ideas and throw away all the gimmicks
I do the best with what I have
The pills are kicking in
The pills are kicking in

Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feeling al-
I was stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feeling alright

Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun (I'm stuck in the sun)
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun (I'm stuck in)
