Why can you read me like no one else?
I hide behind these words
But I'm coming out
I wish I kept them behind my tongue
I hide behind these words
But I'm coming out


Put your hand between an aching head
And an aching wound
We'll make them so jealous
We'll make them hate us
An aching head
And an aching wound
We'll make them so jealous
We'll make them so jealous

Always you made my stomach turn
And all the long drives
With my friends blur
And I wish I kept them inside my mind
I hide behind these words
And think of all the places
Where you've been lost
And found out
In between my sheets
In between the rights and the wrongs

Put your hand between an aching head
And an aching wound
We'll make them so jealous
We'll make them hate us
An aching head
And an aching wound

Think of all the places
Where you've been lost
And found out
