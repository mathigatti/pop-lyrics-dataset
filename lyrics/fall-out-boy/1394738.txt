I can't explain a thing
I want everything
To change and stay the same oh time
Doesn't care about anyone or anything
Come together
Come apart
Only get lonely when you read the charts


And oh baby, when they made me, they broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around then I got cold
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand

I'm a mascot for what you've become
I love the mayhem more than the love

And oh baby, when they made me, they broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around then I got cold
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand

Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them cause I just don't care
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them cause I just don't care

I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Oh oh change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Oh change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand

We will never believe again (I will never believe in anything again)
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again (I will never believe in anything again)
Preach electric to a microphone stand

We will never believe again (I will never believe in anything again)
