I love everything about you that hurts
So let me see your moves, let me see your moves
Lips pressed close to mine, true blue


But the prince of any failing empire knows that
Everybody wants, everybody wants
To drive on through the night, if it's the drive back home

Things aren't the same anymore
Some nights it gets so bad
I almost pick up the phone

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
I know it's strange
It's a strange way of saying
That I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you

I've already given up on myself twice
Third time is the charm, third time is the charm
(Threw) caution to the wind, but I've got a lousy arm

And I've traced your shadows on the wall, now I kiss them
Whenever I'm down, whenever I'm down
Figured on not figuring myself out

Things aren't the same anymore
Some nights it get so bad
I almost pick up the phone

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
I know it's strange
It's a strange way of saying
That I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you

I was born under a bad sign, you saved my life
That night on the roof of your hotel
Cross my heart and hope to die
Splinter from the headboard in my eye
Photo-proofed kisses I remember so well

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
I know it's strange
It's a strange way of saying
That I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you
