I'm head over heels for someone I
that I really can't deal with
I wanna block her out my mind
but I really can't do it
I tell myself this the last time
I'ma let her do this to me
Whenever we do spend time I realize
that I can't get enough of you.


Wipe that smile off your fucking face,
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your face.
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your fucking face,
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your face.

Refrão:
To be despised, to be loved.
To be dreamt of, to be sought
On the inside I don't care
Right in the middle,
I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
On the inside I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my only.

I wear scarves and hoods cause it's the only poker
face that I've got left
And everything I love about you is a mess
Smash the mirror and break the palm reader's hands
I want to be better than I am

Wipe that smile off your fucking face,
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your face.
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your fucking face,
[then I say to u]
Wipe that smile off your face.

Refrão:
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
On the inside I don't care
Right in the middle,
I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
On the inside I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my only

Girl, just look what you done,
How could you do this to me?
I gotta put my foot down,
I can't let you do this to me.
I can't forget those good old times,
and all those things you were doing to me.
I wanna hit that one more time,
I'm in love with what you're doin' to me.
I'ma say it loud
right, right, left, up in this crowd
Why we arguin'?
I thought me and you were suposta be friends.
Let's chill for a minute,
Better yet, we need ta heal for a minute.
Baby, put down the knife,
sometime I wanna save your life...[but I'm cool]

Refrão:
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
On the inside I don't care
Right in the middle,
I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
On the inside I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my only
