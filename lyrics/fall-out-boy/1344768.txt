I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, til its over love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming no no no, no no
I ain't loving you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but cant escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know


So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
I cant keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I cant keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, In the danger zone
How many times did it take til I finally got through
you lose, you lose
I ain't loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to go
No more wasting time, we cant wait for life
which is wasting time, wheres the finish line

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
I met no one new, I got no one new
No I said I'm through, but got love for you
But i'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
Am I into you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I ain't loving you, the way I wanted to
Way I got to go, I don't need you
I been on this road, too many times before
I ain't loving you, the way I wanted to

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keeping ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keeping ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keeping ya love locked down, you lose
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keeping ya love locked down, ya love locked down
If you keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keeping ya love locked down, you lose
