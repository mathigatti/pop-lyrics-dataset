When i wake up, i'm willing to take my chances on the hope i forget
That you hate him more than you notice i wrote this for you.


You need him. i could be him...
I could be an accident but i'm still trying.
That's more than i can say for him.

Where is your boy tonight? i hope he is a gentleman.
Maybe he won't find out what i know: you were the last good thing about this part of town.

Someday i'll appreciate in value, get off my ass and call you...in the meantime i'll sport my
Brand new fashion of waking up with pants on at 4:00 in the afternoon.

You need him. i could be him...
I could be an accident but i'm still trying.

(won't find out) he won't find out
(won't find out) he won't find out

Where is your boy tonight? i hope he is a gentleman.
Maybe he won't find out what i know: you were the last good thing about this part of town.
