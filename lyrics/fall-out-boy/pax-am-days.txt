Hey, darling, know any bands for my play my party?
Um, I don't know; how 'bout Fall Out Boy?


The king is dead (long live the king)
The king is dead (long live the king)
The king is dead (long live the king)
The king is dead

Yeah, I said lord be my savior
Please don't, we've been doomed from the start
Now we're so dismissive
So the king cannot play the part

Yeah, I said the king is dead (long live the king)
Yeah, I said the king is dead (long live the king)
Yeah, I said yeah
Huh, huh

Huh

The may never think and wonder why, dear Christ
Every time I see you I just want to paint the walls white

Yeah, I said the king is dead (long live the king)
Yeah, I said the king is dead (long live the king)
Yeah, I said yeah
Dead
