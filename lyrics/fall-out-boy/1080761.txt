Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night


Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light

I loved you since I knew you
I wouldn't talk down to you
I have you to tell just how I feel
I won't share you with another boy

I know my mind is made up (oh)
So put away your make up
Told you once I won't tell you again
It's a bad way

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

(Roxanne) You don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne) You don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne) You don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) You don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne) 
Put on the red light
Put on the red light
You don't have to put on the red light
Put on the red light
Put on the red light
Put on the red light
Put on the red light

(Roxanne)
Put on the red light
You don't have to put on the red light
You don't have to put on the red light
Put on the red light
You don't have to put on the red light
Put on the red light
(Roxanne)
Put on the red light
(Roxanne)
You don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne)
Put on the red light
(Roxanne)
Put on the red light
Put on the red light
Put on the red light
