Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town


When I wake up
I'm willing to take my chances on the hope I forget
That you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you (for you, so)

You need him
I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him

Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town

Someday I'll appreciate in value
Get off my ass and call you (but for) the meantime I'll sport my
Brand new fashion of waking up
With pants on at 4:00 in the afternoon

You need him
I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him

1-2-3-4!

Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town

(Won't find out) he won't find out
(Won't find out) he won't find out

Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town

Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman (he won't find out)
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
