They've got us surrounded; we're in their sights
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive


If I was still around
Walk me through
I am your savior now
And I'm your secret too

Carry them alive
Fall off the case again
You're just a black widow
Who fell in love with herself

They've got us surrounded; we're in their sights
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive

If it's never been broken
Can't believe in it
Now you're just a problem
For someone else to fix
If I was still around

I am your savior, yeah
I am your secret too

They've got us surrounded; we're in their sights
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive
