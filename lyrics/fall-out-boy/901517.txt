I'm a stitch away
From making it
And a scar away
From falling apart
Apart


Blood cells pixelate
And eyes dilate
And the full Moon pills got me out on the street at night

Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room

Oh
Put love on hold
Young Hollywood
Is on the other line

Her nose runs ruby red
Deaths in a double bed
Singing songs that could only catch
The ear of the desperate

Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose

I'm a stitch away
From making it
And a scar away
From falling apart
Apart

Blood cells pixelate
And eyes dilate
Kiss away young kills and thrills on the mouths of all my friends

Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
(Watch you work the room)

(I'm a stitch away)
