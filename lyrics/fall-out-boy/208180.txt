I comb the crowd and pick you out
My mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out
It starts eyes closed to fingers crossed
To I swear, I say
To hands between legs, to Whatever it takes
To drinks at the club, to the bar
To the keys to your car
To hotel stairs to the emergency exit door


To the love, I left my conscience pressed
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
What did it ever do for me?, I say
It never calls me when I'm down
Love never wanted me
But I took it anyway
Put your ear to the speaker
And choose love or sympathy
But never both
Love never wanted me

I hoped you choked
And crashed your car
Hey, tear catcher, that's all that you are
And ever were
From the start
I swear, I say
(I swear, I say)

To hands between legs, to Whatever it takes
To drinks at the club, to the bar
To the keys to your car
To hotel stairs to the emergency exit door, no

To the love, I left my conscience pressed
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
What did it ever do for me?, I say
It never calls me when I'm down
Love never wanted me
But I took it anyway
Put your ear to the speaker
And choose love or sympathy
But never both, no

To the love I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyhole, I watched you dress
Kiss and tell
Loose lips sink ships

To the love I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyholes, I watched you dress
Kiss and tell
Loose lips sink ships

To the love I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyholes, I watched you dress
Kiss and tell (kiss and tell)
Loose lips sink ships

To the love I left my conscience pressed
To the love I left my conscience pressed
To the love I left my conscience pressed
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
What did it ever do for me?, I say
