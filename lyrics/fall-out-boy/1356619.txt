You could've knocked me out with a feather.
I know you've heard this all before, but we're just Hell's neighbors.
Why, why, why won't the world revolve around me?
In my dreams trees grow all over the streets.


But I don't know much about classic cars (cars).
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (coke).
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike, Media Blitz.

Let's hear it for America's suitehearts.
But I must confess, I'm in love with my own sins.

You can bow and pretend that you don't, don't know you're a legend.
Time, time, time hasn't told anyone else yet.
(..Sorry, I just..)
Let my love loose again.

Let's hear it for, let's hear it.
Sweethearts.
Let's hear it for, let's..
Suitehearts.
