I could walk this fine line between elation and success
We all know which way I'm going to strike the stake between my chest
So you have to prove yourself
You'll have to prove it to me


So now you're waiting up for him
You're wasting time every time

Oh! Can't do it by myself
Oh! Can't do it by myself
Oh! Can't do it by myself
Oh! Can't do it by myself
Oh! Can't do it by myself

I can't wake up to these reminders of who I am
A failure of everything, 18 going on extinct
I know my place it's nowhere you should roam

So now you're waiting up for him
You're still wasting time every time

Oh! Can't do it by myself
Oh! Can't do it by myself
Oh! Can't do it by myself
Oh! Can't do it by myself

Oh! Can't do it by myself
Oh! Can't do it by myself
Oh! Can't do it by myself
Oh! Can't do it by myself
