It's kind of like smiling similiar to a mouthful of candy
It's like 3: 00 on your last day of
School it's someone else's turn to play the fool


Let's take a walk and let our feet just talk

Let's reach for hands and hold hips where we stand

I'd like to introduce you to my eyes
They've been dying to meet you
Now that you both have met
I have something to dive into

I've let go of the past even before you asked to ensure this
Ship sails smoothly
You can be the wind and guide this ship to a safer place than
This

Let's speak our words and exaggerate the absurd
Show me your teeth and
Promise to never stop smiling

I'd like to introduce you to my lips
They've been dying to meet you
Now that you both have met
I have something to hold onto

I'd like to introduce you to my heart
It's been dying to meet you
Now that you both have met
I have someone to write home to

It's ok if it's not a white Christmas
We can sleigh ride on the sand
We'll bundle up in sweatshirts and sweaters just don't you let
Go of my hand
