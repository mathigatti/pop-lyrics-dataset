Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Wa aoh oh ooh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Wa aoh oh ooh


Life's just a pace-car on death
Only less diligent
And when the two collide
It's no coincidence
The lights are on and everybody's home

The only thing suicidal here is the doors
We had a good run
Even I have to admit
Life's just a pace-car on death
Only less diligent

Hell or glory
I don't want anything in between
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And daddy said "you gotta show the world the thunder"
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh
The thunder

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Wa aoh oh ooh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Wa aoh oh ooh

We didn't come to compete
This is a demonstration
Even the young ones become irrelevant
They always bring up how you've changed
Never the same person when I go to sleep
As when I wake up
As when I wake up
Bop bop ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop

Hell or glory
I don't want anything in between
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And daddy said "you gotta show the world the thunder"
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Wa aoh oh ooh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Wa aoh oh ooh

Hell or glory
I don't want anything in between
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And daddy said "you gotta show the world the thunder"
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh
The thunder

Woah oh oh
He said "bring the thunder!"
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh
The thunder
Woah oh oh oh oh
