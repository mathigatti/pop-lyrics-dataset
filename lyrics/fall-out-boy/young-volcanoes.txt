When Rome's in ruins
We are the lions
Free of the coliseums


In poison places
We are anti-venom
We're the beginning of the end

Tonight the foxes hunt the hounds
And it's all over now before it has begun
We've already won

We are wild, we are like young volcanoes
We are wild, Americana, exotica
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful baby? Yeah!
Oh!

Come on
Make it easy, say I never mattered
Run it up the flagpole
We will teach you how to make boys next door
Out of assholes
(Ha Ha)

Tonight the foxes hunt the hounds
And it's all over now before it has begun
We've already won

We are wild, we are like young volcanoes
We are wild, Americana, exotica
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful baby? Yeah!
Oh!

We are wild, we are like young volcanoes
We are wild, Americana, exotica
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful baby? Yeah!
Oh!
