Baby, seasons change but people don't
And I'll always be waiting in the back room
I'm boring but overcompensate with
Headlines and flash, flash, flash photography


But don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me

Wouldn't you rather be a widowed than a divorcee?
Style your way for fashion magazines
Widowed or a divorcee?
Don't pretend it
Don't pretend
We don't fight fair

They say your head can be a prison
Then these are just conjugal visits
People will dissect us 'till
This doesn't mean a thing anymore

Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me

Wouldn't you rather be a widowed than a divorcee?
Style your way for fashion magazines
Widowed or a divorcee?
Don't pretend it
Don't pretend

We do it in the dark, with smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed, in secret places (woah)
We do it in the dark, with smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed, in secret places
We don't fight fair

We do it in the dark, with smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed, in secret places (woah)
We do it in the dark, with smiles on our faces

With smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed, in secret places

Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
We don't fight fair
