I am such a sucker
And I'm always the last to know
My insides are copper
And I'd kill to make them gold
Conversation got me here: another night alone in the city
So make my bed the grave and shovel dirt onto my sheets


Every friend we ever had in common
I will sever the tie with you
You can thank your lucky stars
That everything i wish for will never come true

When you go, I will forget everything about you

I've seen sinking ships go down with more grace than you

Turn this up I'll tune you out
Another night alone in the city
Fake it like you matter- cause that's the biggest secret you
Have to keep
