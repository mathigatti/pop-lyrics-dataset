Let the good times roll
Let them knock you around
Let the good times roll
Let them make you a clown


Refrão:
Let them leave you up in the air
Let them brush your rock and roll hair
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll


Let the stories be told
Let them say what they want
Let the photos be old
Let them show what they want

{Refrão}

If the illusion is real
Let them give you a ride
If they got thunder appeal
Let them be on your side

{Refrão}

Let the good times roll
