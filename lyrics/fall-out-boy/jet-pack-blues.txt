I got those jet pack blues
Just like Judy
The kind that makes june feel like september
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent


She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember: Baby, come home
Did you ever love her? Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing: Baby, come home
Baby, come home

I've got those jet pack blues
Flight off the light tonight and just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink?
It never mattered what it was
I think our heads were just that close
The sweetness never lasted, no

She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember: Baby, come home
Did you ever love her? Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing: Baby, come home
Baby, come home
