I wrote a goodbye note in lipstick on your arm
When you passed out
I couldn't bring myself to call
Except to call it quits


Best friends
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
Not the other way around
Racing through the city
Windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars

You're wrong
Are we all wrong?
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?

This city says

Come hell or high water
Well I'm feeling hot and wet
I can't commit to a thing
Be it heart or hospital

Best friends
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
Not the other way around
Racing through the city
Windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars

You're wrong
Are we all wrong?
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?

The tombstones were waiting
They were half-engraved
They knew it was over
Just didn't know the date

I cast a spell over the west to make you think of me
The same way I think of you
This is a love song in my own way
Happily ever after below the waist

Best friends
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
Racing through the city
Windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars

You're wrong
Are we all wrong?
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?

Best friends (you're wrong)
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers (you're wrong)
Not the other way around
Ex-friends till the end (you're wrong)
Better off as lovers (you're wrong)
