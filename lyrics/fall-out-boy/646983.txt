Landing on a runway in Chicago 
and I'm grounding all my dreams of ever really seeing California,
because I know what's in between is something sensual in such non-conventional ways.


Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say.
Tonight I'm writing you a million miles away.
Tonight is all about "We miss you."

And I can't forget your style or your cynicism, 
somehow it was like you were the first to listen to everything we said.
My smile's an open wound without you...and my hands are tied to pages inked to 
bring you back.

Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say.
Tonight I'm writing you a million miles away.
Tonight is all about "We miss you."

These friends are, new friends are golden.
These friends are, new friends are golden.
These friends are, new friends are golden.
