I got the midnight tennis elbow
Got the solitairy burn
Took a turn
An ace up my sleeve (so to speak)


I wanna choke
Get sick off of you
Like second-hand smoke
Got me sweatin' at the cutoff lights
Just returned epiphany

I am a wing (wing)
I'm a prayer (prayer)
A thimble in the making
A promise from a part of perfect character
We'd understand it but not for long

I'll give you heat stroke
I'm gettin' you and I'm loosin' me

We'd get legendary
tonight little darlin'
uh-huh little darlin'
But I gotta nomadic head
I love you but I got to regret

We'd get legendary
tonight little darlin'
uh-huh little darlin'
But I gotta nomadic head
I love you but I got to regret
