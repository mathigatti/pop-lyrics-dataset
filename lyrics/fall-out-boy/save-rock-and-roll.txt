Until your breathing stop, stop, stop
Until your breathing stop, stop, stop
Until your, your, your, your, forever, forever...


I need more dreams
And less life
And I need that dark
In a little more light
I cried tears you’ll never see
So fuck you, you can go cry me an ocean
And leave me be

You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word "yes"
I’m here to scream

No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll
Rock and roll, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll

Forever, forever
Until your breathing stop, stop, stop
Until your breathing stop, stop, stop
Until your, your, your, your, forever, forever...

Blood brothers in desperation
An oath of silence
For the voice of our generation
How’d it get to be only me?
Like I’m the last damn kid still kicking
That still believes

I will defend the faith
Going down swinging
I will save the songs
That we can't stop singing

No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll
Rock and roll, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll

Oh, no, we won't go
We don't know when to quit, oh, oh (x4)

You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word "yes"
I'm here to scream

No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll
Rock and roll, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll

Oh, no, we won't go
'Cause we don’t know when to quit, oh, oh (x6)
