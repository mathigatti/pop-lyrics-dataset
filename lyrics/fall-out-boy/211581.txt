Life isn't funny when your working yourself out
Get in or get out
I'm standing by myself
In your room, It's so crowded
Just let me out:


Just let me out
Been through it a thousand times before
(Been through it a thousand times before)
I won't regret this anymore

[Chorus:]
All the songs have been sung
All the wrongs have been done
Time now for
Me to go
Time now for
Start the show

Last Night I had a dream that I did not wake up
I lied in bed all night until my eyes would shut
I dreamed of you
(I dreamed of you [x3])
But I'm so different from the person that you once knew

Just let me out
Been through it a thousand times before
(Been through it a thousand times before)
I won't regret this anymore

[Chorus]

Start The Show!!..
Been through it a thousand times before
(Been through it a thousand times before)
I won't regret this anymore

[Chorus]

Start The Show!!
