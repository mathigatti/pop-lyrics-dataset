I'm holding out and I'm holding on
To every letter and every song
I wrote myself out of the day we ever had to meet
Are you through with me?


So, and when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me "sorry" with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me "sorry" with a straight face (Let's go!)

I'm all ears and I'm all scars
To hear you tell me: Boys like you, you try too hard
To look not quite as desperate, I'm hanging on
But I still know the way to make your makeup run

So, and when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me "sorry" with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face

And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me "sorry" with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell
(Take this to your grave)
Will you be able to tell me "sorry" with a straight face
(I'll take it to mine)

And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goes
