you laughed at my affections while i passed by your direction 
i should have known from your walk 
it was the end of you 
its not that i dont respect your opinion 
your quick with lips just rip me apart 
sometimes like this i've got a big mouth
and maybe you can handle shutting it up 
a simple contradiction could shake my whole foundation 
i'm taking back every step towards you 
still failing at everything i do 
in the meantime just talking to my shoes 
converse with my Converse 
at least they hear a word i say 
and scrutinize it just as far as they can tell what i'm getting
at 
you've twisted my tongue around my neck for the last time 
but parker lewis can't lose 
i'll spend my life trying to figure this all out
but this is the last song about you
