(Here we go again)
Welcome to the demolition derby that is my heart
I'm only here to crash a life it was never alright from the start
Sometimes i feel like the whole world is after me
I'm just the best lookin' pony in the glue factory
But out of every pretty pretty miscalculation
You have got to be my all-time favorite
Love, sex, death
Till there's nothing left
Love, sex, death
Till there's nothing left
Nothing left
But out of every pretty, pretty miscalculation
You have got to be my all-time favorite
Love, sex, death
Till there's nothing left
Love, sex, death
Till there's nononononononothing left
