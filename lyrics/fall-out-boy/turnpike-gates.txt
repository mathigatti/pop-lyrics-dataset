We would drag ourselves to bed
And sleep took everything I had
I kept it up till he would call
You made me feel like a criminal
And then there's you
You kept a smile though I would always walk the wire


You gave it all
I gave you reason to have doubt
I had to get out of there
I took the stairs
I don't wanna fight with you if I can't be the one to have you
You sat that chair like a queen in the kitchen
I memorized the lines your eyes made at every squint you shot my way

We would drag ourselves to bed
And sleep took everything I had
I kept it up till he would call
You made me feel like a criminal
And then there's you,
You kept a smile though I would always walk the wire

But you're miserable and I'm useless
Always making up excuses
I made you cry too many times
So I'm hanging up that line
I'm throwing rocks at your floor
I'm knocking down your front door
I'm desperate tonight and I just wanna fight
It's my confusion that lets me act so cold
So now I'll go, go, go
And you wanna be just left alone
Put down that phone, cause if you want me just call out: Hey, boy!
