I don’t know where you’re going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don’t know where I’m going but I don’t think I’m coming home
And I said, “I’ll check in tomorrow if I don’t wake up dead”
This is the road to ruin
And we’re starting at the end


Say yeah! (yeah!)
Let’s be alone together (yeah!)
We could stay young forever (yeah!)
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs

Say yeah! (yeah!)
Let’s be alone, together (yeah!)
We could stay young forever (yeah!)
We’ll stay young, young, young, young, young

Cut me off
I lost my track
It’s not my fault
I’m a maniac it’s not funny anymore
No it’s not
My heart is like a stallion
They love it more when it’s broke in
Do you wanna feel beautiful?
Do you wanna?

I’m outside the door
Invite me in
So we can go back
And play pretend
I’m on deck
I’m up next
Tonight I’m high as a private jet

'Cause I don’t know where you’re going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don’t know where I’m going but I don’t think I’m coming home
And I said: “I’ll check in tomorrow if I don’t wake up dead”
This is the road to ruin
And we’re starting at the end

Say yeah! (yeah!)
Let’s be alone together (yeah!)
We could stay young forever (yeah!)
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs

Say yeah! (yeah!)
Let’s be alone together (yeah!)
We could stay young forever (yeah!)
We’ll stay young, young, young, young, young

My heart is like a stallion
They love it more when it’s broke in
Do you wanna feel beautiful?
Do you wanna?

I’m outside the door
Invite me in
So we can go back
And play pretend
I’m on deck
I’m up next
Tonight I’m high as a private jet

Yeah! (yeah!)
Let’s be alone together (yeah!)
We could stay young forever (yeah!)
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs

Say yeah! (yeah!)
Let’s be alone together (yeah!)
We could stay young forever (yeah!)
We’ll stay young, young, young, young, young

I-I-I don’t know where you’re going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don’t know where I’m going but I don’t think I’m coming home
And I said, “I’ll check in tomorrow if I don’t wake up dead”
This is the road to ruin
And we’re starting at the end
