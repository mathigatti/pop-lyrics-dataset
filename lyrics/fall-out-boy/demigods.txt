That's what I want! Oere we go! one

I am believing
Their hearts are gold
The lion pauses
So you can love him now
I am believing


What if it were all a dream?
What if we were demigods?
They'd take to our knees
Raging at the half of our sins

I am believing
Their hearts are gold
The lion pauses [?]
So you can love him now

I am believing
Their hearts are gold
So go on pick your poison
Before I pick it for you, yeah

What if we run like the wind
Feet are chasing moonlight
What if we run like the wind
Feet are chasing moonlight
