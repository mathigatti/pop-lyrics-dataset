I thought of angels, choking on their halos
Get them drunk on rose water
See how dirty I can get them pulling out their fragile teeth
And clip their tiny wings


Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name, it will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name

If heaven's grief brings hell's reign
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you) for just one yesterday

Letting people down is my thing baby
Find yourself a new gig, this town isn't big enough for two of us
I don't have the right name, or the right looks
But I have twice the heart

Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name, it will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name

If heaven's grief brings hell's reign
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you) for just one yesterday

If I spilled my guts
The world would never look at you the same way
Now I'm here to give you all my love
So I can watch your face as I take it all away away away-ay-yay

If heaven's grief brings hell's reign
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you) for just one yesterday
