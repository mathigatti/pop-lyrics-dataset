I'm a preacher sweating in the pews
For the salvation I'm bringing you
I'm a salesman, I'm selling you hooks and plans
And myself making demands


When I'm home alone I just dance by myself
And you pull my head so close volume goes with the truth
Signing off: I'm alright in bed, but I'm better with a pen
The kid was alright but it went to his head

I am God's gift but why would he bless me with
Such wit without a conscience equipped
I'm addicted to the way I feel when I think of you, woah
There's too much green to feel blue

When I'm home alone I just can't stop myself
And you pull my head so close volume goes with the truth
Signing off: I'm alright in bed, but I'm better with a pen
The kid was alright but it went to his head

When I'm home alone I just can't stop myself
And you pull my head so close volume goes with the truth
Signing off: I'm alright in bed, but I'm better with a pen
I'm alright in bed, but I'm better with a pen
I'm alright in bed, but I'm better with a pen
The kid was alright, but it went to his head
