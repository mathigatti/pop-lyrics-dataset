Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Penny for your thoughts but a dollar for your insight
Or a fortune for your disaster
And I'm just a painter and I'm drawing a blank


We only want to sing you to sleep in your bedroom speakers, whoa
We need umbrellas on the inside
Give me a sign

They say quitters never win
We walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down

Oh oh oh oh

I could learn to pity fools as I'm the worst of all
And I can't stop feeling sorry for myself
Whoa

We only want to sing you to sleep
In your bedroom speakers, whoa
We need umbrellas on the inside
Give us light

They say quitters never win
We walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
They say quitters never win
We walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down

We only want to sing you to sleep
(Your bedroom speakers, whoa whoa)
We only want to sing you to sleep

They say quitters never win
We walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
They say quitters never win
We walk the plank, we walk the plank
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down

Walking down on memory lane
We're alone together, we're alone (Woah)
Walking down on memory lane
We're alone together, we're alone
