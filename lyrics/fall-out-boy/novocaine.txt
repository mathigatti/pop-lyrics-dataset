This is a black, black ski mask song
So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare


If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sang at you, you
Would never sing along
Cast them out cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
And d-d-d-don't mind me, I’m just a son of a gun
So don’t stop, don’t stop until your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you

I’m just a problem that doesn’t want to be solved
So could you please hold your applause
Take this sideshow and all it’s freaks
And turn it into the silver screen dream
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sang at you, you
Would never sing along
Cast them out cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
And d-d-d-don't mind me, I’m just a son of a gun
So don’t stop, don’t stop until your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you
I said one day the valley's gonna swallow me whole
(Hijack the Hype! Hijack the Hype!)
I feel like a photo that’s been over-exposed
(Hijack the Hype! Hijack the Hype!)

They took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
And d-d-d-don't mind me, I’m just a son of a gun
So don’t stop, don’t stop until your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you
