I think I got too many memories getting in the way of me
I'm about to go tonya harding on the whole world's knee
And I'm stuck, night vision
So stuck night vision
But I come to life, come to life


Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve
Are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit?
Eau de résistance

The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah

Seems like the whole damn world went and lost its mind
And all my childhood heroes have fallen off or died
Fake tears, we are living fake tears
But the alcohol never lies, never lies

Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve
Are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit?
Eau de résistance

The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
I testify
I testify
Are you smelling that shit?
Eau de résistance

Hey, hey, hey
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve
Are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit?

The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Are you smelling that shit?
Eau de résistance
