My heart is on my sleeve
Wear it like a bruise or blackeye
My badge, my witness
That means that I believed
Every single lie you said (and learned from the best)


Cause every pain of glass that your pebbles tap negates
The pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention fails to
Mention I still hate you

But there's a light on in chicago
And I know I should be home
All the corners of the street signs
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your
Neighbor's house

She took me down and said
Boys like you are overrated, so save your breath
Loaded words and loaded friends
Are loaded guns to our heads

Cause every pain of glass that your pebbles tap
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention fails to
Mention I still hate you

But there's a light on in chicago
And I know I should be home
All the corners of the street signs
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your
Neighbor's house

You want apologies
Girl, you might hold your breath
Until your breathing stops forever, forever
The only thing you'll get
Is this curse on your lips
I hope they taste of me forever

But there's a light on in chicago
And I know I should be home
All the corners of the street signs
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your
Neighbor's

With every breath I wish your body will be broken again
