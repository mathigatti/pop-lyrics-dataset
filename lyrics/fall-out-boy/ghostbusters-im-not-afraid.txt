(Ghostbusters!)

If there's something strange
In the neighborhood
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters!)


If there's something weird
And it don't look good
Who can you call?
(Ghostbusters!)

I'm calling
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
Uh, I'm not afraid

Who are you calling now?
Ca-calling now?
(Ghostbusters!)
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, nah, nah
Yeah, yeah
(Ghostbusters!)

If you're seeing things
Running through your head
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters!)

An invisible man
Sleeping in your bed
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters!)

Oh, I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
Uh, I'm not afraid

Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters!)
If you're all alone
Pick up the phone and call
(Ghostbusters!)

I can't sleep when I'm home alone
Night time, my lights on
Woo, got me scared
Woo, and I need my bed
In my closet, down the hall
I see shadows all on my wall
Man, these monsters be big and tall
Ghostbusters, who you gon' call?
They roll up to my house, they knocking at my door
They come busting in, kill all them ghosts
It's so strange in my neighborhood
Look out the window and it ain't too good
I ain't afraid, so let's get to it
Smoke these ghosts like Backwoods

Listen, I'm not a, I'm not a
I'm not afraid, not afraid (I'm not afraid)
I'm not afraid, not afraid
Uh, I'm not afraid, not afraid
Uh, I'm not afraid

Now who you calling?
(Ghostbusters!)
Now who you calling out?
Now who you calling out?
Now who you calling out?
(Ghostbusters!)
Now listen

Listen

Uh, I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
Uh, I'm not afraid!

(Ghostbusters!)
