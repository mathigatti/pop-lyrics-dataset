I was just an only child of the universe
And then I found you, and then I found you
You are the Sun and I am just the planets
Spinning around you, spinning around you
You were too good to be true, gold plated
But what's inside you? But what's inside you?
I know this whole damn city thinks it needs you
But not as much as I do, as much as I do, yeah


'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from

You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones

I am a collapsing star with tunnel vision
But only for you, but only for you
My head is stripped, just like a screw that's been tightened too many times
When I think of you, when I think of you
I will shield you from the waves if they find you
I will protect you, I will protect you
Just tell me, tell me, tell me I, I am the only one
Even if it's not true, even if it's not true, yeah

'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from

You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of

I'm here, at the beginning of the end
Oh, the end of infinity with you
I'm here, at the beginning of the end
Oh, the end of infinity with you
I'm done with having dreams, the thing that I believe
Oh, you drain all the fear from me
I'm done with having dreams, the thing that I believe
You drain the fear from me

'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from

You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
