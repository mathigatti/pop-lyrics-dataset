spent most of last night
dragging this lake
for the corpses of all my past mistakes
sell me out, the jokes on you
he is salt and you are the wound
empty another bottle
and let me tear you to pieces
this is me wishing you into the worst situations
i'm the kind of kid that can't let anything go
but you wouldn't know a good thing if it came up and slit your throat


your remorse hasn't fallen on deaf ears
rather ones that just don't care
cause i know
that you're in between arms somewhere
next to heartbeats where you shouldn't be asleep
now i'll teach you a lesson for keeping secrets from me

take your taste back
peel back your skin
and try to forget how it feels inside
you should try saying no once in a while
oh once in while [x2]

and did you hear the news
i could dissect you and gut you on this stage
not as elequent as i may have imagined
but it will get the job done
you're done
every line is plotted and designed
to leave you standing on your bedroom windows ledge
and everyone else that it hits
that it gets to
is nothing more than collateral damage

take your taste back
peel back your skin
and try to forget how it feels inside
you should try saying no once in a while
oh once in a while [x2]
