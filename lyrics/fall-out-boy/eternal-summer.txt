I can't do this again
I need more oxygen
Our days were never numbered
This is eternal summer
I can't do this again
I need more oxygen
Our days were never numbered
This is eternal summer


When you're watching this
I'll be in the desert just wishing on every star
Scuba diving in the wishing well
Just trying to save myself
Hands in the air
Hands in the air
But I'll save the middle finger for you
You get scared when you look at me
Cause I, I'm so fine
Miss me. Se love, mr. superstar
Hands in the air
Hands in the air
But I'll save the middle finger for you

I can't do this again
I need more oxygen
Our days were never numbered
This is eternal summer
I can't do this again
I need more oxygen
Our days were never numbered
This is eternal summer
