Clap until your hands hurt
Standing ovations of boos
Watch us until we blur
Walk off into the sunset
Tell rock and roll I'm alone again
I wanna put the Midwest home again
Your time has passed
They say: Never means never
Solar flare stares won't last but never means forever
Never means forever


Alphadog and omegalomaniac
Alphadog and oh-omega-megalo
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alphadog and omegalomaniac

We must have the best coats
Tell the best jokes
We must make it hard to look so easy doing something so hard
You must see my wake (they scream) when they look at me
I'm a, I'm a star
I'm a, I'm a star
I'm a star
Oh I'm a star

Alphadog and oh, oh, omegalomaniac
Alphadog and oh-omega-megalo
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alphadog and oh oh omegalomaniac

You're not the first or the last
But you're possibly the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand
I'm just fine
You're not the first or the last
But you're possibly the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand
I-

Alphadog and oh, oh, omegalomaniac
Alphadog and oh-omega-megalo
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alphadog and oh, oh, omegalomaniac
