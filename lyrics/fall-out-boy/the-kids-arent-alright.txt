Stuck in the jetwash
Bad trip I couldn't get off
And maybe I bit off more than I could chew
And overhead of the aqua blue


Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window
To the pitch black streets

And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Just wanna fill up the trophy case again

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright

I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness
Like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse

And it's our time now if you want to to be
More the war like the carnival bears set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me

And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit too thin
All those people in those old photographs Iâ€™ve seen are dead

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?

And sometimes I just want to sit around
And gaze at my shoes yeah
And let your dirty sadness fill me up
Just like a balloon

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids
Aren't all, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids
Aren't all, kids aren't alright?
