You could have knocked me out with a (feather),
I know you heard this all before, but were just hell's (neighbours),
Why why why won't the world revolve around me?
Build my dreams, trees grow all over the streets,


But I don't know much about classic cars,
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke,
Down set, one, hut, hut, hike,
Media blitz,

Let's hear it for America's suitehearts,
But I must confess,
I'm in love with my own sins,
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts,
But I must confess,
I'm in love with my own sins,

[Lil' Wayne.

You can never take me down
because I stay forever
from the ground
and look at the
time, time, time
time after time I give it up
time after time I risk it all
all for you.


You can bow and pretend,
That you don't, don't, know you're a legend,
Time, time, time hasn't told anyone else yet,
Let my love loose again,

But I don't know much about classic cars,
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke,
Down set, one, hut, hut, hike,
Media, blitz,

Let's hear it for America's suitehearts,
But I must confess,
I'm in love with my own sins,
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts,
But I must confess,
I'm in love with my own sins,

[Lil' Wayne]
there they go, smelling like life everywhere they go
lookin like addiction now come and let me drug you
i stay high above you like a dove do
this is too far about and of you
i heal, kill, hate, and love you
and this is what we come to
microphone check one two


You could have knocked me out with a (feather),
I know you heard this all before,

Let's hear it for America's suitehearts,
But I must confess,
I'm in love with my own sins,
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts,
But I must confess (I must confess),
I'm in love with my own sins,

Let's hear it,
Oh, let's hear it,
Let's hear it,
Oh, let's,
Suitehearts (suitehearts)
