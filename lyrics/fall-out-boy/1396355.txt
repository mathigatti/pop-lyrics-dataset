Have you ever wanted to disappear?
And join a monastery
Go out and preach on Manic Street?
Who will I be when I wake up next to a stranger
On a passenger plane?
(Passenger plane)


Permanent jet lag
Please take me back
Please take me back
I'm a stray dog sick
Please let me in
The mad key's tripping singing vows before we exchange smoke rings
Give me a pen

Call me
Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in I wanna blow off steam
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor
Don't let the doctor in

It feels like fourteen carats
But no clarity
When I look at the man who would be king
The man who would be king
Goes to the desert
The same war his dad rehearsed
Comes back with flags on coffins and say:
"We won, oh we won"

Permanent jet lag
Please take me back
Please take me back
I'm a stray dog sick
Please let me in
The mad key's tripping singing vows before we exchange smoke rings
Give me a pen

Call me
Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in I wanna blow off steam
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor
Don't let the doctor in

B-b-b-b-Benzedrine
My, my, my Benzedrine
My B-b-b-b-Benzedrine now

B-b-b-b-Benzedrine
My, my, my Benzedrine
My B-b-b-b-Benzedrine now

Only one book really matters
The rest of the proof is on the television, on the...

Call me
Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in I wanna blow off steam
Call me
Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor
Don't let the doctor in

Have you ever wanted to dissapear?

It's not me, it's you
actually, it's the taxidermy of you and me
Untie the balloons around my neck and around me
I'm just a racehorse on the track
Send me back to the good back dreams
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my car
to fly the boys home on my own
But you know me: I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone
And saids that you're boring
Your kids are snoring
You say you're not listening and I said I'm wishing..
and I SAID, I SAID
