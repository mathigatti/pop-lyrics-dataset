I'm trying not to wonder what you're doing now and it still hurts somehow
our pictures disappeared with communications down and i'm living out of town
but the formula for love was found to be untrue-i wait for you
to call me up someday and tell me that you're wrong-it's been too long
and the formula for love was found to be untrue-i wait for you
don't try to tell me that my love for you was wrong
and don't try to tell me that you knew it all along
you never loved, you don't know how
and I feel bad for you right now


I'm trying not to wonder whose heart you'll break this time-
you can bet it won' be mine.
