Patrick and Ellen: 
Superstar
Where you from, how's it going?
I know you
Gotta clue, what you're doing?
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby


Look at you
Gettin' more than just re-up
Baby, you
Got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, You, You are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer 

Pete:
Womanizer

Patrick and Ellen: 
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a

Pete:
You got me going, you also charming, but I can do it, you womanizer

Patrick and Ellen: 
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a
Boy, don't try to front. I-I know just-just what you are-a-a

Pete:
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy, you're nothing but a womanizer

Ellen: 
Daddy-O
