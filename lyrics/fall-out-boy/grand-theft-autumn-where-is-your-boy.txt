Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town


When I wake up, I'm willing to take my chances on the hope
You forget that you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you

You need him, I could be him
I could be an accident, but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him

Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town

Someday I'll appreciate in value
Get off my ass and call you
But for the meantime
I'll sport my brand new fashion of waking up with pants off at 4:00 in the afternoon

You need him, I could be him
I could be an accident, but I'm still trying
That's more than i can say for him

Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town

He won't find out  He won't find out.

Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
