I'm coming apart at the seams
Pitching myself for leads in other people's dreams now
Buzz, buzz, buzz
Doc, there's a hole where something was
Doc, there's a hole where something was


Fell out of bed,
Butterfly bandage, but don't worry
You'll never remember, your head is far too blurry.

Put him in the back of a squad car restrain that man
He needs his head put through a catscan
Hey editor, I'm undeniable!
Hey doctor, I'm certifiable!

I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half doomed and you're semi-sweet

So boycott love
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)

Little girl, you got me staring odd
Or was that just a telescopic camera nod
Painted dolls in the highway truckstop stalls
Lot lizard scales cool your nightlife moods
All the rookies leave your badge and your gun on the desk
when you leave the room

I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half doomed and you're semi-sweet

Boycott love
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)

Detox
Just to retox
Detox
Just to retox
Detox
Just to retox
Detox
Just to retox

Detox (So boycott love)
Just to retox
Detox (Boycott love)
Just to retox
Detox (Boycott love)
Just to retox
Detox (Boycott love)
Just to retox

So boycott love (Boycott love)
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing)
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)
