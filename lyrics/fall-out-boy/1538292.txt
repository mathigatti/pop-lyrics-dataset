Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Cause we gon' fight
Yes we gon' fight
Believe we gon' fight
Fight for our right to love yeah
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no

Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody thought we'd last forever
I'm a rollin that body
Got every man in here wishin
Sippin on coke and rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun
And all the Crystal poppin in the stretch Navigator
We got food every where
As if the party was catered
I got fellas on my left
Hunnies on my right
We put the two together we be bumpin all night
And after the show it's the (after party)
And after the party it's the (hotel lobby)
And round about 4 you gotta (clear the lobby)
And take it to the room and somebody sayin

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Cause I got you babe
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Cause I got you babe
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Cause I got you babe
Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
