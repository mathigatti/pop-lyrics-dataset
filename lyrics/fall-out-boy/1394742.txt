I'm a young one
Stuck in the thoughts
Of an old one's head
When all the others were just stirring awake
I'm trying to trick myself to fall asleep again, woah


My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well

Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm gonna leave you
I'm gonna teach you
How we're all alone
How we're all alone

Guild me, build me
It's your club, so let me in (let me in)
Knowing how heartwarming
It is inside your skin

My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well

Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm gonna leave you
I'm gonna teach you
How we're all alone
How we're all alone

How we're all alone

Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm gonna leave you
I'm gonna teach you
How we're all alone
How we're all alone

Mama
If we don't take the medication
We won't sleep for days
We won't sleep for days
Mama
If we pray to the lord
Does he sing on a stage?
Does he sing on a stage?
We waste it all in the back of a long dark car
And I'm a sunshine machine
I want to get stuck
I want to get stuck
And be golden in your memory
