Call it a night when the booze hits (sorry)
That'll never happen again 'till tonight (I'm so sorry)
That'll never happen again 'till tonight (I'm so sorry)
My love isn't lost, it's all I got


Pours out of me, the shape of you (sorry)
There's a hole inside of me, the shape of you (I'm so sorry)
There's a hole inside of me, the shape of you (I'm so sorry)
My love isn't lost, it's all I got

And I feel too much
I feel too much, unless I'm riding the super fade
Riding the super fade

I should've known better
I should've known better
I should've tried to sing about anything but you
I should've tried to sing about anything but you
I should've tried to go to sleep thinking 'bout
Anything else in the world but you

Anything else in the world but you
Anything else in the world but you, but you
You know the world can get my bones
But Chicago gets my soul

Chicago gets my soul, yeah
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my, gets my, gets my soul

You know I got a hole that I try to fill (sorry)
A hole that I try to fill with trophies and lights (I'm so sorry)
A hole that I try to fill with trophies and lights (I'm so sorry)
My love isn't lost, it's all I got

I, I, I'm surfing on the dopamine high (sorry)
I'm someone you gotta institutionalize (I'm so sorry)
I'm someone you gotta institutionalize (I'm so sorry)
Oh, my love isn't lost, it's all I got

I should've known better
I should've known better
I should've tried to sing about anything
Anything else in the world but you, but you
You know the world can get my bones
But Chicago gets my soul

Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my, gets my, gets my soul

Soul, yeah
Chicago gets my soul
Soul, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Chicago gets my soul

But Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my
