Light that smoke for giving up on me
And one just cause they'll kill you sooner than my
expectations
To my favorite liar, to my favorite scar:(my favorite scar!)
I could have died with you
I hope you choke on those words that kiss that bottle, confess
(so bury me in memory)
Now ask yourself yeah out on the insides, said I loved you but I
lied


Lets play this game called when you catch fire
I wouldnt piss to put you out
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory
His smile's your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat

On the drive home
Joke about the kid you used to see
And his jealousy
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool
As when you wrap your car around the tree
Your makeup looks so great next to his teeth

Lets play this game called when you catch fire
I wouldnt piss to put you out
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory
His smile's your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat
So bury me in memory
His smile's your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat

So bury me
In memory
Around you throat
