I speak fast and I'm not gonna repeat myself
So listen carefully to every word I say:
"I'm the only one who's gonna get away with making excuses today,


You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have"
Blackmailed myself
Cause I ain't got anyone else
"This is a stick up
Give us all your.."
I've got the red carpet blues baby

"Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
But don't get the wrong idea
We're gonna shoot you
We're gonna shoot you
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet
That could change just how this goes
No
We're gonna shoot you
We're gonna shoot you"

When I said that I'd return to you I meant more like a relapse
Now again I think "His and her's" "For better or worse"
But the only ring I want buried with me are the ones around my eyes

"You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have"
I've got the red carpet blues baby

"Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
But don't get the wrong idea
We're gonna shoot you
We're gonna shoot you
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet
That could change just how this goes"
And everyone shakes to the beat with a barrel down their throat
