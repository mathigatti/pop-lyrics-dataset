Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone no doubt about it


Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up!
Am I just paranoid
I'm just stoned!

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She said it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit whining cuz it's bringing her down

Gasping to control
So I better hold on
