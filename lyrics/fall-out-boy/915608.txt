You're a canary, I'm a coalmine
Cause sorrow is just all the rage
Take one for the team
You all know what I mean


And I'm so sorry, but not really
Tell the boys where to find my body
New York eyes, Chicago thighs
Pushed up the window to kiss you off

The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you

Do you remember the way I held your hand?
Under the lamp post and ran home
This way so many times
I could close my eyes

The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you

The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth
The truth

(Now press repeat)
