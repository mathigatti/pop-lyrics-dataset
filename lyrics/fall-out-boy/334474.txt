We're pretty boys
For secret girls
Who never stood a chance in the world
I'm not ready for sincerity
I'd tell any lie to keep you listening


I gave you pretentious.
I gave you indifference, but you only wanted undressed and defenseless.
With all your cheap words about hearts and accidents

Sincerity's in
So make it sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year no one will even care.

So make it sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath

Everyone loves an underdog that's why you're all singing along.

With all your cheap words
Who are you kidding?
We're pretty boys
For secret girls
Who are you kidding?

Sincerity's in
So make it sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year no one will even care.

Sincerity's in
So make it sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year

(Hey! Everyone loves an underdog that's why you're all singing along.)
(Hey! Everyone loves an underdog that's why you're all singing along.)

When the hook sets in
And this all ends.
I'll wish it never began,
Oh I will die without all the attention.
