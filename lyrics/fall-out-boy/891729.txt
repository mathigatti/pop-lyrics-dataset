Yeah, what you critics said would never happen
We dedicate this album to anybody, people who said we couldn't make it
To the fans that held us down till anybody came around
Welcome, it's here


[Patrick Stump]
Last summer we took three across the board
But by fall we were a cover story
Now in stores
Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an accepting speech
I found the safest place to keep all of our mistakes
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update

So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

I can take your problems away
With a nod and a wave
Of my hand
'Cause that's just the kind of boy that I am
The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one in the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards

So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

Long live the car-crash hearts
(Long live the car-crash hearts)
Long live the car-crash hearts
(Long live the car-crash hearts)

Long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45
