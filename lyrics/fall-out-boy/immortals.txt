They say we are what we are
But we don’t have to be
I’m bad behaviour, but I do it in the best way
I’ll be the watcher of the eternal flame
I’ll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams


I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass
(Glass, glass)
I try to picture me without you but I can’t
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immor, immortals
Immor, immortals
Mmor, immortals
Immor, immortals

Sometimes the only pay off for having any faith
Is when it’s tested again and again everyday
I’m still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound, but they’re my sutures

I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass
(Glass, glass)
I try to picture me without you but I can’t
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immor, immortals
Immor, immortals

And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down

We could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
We could be immor, immortals
Immor, immortals
Mmor, immortals
Immor, immortals
