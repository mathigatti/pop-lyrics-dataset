Last years wishes are this years apologies
Every last time I come home
I take my last chance, to burn a bridge or two
I only keep myself this sick in the head
'Cause I know how the words get you (off)


We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof loneliness
At best, at best

Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
(If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you)
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
(If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you)

Collect the bad habits
That you couldn't bear to keep
Out of the woods, but I love
A tree I used to lay beneath
Kiss teeth stained red
From a sour bottle baby girl
With eyes the size of baby worlds

We're the new face of failure
Pretty and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof loneliness
At best, at best
Me and you (I'm like a lawyer)

Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
(If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you)
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
(If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you)
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
(If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you)
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon (honeymoon)
(If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you)

The best way to make it through
With hearts and wrists intact
Is to realize two out of three ain't bad
Ain't bad

Me and you, setting in a honeymoon

(If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you)

Me and you (honeymoon)
Setting in a honeymoon (a honeymoon)

Me and you, setting in a honeymoon (honeymoon)
(If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you)
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon (honeymoon)
(If I woke up next to you)

(Honeymoon)
