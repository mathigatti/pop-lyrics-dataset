Light that smoke for giving up on me
And one just cause they'll kill you sooner than my expectations
To my favorite liar, to my favorite scar:
"I could have died with you"
I hope you choke on those words, that kiss, that bottle- I confess
Now ash youself out on the insides, when I said I loved you but I lied


Let's play this game called "When you catch fire"
I wouldn't piss to put you out
Stop burning bridges
and drive off of them 
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory
His smile's your rope
Wrap it tight around your throat

On the drive home
Joke about hte kid you used to see
And his jealosy
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool
As when you wrap your car around a tree
Your make up looks so good next to his teeth

Let's play this game called "When you catch fire"
I wouldn't piss to put you out
Stop burning bridges
and drive off of them 
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory
His smile's your rope
Wrap it tight around your throat (2x)

So bury me in memory
around your throat
