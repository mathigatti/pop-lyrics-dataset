It's all a game of this or that, now versus then
Better off against worse for wear
And you're someone who knows someone who knows someone
I once knew, and I just want to be a part of this


The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer and we are the dream
I could write it better than you ever felt it

So hum Hallelujah just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
A remix of your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop

I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it

So hum Hallelujah just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelu
Hallelujah, hallelujah (Hum hallelujah, hum hallelujah)
Hallelujah, hallelu (Hum hallelujah, hum hallelujah)
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

So hum Hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
Vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too
