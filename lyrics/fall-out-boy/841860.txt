I am an arms dealer feeding you with
Weapons in the form of words
And (don't really care which side wins)
As long as the room keeps singing that's just the business I'm in


This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on
But I digress

I'm the leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate
Oh, so intricate
I'm the leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate
Oh, so intricate

I wrote the gospel on giving up
(You look pretty sinking)
But the real bombshells have already sunk
(Prima donnas of the gutter)
At night we're painting your trash gold
While you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars
But more like p-p-p-parties

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
Bandwagon's full
Please catch another

I'm the leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate
Oh, so intricate
I'm the leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate
Oh, so intricate

All the boys who the dancefloor didn't love
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast
Enough
Sing...until your lungs give out

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Now you)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Wear out the goove)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Sing it out loud)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Oh, oh)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

I'm the leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate
Oh, so intricate
I'm the leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate
Oh, so intricate
