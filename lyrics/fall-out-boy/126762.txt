Walking out on the show is walking out on you
And walking out on you's still the best thing that I ever did.


Last night I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night I saw my world explode

Well, I'm looking out at you obscured by the stand up arcade
And the sound of the descendents.
Your smile reminds me of switchblades and infidelity.

Walking out on the show is walking out on you
And walking out on you's still the best thing that I ever did.

Last night I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night I saw my world explode

One, two, three, four
Last night I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night I saw my world explode
