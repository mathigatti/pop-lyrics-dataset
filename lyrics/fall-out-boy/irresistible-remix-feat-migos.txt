Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight til the ending
This will not be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA


[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby

You hurt me one time then I love it
You hurt me two times then fuck it
When my pockets was low, you was ready to go
Now my pockets on swole you got relationship goals
When you laid your eyes on me, you was excited
And I was the fuel to your flame, I ignited
Then you stole my heart, that's the heart of a lion
So fuck all this shit, let's just start up a riot
This world is so cold that's why I bought a fur coat
My house is on a island, you gonna need a fucking boat
And I swim with the sharks til the other side
And I feed on the [?] outside
I came from the bottom, are you from the bottom?
If you ever had problems and you started from the bottom, holler

And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby

Hey, talk to 'em Takeoff
See I would toss her salad [?] rock and never fold
I'ma tell him, my son, everythin' glitter it ain't gold
I showed you shit that a basic bitch, she'll never know
And took you places a basic bitch, she'll never go
Now you running around showing off your camel toe
Got you singing a sad song, call you Satchmo
Then go home and tell your momma about us and we fuss
She called my phone and question me like we love her, she bugging
I think it's better that we end our days and split our ways
Know you like them red bottoms, put you right back in them Js
When we go shopping we cop it right then and never wait
When we depart, go put that merchandise on layaway
I tried to show you expensive shit and luxury living
Breaking news, break your heart when you see me on television
Takeoff

You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in, but honey I don't know what you're doing to me
Mon ch√©ri but the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war

And I still love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
