Sat outside my front window...
This story's going somewhere:
"He's well hung," and I am hanging up.
There's a song on the radio that says:
"Let's get this party started."
So let's get this party started.


What you do on your own time's just fine.
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know.
And what meant the world had folded like legs and fingers holding onto what escapes me what he has: a better kiss that never lasts.

You said, 
Between your smiles and regrets: 
"Don't say it's over."
Dead and gone.
Dead and gone.
Yeah.

The calm before the storm set it off (set it off), and the sun burnt out tonight.
A reception less than warm set it off. And the sun burnt out to--

This is me standing in the arch of the door, 
hating that look that's on your face 
that says there's another fool like me. 
There's one born every minute. 
There's one born every minute. 

What you do on your own time's just fine. 
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know.
What meant the world imploded, inflated then demoted all my oxygen to product gas and suffocated my last chance.

You said, 
Between your smiles and regrets: 
"Don't say it's over."
Dead and gone.
Dead and gone.
Yeah.
Woah. 

The calm before the storm set it off (set it off), and the sun burnt out tonight.
A reception less than warm set it off. And the sun burnt out to--


(Calm before the storm set it off, set it off woah)

The calm before the storm set it off, and the sun burnt out tonight.
A reception less than warm set it off. And the sun burnt out tonight 
woah yeah the sun burnt out tonight 
the sun burnt out tonight
