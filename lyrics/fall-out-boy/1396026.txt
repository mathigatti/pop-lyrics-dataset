I'm not a crybaby
I'm the crybaby
A caterpillar that got stuck
Mr. Moth come quick with any luck
A long walk to a dark ha-ha-house
A roman candle heart keep us far apart
I'm cocktail party doing all right
Hate me baby, maybe I'm a piece of art


Oh my friends all lie and say
They only want the best wishes for me
Oh 3-2-1, we go live

Oh baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
And oh baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)

I can make your heart slow
I can feel the weather in my bones
Wish hard enough I could turn it to what I like
Your pupils big rolling like dice

They say
They only want the best wishes for me (They only want the best for me)
Oh 3-2-1, we go live

Oh baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
And oh baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)

Not the boy I was the boy I am is just venting venting
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city
Not the boy I was the boy I am is just venting venting
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city

They say
They only want the best wishes for me (They only want the best for me)
Oh 3-2-1, we go live

Oh baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
And oh baby you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
