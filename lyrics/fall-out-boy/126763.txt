Walking off that stage tonight
I know what you're thinking
And he stands alone, because he's high on himself
But if you only knew


I was terrified and would you mind if I sat next to you
And watched you smile
So many kids but I only see you
And I dont think you notice me
Well I've seen your boyfriend and I dont think he treats you right
But thats none of my business is it?

I'm not the way you think I am
No
I'm not the way you think I am
No

The only girl who ever gave me the time
Was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine
Knocking boots in the back, how degrading is that?
I decline

I was terrified and would you mind if I sat next to you
And watched you smile
So many kids but I only see you
And I dont think you notice me
Well I've seen your boyfriend and I dont think he treats you right
But thats none of my business is it?

I'm not the way you think I am
No
I'm not the way you think I am
No

I'm not the way you think I am
No
I'm not the way you think I am
No
I'm not the way you think I am
No
I'm not the way you think I am
No
I'm not the way you think I am
No
I'm not the way you think I am
No, no
