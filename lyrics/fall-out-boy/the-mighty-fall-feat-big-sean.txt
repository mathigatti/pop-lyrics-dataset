Oh god!
Sean Don
Fall Out Boy!


Did you trip down 12 steps into Malibu (Malibu)
So why the hell is there a light that's keeping us forever
Bel Air baby did you get dressed up?
Pretty pout pout
(While you bottomed out out)
I can't stop it
When there's chemicals keeping us together
I'm singing whoa

How the mighty fall (hey)
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in love

Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme
And I'm dizzy on dreams
(Yeah you're dizzy on dreams)
But if you ask me
Two's a whole lot lonelier than one
B-baby we should've left our love
In the gutter where we found it
(Gutter where we found it)
Cause you think your only crime is
That you got caught
I'm singing

Whoa
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in love

It's getting clear
You're never coming clean
So I'll lock you up inside
And swallow
Swallow the key

Hello?
Yeah I know you said not to call
Unless I'm dying
But I'm driving
And I can't stop staring at my eyelids
But even though my eyes closed, I still see you
I just hope when you see me
I'm not see-through
You know how we do

Some times I swear, I need a day just for me to lay
With some T and A, but the way we
They way we is do deeper
Baby straight up chemistry DNA
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A
Like, I let her climb on top
I'm either fuckin or workin'
So the grind don't stop
They say I got screws missing, well hell
Only when I'm missing you
And hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, addicted to you

Whoa
How the mighty fall (hey)
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in love
