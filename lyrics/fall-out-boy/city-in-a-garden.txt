Take me home
Take me home
And the street lights light up to take me home
I love you Chicago
You make feel some summer fling
You know that I know
That I owe you everything
I love you Chicago


Feel the sorrow, hit the bottle
Feel the rush, I’m having no tomorrow
She said you gotta find yourself
Something worth holding onto

You charged me up
Charged, charged me up
I was something they forgot
To label fragile now I’m stuck
And you know too much
Know, know too much
You’re the one true thing
You’re the one

Take me home
Take me home
And the street lights light up to take me home
I love you Chicago
You make feel some summer fling
You know that I know
That I owe you everything
I love you Chicago

And I’m just living out of a suitcase
Watch me now
Watch me as I drive away
I’m supposed to leave you at the end of the season
But I’ll stay

You charged me up
Charged, charged me up
I was something they forgot
To label fragile now I’m stuck
And you know too much
Know, know too much
You’re the one true thing
You’re the one

Take me home
Take me home
And the street lights light up to take me home
I love you Chicago
You make feel some summer fling
You know that I know
That I owe you everything

Take me home
Take me home
And the street lights light up to take me home
I love you Chicago
You make feel some summer fling
And you know that I know
That I owe you everything
I love you Chicago
