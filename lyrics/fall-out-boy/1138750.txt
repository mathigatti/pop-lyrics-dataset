If I had one last moment,
Until my head is empty
My hands would be at your throat,
or maybe on your hips.
Before you say goodbye tonight,
Baby, just tell me this
"You'll always be my only love, always and forever hun."


Tonight is the night when I surrender
Myself to you. I give up, this is over.
Now and forever more, baby walk out that door.

Kiss me one last time again, before
I go and change my mind, tell me what a dick I am.
Oh God, You're just too beautiful when you beg.

Tonight is the night when I surrender
Myself to you. I give up, this is over.
Now and forever more, baby walk out that door.

Baby, walk out that door.
Baby, walk out that door.
Baby, walk out that door.
Baby, walk out that door.
