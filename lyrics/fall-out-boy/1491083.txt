Landing on a runway in Chicago
And I'm grounding all my dreams of ever really seeing
California,
Because I know what's in between is something sensual
In such non-conventional ways


Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that
I can't say
Tonight I'm writing you a million miles away
Tonight is all about "We miss you."

And I can't forget your style or your cynicism,
Somehow it was like you were the first to listen to
Everything we said
My smile's an open wound without you and my hands
Are tied to pages inked to
Bring you back

Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that
I can't say
Tonight I'm writing you a million miles away
Tonight is all about "We miss you."

These friends are, new friends are golden
These friends are, new friends are golden
These friends are, new friends are golden
These friends are, new friends are golden

Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that
I can't say
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that
I can't say
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that
I can't say

These friends are, new friends are golden
