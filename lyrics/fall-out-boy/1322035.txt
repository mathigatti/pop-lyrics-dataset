A beautiful girl can make you dizzy, 
Like you've been drinking jack and coke all morning. 
She can make you feel high, 
Full of the single greatest commodity known to man: 
Promise. promise of a better day, 
promise of a greater hope, 
promise of a new tomorrow. 
This particular aura, 
can be found in the gait of a beautiful girl. 
In her smile, and in her soul. 
In the way she makes every rotten little thing about life 
seem like it's gonna be ok.

September never stays this cold, 
Where I come from and you know, 
I'm not one, for complaining. 
But I love the way you roll 
Excuses off the tip of your tongue, 
As I (slowly) slowly, quietly, slowly, fall apart. 

This won't mean a thing come tomorrow, 
And that's exactly how I'll make it seem. 
'Cause I'm still not sleeping, 
Thinking I've crawled home from worse than this. 
So please, please, (please) 
I'm running out of sympathy,(I'm running out of sympathy) 
I never said I'd take this, 
I never said I'd take this lying down. 

She says, "C'mon c'mon, 
Lets just get this over with."(3x) 

I never said I'd take this lying down. 
Well I've crawled home from worse than this, 
From worse than this! 

You always come close 
But this never comes easy. 
I still know everything.(3x) 

You always come close 
But this never comes easy.(2x) 

I never said I'd take this lying down.(2x) 

You always come! 
You're coming close. 

I never said I'd take this lying down. 
But I've crawled home from worse than this. 
If it's not keeping you up at night, 
Then what's the point?(4x) 

I'm in your room, 
Well is this turning you on? 
Am I turning you on? 

I'm in your room, 
Are you turned on? 
I'm on the corner of your bed 
Are you turned on?(2x)
