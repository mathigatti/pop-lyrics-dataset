My heart ticks in beat with these kids that I grew up with
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play like a big shot talent
But at the end of the day you know where we come from
And where we call home


Hey Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back

They'll say it's not worth it
So we'll leave this town in ruins
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play like a big shot talent
But at the end of the day you know those busted lips
We take back home

Hey Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back

I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade
So I'll tell everyone how much this means to me
