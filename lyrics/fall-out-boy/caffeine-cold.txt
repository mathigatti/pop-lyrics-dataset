I just want to feel you up with such dread
Let you suck it out, let you suck it out
Till I'm dry and dead
Now I've got love flowin in my nightmare girls
Caffeine cold caffeine cold and I can't see shit


Don't breathe life in to the monster then
Complain when he destroys it all again
Don't breathe life into the monster then
Complain when he destroys it all again

Now I smell like cigarettes
Cause I love to breathe your smoke
I smell like alcohol
Cause I drink to believe in more

I have 3 drinks
Before I even start to count
I think I'm gonna move
Way down south

Don't breathe life into the monster then
Complain when he destroys it all again
Don't breathe life into the monster then
Complain when he destroys it all again

I'm not a monster
Just really fucked up
I'm tired
I'll see you in hell
Are you judging me?
Don't laugh at me
Don't laugh at me
No, seriously, don't laugh at me
It's not funny
I'm not joking
It's not funny
I'm not laughing
