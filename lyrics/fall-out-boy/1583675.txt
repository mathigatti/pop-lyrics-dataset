'I just want to be better than your, your head's only medicine'
'I just want to be better than your, your head's only medicine'


A downward spiral just a pirouette
Getting worse til there's n-n-nothing left
What good comes of something when I'm just the ghost of nothing's nothing?
'I'm just the man on the balcony singing':
"Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
(for a)

Lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing til
Til they can't stand it
A composer but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer but never composed
'Singing':
"I only want what I can't have"

'Heralded as a king before I had a birthday
With double digits
Fit the crown to my head but I was only a kid'
Hey!
'I'm just the man on the balcony singing':
"Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
(whoa)

Lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing til
Til they can't stand it
A composer but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer but never composed
'Singing':
"I only want what I can't have"

'To be better than your, your head's only medicine'

'I'm just the man on the balcony singing':
"Nobody will ever remember me,"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
(for a)

Lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing til
Til they can't stand it
A composer but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer but never composed

"I only want what I can't have"
