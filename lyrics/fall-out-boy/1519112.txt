Well hello is this thing on? 
Is anybody listening? 
A brand new day has begun 


The first thing that I want do 
Make sure that you feel it too 
So I´m not the only one 

C´mon and lift me up it´s a brand new day 
Open up a little happiness today 
So I can be someone new (so I can be someone new) 
C´mon and lift me up to a better way 
Open up a smile on another face 
So I can feel something new 

Open up open up some happiness 
Open up open up some happiness 
Open up open up some happiness 
Open up open up some happiness 

Ahem ahem 
Let me clear my throat 
So you can hear clearly every word spoke 
Today I woke feeling lovely 
Happiness overflowin´ knowin´ somebody loves me 
Just think yesterday I was down and out 
Now there´s not a single thing for me to frown about 
And the same thing can happen to you 
Smiling so hard my mouth look like a capital U 

I want the sun to shine 
All the time 
Is that too much to ask 
Oh I want to have some fun 
I want all my friends to come 
´Cause it´s now or never 
Learn the words and sing together 

C´mon and lift me up it´s a brand new day 
Open up a little happiness today 
So I can be someone new (so I can be someone new) 
C´mon and lift me up to a better way 
Open up a smile on another face 
So I can feel something new 

Your heart deserves your trust 
A choice made by all of us 
The sun will come back tomorrow 
There´s a message in the bottle 
So come on I´ll meet you there 
There´s enough sunshine to share 
As long as you know 
The bridge between us is a rainbow 

C´mon and lift me up it´s a brand new day 
Open up a little happiness today 
So I can be someone new (so I can feel something new) 
C´mon and lift me up to a better way 
Open up a smile on another face 
So I can feel something new 

Open up open up open happiness 
Open up open up some happiness 
Open up open up open happiness 
Open up open up some happiness 
Open up open up open happiness 
Open up open up some happiness 
Open up open up open happiness 
Open up open up open happiness 
Open up open up open happiness 
Open up open up open happiness 
Open up open up open happiness 
Open up open up open happiness 
Yeah
