You are a getaway car - a rush of blood to the head
But me, I'm just the covers on top of your bed
You steer in a rear view mirror - make my head swim
I keep you warm and won't ask you where you've been


With your backless black dress soaked to the skin
When it's said and down they're all scrambling
And we're friends, we're friends
Just because we move units

Strike us like matches, cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame
Such a shame

The sounds of this small town make my ears hurt
Oh yeah, you caught me. But I caught you on worse
They say, "You want a war? You've got a war."
But who are you fighting for?
The tide's out, the ship's run aground
We drown traitors in shallow water

With your backless black dress soaked to the skin
When it's said and down they're all scrambling
And we're friends, we're friends
Just because we move units

Strike us like matches, cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame
Such a shame

At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame
Such a shame

Strike us like matches, cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a mnr
