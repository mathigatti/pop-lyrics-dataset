She's shallow like the shoreline durning low tide 
but my hopes are not quite as high 
cant spot her faults but she spotted mine 
she left me for herself 
considering i would too 
go figure, i'm bigger than that 
the battles only halfway done 
i might look young 
but i'm no less defeated 
how's the weather up there? 
good God i wish i was tall
