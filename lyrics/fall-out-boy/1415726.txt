I am an arms dealer
Fitting you with weapons in the form of words
And don't really care, which side wins
Long as the room keeps singing
That's just the business I'm in


This ain't a scene; it's a God damn arms race
This ain't a scene; it's a God damn arms race
This ain't a scene; it's a God damn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate

[Kanye West]
Now, I don't know what the hell this song is talking 'bout
Do you?
She said yeah, I've been spending all day trying to figure that out
You too?
The arms race made them raise they arms
And race straight to the top, who knew?
Right now, they got the number one spot
Do you want that (want that) me too
One thing I gotta call out boy
Take a look at Fall Out Boy
Since they ain't black
When they get money they don't ball out boy
They just buy tight jeans till they nuts hang all out boy
They figure they dress tight
So we gon dress tighter
He dress white, so we gon dress whiter
So in spite of anything you might of
Seen or heard, this scene occurred
Word

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate

Yeah
Whoa

[Patrick Stump]
All the boys who the dance floor didn't love
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough
Sing until your lungs give out

This ain't a scene; it's a God damn arms race
This ain't a scene; it's a God damn arms race
This ain't a scene; it's a God damn arms race
This ain't a scene; it's a God damn arms race
This ain't a scene; it's a God damn arms race
This ain't a scene; it's a God damn arms race

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
