Hands up ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talking ‘bout a tune
You can hear us coming with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom we are breaking through


We prepared for the turbulence
But there’s no preparing for this
Got paid on Tuesday
But I’m still broke when the weekend ends
Another trip around the Sun
It was a good run
Just mixing all of my prescriptions with my problems

Streets are full of seasons
Saw what they did to Jesus
Dude’ll kill you for no reason and charge you for treason
I know this one for a fact
My phone they got it on tap
Cause every time I’m talking I can hear them in the back

Hands up ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talking ‘bout a tune
You can hear us coming with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom we are breaking through

She winding like she losing her mind

Knock knock knock knock
Who is it?
She said this is a surprise visit
It’s my fantasy I’m gonna love it
Hands up and don’t you refuse it

I wanna tattoo you on me
Just look what you created
Dear future self
I hope it’s going well
I’m drunk on cheap whiskey in an airport hotel

Hands up ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talking ‘bout a tune
You can hear us coming with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom we are breaking through

She winding like she losing her mind

Knock knock knock knock
Who is it?

Hands up ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talking ‘bout a tune
You can hear us coming with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom we are breaking through
