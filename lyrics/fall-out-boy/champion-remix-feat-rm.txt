Yo, should I be a star, baby I think I already are
Not a saint, not that great, feel like I was born a car
In 94, the world started me and I've been driving
Sometimes a man just can't open his car, and
Ain't gotta be somebody, be anybody
Rather be anybody than live in a dead body
If you can't see me then find a helicopter
In the night sky, shine like a star


And I'm back with a madness
I'm a champion of the people who don't believe in champions
I got nothing but dreams inside
I got nothing but dreams

I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe in, yeah

If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything

Champion, champion
Champion, champion

I got rage every day, on the inside
The only thing I do is sit around and kill time
I'm trying to blow out the pilot light, I'm trying to blow out the light

I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe

If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything

Have you ever felt how hard it is to be an anybody
To be living, to be breathing, not choosing a dead body
Remember, the man told me that this life is a party
Yeah, all the glory's so short you should put away the garbages
Normal ain't normal, ordinary is a luxury
People say: Woo, pessimism â€” why do you all on me?
If you wanna understand, you stand under
This shit is vital, respect to the mothers and fathers

What's wrong with the life of a passenger
If somebody gotta be then I'mma be the messenger
I'm just too young don't know what to believe in
But too young, you know, not to believe in
I will stay, I will wait and I'll fall like a king
Even though I can forever ever be a king
I will marry this goddamn world by my own
And put myself I get a damn ring

If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything
(I can do anything I can)
Do anything, anything, yeah
If I can live through this
If I can live through, live through this

If I can live through this (if I can live through this)
If I can live through this (if I can live through)
If I can live through this (if I can live through this)
I can do anything
(I can do anything)
If I can live through this
(I can do anything)
If I can live through this
(I can do anything)
If I can live through this
I can do anything

Champion, champion
