Brothers and sisters put this record down
Take my advice ('cause we are bad news)
We will leave you high and dry
It's not worth the hearing you'll lose


It's just past 8:00 and I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says
"Do not open before Christmas"

We're only liars, but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trend
We're only good cus you can have almost famous friends
Besides we've got such good fashion sense

Brothers and sisters-put these words down
Into your notebook, spit lines like these:
"We're friends when you're on your knees"
Make them dance like we were shooting their feet

It's just past 8:00 and I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says
"Do not open before Christmas"

We're only liars, but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trend
We're only good cus you can have almost famous friends
Besides we've got such good fashion sense

We're only liars, but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trend

We're only liars, but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trend
We're only good cus you can have almost famous friends
Besides we've got such good fashion sense
