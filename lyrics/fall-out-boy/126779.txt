Bury me standing under your window with the cinder block in hand
Yeah cause no one will ever feel like this again
And if I could move I'm sure it would only be to crawl back to
You
I must have dragged my guts a block, they were gone by the
Time we


I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But you know that I could crush you with my voice
I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But you know that I could crush you with my voice

Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details I don't want to know a thing

I hate the way you say my name like it's something secret
My pen is the barrel of the gun. Remind me which side you
Should be on

I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But you know that I could crush you with my voice
I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But you know that I could crush you with my voice

Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details I don't want to know a thing

I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel

I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But you know that I could crush you with my voice
I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But you know that I could crush you with my voice
I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But you know that I could crush you with my voice
(Want, want, want)
I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But you know that I could crush you with my voice
(Want, want, want)
I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But you know that I could crush you with my voice
