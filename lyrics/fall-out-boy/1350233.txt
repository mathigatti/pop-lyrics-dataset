Mr. Sandman showing his beam
When he walks into the room the walls lean in to listen
Surfed out brain waves flick back and forth
Like old headlights sniffing model glue again
Head like a steel trap
Wish I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't
I don't just want to be a footnote in someone else's happiness


Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way
Does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?

But I will never end up like him
Behind my back I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know

The last time you came through
Oh darling I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling
Oh darling
Oh darling

Aw, tempest in a teacup
Get unique
Peroxide princes shine like shark teeth
It's a sign (it's a sign)
It's a sign (it's a sign)
It's a sign-
What if you peaked early?

Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way
Does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?

Does he
Does he know the way I worship our love?
Does your husband know the way that
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band?

But I will never end up like him
Behind my back I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know

The last time you came through
Oh darling I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling
Oh darling
Oh darling

Does your husband know?
Does your husband know?
Does your husband know?
Does he know?
Does he know?
Does he know? Oh, oh

But I will never end up like him
Behind my back I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know

The last time you came through
Oh darling I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling I know what you're going through
