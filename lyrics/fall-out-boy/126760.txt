I served out my detention
And in the end I got an honorable mention


In the movie of my life
Starring you
Instead of me

When the moonlight
Hits your bright eyes I go blind
And maybe next time
I'll remember not to tell you something stupid like I'll never leave your side

Like the oldest movie I ever saw was the one we wrote together
I said I hate you but I'd never change a thing
I can be your John Cusack

I burnt out
My defensive
Now everything I say is taken as offensive

In the movie of my life
Starring you
Instead of me

When the moonlight
Hits your bright eyes I go blind
And maybe next time
I'll remember not to tell you something stupid like I'll never leave your side

Like the oldest movie I ever saw was the one we wrote together
I said I hate you but I'd never change a thing
I can be your John Cusack

Oldest movie I ever saw was the one we wrote together
I said I hate you but I'd never change a thing
I can be your John Cusack
Be your John Cusack
I can be your John Cusack
