Wishes bonce me weightless
The infrared scope on pointlessness
The bulls are sedated and this fight's fixed
Don't feel bad for the suicidal cats
Gotta kill themselves 9 times before they get it right
The PA system keeps my heart, heart beating tonight


Oh hell yes, I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yed, the drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father, twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost

Come on in the water's warm
Come on like a sugar cube but with a kick in the head
like putting wings on lead
Your eyes are blocking my starlight
I'm the last of my kind
And that's all that sound matter to you

Follow the desorganized religion of my head
And we'll never get through customs
Let's just take of again instead
Got mu degree in the gutter
My heart broken in dorms of the Ivy League

Oh hell yes, I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yed, the drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father, twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost

Knock once for the father, twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost

I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck, huh, I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck, the drugs just make me reset

Knock once for the father, twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
Three times for the holy ghost
Three times for the holy ghost
