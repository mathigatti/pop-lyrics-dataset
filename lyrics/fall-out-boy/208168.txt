I'm sleeping my way out of this one
With anyone who will lie down
I'll be stuck fixated on one star
When the world is crashing down


I keep telling myself
I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking through blinds

I keep telling myself
I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type

I'm sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well
sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well on my own

The only thing worse than not knowing
Is you thinking that I don't know
I'm having another episode
I just need a stronger dose

I keep telling myself
I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking through blinds

I keep telling myself
I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type

I'm sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well
sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well on my own

I keep telling myself
I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking through blinds

I keep telling myself
I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type

I'm sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well on my own
