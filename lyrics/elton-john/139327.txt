I wake up and I look at the clock
In the middle of the night my heart stops
When I see you in the moonlight
I know why I'm in love


Peace will come I promise you
I wish you success in all you do
And when I think about the rest
I know why I'm in love

It's hard to find the kind of thing
You've searched for all your life
Someone bright and crazy
With a little soul inside
And looking at you fast asleep
I thank the stars above

And what more can I say
I've said it all in different ways
The bottom line, the simple facts are true
I know why I'm in love with you
I only hope you know I love you too

I kiss you and I melt inside
What you mean to me I can't describe
And if seeing is believing
You'd know why I'm in love
