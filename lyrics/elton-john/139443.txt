The mother of invention made it good for me
Tighter in the rear
Longer in the seam
Kicked out yards of leather
Wrapped around her waist
Trimmed it to perfection
And left a little space


Yeah they got competition now
All across the world
But there ain't been no looking back
Since god invented girls

Now I know what brian wilson meant
Every time I step outside
I see what heaven sent
There may be seven wonders
Created for this world
But one is all we need
Since god invented girls

Higher on the heel, paler than pure cream
Leaner on the sidewalk
Cutting through the steam
After claws and feathers
He took skin and bone
Shaped it like an hourglass
And made the angels moan

Oh, here's a little heat boys
To straighten out them curls
Now there ain't been no angels round
Since god invented girls
