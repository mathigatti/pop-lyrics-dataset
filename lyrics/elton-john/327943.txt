There's nowhere in the world that I would rather be
Than with you my love
And there's nothing in the world that I would rather see
Than your smile my love


For united we stand
Divided we fall
And if our backs should ever be against the wall
We'll be together, together, you and I

And if the world around you falls apart my love
Then I'll still be here
And if the going gets too hard along the way
Just you call, I'll hear

For united we stand
Divided we fall
And if our backs should ever be against the wall
We'll be together, together, you and I
