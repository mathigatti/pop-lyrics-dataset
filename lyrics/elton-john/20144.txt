When I think of those East End lights
Muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downsairs
Prima Donna lord you really should have been there
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer
And I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there rolling
Round the basement floor


And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Alter-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away bye bye

I never realized the passing hours
Of evening showers
A slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four-o-clock in the morning
Damn it!
Listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music is still alive

And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Alter-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye, bye

And I would have walked head on
Into the deep end of the river
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
They're coming in the morning
With a truck to take me home

Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength
And run the field you play alone

And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Alter-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away bye bye

Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
