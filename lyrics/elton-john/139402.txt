Saw a Cadillac for the first time yesterday
I'd always seen horses, buggies, bales of hay
`Cause progress here don't move with modern times
There's nothing to steal
So there's not a great deal of crime


It sure is hell living in a one horse town
There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
Nothing much doing of an afternoon
Unless you're sitting in a rocking chair just picking a tune

And they ain't too well acquainted with the stars and stripes
But if you want to hear Susanna then they'll pick all night
They'll pick all night

`Cause it's no dice living in a one horse town
Laid back, as my old coon hound
And I just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
There's nothing to steal `cause there's simply nothing much around

Sure is hell living in this one horse town
There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
And I just can't wait to grow out of this one horse town
There's nothing to steal `cause there's nothing much around
