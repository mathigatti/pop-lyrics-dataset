Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon


Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
The sweet afternoons
Still capture me

Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all
And watched it slip away
Where are we now?
Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me

Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again someday soon

I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us

Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
The sweet afternoons
Still capture me

Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again someday soon

Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us

I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us
I still believe
I still put faith in us
