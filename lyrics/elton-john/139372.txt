Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

See the little baby
Wrapped in a manger
On Christmas Morning


Amen, Amen, Amen

See him in the Temple
Talking with the Elders
Tomorrows Wisdom

Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

Down at the Jordan
And John was baptising
And Savin' all sinners

Amen, Amen, Amen

See 'em at the Seaside
Talking with the fisherman
And makin' disciples

Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

Sing it through the mountains

Amen chorus

Down at the Jordon
John was baptising
Savin, savin, all sinners

Amen? chorus
