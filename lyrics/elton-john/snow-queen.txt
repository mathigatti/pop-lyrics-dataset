You remind me so much
Of her when you're walking
Where everything's perfect
And nobody's talking


You're a cushion uncrumpled
You're a bed that's unruffled
If I was bone china,
Bone china around

And I believe that the snow queen
Lives somewhere in the hills
She's got the world on a string
Like white wine when it's chilled

Arms are spread like icicles
Upon a frosted cake
The snow queen reigns in a warmer land
Behind the cold black gates

Your talons are tested
They're polished and they're shaved
Your talents are wasted
On men of no taste

But how about proving
That passion means more than
A wardrobe of gowns, TV ratings,
A fragile waist, and a name
