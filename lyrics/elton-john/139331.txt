In the nicotine glare of a cold naked light
I drag my body from the covers and down forty flights
I run out the front door into the center of the street
I scream out your name as the steam just swells around my feet


I hear you after midnight from the inner city
As every Cinderella turns to drop dead pretty
We were built out of the darkness into this West Side Story
We came together in the shadows but the moon just steals our glory

Well, this is my battleground baby
This is my plaything
The only thing I've ever known
Outside of a wedding ring

And I swear I heard the night talking
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
And all we ever do is listen to the night talking

On the burden of insanity we can't find the cause
On a flatbed truck, well, the home girl she paints her claws
There's a coward who gets his courage undercover of the dark
And it's a strange breed of devil freeze at night to go walking in the park
