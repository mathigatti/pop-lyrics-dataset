She's a real ball-buster, don't trust her
She's in a most peculiar phase
You can rear end her oh it'll send her
She wants you, she'll have you her own way


Don't untie her, don't defy her
`Cause she'll bring you down to your knees
You can beat her but don't mistreat her
Oh don't believe that woman please

Don't trust that woman
Don't trust that woman boys
`Cause she'll burn you
Turn you into little toys
Don't trust that woman
Don't trust that woman boys
`Cause she'll hurt you
And turn you into little toys
Don't trust that woman boys

She's a man-eater, oh don't you cheat her
She'll cut you just to watch you bleed
A woman half crazy, oh then again lazy
With an appetite to feed

She's a liar oh you can't buy her
`Cause she'll bring you down to your knees
Don't untie her, don't defy her
Oh don't believe that woman please

Mean sister, tongue-twister
She takes it easy but she makes it hard
Soul sister, two-fister
She takes it easy but she makes it hard
