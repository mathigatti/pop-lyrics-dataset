Well he looks through the wreckage
But he can't find a photo of you
Then he ties me in knots
With riddles he chooses to use


And he says how come you two
Are the only ones here who survived
Oh I thought it was me
Who was destined to be
The lord of the flies

And who rules when fools leave, I do
Says the lord of the flies
Leave me your world, give me your earth
Swallow your foolish pride
And don't think I'm wrong, it's here I belong
It's mine, I'm the lord of the flies
Lord of the flies
Lord of the flies

Then take all the money you want
It's the last thing we used for fuel
Here in the late great capital
We burned a bonfire for you

He knows we burned the harvest
And saw through his disguise
He's no phantom at all
He's the only thing left
The lord of the flies
