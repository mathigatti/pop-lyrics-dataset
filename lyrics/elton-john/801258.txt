He was a light star
Tripping on a high wire
Bulldog stubborn, born uneven
A classless creature, a man for all seasons
But don't bet them
They can't take him
To the very bottom
Because they made him and they'll waste him
And I don't believe that I want to watch them


`Cause the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then, now he's an idol here
But his face has changed, he's not the same no more
And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before

He was tight-assed
Walking on broken glass
Highly prized in the wallet size
The number one crush in a schoolgirl's eyes
But don't pretend that it won't end
In the depth of your despair
You went from lame suits right down to tennis shoes
To peanuts from the lion's share
