Time goes by, it seems so long
But it was only days ago when things were going wrong
What happened to the love, to the love we knew
The days we shared were so short and so few


And baby I miss you
Baby I miss you
Remember when it didn't rain
Will I ever see the sun again
And baby I miss you
Baby I miss you
And I only wish that I could share your love again

I thought about leaving for some new place
Somewhere where I, I don't have to see your face
'Cause seeing your face only brings me out in tears
Thinking of the love I've wasted all through the years
