Night life, hot spot light
I've gotta make them dance tonight
Night life, hot spot light
I really want to shine tonight
Night life, hot spot light
I gotta steal a heart tonight
Night life, hot spot light
I'll show them how to dance tonight


I know that the competition's heavy
I know that these guys are cool
But I'll show this kid is more than ready
I sure got something to prove

Right now I'm just another guy
I don't mean nothing to them
but when they see me dance
When they see me dance

Right now the music's moving higher
I feel them stepping up the beat
These shoes will set the floor on fire
Everybody on your feet

You thought that you'd seen the best
Well I can tell you, forget the rest
When you see me dance
When you see me dance
