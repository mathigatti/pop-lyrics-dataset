Crime in the streets
I read about it everyday in the papers
Justice needs and justice wants
But just in times, yes, too late here
Feels like I wasn't born there
I feel just like a boogie pilgrim
Boogie pilgrim
Hustled to get it
To get it together
Down on the jive talk
Down on the weather
Boogie pilgrim
Brother, I never felt better
No, I never felt better


Low life's complete
When you've lived that way out on the sidewalk
(Walking on the sidewalk everyday)
I got the speed if you got the need
But the need in me needs nothing
(But you know that I need nothing)
But I know that you all want something
Just like boogie pilgrim
