Born to lose
I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose
And now I'm losing you


Born to lose
Oh it seems so hard to bear
When I wake and find that you're not there
Ooh you've grown tired and now you say we're through
I'm born to lose
And now I'm losing you

Born to lose
I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose
And now I'm losing you
Born to lose
And now Elton I'm losing you
