When stars are born, are they cast out
To wander cold and lonely lost in space?
A loveless point of light that can't return
Forever fixed within one place


When love is lost and dreams are cast
Like bruised and battered pieces left to die
When hands that reach out are betrayed
How can my tortured soul survive?

There's only one thing left
And that's the one thing that you needed most of all
For the freedom that you gained
Is the loss that led me aimless to the shore

And I'm borne high on these waves
Swept by the wind and alone
Oh, sail me away, carry me back to my home
I'm tired, I've been torn
A cruel, wretched storm churns like a gale in my bones
Oh sail me away, carry me back to my home

These scars run deep
The future holds a hunger for your innocence
That passed away
Your callous shadows mock
And make it clear some things
Were not enough to make you stay

The moment time stands still
Is the moment that the writing's on the wall
The words are clear as ringing bells
That pride was present right before the fall

And I'm borne high on these waves
Swept by the wind and alone
Oh, sail me away, carry me back to my home
I'm tired, I've been torn
A cruel, wretched storm churns like a gale in my bones
Oh sail me away, carry me back to my home
