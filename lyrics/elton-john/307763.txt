Me and you we're not that pretty
Me and you could use a lift
I'm out here on the corner crying
I got ribbons but I got no gift


Me and you we're all we've got
Me and you could be our curse
We've got bleeding hearts and flowers
You got strings but you got no purse

We're just freaks in love
Saints above
Shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union
Of fools and freaks alike 

And fearless are the idiots
Among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love

There's a wonder in this weakness
It's so beautiful sometimes
Across the universe we're lightning
In the race we're a step behind

Me and you we're not for everyone
Me and you we're damaged goods
We're antique and unacceptable
And just misunderstood

We're just freaks in love 
Saints above
Shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union
Of fools and freaks alike 

And fearless are the idiots
Among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love

We're just freaks in love 
Saints above
Shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union
Of fools and freaks alike

And fearless are the idiots
Among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love

We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love
