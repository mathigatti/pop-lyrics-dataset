Where it's at
Dada dum-da dadada dum-da
Where it's at


He's a man who knows most everything
Of anything at all
Tells a story of psychology
And his story never falls
He's a man who wears a portobello yellow bill-bob hat
He's a man who knows exactly where it's at

He's a man who draws illusions
And he carves them on a tree
Including all the love he found
He gives to you and me
And I don't even know his name
But I surely promise that
He's a man who knows exactly where it's at

Roaming around from place to place
He takes in all that he sees
He notices the good things that please him
He watches all the bad things that grieve him
But he loves everybody and he knows just where it's at

He was born of Gypsy parenthood
And he's always lived the land
And if people who would talk to him
Just cannot understand
But no matter what they say of him
They'll always tell you that
He's a man who knows exactly where it's at
