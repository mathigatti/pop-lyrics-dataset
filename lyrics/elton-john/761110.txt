The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down 
I'm more paranoid with every little sound 
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around 
And a siren wailing on the other side of town


Oh the TVs on and the colors really hurt my head 
If I could think straight I'd wish I was dead 
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed 
Instead I'm hanging over Hell suspended by a single thread 

chorus:
And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around 
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line 
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine 
And a little weed just to level me sometime 
I put the clock in the drawer 'cause I've cancelled out the time

[repeat chorus]

So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall 
When you're high as this you think you know it all 
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall 

[repeat chorus]

And still that saying gets inside my mind 
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down
