On a hill long ago on a cold winter's night 
In a land far away three kings saw a light 
From heaven it shone like God's, God's own crown 
And it guided three kings into Bethlehem town 


Oh they came bearing gifts and so said each one 
Let's call this day Christmas from this moment on 
We'll be calling it Christmas in honor of him 
The child in the manger our savior and king 

chorus: 
We've been calling it Christmas, keeping the faith 
Knowing the reason we're saving the season 
We've been calling it Christmas down through the years 
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here 

Oh a simple belief was the start of it all 
A small child asleep on a bed made of straw 
At the back of an inn where shephers and kings 
First felt the joy this moment would bring 

[repeat chorus]
