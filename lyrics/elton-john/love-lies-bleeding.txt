The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house
Was born to grow and die


Oh it doesn't seem a year ago
To this very day
You said I'm sorry honey
If I don't change the pace
I can't face another day


And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands


I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through


You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow
