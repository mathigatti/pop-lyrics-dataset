Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
Staring at the same four walls
Waiting for the working day to end
Then I get home so wasted, worn out
I curse at you and tell you
How I've done the work of ten to fifteen men
How I've struggled for my money
Sweated blood to get us by, yeah
Well I'm tired of it honey
Think I'm gonna have to leave here for a while


All you hear are hard luck stories
And the ways I look at life
And the way I think the world treats me
And the way that I treat my wife

I never seem to look at you
And see that somewhere underneath
A pair of tired eyes are crying out
Well you know I work hard all day long
Let me kiss you once with meaning
Just to kill this nagging doubt
Well you don't deny I do you proud
And you expect me to be tired
You say there's no future in our lives
While I persist I'm putting out the fire

All you hear are hard luck stories
Just a few well chosen words
'Cause you're still the woman of a working man
You've got the heart of a working girl
