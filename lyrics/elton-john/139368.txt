You can take her
Make her change her name
You and your old money
Dance around the flame
But you can never, never love her like me


You can charm her
Calm her when she's wild
Show a little comfort
Play with her inner child
But you can never, never love her like me

So I just close my eyes and steal her away when you sleep
Sneak her in my dreams every single day of the week
You may have her in real world but if you could only see
How we rock this room in the twilight zone
And you can never, never love her like me

You can warm her
Charm her with your style
I know you convinced her
She's the love of your life
And no, you'll never, never love her like me

You can bless her
Keep her conscience clean
You can undress her
Go all the places I've been
But you'll never, never love her like me
