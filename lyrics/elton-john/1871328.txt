Take me down to the water
Take me back to the source
Call the meeting to order
And let it run its course


Take me back to my childhood
When i was so alone
Let me feel like a child would
Looking out across the great unknown

Take me down to the ocean
Take me down to the sea
Set the feeling in motion
Forget the tied up time and let my spirit free

Take away the illusion
Of the man, of the king
Help me lose the confusion
So i can breathe again

Take me down to the ocean
Take me down to the sea
Set the feeling in motion
So you can just be you and i can just be me
That's how i need to be
