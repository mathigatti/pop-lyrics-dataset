We can spend the night right
So honey turn out the lights
and do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow


You can work on a charm
And tell the man in your arms
To do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow

Lying here in a way that I have always wanted
Close to you in a scene that I have always haunted
Time and time again we defended a right to cling to
Our love-shy goodbyes, for broken hearts could cry

You can do it, you can do it slow
You can do it slow, slow, slow
You can do it slow, slow
Do it nice and slow

You can turn on the heat
To keep a man on the streets
When you do it nice and slow
I like it when you do it nice and slow

You can work on a spell
And weave your magic so well
When you do it nice and slow
come on and do it nice and slow

You can do it, you can do it I know
You can do it nice and slow
You can do it, you can do it
You can do it nice and slow, slow
I like it when you do it slow, slow

Come on and do it
Do it nice and slow
