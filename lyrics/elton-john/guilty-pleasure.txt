Hand it over reach across the line
Let's talk about it, tell me one more time
What is it you want, what you think you'll find
Inside of this old heart of mine


Come on out, cause you want to play
The rain went east, come to roll away
Here you went to choose and you're gonna stay
So I knew that's the price I pay

Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure

I roamed around looking for a clue
Searched the world it's what I used to do
Where I went, what I went though
A bit too hard to find a way to you

I can't move so never really could
Sing a song that you understood
It's what you do when you think you should
Surrender like you knew you always would

Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure

Hold out, distilling down
What's it going to be
Never tell in a million years
No, you can't get enough of me

Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure
