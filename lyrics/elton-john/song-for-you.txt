Written by Leon Russell
Released as a live UK B-side in 1988


I've been so many places in my life and times
I've seen a lot of things, I've had some bad rhymes
I acted out my life on stages, ten thousand people watching
Now I'm alone and I'm gonna sing these songs for you

I know your image of me isn't what I hoped it would be
I treated you unkindly, I'm a fool you see
There's no one more imprtant to me
Darling can you please see through me
Now I'm alone and I'm gonna sing these songs for you
