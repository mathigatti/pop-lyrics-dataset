I can't keep this from you 
I've held it in so long 
It's time to tell the truth 
Keeping it from you is wrong 
I can't keep this from you 
It's so simple I'm afraid 
When I tell you how I feel 
You'll just laugh and call me crazy 


And I can't keep 
This love a secret 
And I don't want 
To go on longing 
I just want a chance for me to prove 
My love and I can't keep this from you 

I can't keep this from you 
It's hard to breathe in here 
I just seem to act the fool 
Every time I feel you near 

I can't keep this from you 
No matter what you say 
Anything is better now 
Than going through my life this way 

And I can't keep 
This love a secret 
And I don't want 
To go on longing 
I just want a chance for me to prove 
My love and I can't keep this from you 

And I love every move you make 
Can't you hear every heart you break? 
And don't you know when I hear your name? 
Just the sound of it shoots me down in flames 

And I can't keep 
This love a secret 
And I don't want 
To go on longing 
I just want a chance for me to prove 
My love and I can't keep this from you 

I can't keep 
This love a secret 
And I don't want 
To go on longing 
I just want a chance for me to prove 
My love and I can't keep this from you 

I just want a chance for me to prove 
My love and I can't keep this from you 
Oh no I just can't keep this from you
