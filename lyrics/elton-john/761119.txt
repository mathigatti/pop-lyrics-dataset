Nostradamus said I predict 
That the world will end at half past six
What he didn't say was exactly when 
Was he listening to the radio? 
Was he listening to the government? 


Well he got us spooked anyway 
We'd been running hot up until today 
But a wind of change blew across our sales 
We were coasting on a winning streak 
We were kings until the power failed 

chorus:
We've been living in a tinderbox 
And two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock 
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock 
You and me together in a tinderbox
Two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock 
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock 
You and me together in a tinderbox

Godzilla came in disguise 
Tore the building down right before our eyes 
Kept the needle out of the red balloon 
Was he worried we might go too far 
Maybe wind up rhyming moon and June

The sun descends down in Mexico 
While a fancy car back on Savile Row 
Shows the price of fame leads to overkill
Things are gonna have to change 
Some holes along the road get filled 

[repeat chorus]

Pressure's gonna cook us if we don't unlock it 
Guns going off if we don't uncock it 
We've gotta climb out of the other one's pocket 
Or we're gonna burn, out on this beautiful rocket

[repeat chorus]
