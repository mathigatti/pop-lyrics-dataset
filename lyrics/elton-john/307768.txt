Say goodbye to loneliness, say goodbye to Marlon Brando
Say goodbye to latitudes and the confusion that surrounds you
Say goodbye to misery, say goodbye to the morning news
Say goodbye to prime time and the fools that choose to view
Say goodbye to Wendy, say goodbye to Rhonda
Say goodbye to the Beach Boys from the Palisades to Kona


Say goodbye to Glasnost, say goodbye to Malathion
Say goodbye to the clowns in congress and the belt around Orion
Say goodbye to the tabloids, say goodbye to diet soda
Say goodbye to new age music from the Capa to the Coda
Say goodbye to gridlock, goodbye to Dolly's chest
Goodbye to the ozone layer if there's any of it left

Don't it make you wanna crawl back to the womb
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room
This overload is edging me further out to sea
I need to put some distance between overkill and me, me

Say goodbye to Jackie Collins, say goodbye to illiterate fools
Goodbye to evangelists and geeks with power tools
Goodbye to statuettes, say goodbye to lists
Say goodbye to articles on who the senator kissed
Say goodbye to hair styles, goodbye to heaven's gate
Goodbye to Rocky Five, Six, Seven and Eight
