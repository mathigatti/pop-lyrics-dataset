Every story, tale or memior 
Every saga or romance 
Whether true or fabricated 
Whether planned or happen-stance 


Whether sweeping through the ages 
Casting centuries aside 
Or a hurried, brief recital 
Just a thirty minute ride 

Whether bright or melancholy 
Rough and ready, finely spun 
Whether with a thousand players 
Or a lonely cast of one 

Every story new or ancient 
Bagatale or work of art 
All are tales of human failing 
All are tales of love at heart 

This is the story of a love that flourished in a time of hate 
Of lovers no tyrany could separate 
Love set into motion on the Nile's shore 
Destiny ignited by an act of war 

Egypt saw the mighty river 
As its very heart and soul 
Source of life for all her people 
That only Egypt could control 

Destruction of their southern neighbor justified 
Nubia exploited left with little more than pride 
Oh
