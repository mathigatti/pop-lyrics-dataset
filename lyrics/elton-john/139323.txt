Like a corn in a field I cut you down
I threw the last punch too hard
After years of goin' steady, well I thought that it was time
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards


And I can't take you dancin' out on the weekend
I figured we'd painted too much of this town
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon
And I knew then I had lost what should have been fou-nd
I knew then I had lost what should have been found

And I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford
I'm low as a paid assassin is
You know I'm cold as a hired sword
I'm so ashamed, can't we patch it up
You know I can't think straight no more
You make me feel like a bullet, honey, in the gun
In the gun of Robert Ford

Like a child when his toys have been stepped on
That's how it all seemed to me
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in
And I'm damned if I'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel

And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man
Your friends and mine don't call no more
Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded
Breaking up is sometimes like breakin' the law
Breaking up is sometimes like breakin' the law
