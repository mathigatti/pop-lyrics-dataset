I said from the start that you'd be mine
But now it just seems I'm just wasting your time
If only you knew the hurt I've been through
You'll be sorry to see me go
You'll be sorry to see me go


I've always done the best that I could
To make you happy like I should
If only you knew what I've heard about you
You'll be sorry to see me go
You'll be sorry to see me go

I could have been mistreated if I'd been bad
But people tell me I'm the best that you've had
So there's something I want you to know
I think you'll be sorry to see me go
You'll be sorry to see me go

You said from the start that you'd be mine
But now it just seems I'm just wasting your time
If only you knew the hurt I've been through
You'll be sorry to see me go
You'll be sorry to see me go
