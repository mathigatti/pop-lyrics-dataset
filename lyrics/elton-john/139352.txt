I looked up from my glass into the sky
There's no one in my comic book to buy
Calendar swung on the wall held by a rusty nail
Down came the strange rain and washed my thoughts away


So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain

Still I sit beside the fire and watched as it fell
Come in colours from above into my citadel
My eyes are all embriodered with the rainbow you have made
And now it seems as though it's just, just like strange rain

So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain

So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain

Just like strange rain
