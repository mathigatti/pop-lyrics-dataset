There's no time for waiting
No future to see
Inside the next moment
Nothing might be
The answer's not certain
No time to decide
Is this the last curtain
There's no place to hide


There's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
There's only today

We all know the story
We've heard it before
We end up no question
Outside of death's door
There's no easy answer
To the question at hand
So easy to ask
And not understand
