They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds are grey
Than any Russian play could guarantee


I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me

It all began so well, but what an end
This is the time a feller needs a friend
When every happy plot ends with a marriage knot
And there's no knot for me
