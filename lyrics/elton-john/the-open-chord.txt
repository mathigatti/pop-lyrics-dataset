You gotta think about it
You gotta make a wish and count to ten
There's just a sense of wonder
I feel a new direction looking down the lens
Jump started the action
Heard a song in my head and wrote it down
It came out of nowhere
Felt a new sensation driving you through town


You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day

You're gonna see some changes
Gotta pinch myself just to believe
Everybody's having something
But I can tell you've got some magic up your sleeve
Some deep protection
When a feeling follows you around
I always need the silence
Or the lightning you bring like a new good sound

You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day

Sat around and waited for a spark
And it brightened up the night
Before I get much older
I want the pleasure of seeing you up in lights
I could then beside you
Hand over my heart and say a prayer
Love's not for quitters
It's a satisfaction
Knowing that you're there

You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
