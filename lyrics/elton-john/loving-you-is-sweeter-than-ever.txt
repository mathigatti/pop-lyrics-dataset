I remember yet before we met
That every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely woman


I remember meeting you
Discovering love can be so true
When it's shared by two instead of one

When you said you love me (when you said you love me)
We could not be parted (we could not be parted)
And I built my world around you (I built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you

And loving you is sweeter than ever
(I ain't never felt like this before)
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever, sweeter than ever

Each night I pray we'd never part
For the love within my heart grows stronger
From day to day

As best I can, and how I try
To reassure and satisfy
'Cause I'd be lost if you went away

'Cause I really need you (really really need you)
And I need for you to need me too
(If you don't go breaking my heart)
I have built my world around you
(I have built my world around you)
Baby I'm so thankful that I've found you

And loving you has made my life sweeter than ever before
(I ain't never felt like this before)
And loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
So much sweeter

That's what loving you (loving you)

'Cause I really love (really really love you)
And I'm thankful that you love me too
(Thankful that you love me too)
I have built my world around you
(I have built my world around you)
I am truly glad, I am truly glad
That loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
(You don't know how much this means to me)
When I'm loving you
Me, you, us

Sweeter than ever (tell me about it)
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
(You don't know how much this means to me)
I'm loving you, you made my life sweeter than ever
(You're sweeter than ever baby)
Sweeter than ever (sweeter than ever)
So much sweeter (sweeter than ever)

Loving you
Loving you is sweeter than ever...
