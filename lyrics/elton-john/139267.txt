Loose lips keep him rolling on his whitewall tires
Burning out his diesel now, looking like a forest fire
Ducktail jiver, common pearl diver
Let you have a piece real cheap
Those Sunday sermons, gotta start learning
How to look before the lion leaps


Oh I'd be Santa Clause in something more
Than a honeymoon in San Moritz
Ducktail jiver, nine to fiver
I'd like to buy a _____ that fits

Overloaded, railroaded
On the border of a Spanish town
Adios amigos, me got to go
Before they cut this poor boy down

So I'd like to buy a drink for someone
A pitcher and a glass
My circuit's run down, my fuse is blown
My childhood came at last

Sun-soaked, rain-choked
I need to get this battery charged
Miles behind my parents' time
Living in the world's back yard
