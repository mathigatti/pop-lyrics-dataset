Have you ever had a good time turn bad
When the leaves turn brown
And the shattered glass just splinters
It's days like this that you can't resist
A long tall drink
And a big yellow sun in the winter


And you can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

Did you ever pray you could stay away
Company excluded
From the curse of the family circle
In a big round room on the edge of the moon
There's a shooting star
In a race for the final hurdle

No need to worry, no need to worry
No need to worry when you dance alone
You already made it, you already made it
When you're dancing in the end zone
