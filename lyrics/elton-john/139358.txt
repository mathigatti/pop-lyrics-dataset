Your accountant called this morning
There was springtime in his heart
He couldn't wait to tell me
How he'd pulled our lives apart
And the letter from your lawyer
Lies unopened on the tray
I may get around to reading it later today


Walking round the lonely rooms
I see everything the same
But suddenly it matters
What was purchased in my name
Whether this or that was paid for
Belongs to me or you
Can the seven years together be divided by two

It says something for the legal boys
But nothing much for us
That all we had together
Is so quickly ended thus
The legal boys have won again
And you and I have lost
They can't tell us how it happened
But they'll let us know the cost
Oh they'll let us know the cost, oh yeah

There's a lot I'd like to tell you
But I can't get past your guards
I do not speak their language
And they hold all the cards
I would rather call you darling
Than defendant in the case
But lovers left here long ago
And clients took their place
