Your bags out on the bed 
Your closet's all cleared out 
You say you're goin' to Jacksonville 
'Cause our love's all worn out 
You're searching in my eyes 
To try and find a tear 
But the well of my forgiveness 
Has dried up with the years 


You might still look pretty 
In that lacey little dress 
But I think you've got your signals crossed 
If you think that I'm a mess 

I ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna cry 
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve 
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart 
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave 
I ain't gonna shake, I ain't gonna break 
I ain't gonna fall down on my knees 
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed 
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave 

It's like a prime time movie 
You play the part so well 
You do believe you're Heaven sent 
And livin' here is hell 

I hear it's hot in Florida 
And it's raining here tonight 
But the sun's gonna shine tomorrow 
And I'm gonna do alright 

You might still look pretty 
In that lacey little dress 
But I think you've got your signals crossed 
If you think that I'm a mess 

I ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna cry 
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve 
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart 
Oh, and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave 
I ain't gonna shake, I ain't gonna break 
I ain't gonna fall down on my knees 
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed 
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave 

You might still look pretty 
In that lacey little dress 
But I think you've got your signals crossed 
If you think that I'm a mess 

I ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna cry 
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve 
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart 
And darlin' turn the lights out when you leave 
I ain't gonna shake, I ain't gonna break 
I ain't gonna fall down on my knees 
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed 
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave 

So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed 
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
