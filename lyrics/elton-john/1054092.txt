I've a constant ache in the morning light
It's on account of night before
Some Park Lane lady in a shady bar
Took a fancy to the watch I wore


Oh but I can still remember how she laughed at me
As I spun around and hit the bed
She said, thank you honey, forget about the money
This pretty watch will do instead

City livin' woman, you're so static
Matchin' your men with a hook and eye
If you're gonna spend the summer in New York City
Ohh them women oh oh oh they're gonna slice your pie

Said, you're so static, baby I've had it
Rolling in a yellow cab
Downtown hustlers trying to pull some muscle
Ohh if they catch you, oh oh oh it could've turned out bad

It's show me what you want, I'll show you what I've got
I can show you a real good time
She's a friend indeed of a friend in need
But you'll be sorry when she leaves you crying

But I can still remember how she laughed at me
As I spun around and hit the bed
She said, thank you honey, forget about the money
This pretty watch will do instead

City livin' woman, you're so static
Matchin' your men with a hook and eye
If you're gonna spend the summer in New York City
Oh them women oh oh oh they're gonna slice your pie

Said, you're so static, baby I've had it
Rolling in a yellow cab
Downtown hustlers trying to pull some muscle
Ohh if they catch you, oh oh oh it could've turned out bad

City living woman, you're so static
Matching your man with a hook and eye
If you're gonna spend all summer in New York City
Ohh them women oh oh oh they're gonna slice your pie
(Pie)

Said, you're so static, baby I've had it
Rolling in a yellow cab
Downtown hustlers trying to pull some muscle
Ohh if they catch you, oh oh oh it could've turned out bad
