You know it, it is only true
That you could be the best of you
How I wonder miles away
Tying horshoes by the bay


As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Many say and lucky do
My own fire once said it too
Leave the ocean live and play
Door on sockets yesterday

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Is it fair or nestled sorrow
You could be there tomorrow

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Whooo ...

Whooo ...

As we know, maybe faster
