The night we met, we stood
Divided by defenses as old as time
But love has found a way
To bring me to your senses and you to mine


So we meet in the cloak of evening
And we try to go on believing
Two different worlds can still be one
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun

The night we met, we knew
What love would soon be leading us to do
And so it goes, and now
When wanting turns to needing, I turn to you

And it's hard to go on deceiving
But we have to go on believing
That someday our love will overcome
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun

As I lie here and feel you breathing
It's not hard to keep on believing
That someday our love will overcome
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun
