Hello, Baby hello!
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me or are you still
The same spoiled child
Hello, I said Hello!
Is the only place you thought to go
Am I the only man you ever had or am I just the last surviving
Friend that you know


Harmony and me were pretty good company
Looking for an Island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony Gee I really love you and I want to love you forever
I dream I'm never never never leave Harmony

Hello, Baby Hello!
Open up your heart and let you feelings flow
Your not lucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
In any case I'm settin my own pace by stealing the show
Say hello hello

Whoa

Harmony and me were pretty good company
Looking for an Island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony Gee I really love you and I want to love you forever
I dream I'm never never never leaving Harmony

Never leaving Harmony

Aaagh!
