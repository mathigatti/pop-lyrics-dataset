Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like deep blue sea
On a blue blue day


Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the morning comes
I'll be far away
And I say
Blue eyes holding back the tears
Holding back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear blue sky
Watching over me
Blue eyes ooh I love blue eyes

When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see
Blue eyes laughing in the sun
Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes

And I am home again
Blue eyes laughing in the sun
Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home again
