Jo-Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo-Jo left his home in Tuscon, Arizona
For some California grass


Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her said she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

So get back, get back...
