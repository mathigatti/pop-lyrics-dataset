Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
About you're plans to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday


Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

I know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love somebody else

Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
for the other guy you loved before

Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
