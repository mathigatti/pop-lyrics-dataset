From this day on I own my father's gun
We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down below the southern land
It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands
I'll take my horse and I'll ride the Northern plain
To wear the colour of the greys and join the fight again
I will not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun


I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

As soon as this is over we'll go home
To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring

I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company, it needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
Oh
I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat
The riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said now, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

(The riverboat sails tonight)
(That's just fine alright)
Oh, slip us a rope
Sail on round, sail on round, sail on round, sail on round
(Sail)
Sail on round the bend
(The riverboat sails tonight)
Oh, I said
That's just fine alright
