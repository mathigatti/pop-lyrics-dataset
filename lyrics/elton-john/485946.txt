Keep it a mystery
Keep it to yourself
I'm always watching
And I'll always help


Keep it a mystery
Keep turning it on
You're hiding something
That's keeping me warm

Daylight is coming
And shadows are gone
Keep it a mystery
'Till night's coming on

Keep it a mystery
And don't let it drift
It's like the ocean
It's nature's dark gift

A common addiction
Couldn't be like this
It's strangely compelling
And I can't resist

Daylight is coming
And shadows are gone
Keep it a mystery
'Till night's coming on

'Cause I want to see that mystery in me
And I want to sleep with the secrets that you keep
I want to wake with the magic that you make
Running up and down my spine like when a fault line shakes
Keep it a mystery, a mystery for me
Keep it a mystery, a mystery for me

I want to hide, I want to watch
I want to draw back the blinds and be caught
I want to hang on every word
I want to know that my breathing was heard

'Cause I want to see that mystery in me
And I want to sleep with the secrets that you keep
I want to wake with the magic you make
Running up and down my spine like when a fault line shakes

Oh, I want to see that mystery in me
And I want to sleep with the secrets that you keep
I want to wake with the magic you make
Running up and down my spine like when a fault line shakes

And keep it a mystery, a mystery for me
Keep it a mystery for me
Keep it a mystery
