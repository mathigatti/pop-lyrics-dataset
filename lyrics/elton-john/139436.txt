It's a tired old world that we're living in
Where the voice of reason is wearing thin
Got a beaten earth, got a hole in the sky
Got a whole lot of angry people crying
"I want an eye for an eye"


Compassion sunk without a trace
All trust is gone, have we lost our faith
Got a taste for hate, got a lot of guns
Got a whole lot of family values bitching
"Just blame it on the young"

And a little peace goes a long, long way
It's peace we want, for peace we pray
A little peace goes a long, long way
It's peace we want, for peace we pray
Ain't so crazy, John Lennon knew
That a little peace goes a long, long way when you want it to

We crush the ones who don't agree
Whose lifestyles clash with you and me
Got our TV sets full of talking heads
Got a whole lot of people walking around
Like the night of the living dead

And a little peace goes a long, long way
It's peace we want, for peace we pray
A little peace goes a long, long way
It's peace we want, for peace we pray
Ain't so crazy, John Lennon knew
That a little peace goes a long, long way when you want it to

Our summer of love has come and gone
Us sixties kids are getting on
We had a dream way back then
No reason why we can't dream again

And a little peace goes a long, long way
It's peace we want, for peace we pray
A little peace goes a long, long way
It's peace we want, for peace we pray
Ain't so crazy, John Lennon knew
That a little peace goes a long, long way when you want it to

A little peace goes a long, long way
It's peace we want, for peace we pray
A little peace goes a long, long way

A little peace goes a long, long way
It's peace we want, for peace we pray
A little peace goes a long, long way
It's peace we want, for peace we pray
Ain't so crazy, John Lennon knew
That a little peace goes a long, long way when you want it to

Ain't so crazy, John Lennon knew
That a little peace goes a long, long way when you want it to
