I read about how you're slow with the truth
Like any old Aesop's Fable
But when you're turtlesque, I'm a hare's breath
Into payment under the table
But some journalist got his mug shot kit
And his briefcase on his lap
But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B.
And all that political crap


`Cause I've seen your fascist faces
On the cover of the national papers
Staring out in black and white
From the tall gray walls on the other side
When I see your fascist faces
Then I know I've had enough
Trying to trace it or erase it
Is it foolproof or a bluff

If the boy had been blessed he'd have been arrested
On a charge of wearing red shoes
But if your pants are blue you got nothing to lose
It'll make you a patriot through and through
