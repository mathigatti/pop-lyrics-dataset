She was just seventeen
And you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
I couldn't dance with another
When I saw her standing there


Well she looked at me
And I could see
That before too long I fell in love with her
I couldn't dance with another
When I saw here standing there

Well my heart went boom
As I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I feel in love with her
I couldn't dance with another
When I saw here standing there
