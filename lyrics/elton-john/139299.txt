I've got a good by-line
They all know my name
The queen of the sly line
I feed on your fame
But I got my heart in the right place
It's all in the game


If you're doing fine boy
You got my vote
But step out of line boy
And I'll go for your throat
'Cause I got my heart in the right place
So give me a quote

I'll ask you some questions
I'll tell you some lies
You'll open your heart like a friend
I'll make up some answers
You won't recognise
The you I create with my pen
But my heart's in the right place
Now and again

Ny heart's in the right place
Know what I mean
My heart's in the right place
On page seventeen

I'll ask you some questions
I'll tell you some lies
You don't understand, but you will
I'll make up some answers
Cut you down to size
Then I move in for the kill
But my heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
It's part of the skill

Heart's in the right place
I'm gonna destroy you
And your reputation
Don't count for nothing with me
'Cause I'm an old bitch you see
And my heart's in the right place
Don't you agree

Heart's in the right place
Just wait and see
Heart's in the right place
Don't you agree
