I've got a strong-willed someone to love me
Here off a highway in the way
Don't need to shout it
We're living here quietly
Away from the folks
Who just sleep all day
I lived the fast life, taking some chances
On my high horse everyone rode
All around were too many monkeys
Asleep at the wheel
And running the show


But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze, freedom's a time
I'm rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

All my sweet sins stayed in the city
I caved in and wandered into your heart
When least expected out of the heavens
The moonlight descended into the dark

But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze, freedom's a time
I'm rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

Cause your blue [?] watch
In no heaven
Set back the clock you gave me
Your time
I'm living better now I'm free and easy
Freedom past I've left here high

Well I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight
(Because I'm)
I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight
Where you are tonight
