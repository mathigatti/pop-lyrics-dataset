Look at you, could I have been so foolish and so green
A face that smiled at every passing scene


Look at you, you're lost behind the web of woven time
When each emotion pinball in your mind

Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial

Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn

But you and I have come so far
With shaken faith from the pain of a broken heart
Toward feeling great
Feel like life has just begun
No more singing duets for one

I hold your picture here beside the bed
You had a party raging in your head

Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt
And here today all I can do is learn

Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial

Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn

I had this picture of me looking at you
Looking at me
And I would like to say
Goodbye, sweet memory
