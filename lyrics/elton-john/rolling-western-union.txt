Never released



I've served upon this railroad for longer than I know
My father and his father did the same thing long ago
To keep the Western Union rolling down towards the sea
The benefits of this great line built for you and me

So Rolling Western Union, you can roll on to the sea
Ten thousand miles of beatin' steel has made a man out of me
In every state I've driven home a rivet with my hands
Oh it's Rolling Western Union rolling onward, onward through our land


It's friends of mine who died upon the building of this line
Irishmen and Chinamen and some from the British Isles
I've even seen the convicts come to work here for a while
Before the law caught up with them and sent them back to trial


I had a wife while on the job a hundred miles on back
She died in Oklahoma and I laid her by the track
All that's left is a wooden cross upright on a mound
