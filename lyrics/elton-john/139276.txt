Oh Emerald
I didn't mean to act this way
I feel numb and dumb
And oh so overcome by the things we say


Oh Emerald
I am not your little boy
Times are tough enough for us to be so rough
Swimming hard against the waves

I don't mean to act so cruel
And I don't mean to punish you
Must this be the life we choose
I don't want to be a slave to you
I just want to be true

Oh Emerald
If you could only see the view from my eyes
Then you'd know how far I've gone for you
But you look the other way

But you don't mean to act so cruel
And I don't mean to punish you
Must this be the life we choose
I don't want to be a slave to you
I just want to be true

We don't mean to act so cruel
And I don't mean to punish you
Must this be the life we choose
I don't want to be a slave to you
I just want to be true
