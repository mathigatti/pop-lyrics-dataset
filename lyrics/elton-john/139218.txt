I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise


I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
And if it's all the same maybe we should part
And I'm singing do do do...
I'm singing do do do...

You had to tie me down inside a cage of doubt
I'm sick of being kicked around so this is where I get out

Oh oui baby you tried to hold me but you were slowly
Driving me insane
Oh oui baby

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise

I couldn't take your pain, you couldn't take my love
So I'm gonna quit this game `cause baby I've had enough
