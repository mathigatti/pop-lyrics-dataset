Fat boys cry when ugly girls sing
About the way the world would be if they were thin
And ugly girls turn their heads when fat boys laugh
About the handsome kid next door who broke their heart
Who broke their heart
Broke their heart


And fat boys lie when ugly girls ask
About the size an apple pie looks through a magnifying glass
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

But it's the fat boy's world for an ugly girl
And ugly girls love that fat boy joy
Who needs the worries of a perfect world
Hear the early birds make that spring time come
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl

Fat boys dance when ugly girls shout
That a waltz is not the dance for the boy who's stout
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

Fat boys and ugly girls
