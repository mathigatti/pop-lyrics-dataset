I've been out on this road some 
Can't help feeling I've been showing my friends around 
I've seen it growing from next to nothing 
Into a giant eating up your town 


Called up the tealeaves and the tarots 
Asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands 
She saw a mountain and wild deer running 
A crazy kid becoming a better man 

But we stuck around for the fireworks 
Waiting to explode 
Shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed 
And me on a yellow brick road 
Pleasing the people some of the time 
For better or for worse 
An urban soul in a fine silk Suit 
And a heart out west in a Wrangler shirt 

chorus:
And you can't go back and if you try it fails 
Looking up ahead I see a rusty nail 
A sign hanging from it saying "Truth for sale" 
And that's what we did 
No lies at all just one more tale 
About the Captain and the Kid 

We've been missing at times in action 
Can't imagine what he said he might do for you 
The devil got to come to the party sometimes 
But he never got to wear our shoes 

Oh we've conjured up what we created 
Way back then when I was standing up in six-inch heels 
Now you're riding off into the sunset 
And I'm still spinning like a Catherine wheel 

But we stuck around for the battle 
Waiting for a plan 
To turn you into the Brown Dirt Cowboy 
And me into a rocket man 
It pleases the people some of the time 
Digging into our roots 
But I got a brand new pair of shoes 
And you're on a horse in old cowboy boots 


[repeat chorus]
