Shakey wake up thirsty from a night in the bar
And snake hips Joe is Mr. Cool
Out on the boulevard
The pimp from the Jack of Diamonds
Just got another Jane Doe
She just got off the last bus from Montecedo


Sailor boys find trouble in the alien state
It's one on one from Las Palmas to the Golden Gate
Fly boys on the corner waiting for a ride
For twenty bucks he'll pull the cork on the man inside

`Cause we're rolling in heavy traffic
Judy's in the jump seat and Jody's in the bucket
Billy likes to drive and Jackie's just high
And Cindy thinks we're all gonna commit suicide
`Cause we're rolling in heavy traffic
Yeah we're rolling in heavy traffic

Mack he's got his Marlboros tucked up in his sleeve
He's shacked up in his basement making P.C.P.
He used to shake the french fries
Down on 12th and Maine
And now he stays up nights on apple juice and cocaine
