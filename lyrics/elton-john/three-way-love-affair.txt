Loving you was easy
Your love captured my heart
You were always pleasing
Till you tore us apart
Said you needed both of us
How could you be so unkind
Then you traded love for lust
But sooner or later I'm gonna get you
Look out girl `cause I'm gonna fix you


I'm gonna shake it up
This time I'm gonna break it up
There won't be any making up
I'm shaking this three-way love affair
I'm gonna shake it up
This time I'm gonna break it up
There won't be any making up
I'm shaking this three-way love affair


Sneaking out on Sunday
You thought I didn't know
Well early morning Monday
Once more you didn't show
Alibis and selfish lies
Oh I've had my fill of them all
You can dry your crying eyes
I know you're faking, there's no mistaking
Look out girl your heart might be breaking
