Goodbye Grandma, sleep well tonight
Dream of all your younger days
Way before time had left you sad
And store yourself away


'Cause I remember you
Just as you always used to be
Before time had taken toll
And stole you away from me

And I wish I could stop time tonight
And hold the whole world still
And keep you here forever
To be mine

And I wish the world was different
And I could hold you in my arms
And I keep you here forever
For all time

'Cause Grandma, I can sail the seven seas
I could take a rocket to the moon
But everywhere I go
You would be there too
And I'd be right there with you

Sleep well tonight
Sleep well tonight
