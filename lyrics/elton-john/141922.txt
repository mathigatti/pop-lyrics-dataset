Don't you have a word to show what may be done
Have you never heard a way to find the sun
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue


Have you seen the land living by the breeze
Can you understand a light among the trees
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Tell us all today
IF you know the way to blue

Look though time and find your rhyme
Tell us what you find
We will wait at your gate
hoping like the blind

Can you now recall all that you have known
Will you never fall when the light has flown
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue
