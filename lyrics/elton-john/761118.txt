We are the Goaldiggers, we are the Goaldiggers
And we'd like you to help us if you can
We would like your cooperation
To help our organization
Provide football pitches throughout the land


If you were a kid, oh what would you say
If you found out there was just nowhere to play
If I were a kid, oh I would feel abused
If the energy that I had couldn't be used

We are the Goaldiggers, we are the Goaldiggers
So help us to start the ball to roll
Spread the word from man to man
Give us anything you can
Help us to achieve our goal

Goaldigger, Goaldigger
I'm a Goaldigger, he's a Goaldigger
Goaldigger, Goaldigger
I'm a Goaldigger
