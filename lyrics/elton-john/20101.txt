As I awoke the evening with the smell of woodsmoke clinging.
Like a gentle cobweb hanging upon a painted teepee.
Oh I wen to see my chieftain with my war lance and my woman.
For he told us that the yellow moon would very soon me leaving.


This I can't believe I said, I can't believe our Warlord'sdead.
Oh, he would not leave the chose ones to the buzzards and thesoldiers guns.

Oh, great father of the Iroquois ever since I was young,
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast-fed on the sound ofdrums.
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild.
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughtermine.

And now you ask that I should watch the red man's race be slowlycrushed!
What kind of words are these to hear from Yellow Dog, whom thewhite man fears?

I take only what is mine Lord, my pony, my squaw, and my child.
I can't stay to see you die along with my tribe's pride.
I got to search for the yellow moon and the Fathers of oursons,
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold, and the healingwaters run.

Trampling down the prairie rose, leaving hoof tracks in thesand.
Those who wish to follow me, I welcome with my hands.
I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead,
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full oflead.

Now there seems no reason why I should carry on,
In this land that once was my land, I can't find a home.
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are coming,
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senselessrunning.
For soon I'll find the yellow moon, along with my loved ones.
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields without the sound ofguns.

And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole.
