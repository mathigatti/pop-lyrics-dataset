Seen him playing in his backyard
Young boy just starting out
So much history in this landscape
So much confusion, so much doubt


Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids mean and dumb
Looks like a painting that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from

Western skies don't make it right
Home of the brave don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind, it's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind blowing, Wyoming

See two coyotes running down a deer
Hate what we don't understand
You pioneers give us your children
But it's your blood that stains their hands

Western skies don't make it right
Home of the brave don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind, it's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind blowing, Wyoming

Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To Ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined one life spent
Western skies don't make it right
Home of the brave don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind, it's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind blowing, Wyoming

It's a cold, cold wind, it's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, blowing
Wyoming
