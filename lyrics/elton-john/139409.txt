There's another one due in three month's time
She'll have to paint the spare room blue
She'll work a little overtime
And hope it all works out for Frank and her
If she can keep him home nights
Away from those factory girls


And the gas bills come and the money burns
And Frank just keeps complaining
How little they both earn
And mother drops by Mondays
Just to nag about the world
Then she stays to nag at Dallas
`Cause she hates those Texas girls

Poor cow
You'll get your dumb man
You'll see your whole life coming at you
In the back of his hand
Poor cow
It's a monkey see town
You'll walk down the aisle
In the hand me down gown
Of some poor cow

Oh them rich bitch girls
Ain't like our lass
Got no spine for labour
Like us working class
Us gamey lot
Still got our pride
We got our health
It's just the truth that's died
