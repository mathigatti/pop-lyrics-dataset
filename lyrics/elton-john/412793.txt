It's getting dark in here 
Don't want to leave 
Shadow's falling 
And I believe 
Winds picking up 
Thing's so unclear 
I'm afraid of my shadow 
And it's getting dark in here 
I'm scared of strangers 
On the street 
World's so ugly 
I can't breath 
Moon's so spooky 
I'm close to tears 
I've lost it all 
And it's getting dark in here 


And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting 
Sometimes I feel I'm on fire 
I've been handed a curse and a blessing 
My life's been stripped down to the wire 
And I'm trying to get back and hold on 
Find someone somewhere who cares 
But the sun's always setting on my life 
And it's sure getting dark in here 

Don't talk about angels 
Or how I'll be saved 
I'm no coward 
But I'm not that brave 
Rags are blowing 
Rain's getting near 
I'm done with running 
And it's getting dark in here 

And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting 
Sometimes I feel I'm on fire 
I've been handed a curse and a blessing 
My life's been stripped down to the wire 
And I'm trying to get back and hold on 
Find someone somewhere who cares 
But the sun's always setting on my life 
And it's sure getting dark in here 
And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting 
Sometimes I feel I'm on fire 
I've been handed a curse and a blessing 
My life's been stripped down to the wire 
And I'm trying to get back and hold on 
Find someone somewhere who cares 
But the sun's always setting on my life 
And it's sure getting dark in here 

Yeah, the sun's always setting on my life 
And it's sure getting dark in here
