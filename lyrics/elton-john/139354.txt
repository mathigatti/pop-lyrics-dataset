My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my pill, yes you will be my pill


My Lady D'Arbanville
Why does it grieve me so
But your heart seems so silent
Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low

My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my pill, yes you will be my pill

My Lady D'Arbanville
You look so cold tonight
Your legs feel like winter
Your skin has turned to white, your skin has turned to white

My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my pill, yes you will be my pill

My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you grieve me so
But your heart seems so silent
Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low

I love you my lady
Though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
This rose will never die, this rose will never die
