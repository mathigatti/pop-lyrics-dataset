Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Never released


Don't you worry where I'm going
I'll just go without you knowing
I won't come back to you again
I'll leave right now and catch the train

Don't you wait for me anymore
I loved you then and then I was sure
Our love was something at the start
You killed the sun and you broke my heart


Why oh why did you do it
I thought I'd never get through it
While you were telling me lies
You were taking the sun
Taking the sun from my eyes
Taking the sun from my eyes
Taking the sun from my eyes


So just listen to me while I say
forget all the love of those days
They're only empty and they're gone
Just like the river that's washed in the storm
