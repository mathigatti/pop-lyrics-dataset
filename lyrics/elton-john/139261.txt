I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck
I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck
That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard
But I'm gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard
When I watch the police come by and move you on
Well, I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become
Well, you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear
But all you got was a mop-up job washing other people's stairs


I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
Oh! (oh!)

I'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, I bet she
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped

I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
Oh! (oh!)

I'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, oh, I bet she, let me tell you now
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

Oh ho
Ah ho!
'Cause I bet she, oh, I bet she
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

Dirty little girl (girl)
Oh ho (oh ho)
Dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Girl, girl, girl, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Oh, oh, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Girl, girl, girl, dirty, dirty little girl
