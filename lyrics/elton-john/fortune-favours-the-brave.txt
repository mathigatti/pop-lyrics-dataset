Soldiers:

Oh, Oh
Fortune Favors the Brave
Oh, Oh
Fortune Favors the Brave


Radames:

We have swept to glory,
Egypt's mastery expands
From the Nile's northern most delta
To the dry, dry southern sands

The more we find, the more we see,
The more we come to learn
The more that we explore,
The more we shall return

Soldiers:

Oh, oh
Fortune favors the brave

Radames:

It's all worked out, my road is clear
The lines of latitude extend
Way beyond my wildest dreams
Toward some great triumphant end

We seize the day
We turned the tide
We touched the stars
We mocked the grave
We moved into uncharted lands

Radames &amp; Soldiers:

Fortune favors the brave

Radames:

The more we find, the more we see
The more we come to learn
The more that we explore
The more we shall return

Nothing is an accident
We are free to have it all
We are what we want to be
It's in ourselves to rise or fall

This is easy to believe
When distant places call to me
It's harder from the palace yard
Fortune favors the free

Soldiers:
Oh, oh

Radames:

Fortune favors the young!

Soldiers:
Oh, oh

Radames:

Fortune favors the brave!
