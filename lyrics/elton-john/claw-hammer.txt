You're holding back
You're hard to read
Your a 21st century kind
You're lighting fast
Built for speed
A tight lipped modern mind
An architect
Of grand romance
You're a mystery of disguise
You're holed up in your house
Just waiting for the fire
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know


You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord

Look at us fools
Being used
We're totally dumb, surprised
Waiting for you to share with us
The myth behind the lies
Come on out
Throw us a bone
We want to know your intentions
Are you fake
For goodness sake
Or the Mother of Invention
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord

You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
