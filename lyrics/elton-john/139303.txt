Ooh, I got a busted wing and a hornet sting
Like an out-of-tune guitar
Ooh, she got Hercules on her side
And Diana in her eyes
Some men like the Chinese life
Some men kneel and pray
Ooh, well, I like women and I like wine
And I've always liked it that way
Always liked it that way


(Doo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, ah)

I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough-man routine up her sleeve
Living and loving, kissing and hugging
Living and loving with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules

Oh, and it hurts like hell to see my girl
Messing with a muscle boy
No Superman gonna ruin my plans
Playing with my toys
Rich man sweating in a sauna bath
Poor boy scrubbing in a tub
Me, I stay gritty up to my ears
Washing in a bucket of mud
Washing in a bucket of mud

(Doo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, ah)

I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough-man routine up her sleeve
Living and loving, kissing and hugging
Living and loving with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules

(Doo-wop, shoo-wop)
(Doo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, ah)

But I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough-man routine up her sleeve
Living and loving, kissing and hugging
Living and loving with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
(Oh, yeah)
