Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway


For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors
Of the world outside
Thinking of the ways
That the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn
From purple into grey

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again

Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind

Let me wake up in the morning
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day

I want to hear the pealing bells
Of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me
From this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again

Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very, so very far behind
