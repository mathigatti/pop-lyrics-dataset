I remember when rock was young
Gnomeo and Juliet had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold buggy and a place of their own
But the biggest kick they ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking Round the clock
They were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Eh! Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Eh! Everybody is feeling right
Because were gonna dance all night
And the Crocodile Rocking was something out of sigh

Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah
Laaaaaaa la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

B?t th? years w?nt b? ?nd th? rock never died
Juliet w?nt ?nd left Gnomeo f?r ??m? foreign guy
Gnomeo nights ?r??ng b? th? record machine
Dreaming ?f m? buggy ?nd m? old blue jeans
Cause I'll never k?ll th? thrills w?'ve g?t
Burning up t? th? crocodile rock
Learning fast as the weeks g? past
Cause Gnomeo really th??ght th? crocodile rock gonna last

Eh! Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
