When you hold me, when you thrill me
My heart just sets on fire
When you love me, when you hold me
I'm just filled with desire


You know that I love you baby
But your kind of loving just drives me crazy
When you hold me, when you kiss me
Mr. Frantic, Mr. Frantic

When you tell me that I'm your only
I feel on top of the world
If you'd only say you will
Then you'll be my only girl

We could be such a happy pair
And I promise to do my share
When you hold me, when you kiss me
Mr. Frantic, Mr. Frantic

You know that I have loved you since
The day we met in the rain
And if you were to go away now
My heart couldn't stand the pain
