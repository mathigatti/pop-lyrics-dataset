Our glorious city
Was built by the divinities, by gods
Who saw fit to bestow
The gift of a paradise
Peaceful and harmonious upon
Us mere mortals below


And made El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
One thousand years ago

El Dorado
El Dorado
El Dorado

But all this was granted
For only one millennium
I know my legacy is to fulfill
My promise to all my people
Who have trusted me, the gods
Will approve of us still

Preserve El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
And I believe they will

El Dorado
El Dorado
El Dorado

The mountains so high and waters deep
Are her disguise
Her secrets are safe from foreign hands and eyes forever

Preserve El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
And I believe they will

El Dorado
