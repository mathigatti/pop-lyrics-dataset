Abide with me, fast forth the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord abide with me
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, O abide with me


I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting, where, grave, that victory
I triumph still if Thou abide with me

Hold Thou thy cross before my closen eyes
Shine throught the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me
