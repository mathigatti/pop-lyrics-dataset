The seadogs have all sailed their ships
Into the docks of dawn
While the sirens sit and comb their hair
And twiddle with their thumbs


Oh Thor above the mountain
Look down upon your children
This is their heaven where they're told
To bring their galleons

Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

You can come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala

There's long boats in the harbor
Which arrive there every hour
With the souls of the heroes
Whose blood lies on the flowers

And this heaven is the home
Of every man who loves his sword
And he uses it for freedom
To preach the word of Thor

Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

You can come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Val-hala, Val-hala, Val-hala
