If you want it, here it is, come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it anytime, I can give it
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last


Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast

If you want it, here it is, come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it anytime, I can give it
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last

Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money, sonny
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast
Fool and his money, sonny

If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast
