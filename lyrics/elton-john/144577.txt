I'm, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow


I'm, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all of your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases, all your Christmases be white
