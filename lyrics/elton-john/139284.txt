He's so sophisticated
In a critic's eye
He needs a change of habit
But then so do I
He's all Zefferelli
In cool loose clothes
He needs to be rewired
He's plugged on overload


So crisp and new
Well it had to be
I guess he needs a change
From the likes of me
If he should lose some color
When he leaves the sun
I'm sure a little Braggi
Wouldn't hurt no one

'Cause when the fool's in fashion
He's attracting everyone
He'll be the head of your list
He'll be your dinner guest
If he's the center of attention
Looks like the fool's in fashion

You had your pound of flesh
You got the driver's seat
Well you can keep the car
But I'd like the meat
'Cause there must be plenty
Down in the cutting room
It's so tough to suffer
When you want the moon
