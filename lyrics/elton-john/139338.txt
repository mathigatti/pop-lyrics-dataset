I don't know what to say
I don't know where the light shines
It's a grey dawn rising on a green hill
And there's so much behind us


I don't know where we go
I sure feel there's something out there
There's a great awakening and a new morning
And your spirit's pounding loud and clear

If the river can bend
I'll find you waiting
Home at last from the wild sea
All the twists and turns
We've made together
All the boats you rocked
With your harmony
If the river can bend
If the river can bend
If the river can bend
If the river can bend

Come and embrace the struggle
But win or lose we live here
Build a new beginning on an old rock
Breathe deep of the sweet fresh air
