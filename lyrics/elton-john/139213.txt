This year, next year, sometime, never
Will we ever get together
I keep hoping things are gonna change
Colours changing red to yellow
yesterday you said hello
And from now on I'll never be the same


Annabella Umberella
Standing on the corner when the rain comes down
That's the way I'll always think of you
When I first met you
Annabella Umberella, child

I wanna get to know you better
Get to know your name
And yet I know to me you'll always be the same

Sunshine sunshine go away
Come again another day
Raindrops fall, us both together
How I love the rainy weather
