There's a fly in the window, a dog in the yard
And a year since I saw you
There's a trunk in the corner I keep all my letters
My bills and demands I keep too


Well, I can't help thinking about the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me, cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine

Drunk all the time, feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days, we'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together without a wife in line?
To pick the crop and get me hot on elderberry wine

Round a tree in the summer, a fire in the fall
Flat out when they couldn't stand
The bottle went round like a woman down south
Passed on from hand to hand

Well, I can't help thinking about the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me, cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine

Drunk all the time, feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days, we'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together without a wife in line?
To pick the crop and get me hot on elderberry wine

Drunk all the time, feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days, we'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together without a wife in line?
To pick the crop and get me hot on elderberry wine

Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
