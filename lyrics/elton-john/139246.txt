You don't love him any more
He threw your rag doll out the door
I kept my distance
I held my breath
Love always ends up
Hanging by a thread


Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
'I don't love you' is like a stake
Being driven through your heart

But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel, but I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm cold
cold
cold

You said don't cry to me
He said I'm a dead man if you leave
I have no feelings, I have no heart
Love always cuts out
The warm and tender part

Love hurts so much
Love cuts so deep
It's a hot sweat and a cold shake
Like drowning in your sleep

But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel, but I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm cold
cold
cold

Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
'I don't love you' is like a stake
Being driven through your heart

But I don't care
I came back for you
I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel
But I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm cold
Cold
cold
