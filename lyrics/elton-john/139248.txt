Come back baby
Come back to me yeah
And you will see yeah
How I've changed
'Cause you're the only love that I ever had
You're the only love that I ever had
Come back to me


Come back baby
I did you wrong yeah
And this is the song I sing
I hope will bring you back to me
'Cause you're the only love that I ever knew
You're the only love that I ever knew
Come back come back

Come back baby
Come back and treat me right
Come back baby
Come on back, I'll hold you tight

Come back baby
Come back I'll treat you right
Come back baby
Come on back
Come back and hold me tight

Come back baby
Everything's gonna be fine right now
It's gonna be fine right now
It's gonna be fine right now
'Cause you're the only love that I ever had
Yeah you're coming back and I'm so glad
You're coming back to me
