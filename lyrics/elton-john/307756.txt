Your life stepped lightly out our hands
When no one's looking out you understand
Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned


And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy snare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end

Every new version of the way of life
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night
But whose kid are you when they finally decide
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died

But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell
The difference for you between heaven and hell
To glorify something, your legends are found
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground

Years rolling by just like a dream
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine
They've lost you and fate put your name on a stone
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone
