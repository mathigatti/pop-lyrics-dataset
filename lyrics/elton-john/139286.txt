When it's springtime down in Georgia
It's winter time up in Maine
You can go from snow to sunshine
If you board a southbound train
You get used to taking orders
But it's sometimes kind of rough
I got everything that a man could need
But it still ain't quite enough


Taking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel my life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I'm gone

When it's nighttime down in Georgia
It's daytime in L.A.
Where they never seem to do much
But they sure got lots to say
The times are changing down in Georgia
Though not always for the best
Give me thirty five good acres lord
And let progress take the rest

Talking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel that life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before they're gone

Oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel that life has passed me by
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I die
