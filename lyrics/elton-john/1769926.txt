Feet are feeling light
Head on out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?


Ducking up and down
All these crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool

Just when you think
You're a chain with just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool

Hello hello
Hello hello
My my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out threr dropped say hello
Hello!

Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy
Nothing comes for free

Sniffing on a flower
Run through an autumn shower
Bumping into someone else like me

Hello hello

Hello hello
My my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!

And I could fly on the back of a bird
I could shake all the leaves from a tree
If there's a quest I'm a Knight
Where's there's wrong I'll do right
Two is better than the one I used to be

Hello hello
Hello hello
My my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello

Hello Hello
Hello Hello
