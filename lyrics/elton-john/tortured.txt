Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Released as a UK B-side in 1984


I'd like to make this song so simple
Don't want to hide my feeling under
Drawn up words in shades of many colours
How can I make them think I am clever
By merely saying that I miss you

It's just a state they claim I'm going through
Don't want you to think that I am weakening
Although you know I'm always dreaming
Someday you'll be coming home to me


Tortured, I've been so tortured by you so many times
But you always love the ones that hurt you
And I guess those are the ties that bind
Tortured by you


If I had taken parting easy
It might have been a better lesson
For all concerned in wars of love and hate
How can you swear through words and music
The heart you crave and how to move it


It's just a beach you washed my body onto
Don't want you to know that I an crying
Although your friends can see I'm dying
Slowly from the knife you left in me


Tortured by you
Tortured by you
Tortured by you so many times
