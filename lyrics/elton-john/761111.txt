He wasn't famous but I sure did love him 
I've got his picture in a little frame 
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name 
But there's so many more and I've lost count 
The hows and whys aren't important now 
All that matters is they came around 
And brightened up our lives


She was twenty one with her life ahead 
You don't need to know her name 
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade 
But fate's right hand isn't always just 
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust 
She was just a little girl ain't that enough 
To rage against the day 

chorus:
And how did we get so lucky? 
Targets on the rifle range 
Who makes the call and who gets to choose? 
Who gets to win and who gets to lose? 
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues 
And blues never fade away 
Hey hey the colors run when the rain falls 
But blues never fade away 

He shone so bright with a lust for life 
Like the Sun King that he was 
His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth 
And for reasons I never understood 
About the choices made between the bad and good 
I've tried to figure out but 
The pain never goes away 

[repeat chorus]

And there's marble markers and little white crosses 
Along the beaten path 
And I've spread their ashes on the wind 
And I miss John Lennon's laugh 

[repeat chorus]
