Some days I think it's all a dream 
The things I've done, the places that I've been 
This life of mine seemed surreal at times 
Wasted days and nights in someone else's mind 
 
Could it be I'm not for real? 
I've slapped my face to check out how I feel 
There's hostages to prove it's true 
Who lives behind the mask was never proved 
 
Come on Robert Johnson  
Though we're worlds apart 
You and I know what it's like 
With the devil in our heart 
You sold your soul at the crossroads 
Kept a little of mine on hand 
I'm wading out this muddy water 
Been stranded in the Wasteland 
 
Rattling chains all around my bed 
Ghosts can laugh but they're already dead 
I'm not dying and I'm far from gone 
The blues man spent his candle but his pain lives on
