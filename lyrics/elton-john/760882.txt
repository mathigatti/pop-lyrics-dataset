I spy headlines, newsprint tells lies
Tell me what the papers say
Save lives don't drive, everybody's got to die someday
At least that's what the papers say


Coal mines closed down
Nobody's working underground today
More jails, peace for sale
Japanese still killing whales
Teen dreams
On two inch screens
Lipstick boys all look like queens
Least that's what the papers say

I spy headlines, newsprint tells lies
Tell me what the papers say
Save lives don't drive, everybody's got to die someday
Least that's what the papers say

Dope and pills, guns kill
Death just buys cheap thrills
Coal mines, closed down
Nobody's working underground today

Teen dreams, on two inch screens
Lipstick boys all look like queens
Least that's what the papers say
