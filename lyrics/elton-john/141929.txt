When the money's gone, will you be my friend
Float a small row boat till the ship comes in
When the winter nights chill us to the soul
Will you feed the fire, spin the straw to gold
When the money's gone


When the money's gone, will you get cold feet
Will you still be there if the ends don't meet
Till we're in the red just forget the green
Take a bus with me, no more limousines
When the money's gone

Will you still want me
All it ever was
Will you still love me, will you want me

Oh what a fine life I give to you
All you ever want
Will you still be there
Will you pull me through when the cash don't come
And if you're mine
Will you still love me wherever we fall
When the money's gone

Oh will you want me baby
Oh will you need me baby
Oh will you love me baby
When the money's gone

When the money's gone, no more caviar
Will you eat fast food in a beat up car
Live life modestly, lost in lotto dreams
Will you find your way through it all with me
Through it all with me
Will you still love me
All it ever was
Will you still want me, will you want me

And a mile off the shore
Flies a bird who'll land no more
And as the tide pulls the sea
So you always will pull me forever more
