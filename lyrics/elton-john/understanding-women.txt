Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Available on the album The One


Rolling over trying to sleep
And understanding women
Thinking of you out there somewhere
Looking for a new beginning

Just let me be the final word
In the book we haven't written
I won't be another page
In understanding women


I could drive to Mexico
On understanding women
Throw myself against the waves
And answer up to heaven


How come her heart's so stubborn
And what's so wrong with giving
Ask the big sky talking
About understanding women


And I'm not just anyone who ever stood outside your door
And I'm not any man you've ever known before
Don't judge this picture by the frame
Every man is not the same
Some men reach beyond the pain
