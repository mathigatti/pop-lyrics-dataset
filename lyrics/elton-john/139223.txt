Oh I've been staying up nights
Thinking about a long flight that could take me home
Or a slow train rolling
Or a big boat floating out there on that lonely ocean


I'm not the man I was
I guess the dark side lost and the sun broke through
I thought I knew it all
I was the next big thing until I thought about you

Oh I was reaching for the stars
When I wasn't even touching you
I was lying to myself, I needed no one's help
thought I was living proof

When there's one set of footsteps
No one's gonna fill your shoes
Now I'm looking in the mirror
At a big man in a little suit

I'm a big man in a little suit
It's tight on me, hard on you
It's a short cut but it's a long way home
When you think you can make it on you own

You think you're bulletproof
But what you really are
Is a big man in a little suit

I was part of the chain
A face with no name in a place with no soul
By a thief in the night
I was robbed of the light and left nothing, nothing to hold

I've turned my back on a world like that
I want to get back to loving you
Give me one more chance
Won't you warm the hands of this cold headed fool
