I knew from the first night I met you
Something just wasn't quite right
Looked like an innocent stranger
But something was just out of sight


How could I know that you would use me
Fill out some plan of your own
I couldn't have known you'd abuse me
Leave me here hurt and alone

chorus
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
I know you could be just like you should
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good

I only saw what I wanted to see
You were a dream in my mind
I didn't know how you really could be
It didn't take long for me to find

I guess that it's my fault for seeing
Only what I wanted to see
I couldn't know you would be
A player just acting for me

[repeat chorus]

I knew from the first night I met you
Something just wasn't quite right
Looked like an innocent stranger
But something was just out of sight
