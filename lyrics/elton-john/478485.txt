I'd say when Heaven falls
I'll be the war you never fought
I will protect you after all
My very own


And with a silent prayer
I'd run through city streets and bare
My soul from cold grey stone
For this love

I have in my desire
A will to walk through any fire
And I will stand by you
When winters come

chorus:
And rise, rise above it
Take hold and take comfort
Cause things only get better with love
Break out the shadows, look to tomorrow
Cause things only get better with love

I came just for you
A wall around the living proof
No one can tear it down
Or break on through

Under a crimson sky
A soul bathed in the healing tide
No mortal leans on life
Like me to you

I have in my desire
A will to walk through any fire
And I will stand by you
When winters come

[repeat chorus]

Laughter is better with love
Mothers live better with love
Teach your children love
Shower the world with love

Laughter is better with love
Mothers live better with love
Teach your children love
Shower the world with love

[repeat chorus]


[repeat chorus]

Laughter gets better with love
Mothers live better with love
Teach your children love
Shower the world with love...
