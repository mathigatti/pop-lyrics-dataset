And every time I get to thinking
Every thought of you I want to shout aloud
Then I think about the love I have inside me
How you brought what's inside out


Now love's made it to the outside
I want to tell the world of everthing I've found
Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me
You turned my living upside down

And I can't tell the bottom from the top
Am I standing on my head or on my heels
Is it cloudy, is it bright
Is it day or is it night
Am I wrong or am I right
And is it real

Tell me where you learned the magic
The spell you used the day you made me fall
Maybe now I know that love is no illusion
I'm upside down but ten feet tall

On and on I've drifted with the tide
I didn't know that love could move me so
You fed my life with love and much more besides
And you showed me which way to go
