The sister of sunlight
Comes to my lonely life
Bearing the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife
And the anchor told me
If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her


All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains

Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leaving me standing
On a road leading through

All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains
