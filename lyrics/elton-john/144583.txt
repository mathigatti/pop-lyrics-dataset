I am here to tell you
We can never meet again
Simple really, isn't it
A word or two and then
A lifetime of not knowing
Where or how, or why, or when
You think of me, or speak of me
Or wonder what befell
The someone you once loved
So long ago, somewhere


Never wonder what I feel
As living shuffles by
You don't have to ask me
And I need not reply
Every moment of my life
From now until I die
I will think or dream of you
And fail to understand
How a perfect love
Can be confounded out of hand

Is it written in the stars?
Are we paying for some crime?
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time?
Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say?
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day?

Nothing can be altered
There is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart
Nor any place to hide

You are all I'll ever want
But this I am denied
Sometimes, in my darkest thoughts
I wish I'd never learned
What it is to be in love
And have that love returned

Is it written in the stars?
Are we paying for some crime?
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time?
Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say?
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day?

Is it written in the stars?
Are we paying for some crime?
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time?
Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say?
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day?
