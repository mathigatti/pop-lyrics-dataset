We are still all right 
We took it on the chin 
But in the thirteenth hour 
No one ever wins 
But we're strong enough 
Like traffic all tied up 
And when the static clears 
The radios still buzz 


And I stop and I breathe 
'Cause you wanted me 
And I wanted you so bad 
And I stop and I breathe 
'Cause I still believe 
No one really knows what it is that we have 

Like blood in a vein 
We chased this one down 
And in the darkest long night 
We turned it all around 

And it was coal-dusted snow 
That covered the fields 
But the corn it still grew 
And the injury healed 

And I stop and I breathe 
'Cause you wanted me 
And I wanted you so bad 
And I stop and I breathe 
'Cause I still believe 
No one really knows what it is that we have 

And I stop and I breathe 
'Cause you wanted me 
And I wanted you so bad 
And I stop and I breathe 
'Cause I still believe 
No one really knows what it is that we have
