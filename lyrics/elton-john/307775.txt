I've been beaming aboard her for a light year
From a strange craft
She's got a subtle touch on the silver key
To a clockwork heart


I am your robot, I am your robot
I am your robot man
I am your robot, I am your robot
I am your robot man

You went and flipped the switch and turned me positive
When I was negative
I've been stumbling around like a metal man
On the graveyard shift

I am your robot and I'm programmed to love you
My serial number is 44357
