This is my house
This is were I live
That is the winter
Those are the trees
I can hear them breathe
This is my bed
This is were I sleep
That was the dark
Those are my dreams
They belong to me


This is my floor
This is where I lie
This is a square room
That was a bright light
These are not my eyes
What is my soul?
Where is my tired heart?
That is the question
Where is the answer?
Inside my house

And I sit by the window
And I wish I was rain
I want to fall from the sky
I want to get wet all over the rain

'Cause this is my house
It belongs to me
Inside my head
It's all that's left
This is my house
This is my bed
This is where I sleep
That was the dark
Those are my dreams
They belong to me

This is my house
This is my house
This is my house
Yeah, this is my house
This is my house
This is my house
This is my house
