If I wasn't born to love you, why was I born at all?
If I wasn't meant to hold you, what are these two arms for?
If I can't protect you, what are these muscles for?
If I can't enrich your life, I might as well be poor
If I couldn't see you naked, I might as well be blind
If I couldn't treat you right, wouldn't I be so unkind?


And you were made for me
You were made for me
You weren't born to be alone
And you were made for me

You were made for me
You were made for me
Flesh and bone, it's etched in stone
That you were made for me

If I couldn't translate fantasy, imagine how I'd feel
If I couldn't hear your secret, my ears would both be sealed
And if I can't make love to you, this body has no use
If you believe I loved you, you wouldn't need no proof
And if I can't return to you, I wouldn't need my legs to run
And if I can't draw warmth from you, why do I need this sun?
