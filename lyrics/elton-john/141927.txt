I'm very low but not too dim
I can still see the faces of you and him
I remember well how it used to be
You remember too obviously


Remember when, remember when I was Tealby Abbey then
It was not so long ago maybe a hundred years or so
When I was Tealby Abbey
That's a long long time ago
When I was Tealby Abbey
That's a long long time ago

When the clock stopped and the rocks dropped
And the gravel started giving away
I can still recall when we were small
But oh what a fateful day

In younger times, children climb
Up and down your walls
And a curse on the day the fates will say
When Tealby Abbey falls
