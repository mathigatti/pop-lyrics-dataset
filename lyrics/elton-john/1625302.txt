Lady luck and four leaf clovers
Won't ease this hurt I feel all over
My life was one special occasion
`Til your leaving dampened the situation


Well well well
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
Girl you better throw me a life preserver
`Cause I'm about to drown in my own tears

Well well well
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Well well well
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Well well well
Standing on shakey ground
Shaking, shakey ground
Standing, standing
Standing on shakey ground
