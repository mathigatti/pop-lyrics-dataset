She slid down to the city limits
Monkey time in fifteen minutes
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.
Don't let me down
Please stick around
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.


Strobe light on funky feet,
Soul children in the disco heat.
Top dog, top cat,
Move that muscle and shake that fat.
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.

Chicago, L.A.
Everyplace, everyway
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.

Illinois, Santa Fe,
Do do do do do do do what I say
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
