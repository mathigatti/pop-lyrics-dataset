Every breath is a prayer of some kind
I breathe in, I breathe out, I just breathe
And you're so well, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me


Like swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful again

Don't you know where you go? I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
Kind of blue of all the blues I need

Yesterday did someone else's song
In sixty-five summertime, don't let go
Long before you came, blue wonderful
The blue wonderful I know

Ain't just something I just left behind
In the past, far away, used to be
But your presence, my blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me

Go where you want, when you want to
Just don't let the wind tear you free
Stick around the light that brings you home
Don't ever hang around with the breeze

Don't you know where you go? I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
Kind of blue of all the blues I need

Every breath is a prayer of some kind
I breathe in, I breathe out, I just breathe
And you're so well, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me

Like swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful again

I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful, again
