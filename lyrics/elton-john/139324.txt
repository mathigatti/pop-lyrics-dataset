Never thought I'd miss you
When you said goodbye
Never thought I'd see the day
That I break down and cry
Won't you come on back to me
Back where you belong


'Cause I get a little bit lonely baby
Lonely and blue missing you
I get a little bit lonely baby
If you ever come back, gonna be true

Oh I know I hurt you
Couldn't you forgive
For I know without you
It's impossible to live
I want you back in my arms again
Back where you belong

Come on baby
Let's forgive and forget
And even though things are bad
I'm gonna get you yet
