Oh no I don't want it
You can take it all
I'll put my money where my mouth is
Put your suitcase in the hall


Oh you robbed me blind
Of what little hope remained
You put a gun to my head
A bullet through my brain

You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains

Just as long as you're around
We live on borrowed time
I'll put my money where my mouth is
You're guilty at the scene of the crime

I never say more than I need
The mystery runs deep
The dangers buried below
The secrets that you keep

You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains
