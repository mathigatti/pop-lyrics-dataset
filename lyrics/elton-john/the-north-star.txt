Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
released as a b-side in 2001




You can't always count on the prayers in your sleep
But this cold light's still killing me
If I pay the ransom
Well can they guarantee
To split the chains, slip the knots
I don't know if they'll ever set you free

I just can't rely on all these twisted signs
Too many bright lights turn you blind
The history of the blues
Seems to swim in your eyes
Pick yourself up, throw your head back
Take a long, long look into the sky

Are you out there, are you listening
Am I'm coming across to you
Is the North Star still shining
In the sky outside your room
You can listen but they're lying
Don't let them tell you
What you've always known
It's the North Star that's the big one
And it's always gonna lead you home

Can't always agree on all my dumb ideas
I'm still looking for a way out of here
You can value what you want
But you pay for change
There's full moons, cold lifeless nights
And tumbled stars spell out your name

Close your eyes, take a ride
Think of everytime that you
missed your opp
click your heels, see how it feels
Something so childish
Sometimes seems so real
