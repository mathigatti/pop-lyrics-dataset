I can't go on living without you, oh no
I once said I could go on without your love
I would be strong but things have changed and heaven's above
I know that I need you more than I did before


I can't go on living without you, oh no my love
I can't go on living without you, oh no my love
I can't go on living without you, oh no

If you could see the state I'm in you'd never know
That it was the same old me that told you to go
I've never been happy since I walked out on you

You know that I've missed you more than anything at all
If there's any way to get you back I'll try it
I won't deny it, I'm lonely for you girl
