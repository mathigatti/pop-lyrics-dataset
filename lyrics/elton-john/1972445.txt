It's a long long journey
When you're on your own
It's a long long way to travel
When you're all alone
So be careful and you'll find
That you're sure to make good time
'Cause your home
Is the best place you can go


I'm going home, going home
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm feeling tired, sad and all alone
I'm going home, going home

Don't you try and stop me
I made up my mind
I have been to many places
Where they treated me unkind
So be careful and you'll find
That you're sure to make good time
'Cause your home
Is the best place that I know

I'm going home, going home
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm feeling tired, sad and all alone
I'm going home, going home

It's a long late evening
And not far to go
You have traveled many miles
But it's nice to know
You're careful, you'll find
That you always make good time
Good time
To the best place you can go

I'm going home, going home
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm feeling tired, sad and all alone
I'm going home, going home

I'm going home, going home
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm feeling tired, sad and all alone
I'm going home, going home
