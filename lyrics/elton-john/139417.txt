I fell in love with you one September
Between the ashes and the dying embers
What happened to our dreams
Nothing so it seems
But I fell in love with you
Remember


If the phone forgets to ring this evening
And I'm left dazed and gazing at the ceiling
Be sure to understand
The future's in your hands
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Remember

I've loved enough to know
When I'm without a reason in hand
Oh there's little doubt
I've loved enough to be sure
I've loved enough to know the reason has gone
There's little doubt the season has gone
When I was young and so secure

I wrote to you of romance made in heaven
My words were touched with guilt, my sentences uneven
What happened to the line
I repeated time and time
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
Remember, remember
