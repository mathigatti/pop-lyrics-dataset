There's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still were often told
Seek and we shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain girl I have in mind


Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet
She's the big affair, I cannot forget
Only girl I ever think of with regret...

I would like to add her initials to my monogram
Tell me where is the shipped
For this lost lamb

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who watch over me

Well, I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although she may not be the girl
Some men think of as handsome
To my heart she carries the key

Won't you tell her, please,
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need...
Someone to watch over me...
Someone to watch over me... 

It's very clear 
Our love is here to stay
Not for a year 
But ever and a day

The radio and the telephone 
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies, 
And in time may go

But, oh my dear, 
Our love is here to stay
Together we're 
We're going a long, long way

In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

But, oh my dear, 
Our love is here to stay
Together we're 
We're going a long, long way

In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Our love is here to
Our love is here to stay
