Hey armadillo what you doing in the garden
Slumbering and spherical, you're always hanging around
Leather on the outside but a delicate interior
Very like a lot of human beings I have found


Hey armadillo I can't tell which way you're facing
Maybe that's a good thing, maybe you don't even know
No one's gonna bother you if they can't find your front end
There again I guess you find your love life rather slow

In the armadillo circle
In that armour-plated set
The philosophy is simple
What you see ain't what you get
In the armadillo culture
In that well-protected creed
A solid hide to hide in
Is the only thing you need
Hey armadillo

Hey armadillo what you doing in the desert
Is a life of burrowing the answer to it all
What I would give to leave my problems six feet underground
And always be the perfect shape to be, and have, a ball

In the armadillo circle
In that armour-plated set
The philosophy is simple
What you see ain't what you get
In the armadillo culture
In that well-protected creed
A solid hide to hide in
Is the only thing you need
Hey armadillo
Hey armadillo
