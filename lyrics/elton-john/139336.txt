I didn't mean to hurt you
You know it's just my way
Those things that I said yesterday
Were things I shouldn't say
Although you're blue
Just one thing I want you to do
Just forget all those things
That I said about you


`Cause I've been loving you baby
Loving you baby for a long time
And if you go away
I just won't know what to do

Yes I've been loving you baby
Loving you baby for a long time
And you know in your heart
That I'll always worship you

I couldn't bear to see you go
Oh no no no no
So don't you feel sad
It's not the thing to do
Because I worry
If I know you're feeling blue
Please put your tears away
So nobody can see
`Cause the last thing I want
Is for you to cry over me
