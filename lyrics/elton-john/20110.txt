He died when the house was empty,
When the maid had gone.
He put a pen to paper for one final song.
He wrote-
'Oh babe, it's the only way.
I know it's wrong but I can't stand
To go on living, to go on living, living life ths way.


And I don't know what the time is,
Or what the next line is.
Or how you're going to take the news.
But if I had my life again.
Ooh ooh
I wouldn't change a thing.
I'd let nobody - I'd let nobody
Stand inside my shoes.

Oh something's gotten hold of me,
This home is not the home it used to be.
I've gathered dust like the dying flowers,
And I've drunk myself sober - oh oh
After hours and hours.'
