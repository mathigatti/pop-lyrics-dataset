I'm a simple man with a simple dream
In a far from simple time
And I payed the price of the road I chose
But at least the choice was mine


And the times I get the feeling
That the journey's end is near
But I prefer to die with my head held high
Than to live my life in fear

I'm a simple man from a time gone by
Growing cold and old alone
There's a time to run and a time to hide
And a time to head for home

To forgive and be forgiven
If it's the last thing I can do
Then in death's release I may find the peace
That in life I never knew

'Cause I'm a simple man with a simple dream
I may never see come true
