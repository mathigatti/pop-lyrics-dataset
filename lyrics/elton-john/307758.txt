Suzie walks her dog but it don't solve
All the mysteries
Hanging with the guys, making with the guys
Playing hard to please


Back in '63, she was made for me
We were having fun
Wasn't long before I could not ignore
She's about hanging out
Campus queen dreams shattered years ago
And I'm the one who knows

It's the same country love song
Different words, a different melody
It's the same country love song

Mama said to me, John you got to be
Honest to yourself
Keeping up the pace, losing in the race
Further on the shelf

I want to write a country love song, tell them nothing's wrong
Suzie did my heart
There is nothing more, something said before
C'est la vie, mon cherie
Lady Luck, me and sexy so-and-so
And I'm the one who knows
