It looked a lot like the same old thing
I've seen so many times
She was aging fast like a bandit
Born to a life of crime
Meanwhile he held his crown and watched her fall
Just bouncing her around like a rubber ball


Through her washed up eyes she could see
That the ties on her prince were gone
He turned the radio off when they played
What he once had called their song
Well the crystal didn't clink but they drink up more
And when he stayed out late she knew what he stayed out for

Love's so cold when you're growing old and your looks are gone
Love's so cold when your hands don't dance where they once belonged
If he's heading down to the red light and the local bar
Love's so cold when he shoots an arrow through your heart
Love's so cold when he shoots an arrow through your heart

Due to natural causes she became distorted and she tried to leave
But the winning team had an Ace or two up a crooked sleeve
For he knew that her age wouldn't help her get along
And that's what made his hold on her so strong
