Without you, I no longer swim upstream
Where are you when I try to fill the spaces in between?
The red letter days and all the pain
And while I remain shipwrecked everything has changed


And I fall apart
With this threat of indecision
Hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely
When the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time
When I fall apart

Can't you tell the shadows no longer comfort me
I don't feel the need to cling to anyone I see
This fool's suffered gladly each and every day
I don't wish to reconsider, I wish they'd stay away

I've no care to count the stares that pity me
I'll wash your hurt away just you wait and see
For every rose you give her I'll give her three
But in the meantime I'll just wish that she was me
