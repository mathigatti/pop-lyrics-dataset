It's closing time the boys are all together at the bar
Staring in their glasses
Looks like another layoff at the yard


Yesterday I heard union hall come down
They hit it with a wrecking ball
And they try but nothing changes in this town

Cap in hand stood in line
Your family ties are the chains that bind
The endless wheel goes round and round
Chances are you'll never leave this town

Oh oh no

Like a river now the empty streets are flooded out with
rain
It's falling on the playground
While the kids get wet playing the same old games

Locked away so many things remind them of war
They tap the pavement with their canes
The good old days ain't so good no more
