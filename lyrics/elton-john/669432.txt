For our world, the circle turns again
Throughout the year, it seems the seasons change
It's meant a lot to me to start a new
Oh, the winters cold, but I'm so warm with you
Out there there's not a sound to be heard
And the seasons seem to sleep upon their words
As the waters freeze up with the summer's end
Ain't it funny how young lovers start as friends
Yes, it's funny how young lovers start as friends
