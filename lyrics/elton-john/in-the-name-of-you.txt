Got a penny in my pocket
And a dollar in my hand
But I'll drop it in your tin cup
Cause you were a one man band
If I could make a million
On some TV show
On the roulette wheel
In a great big casino


I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you

I got my favorite hat
With that snakeskin band
When you need a little shake
I've put it in your hands
To the bottom of the ocean
I would surely dive
To find the oldest oyster
With the biggest pearl inside

I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you

I'd claim a confront
I'd claim a tune
All the undiscovered territory
Out there beyond the moon
