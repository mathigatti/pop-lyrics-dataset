There is still a little love left for me in your heart
Even though it seems to you that we are far apart
You can turn your eyes to other guys, ignore me on the street
But don't forget it's bound to show if we should ever meet


And there is still a little love left for me in your heart
You can use a little love to make a brand new start
For no matter how you try
you just cannot deny
There is still a little love in your heart

But you're far too proud to say what's on your mind
I can read you like a story book, do you think I'm blind
For every place I seem to be, you seem to be there too
Standing in the wings of love and waiting for your cue
