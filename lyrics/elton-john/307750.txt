I came down here just to waste some time
To get a little rest and to ease my mind
I didn't calculate it when I walked in the door
I only thought I'd stay for a minute or more


First I saw the lights on the ceiling dim
The stale perfume yeah, and ___________
My first impression was to get outside
But then I saw you crying, crying by the fireside

The pendulum swings
Goig to and fro
And the clock goes round
Says it's time to go
And the clock goes round
And the hours fly past
Slow down pendulum you're moving much too fast

Now it's gone kind of quiet but I seem to see
That the only people here in the room are you and me
But I don't mind girl, girl that's all right
As long as you're gonna be with me, gonna be with me all night
