Is it you
Running around with someone who is new
I love you
You can be sure of everything I do


If you're feeling lonely
If you're feeling blue
Is it you
Is it you

Is it you
I can be sure that you have someone new
Oh I knew
You can be sure of everything I do

If you're ever lonely
To a heart that's true
Is it you
Is it you...

If you want somebody
Who loves you through and through
I want you
I need you
Is it you
Is it you...
