I lived in a tenement six floors above
I lent you my records and I lent you my love
But you left me on the weekend without a by-your-leave
That's a dirty and a low-down trick
My folks all think you're mean


But I don't mind, that's kind of nifty
You always set those break-ups in the movies
And just like a light honey you put me out
Now I'm gonna do my best
To get you back in the nest you came from

You can erase me if you want to
Turn your back in other men
But whenever you're ready
Honey, we'll go steady again

It's nasty without you in my little room
I miss you like crazy, please come back soon
I was joking with those things I said
I couldn't have been thinking
If you don't come back I think I'll crack
Just like my old ceiling
