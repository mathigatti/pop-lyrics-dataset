Just got the price in my pocket for a one course meal
My shoes are tilting over to an angle at the heel
I should be feeling sorry for myself and I may
But I've got a little happiness, I know she's gone away


Sara's coming back to me, yes she is
To take away my suffering and pain
Sara's coming back to me, yes she is
To show me that the good times will be here once again

She's got the face of an angel and a heart made of gold
She's got me feeling like a spy that came in from the cold
Now I can shout about it, that's the way that I feel
'Cause Sara's coming back to me, she's coming back for real

Now I know that I wasn't very kind to her before
'Cause I was staying out at night, I guess it made her sore
And there were times that I thought she'd left me for good
But she wrote to me this morning, and she said she never could
