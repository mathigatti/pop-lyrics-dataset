Figuring out where I went wrong
The script not followed, then was awfully long
Too much pluck, too little of
The acting right, not acting up
I wore the world upon my back
Though someone else could meet, pick up the slack
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way


Now I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinking 'bout
Time is wasted looking back

Now I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

You drop a bucket in a well
It's dark and deep down there
Crank the handle, bring it up
The water, crystal clear

I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground
I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Looking up, looking up
Looking up, looking up
