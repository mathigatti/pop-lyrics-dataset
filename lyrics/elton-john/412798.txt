She threw back that shiny hair 
Like the mane on a Delta queen 
Gonna spend my last dime on a telephone call 
'Cause she's the wildest thing I've ever seen 
She was just plain mister once 
Got herself fixed up real good 
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free 
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood 


Now they call her the cat 
And that's a stone fact 
They took a little of this 
She got a little of that 
Now Billy got a kitty 
He got something to scratch 
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat 

She just does that double act 
She got Babs and Joan down pat 
She got hips like Mick, she's a Rolling Stone 
Never seen a woman shake like that 

She was just plain mister once 
Got herself fixed up real good 
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free 
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood 

Now they call her the cat 
And that's a stone fact 
They took a little of this 
She got a little of that 
Now Billy got a kitty 
He got something to scratch 
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat 

She's so fine that the water line 
Don't separate hot and cold 
She got stitched up bitchy by an old M.D.
Now she's headed out to Hollywood or so I'm told 

Now they call her the cat 
And that's a stone fact 
They took a little of this 
She got a little of that 
Now Billy got a kitty 
He got something to scratch 
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat 

And that's a stone fact 
They took a little of this 
She got a little of that 
Now Billy got a kitty 
He got something to scratch 
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat
