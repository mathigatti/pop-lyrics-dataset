If you feel that it's real I'm on trial
And I'm here again in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with that treason


Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me a to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger

Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger

Well I know he's not old
And I'm told he's a virgin
For he may be she
But what I'm told is never for certain
