On a bench, on the beach
Just before the sun had gone
I tried to reach you
Plain faced and falling fast
You looked so vacant like an empty shell
Whose life had passed upon the ocean


Before light shook the sky
Down by the docks I saw
The masts unfolding
Don't turn away, please, understand
It's a life and a living
And a way to keep the wolves away
From hungry hands, from hungry hands

Crazy water
Takes my fishing boat on Monday morning
Dangerous dreaming
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing
Oh, we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy water

Tangled lives, lonely wives
Shoreline widows pray
For the souls of missing whalers
Endless nights on an endless sea
Where nothing lives between us
Just the breakers on the ocean
Separating you and me
Separating you and me
