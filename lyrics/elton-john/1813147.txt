You stare through a tunnel of
Solid wall that should be broken down
And you can't see the field of green
Has been turned into a raging battleground
And you'll live with the consequence
Tell me why don't you understand
You'll destroy all the love that's been created
Be a miser with an empty hand
And it's all such a simple thing
Changing everything
Listen to the one who brings all this love to you


Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Don't you care, stop and think about us and what you feel
I'll be there, don't you cut yourself off from what is real
Don't live in some other world
You don't live in some other world

There's a boat bound for paradise
If you hurry you can ride it back
'Cause once the bait hits the water
It don't take long 'till the sharks attack
Oh but it's all such a simple thing
Change is everything
Let me be the one who brings all this love to you

Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Don't you care, stop and think about us and what you feel
I'll be there, don't you cut yourself off from what is real
Don't live in some other world, in some other world
Oh you don't live in some other world, in some other world
Got to stop living in some other world

Let me help you with a change of mind
And it's all such a simple thing
Changing everything
Listen to the one who brings all this love to you

This is our world, not some other world
You don't live in some other world
Live in our world, not some other world
You don't live in some other world
