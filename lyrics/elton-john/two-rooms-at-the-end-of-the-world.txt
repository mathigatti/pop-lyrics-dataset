Through a mutual agreement, we got that aching feeling
To look up one another one more time
Tracking down the zip codes
Sealing down those envelopes
Lack of communication on the telephone line


But don't judge us by distance
Or the difference between us
Try to look at it with an open mind
For where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

Well, we've both ridden the wagon bit the tail off the dragon
Borne our swords like steel knights on the highway
Washing down the dirt roads
Hosing off our dirty clothes
Coming to terms with the times that we couldn't, but we tried

Where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

Door to door, they would whisper, will they ever get together
Their rooms are different temperatures, I'm told
There's a change in their thinking
And their habits seem uneven
But together, the two of them were mining gold
