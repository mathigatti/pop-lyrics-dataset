I got home today
Took a look around
Trying to find that girl of mine
She could not be found


All her things were gone
She just left a note
It don't take no mastermind
To figure what she wrote

And she said dear John I'm moving on
By this time I'm gonna be long gone
Dear John c'est la vie
Dear John so long
You've seen the last of me

I don't want her back
I won't even try
This time ain't just au revoir
This time it's goodbye

We could not go on
Living like we were
I was just about to write
A Dear John note to her

I was gonna say
Dear John I'm moving on
By this time I'm gonna be long gone
Dear John c'est la vie
Dear John so long
You've seen the last of me
