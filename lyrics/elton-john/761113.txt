It's just like Noah's ark
There's two of every kind
Pretty girls and boys in drag
Walking a fine thin line
Shaking hands and bussing cheeks
Licking their lips like they could eat
Me alive in a couple of weeks
Yea just like Noah's ark


Italiano promotion men
Chomping a big cigar
Slapping backs and making cracks
About the fags in the bar
Radio boss dipping his nose in a little white packet
You put it out son and we'll all back it
Yea it's just like Noah's ark

chorus:
And the waves are crashing round us
But we're ready for the flood
And we don't need a sign like an olive branch
In the beak of a snow white dove
We're not as dumb as we might look
You can't keep us in the dark
With me and you it's two by two just like Noah's ark

These four walls have seen
The Cockettes and the Casters
From San Francisco to Ohio
I've seen beauty and disaster
Cocky young roosters and little chicks
Flashing smiles, shaking them hips
Trying to hook it up for the late night shift
Here in Noah's ark

[repeat chorus]

And we wrote it as we saw it from the centre of the stage
All access to the liars who claim they wrote a page
But for every tiny dancer there's a dog that's had its day
The truth is never quite the same as what the papers say

[repeat chorus]
