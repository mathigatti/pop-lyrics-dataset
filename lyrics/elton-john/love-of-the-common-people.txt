Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can we do


Tears from your little sister
Crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch for the party to go
Oh but you know she'll get by


'Cause she's living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Momma's gonna love her just as much as she can
And she can


It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'll lose it in the snow on the ground
Out walking your dog to find a job


Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
You better go home where it's warm


You can live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Momma's gonna love her just as much as she can
And she can


Living on dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
You can take them in stride, for family pride


You know that faith in your foundation
And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
And don't forget to pray
Making you strong where you belong


Where you can live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Momma's gonna love her just as much as she can
