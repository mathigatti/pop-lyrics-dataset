Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving
He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling
He called you his child, said: Honey get wise to his game
He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same
There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go West on that bus


And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
Gonna go West to the sea
The greyhound is swaying
And the radio is playing
Some blues for baby and me

And the highway looks like it never did
Lord it looks so sweet and so free
And I can't forget that trip to the West
Singing blues for baby and me

Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise
It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky
I called you my child, said: Honey now this is our game
There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again
There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go West on that bus
