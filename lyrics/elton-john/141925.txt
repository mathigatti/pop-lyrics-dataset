She may be lost
She may be out of bounds
All her tenderness and charms could be something
A man like me has never found
But in her woman's way
She's still a little girl
The things that she wants, the things that she needs
Oh, well, the choice is hers


'Cause you can't take a woman
When she doesn't want you
And you can't be a man
If you're blind to reason
Man might be strong
But true love is stronger
You gotta play it straight
When a woman doesn't want you

Her voice invites
Her eyes say more than words
But her needs and complications
Can tear away the memory of last night's girl
And if you're weak
Yeah, we're all weak sometime
The best things can wait
The best times they come
Oh, when strength is kind

And if you can't read her
Leave her alone
And if you don't know by now
She's not someone's prize
And you can't take her home
