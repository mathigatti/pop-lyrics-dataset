There's a picture in the nursery of a well known soldier man
And he wants to be like father when he grows up if he can
His eyes survey the floorboards with his soldiers around him
But fear not for the future, you will climb the highest mountain


So Regimental Sergeant Zippo
Stand up to attention will you
Hear the bugle sounding in the morning call up rising
So your cowboy castle is standing
You're the one who is commanding
Watch them march along the landing down the stairs

Just a small boy in a small boy's world
And small boys do strange things
He likes to see the match sticks fly
And hear the cannons ring
For his eider down, his battle field
And in his dreams his fights are real
Until the field is won, aim, fire the guns
