I want to be your honey man
I want to be, I want to be your honey man
To wash your clothes and hold your hand
I want to be, I want to be your honey man


You've got a lot
But all of your money and stuff
Just isn't enough to buy what I can give
When things get rough
And all of your friendliest friends
Are turning to dust

We will live
You know I'll give you the world
I'll sacrifice girl anything
I'll do it all on my own, believe me
