Oh, the perfect love

Happiness comes when most unexpected
When nothing and no one seems true
So many promises broken
But I feel certain of you
Certain as night and day
You keep my ambitions alive
Though you don't have to stay
If you go I can never survive


The perfect love
Will probably never exist
But you are as close as it gets and I won't resist
The perfect love
Has never proven to be
But you are as close as it gets when you're close to me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, the perfect love

Out on our own in a furious world
We chase any dream, any star
Nothing can harm us, we are immortal
Innocent fools that we are
Sometimes our confidence dies
But I won't mind at all
I see my dreams coming true in your eyes

The perfect love
Will probably never exist
But you are as close as it gets and I won't resist
The perfect love
Has never proven to be
But you are as close as it gets when you're close to me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
The perfect love

The perfect love
Will probably never exist
But you are as close as it gets and I won't resist
The perfect love
Has never proven to be
But you are as close as it gets when you're close to me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
The perfect love
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
The perfect love
