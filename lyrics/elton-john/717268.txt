Elton John  - 20th Century Blues 


Twentieth century blues are getting me down
Blues, escape those dreary twentieth century blues
Why, if theres a God in the sky, why shouldnt he grin
High above this dreary twentieth century din



In this strange illusion, chaos and confusion
People seem to lose their way
What is there to strive for, love or keep alive for
Say, hey hey, call it a day


Blues, nothing to win or to lose, its getting me down
Blues, escape those weary twentieth century blues


Why is it that civilized humanity can make this world so wrong
In this hurly-burly of insanity, our dreams cannot last long
Weve reached a deadline, a press headline, every sorrow
Blues value is news value tomorrow
