Talk of making love
Take your time
To bluff your way to stay
Let me use your eyes
Please don't amuse with words that cut me down to size
With your lovely mind
Never taking time
To treat a man so kind


You remain to me a vision of sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty

Do I need to say
That I'm wiser with surprise for borrowing your eyes
Morning sets the scene
The more you stay the more you go away from me it seems

With your lovely mind
Never taking time
To treat a man so kind

You remain to me a vision of sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
