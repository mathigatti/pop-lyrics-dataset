You say today was not so easy
Pleasure tends to get the best of you
Well don´t let them break your spirit
Keep the faith and you will come on through
And I'll head home for the weekend
You've tired and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the frontsteps baby when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands


And slip into my soul glove
Pull it on we got a tight fit
Never take it off
And, baby, if the seam's rough
And, honey, if the skin's soft
You and me we go together
Oh, like a soul glove
Look at me don't you believe me
Cheating hangs a noose around your neck
To shave in someone else's mirror
Is one desire I haven't dreamed of yet
But I'll head home for the weekend
You´ve tried and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the frontsteps, baby, when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands

And slip into my soul glove
Pull it on we got a tight fit
Oh, never take it off
And, baby, if the seam's rough
And, honey, if the skin's soft
You and me we go together
Oh, like a soul glove

Won't you slip into my soul glove
Pull it on we got a tight fit
Oh, never take it off
Baby, baby, baby, if the seam's rough
Honey, honey, if the skin's soft
You and me we go together
We go together like a soul glove
(Fit)
We go together
Oh, we go together like a soul glove
Pull it on we got a tight fit
We go together
Baby, baby, baby soul glove soul glove
