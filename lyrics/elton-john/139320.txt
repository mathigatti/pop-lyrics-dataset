This house that I live in has no reason
This house that I sleep in has no purpose
It has a bed and a few old chairs
Three flights up, two flights of stairs
But it has no reason


Then someone shot through the tyre swing
The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring
And the ivy that hung now sadly clings
To a dying season

And I cry at night when the lights go out
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies
And when the lights go out it's tought to survive

This man holds a hand that shows a tremble
This man that I live in bears his faults
He has a heart and a well worn soul
Ten years a slave to Rock And Roll
But he has to tremble

For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn
Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn
And just like your love that's come and gone
It goes on breathing
