Ice thaws the sun when autumn comes
And Bristol trips and bugy rides are over
And the nucleus of everyone has disappeared
As winter holds my shoulder


So put on your make-up
Make up to me now
Kick off your sand-shoes
Throw them in the sea now
It's the season of the rain

You wear your big hat
I'll wear my check cap
Throw up your string bags
Into the old trap
It's the season of the rain
And I gotta get home
I wanna go home again

Castles in the country
See the maids of air
Rambling fires and canopies contain us
And the waters of the countryside
Wash away our cares
Leave the city lights behind us
