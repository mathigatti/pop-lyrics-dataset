Do you want to drive to ride mount on your pony
Loosen up my tie to help me breathe
Insisting that I pay my alimony
Each and every day is the same old scene


Come on do the roll, do the roll with me
Come on do the roll, do the roll with me
I said honey, I said honey
I said honey, I said honey
Come on do the honey roll with me

Well I want to say that I'm your mister funky
Singing this song is taking up your time
I did the donkey now I'm your funky monkey
Sing it children, sing it on your mind
