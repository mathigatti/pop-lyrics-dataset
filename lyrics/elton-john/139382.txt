We look at the table
And we look at the time
We see a short fuse burning
We're standing on a land mine


You look at the cold soup
I look at the grey wall
I see a red flag burning
Yeah, man we need a Santa Claus

Down on the homeless avenue
Down among the rocks and stones
The cradle falls but the buck stops here
Let's think about their hearts and bones

And we all need a medicine man
All need a medicine man
Don't we need a medicine man
His shake and his rattle and his helping hand

See the meat of a nation
On the back of a truck
I think we're waste in a dumpster
Hey sorry kid it's tough luck

She was adorable
And he was a good boy
They were inseparable
Yeah bitten by the cold war

Rags on the shapes of millions
Tears among the cuts and blows
The backbone snaps and the kids can't dance
Let's think about their hearts and bones
