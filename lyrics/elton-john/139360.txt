I may not seem your ideal when you look into my eyes
I don't smoke, I don't tell jokes, I'm not the custom made size
But baby let me take you out on the highway for a while
I'll show yow where the man in me is when he doesn't hide
Well he's cruising in the fast lane, stuck behind the wheel
Jekyll and Hyde going on inside when I'm your automobile


Let me be your car for a while child
Shift me into gear and I'll be there
Fill me up with five star gasoline girl
I'll be your car, I'll take you anywhere

Let me be your car, come on and drive me
I'm a speedy little boy down deep inside
I got bucket seats and two speed window cleaners
Just let me be your car, oh come on and ride

I can't dance, I don't dig it, I can't see it at all
You say I'm just a specimen, and baby I can crawl
Well my physique don't look the way the physiques really should
But then again I've got an engine underneath my hood

When I'm cutting up the road with a sports car on my tail
Frankenstein's inside my mind, and the wind's inside my sails
