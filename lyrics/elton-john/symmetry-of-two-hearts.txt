On a good day, I can see forever
I can take my time and let you know
Who you are it's a mystery, it's never in the stars
It's in your blood, tears, and heart
And there must be a good reason
These things take time
Love is only a season in the era of your mind
I'd like to think that I'm honest
It's better for your health


But when two times I've pulled myself
That the symmetry of two hearts
It's never easy, I never go back to start
I really tried even if we're two hearts
One beat is all I steal, I steal
Wish you were mine

And in the mornings, I tend to find myself
Overthinking are you with someone else?
I don't remember the little words I say
Don't wanna waste the time, don't waste the speed
One heart

A kiss, a moment, or a touch I'm in
There must be a good reason
That some people forget
Instead I have to remind myself

That the symmetry of two hearts
It's never easy, I never go back to start
I really tried even if we're two hearts
One beat is all I steal, I steal
Wish you were mine

Ooh oooh oooh oh oh
Ooh oooh oooh oh oh

One kiss and the ice might melt, remember
One word and my world might fall at your feet
'Cause one dream can we set by moment?
One mind or

'Cause the symmetry of two hearts
It's never easy, I never go back to start
I really tried even if we're two hearts
One beat is all I steal, I steal

Wish you were mine
Wish you were mine
Wish you were mine
Wish you were mine
