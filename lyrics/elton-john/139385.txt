Here am I, standing by
To see if you still love me
Why conceal, you still feel
The need to push and shove me


Take love for better, take love for worse
But never ever take love for granted
Make love and promise it will always be
More than just a memory of

Love will grow, it comes and goes
Emotions can deceive you
Well this I vow, here and now
My love will never never never leave you

Take love for better, take love for worse
But never ever take love for granted
Make love and promise it will always be
Ours for all eternity
Promise it will always be
More than just a memory of love
