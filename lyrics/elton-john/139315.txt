I grew up in your hometown, at least began to grow
I hadn't got to my first shave before the body blow
Egyptians in the courtyard, my family in chains
You witnessed our abduction which possibly explains


How I know you
How I know you

Before that fateful morning my family enjoyed
A privileged existence, for my father was employed
As advisor to the king, no less, which surely rings a bell
For as you are his daughter, you probably can tell

How I know you
How I know you

Enough of reminiscence, and such happy memories
The reason why I know you well is really none of these
It's just you reek of royalty, you ooze uncommon grace
I'd know you were a princess, in any time and place

Yes I know you
How I know you
Yes I know you
How I know you
