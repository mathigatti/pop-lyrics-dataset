Sling your hook in with him baby
He's a real sharp-shooter now
If he's out there hiding in the tall grass
Tell him I said he was a coward


This ain't any old western honey
It's the twentieth century now
But if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy
And he's hurt her then I want to know how

Did he shoot her with his compromise
Like a heart attack he can paralyse
Or did he hang her in a noose
On the telephone line

Did he shoot her with a 45
Did he leave his mark right between her eyes
Oh did he shoot that girl
That used to be mine

Tell him I'm ready any time he chooses
The pay-off for the things, for the things he's done
He ain't messing with no two-bit bandit
Armed with a couple of guns

If he wants to see it as a two reel movie
He's living in the head of someone else
But better take him down and dust him honey
I want to hear the truth for myself

Did he shoot her
Did he shoot her
