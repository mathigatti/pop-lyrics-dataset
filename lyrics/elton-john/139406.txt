Can you tell me how old Dan might have done it
If he'd been here now, holy cow
My stars might have been read on the planet Mars
Because I don't have foresight to see
If we still be together in the twenty first
In the twenty first century


He's our flying ace, pilot of the future
In an endless space, holy cow
My eyes never saw a rocket that was quite that size
Because I don't have the energy
To be cat and mouse for the champions
For the champions of destiny

So long captain Dan
I fail to see what motivates your hands
Goodbye restless night
You know I loved Dan Dare, but I couldn't make his flight
So long, so long

Dan Dare doesn't know it
He doesn't know it
He doesn't know it
But I liked the Mekon
