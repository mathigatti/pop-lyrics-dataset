Time has gone by
The calendar leaves ___
I might try phoning
If I could think of the words to try


What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
She never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fall

She left in the morning
_____ was her way
And on returning
I find I have nothing to say

What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
No, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fall
