Your mother's eyes look straight through me
Whenever we meet
Your father swears it'll never be
As long as he breaths


And how many times have they told you
That you're too young
How, how I've ached to hold you
But you're too young

If we don't buy what's right or wrong
Then we are sinners
We were never two to tag along
But we were always winners

And how many people, have told you
That you're too young
And how many jealous hands would love to hold you
`Cause you're too young

Well you're too young to love me
And I'm too old for you
At least that's what they tell us
It's in their book of rules
That you're too young, too young baby you're too young

We could try it for a while
But they'd get us in the long run
They say that you're too young, baby you're too young
