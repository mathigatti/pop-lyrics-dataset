I was unprepared for fame
Then everybody knew my name
No more lonely nights, it's all for you
I have traveled many miles
I've seen tears and I've seen smiles
Just remember that it's all for you


Don't forget me as the colors fade
When the lights go down, it's just an empty stage
Okay

Yes, I've been a bad guy
Been higher than the blue sky
And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
I've made grown men cry
Don't know why I'm still alive
Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man

Many times, I lost control
They tried to kill my rock 'n' roll
Just remember I'm still here for you
I don't wanna say goodbye
When I do, it'll be alright
After all, I did it all for you

Don't forget me as the colors fade
When the lights go down, it's just an empty stage
Okay

Yes, I've been a bad guy
Been higher than the blue sky
And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
I've made grown men cry
Don't know why I'm still alive
Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man

Yes, I've been a bad guy
Been higher than the blue sky
And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
I've made grown men cry
Don't know why I'm still alive
Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
