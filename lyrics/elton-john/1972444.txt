I have spent so many years
In fancy lace and beaded gowns
I have set my hair a hundred ways
My face i painted up and powdered down
This body bears a telling tale
They pinch my cheek and wish me well
For all their patronizing smiles
This frame remains a prison cell
They look at me and what they see
Is one more painted china doll
A sweet and cudled daudle with
A painted fan, a sweet treat, and a parasol
Inside of me there lives someone
Who could have been somebody's wife
Could have seen their children grow
Could have had a normal life
Who could have fiercely loved a man
And felt his kisses deep and moist
Instead i get this kiss of death
And in this i have no choice
Imagine walking down the aisle
I'll never have that chance
A wedding dress of virgin white
The very best from france
A cottage in the country
The pleasures of romance
Sunlight laying on my skin
I'll never have that chance
Oh no, i'll never have that chance
They glide around society swans
With slim long necks and perfect breasts
While i remain the frozen child
A baby bird without the wings to leave her nest
This body bears a telling tale
They pinch my cheek and wish me well
For all their patronizing smiles
This frame remains a prison cell
The mirror with its cruel laugh
Reflects this ageless face of mine
In taunting ways as if to say
A child who is not something you can leave behind
Inside of me there lives someone
Who never felt a mother's love
Who chould have heard the bells on sunday
Pealing in the church of god
Who would have loved a rainy day
And never had to feel the fire
Instead i hunger for the vein
And hoarde the life-force i desire
Pleasures of fine wine and dining
I'll never have that chance
The taste of chocolate and champagne
The very best from france
The arching of a rainbow
The way the colors dance
The miracle of giving birth
I'll never have that chance
Imaging walking down the aisle
I'll never have that chance
A wedding dress of virgin white
The very best from france
A cottage in the country
The pleasures of romance
Sunlight laying on my skin
I'll never have that chance
Oh no, i'll never have that chance
I'll never have that chance
