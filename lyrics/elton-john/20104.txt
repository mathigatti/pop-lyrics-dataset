Lately, I've been thinking
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield
Brightening the daybreak


Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh
Like a puppy, child

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

I can see you sitting, eating
Apples in the evening
The fruit juice, flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body

Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh
Like a puppy, child

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

Oh, if only I could nestle
In the cradle of your cabin
My arm's around your shoulder, whoa
The window's wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore, whoa
Are playing in the valley
Oh, I miss you, Amoreena
Like the king bee misses honey

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

Lately, I've been thinking, oh
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield
Oh, brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, whoa
Like a puppy, like a puppy, child, oh
