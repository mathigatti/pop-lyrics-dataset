Ice cubes on the back of your neck
Warm wind blowing through the parking lot
A radio humming in every car, and it feels like the clocks have stopped


Calypso moon just cast its spell
We grabbed that magic just because
We remember and never forget what a wonderful crazy night that was

Some things you don't forget, some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that takes you back, won't let you go
Someday if you're asking all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was, yeah

Loose clothes and a cool, cool drink
A greasy breeze from the chicken stand
Hearts on fire just one last time, a wishbone snapping in every hand

Some things you don't forget, some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that takes you back, won't let you go
Someday if you're asking all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was

We found a place to feel it, we knew where we were at
Stop the bar, don't have a future, don't everybody need a life like that

Ice cubes on the back of your neck
Warm wind blowing through the parking lot
We remember and never forget what a wonderful crazy night that was

Some things you don't forget, some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that takes you back, won't let you go
Someday if you're asking all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was
