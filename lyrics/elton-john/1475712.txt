You're a stranger to me
Then you give me your life
I toss it to one side
Still you're sweeter to me
When we lie on the shore


It's warm where you are
But my lips just don't burn
I feel so insecure
When you try to be kind
Could I ask for more

Looking at you now I know you only want to find me
Still I need a reason to leave the past behind me
Behind me
There ain't no easy way
To learn how to fly
I hope that I can care
When I turn around you're there
Should I ask for more
I feel like sugar on the floor
I feel like sugar on the floor
