You say that all you want are the simple things
Long walks on lonely beaches, guitars with nylon strings
But underneath you'd rather leap through a hoop of fire
You shy away from lips that want, that want to kiss you
Tongue-tied on formal evenings, wealth don't impress you
But if you ask me you like the heat in a hoop of fire


And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire

No late nights making love in secret places
You feel pressure all around you, mistrust in strangers faces
But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire

But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire
