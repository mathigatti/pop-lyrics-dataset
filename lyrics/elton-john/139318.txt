Take me for granted, I think that I could stand it
After all these rough seas
Left me reckless and abandoned
Say the spirits willing, chance a new beginning
Break down the cold front
Give me peace and understanding


And you wait, and you wonder
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder
Will she still be the star to see me through
'Cause I can't steer my heart clear of you

No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view
And should I drift away, the compass holds the clue
You control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you

Make me your penance, show me your innocence
Everything is history
From the aching to the pleasure
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us
Everything gets twisted
Let me burn or bring me water
