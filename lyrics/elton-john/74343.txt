Way beyond the water hole
A little down the line
The jungle and the plains and peaks
Are scheduled to be mine


I'm gonna be the ruler
Of most everything around
From the grandest of the montains
To the humble common ground
My reing will be a super-awesome thing
Oh, i just can´t wait to be king

I´m gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I´m brushing up on looking down
I´m working on my roar
The fauna and the flora gonna swing
Oh, I just can´t wait to be king

(Chorus):
No one saying do this
No one saying  be here
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
I´ll be free to do it my way

(Chorus):
No one saying do this
No one saying  be here
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
Free to do it  my way

The time has come
As someone said
To talk of many things
This may be true
But i would rather stick to talking kings

It´s easy to be royal
If you´re already leonine
It isn´t just my right
Even my left will be divine
The monarchy is waiting to go zing
Oh, I just can´t wait to be king

Oh, I just can´t wait to be king
(Repeat until fade)
