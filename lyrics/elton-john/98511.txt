I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me, like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues


And his promise made was never clear
It just carved itself in me
All I saw was frost inside my head
On the night he said to me

Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses

We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train
On the road to the golden gate

On the flat, dry desert, I jumped ship
It just made sense to me
I've spent too long in the belly of the beast
And now, I shall be free

Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses someday

Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses
