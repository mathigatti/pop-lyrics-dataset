When the day is done
Down to Earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done


When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you begun
When the day is done

When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold

When the bird has flown
Got no one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
Now the bird has flown

When the game's been fought
Newspaper blowing across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to to start anew
Now the party's through

When the day is done
Down to Earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done
Day is done
When the day is done
