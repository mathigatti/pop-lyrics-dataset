You and I we live in modern times
And every day we face another to climb
It's easy to ignore this pain we read about
This sickness only happens in someone else's house


You don't need to hear another voice
You don't want this pressure, love should be your choice
But if it's love hang on 'til you're sure
Don't jump into the fire before you know the score

Hey love, love is worth waiting for
Oh love, love is worth waiting for
Take time to know them
Take time to be sure
'Cause love, love is worth waiting for

It's so hard playing by the rules
The night is what you make it, but the payoff can be cruel
We believe we're safe from the hands of fate
But reckless love these days can be your last mistake

Don't chance it if it's easy
Don't push it if they might
That risk you'd like to take
Could be the risk that takes your life
