It's so strange he doesn't show me more affection than he needs
Almost formal, too respectful, never takes romantic leads
There are times when I imagine I'm not always on his mind
He's not thinking what I'm thinking, always half a beat behind
Always half a beat behind


I'm in every kind of trouble, can't you tell, just look at me
Half ecstatic, half dejected, all in all I'm all at sea
Easy turns I thought I wanted, fill me now with chilling dread
You can never know the chaos, of a life turned on it's head
Of a life turned on it's head

Take a little time to panic, shake off your complacent state
I know all I ever wished to, of a life destroyed by fate
It's so strange you never notice anything but where you are
Step outside your gleaming prison, or is that a step too far
Or is that a step too far
