Saturday sun came early one morning
In a sky so clear, clear and blue
But Saturday sun, it came without warning
So no one knew what to do


And saturday sun brought people and places
That didn't see much in their day
And when I remember these people, these people and places
They were really, really too good in their way, in their way

And saturday sun won't come and see me today
Think about stories with reason and rhyme
Circling through, through your brain
Just think about, think about people
In their season, season and times
Just returning again and again

So Sunday sat in Saturday sun
And wait for a day gone by
