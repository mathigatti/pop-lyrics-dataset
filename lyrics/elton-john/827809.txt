Songs are lightning
When they strike you
You hang on every line
They're bits of history
Don't try to change 'em
It's how you're feeling at the time


The world is changing
We're getting older
Simple things are hard to find
Hope they remember
What we did here
The ones we leave behind

That's it I guess
It's been some trip
But we'll just shrug and say
It's just my job
It's all I know
I hope we did OK
