You're a cool little one
My dark southern breeze
Sweeps through my fingers
And it amazes me


Dixie shadowland
Your envy shelters me
Lay down your burden
Mystery of ebony

And it amazes me
Oh, it amazes me
Maybe the heat, babe, could be this tune
It amazes me
It amazes me
What drives me crazy is that big fat yellow moon

Look up that pale light
Well, she's waking the trees
I'm drifting in your hoodoo
And it amazes me

That magnolia state
Got a hold on me
I got no blues to preach
Just Mississippi company

Ain't no magic potion
No gri-gri on her side
She's bound to my salvation
Sweet little mama
Take me down by the river tonight
And it amazes me
