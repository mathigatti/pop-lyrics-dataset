I know that your powers
of retention are as
wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride


It's clear from your
vacant expressions
The lights are not all on
upstairs
But we're talking
kings and successions
Even you can't be caught
unawares

So prepare for a chance
of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

And where do we feature?

Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues!
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!


Be prepared for what?


For the king's death!

Why? Is he sick?

No, you fool, we're going
to kill him... and Simba too!


Great idea! Who needs a king?


No king, No king, nah nah
nah nah nah nah!


Idiots! There will BE a king!


But you just said...


I'm gonna be king
Stick with me, and you'll
never be hungry again!


YEA!!!!!! Long live the king!
It's great that we'll soon

be connected
With a king who'll be
all-time adored
Scar:

Of course, quid pro quo,
you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me
So prepare for the coup of

the century
Be prepared for the
murkiest scam
Ooooh!
Meticulous planning
We'll have food!
Tenacity spanning
Lots of food
Decades of denial
We repeat
Is simply why I'll
Endless meat
Be king undisputed
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Respected, saluted
Aaaaaaaaaah!
And seen for the wonder I am
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Yes my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!

Yes, our teeth and
ambitions are bared
Be prepared!
