I know that you'll not understand this
And I know that I'm wasting my time
But there's something I need to tell you
And something inside says it's fine
It's maybe because of the cider
Or maybe it's due to the snow
And I know that you don't feel the same way
But maybe you'll still want to know
I don't have a day that's without you
I think about where you might be
Things that you've done, stuff that you've said
But I know that you don't think about me
But that's OK I understand
If that's the way it must be
But I'll always think of you Billy
Unrequitedly
I know that I shouldn't have told you
No Michael, please it's OK
You won't tell anyone else then
Who am I going to tell anyway
It must be because of the cider
No, I recon it's 'cause of the snow
But we'll both have to keep it a secret
Don't worry no one will know
But I don't have a day that's without you
Thinking about where you might be
Things that you'll do, stuff that you'll say
Even though you don't think about me
But that's OK I understand
If that's the way it must be
And I think about you some of the time
If you promise you'll think about me
Don't worry please, I understand
We all want things that we can't have
And I still love you in my own way
But that's OK, yeah that's OK
I don't have a day that's without you
I think about where you might be
Things that you've done, stuff that you've said
But I know that you don't think about me
But that's OK I understand
If that's the way it must be
But I'll always think of you Billy
Unrequitedly
