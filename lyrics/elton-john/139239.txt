At last I'm over losing you
I've cried so many tears it just ain't true
My eyes are red, my heart is blue
I can't get over getting over losing you


I can't turn back the hands of time
I've come so far, I have to see it through
The trouble is that I still find
I can't get over getting over losing you

I hardly ever think of you
Except in the morning and then in the evening, again in the afternoon
I guess it's true, I'm over the worst
But living's the one thing that ain't rehearsed

But I know that's all behind me now
I'm learning how to live my life anew
And as soon as I discover how
Then I'll get over getting over losing you

I hardly ever think of you, I roll with the punches
I'm taking it easy, I don't play hunches like I used to do
I'm over you now
Still tying to forget you but I don't know how

But at least I'm over losing you
There's only one thing left for me to do
Oh my eyes are red, my heart is blue
I draw the lone on you and me, forget how fine it used to be
And I'll get over getting over losing you
And I'll get over getting over losing you
