I used to know this old scarecrow
My joy and sorrow
Cast alone between the furrows
No longer sown by anyone


Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad

Beneath these branches
I once wrote such childish words for you
I held a dandelion
When summer burned the earth again

Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad...

No longer sown by anyone

Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad...
