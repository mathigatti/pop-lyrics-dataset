Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Never released


Turn to me, turn to me when you're lonely
Brush them aside, gather your pride
Baby turn to me
Turn to me, turn to me when you're lonely
Brush them aside, gather your pride
Baby turn to me
Don't listen to the people
Who spread lies about your name
I know it hurts
But baby I've had it too


I've learned to live with their abuse
I've learned to live with those who choose
To disregard my emptiness and lose me


Your laughter has died in the heat of the night
The people they pretend that company is bright
But brighter you'll wait by the phone that has died
Don't bury your hopes, there's nothing that's left for you to confide in


But you seem to be happy just for now to go on
Try to see through them baby, can't you see what is wrong
You're hurting yourself more that you'll ever know
