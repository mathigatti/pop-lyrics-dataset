You say I can't understand
The highway's hold on a troubled man
You want me but you don't know how
To quit the chase and settle down


I don't know but I can tell
You fill that saddle pretty well
But God knows I need something too
I've hung in all these years for you

So go ahead and chase the wind
And if someday you fold your wings
I'll be the nest you never made
If not, so sad the renegade

So sad that you lost me
When all you ever had to be
Was balanced in the games you play
You'll lose so sad the renegade

You always had a cowboy heart
A wild horse running through the dark
A need to touch the jagged edge
To rock your heels upon the ledge

Everyone who's close to you
Reads your book and sees the clues
Tries to set you straight on me
The love you lose won't set you free

Go ahead and chase the wind
And if someday you fold your wings
I'll be the nest you never made
If not, so sad the renegade

So sad that you lost me
When all you ever had to be
Was balanced in the games you play
You'll lose so sad the renegade

It's only love that keeps me here
Something in you I hold so dear
I'm not out to change your ways
All I want is the chance to say

Go ahead and chase the wind
And if someday you fold your wings
I'll be the nest you never made
If not, so sad the renegade

So sad that you lost me
When all you ever had to be
Was balanced in the games you play
You'll lose so sad the renegade

Go ahead and chase the wind
And if someday you fold your wings
I'll be the nest you never made
If not, so sad the renegade
