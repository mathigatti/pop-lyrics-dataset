On and on, the story of our lives go on and on,
The path of time, The sunsets up ahead, roll along,
In your eyes, the option of a warm embrace implies,
You're my friend, happy endings keep our love alive.


And tell me do I fit in the Big Picture,
Do I have a shot, at the big part,
'Cause I've been up all night,
Looking at the Big Picture,
I've got some good lines for my big star,

Wanna be your main man in the Big Picture,
What a deal, to get a part like this,

Day to day, the shifting wind just blows us on our way,
Here and there, our pockets full of things to say,
Oh my love, I proudly represent you in this world,
Little satellite, brightest star tonight, oh my love,

And tell me do I fit in the Big Picture,
Do I have a shot, at the big part,
'Cause I've been up all night,
Looking at the Big Picture,
I've got some good lines for my big star,

Hope I got a future in the Big Picture,
At the last embrace, from the first kiss,

And tell me do I fit in the Big Picture,
Do I have a shot, at the big part,
'Cause I've been up all night,
Looking at the Big Picture,
I've got some good lines for my big star.
