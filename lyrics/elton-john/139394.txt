Never meant to be so friendly
Never made the room look nice
Never heed a word of warning
Never take my own advice
I got a brand-new problem
Pretty and she's 5 foot 10
I been in love three times this week
I'm just about to fall again


I don't want to fall in love
Never gonna fall in love, again
I don't want to fall in love
Never gonna fall in love
I'm never gonna fall in love, again

Never meant to be so sexist
It's so hard to overcome
Trying hard to fight the feeling
Lechery can be such fun
`Cause everywhere there's lots of foxes
And every cat I meet's a tom
I wish she didn't make me rabid
I wish she wouldn't turn me on

`Cause everywhere there's lots of foxes
And every cat I meet's a tom
I wish she didn't make me rabid
I wish she wouldn't turn me on
