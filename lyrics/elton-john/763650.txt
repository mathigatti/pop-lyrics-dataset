I was born in the north of England
I was raised in a working town
I broke all the rules when I went to school
But the teachers couldn't pin me down


I tried to make my parents proud
By adapting to the social powers
Oh pigs will fly, and the earth will fry
When they get me doing honest hours

Snookeroo, Snookeroo
Daddy's going on the booze
Mother used to cut my hair
And sister used to make the news

Oh it was two rooms up and two rooms down
And we were sentenced by the wrecking crane
I was born on the eve of Halloween
And Snookeroo, Snookeroo, Snookeroo's my name, Snookeroo

I need someone to cook for me
And turn me loose at night
I could spend my life with a factory girl
'Cause the factory girl's my type

I hear them gossip on the street
Most of what they say is true
Oh don't you know that I hear them say
There goes that lazy, no-good Snookeroo
