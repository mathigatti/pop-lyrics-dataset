I got frostbitten in the winter
Ice skating on the river
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
She'd make your darn toes curl just to see her, yeah


I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Susie by by by my side

Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine

I'm an old hayseed harp player
I'm the hit of the county fair
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
Living proof as she swirls, she's a dancer, yeah

I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Susie by by by my side

Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine

Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time, oh
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine
Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine
