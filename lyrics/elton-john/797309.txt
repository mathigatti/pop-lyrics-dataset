Do you believe in faeries
For the children's rhymes are in my mind
Seen through the colours of my eyes
A rainbow in the sky


With the flowers of seed
Taken by the beautiful people who have gone
Where have they gone
Where have they all gone

They're throwing coins in a velvet fountain
Wishing on stars and floating on air
Can somebody catch me if I stranger
And the mystery beleives me a velvet fountain
