Lonely boy, get up and fly
Lonely boy, get up and try
Everyone knows you got what it takes
All you need is one or two good breaks


Lonely boy, this is your time
Lonely boy, you're on the line
This just could be the only throw you got
Get on up and give it your best shot

You gotta make it lonely boy
You gotta take it lonely boy
Oh do da do da day
You gotta do it lonely boy
Get to it lonely boy
Oh take it all the way

Lonely boy, you are the one
Lonely boy, your chance has come
Destiny gonna put you to the test
Face the music and disregard the rest
