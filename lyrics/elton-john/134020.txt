It's a hot summer night in the blackboard jungle 
Crime sits heavy on the city shoulder 
Can't get no work, I can't get a job 
I just sit and play my radio in the parking lot 


Well they're breaking down doors in foreign countries 
Everybody thinks somebody's hiding something 
There's talk on the street and the nation is worried 
But you can't talk back when you're dead, when you're dead and 
buried 

And Everybody's restless 
Everybody's scared 
Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there 
Everybody's restless 

Everybody's scared, they think we're all in danger 
Everyone's taking cover from someone else's anger 
The walls have ears, Big Brother's watching 
They tell us that we're poisoned from everything that we're 
touching 

Well we could be children from the way we're acting 
We feed ourselves lies and then we scream for action 
We just breed and we lose our nerve 
And there's bombs going off in every corner of the world
