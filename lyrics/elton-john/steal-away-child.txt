Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Gary Osborne
Released as a UK B-side in 1980


Steal away child into your dreams
Where nothing is ever the way that it seems
I gave you your life, you gave me your trust
I've no wish to hurt you but hurt you I must
Steal away child, turn down your light
Steal away into the night

Steal away child to the land of the lies
Where love lasts forever and hope never dies
Sit safe for a place peaceful and calm
Where no one and nothing can harm you


Steal away child, you'll be alright
Steal away into the night
Once more goodnight, one last goodbye
Trying hard not to show how I'm making what it's taking not to cry


Steal away child, sleeping so still
Our love is too precious for distance to kill
But when you awake, morning has come
I won't be the one you turn to
I'll do what I must before it gets light
I'll steal away into the night


Steal away child
Steal away into the night
