Suntanned, windblown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par
Oh, how lucky we are


While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So on and on it will always be
True love, true love


For you and I have a guardian angel
On high, with nothing to do
But to give to you as you give to me
Love forever, true
Love forever, true


Give me more true love
Oh yeah
True love, true love


Gotta give me your true love
Oh yeah
True love, true love
