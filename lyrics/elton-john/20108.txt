What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain


And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door?
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed! We're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace

And I've been knocking, but no one answers
And I've been knocking, most all the day
Oh, and I've been calling: Oh, hey, hey, Johnny!
Can't you come out to play?

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

And I've been knocking, but no one answers
And I've been knocking, most all the day
Oh and I've been calling: Oh, hey, hey, Johnny!
Can't you come out to play

Johnny?
Can't you come out to play, in your empty garden?
