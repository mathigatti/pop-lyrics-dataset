I don't want to worry you none but I got the hurt on the run
I just cut out the poison that was
in me so long
Watching you tear out my heart only gave me the last laugh
Watching you tear
out your hair is gonna be the best part


Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child

I've slapped a worried frown on that evil smile
I've been taken down by a spiteful child

I've turned the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child

You'd
better be ready to run, now I've got you under the gun
I put my money on vengeance before this
race had begun
Breaking the spirit in me only added to your conceit
Playing you at your
own game is going to make it complete

Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child

Turn the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child
