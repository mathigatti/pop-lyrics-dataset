She grows, she's grown like pampas
Tall in the wind
She's sinful and spiteful
She's all girl, woman and mother
She's had my children
And she's been my lover


No no no no no no she don't like to fight it
Once you've been bitten
You get excited
My mama she really likes her
She comes for coffee
And my mama asked me

So where's the shoorah she sang
You know I hear it again my friend
Where's the shoorah she came upon it
Waiting to sing her back
`Cause she likes to sing about
Where's the shoorah she sang
Over and over and over
Where's the shoorah she sang
