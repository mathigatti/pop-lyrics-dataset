Never released


Oh pity me
I'm so alone and so blue
My friends have all gone away
Their friendliness too

It was I on my own
With no need to be alone
And I wanted to die
That's when you came along


And thank you for all of your loving
Thank you for all of your tears
Thank you for all of your kindness
Thank you for being here


What a difference it makes
My life has started again
And if you go away
It just won't be the same


It's hard to say what I feel
When I'm by your side
You're there when I'm worried
