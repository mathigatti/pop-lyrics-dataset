He said "How's tomorrow?"
Then he drove back to town
Thinking she might follow
Hoping she might stick around
It was only the thunder
That held up the train
But in that first flash of lightning
He saw her face in the rain
He learned truth in the meaning
Of love at first sight
And when he said "How's tomorrow?"
He meant the rest of his life


Little moments in time are hard to define
Frozen forever, locked up in our minds
The reasons we're right there at a point in our lives
Isn't ours for the asking, isn't ours to decide
It's not always but often, but when that moment arrives
When we say "How's tomorrow?"
We mean the rest of our lives

She stayed on a while
Feeling drawn to that place
Could it be the dark stranger
Or something she sensed as fate
She was always a dreamer
She spent her life on the rails
Working jobs through the heartland
To keep some wind in her sails
But when he stepped from the darkness
Out into the light
And when he said "How's tomorrow?"
She saw the rest of her life

Little moments in time are hard to define
Frozen forever, locked up in our minds
The reasons we're right there at a point in our lives
Isn't ours for the asking, isn't ours to decide
It's not always but often, but when that moment arrives
When we say "How's tomorrow?"
We mean the rest of our lives

Little moments in time are hard to define
Frozen forever, locked up in our minds
The reasons we're right there at a point in our lives
Isn't ours for the asking, isn't ours to decide
It's not always but often, but when that moment arrives
When we say "How's tomorrow?"
We mean the rest of our lives

When that moment arrives
When we say "How's tomorrow"?
We mean the rest of our lives

How's tomorrow...
