My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it


I was lonely once in this great big world
Just a nowhere man without a girl
'Till that lucky day when she came my way
And she smiled at me as if to say

My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it

She's the only one, makes me feel so good
Can't believe my love so I knock on wood
All my silent fears seem to fly away
And she smiled at me as if to say

Your baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes for me

No more lonely nights just waiting for the telephone to ring
No more lonely days, my baby's taking care of everything
I'm telling you people

My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it

She's the only one, makes me feel so good
Can't believe my love so I knock on wood
All my silent fears seem to fly away
And she looked at me as if to say
