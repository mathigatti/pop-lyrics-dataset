Take every ray of sunshine from the sky
Let the rain fall, I don't care if the flowers die
The night lights can forget me
The stars will never glow
The days just seem so worthless
The hours, they come and go


Reminds me of you
Reminds me of you
The things we used to say
The things we used to do
All these happy hours are now just empty days
And I can't bear the strain to pass the time away
Reminds me of you

I see couples walking down the street
I watch them here
With tear filled eyes there's nothing left for me
For I just think about the times
That you and I were two
And still these things remind me of you
Oh they do
