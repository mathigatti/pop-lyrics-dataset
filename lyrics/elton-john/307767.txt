Good morning world, it's a brand new day
I'm packing my bags and I'm going away
I'm moving my legs and my city tired bones
I gotta get away from the busy man's phones


Gotta make a move where the living is wild and free
If you want to get happy them people come along with me
A fee fa fou fafafafa fouu

Run along boy, set a place for me
I'm getting so tired of the company
I'm getting looks from the big white man
I gotta get away just as fast as I can

Good morning, freedom
Gotta break away
Gotta break away
Gotta break away
Good morning, freedom
It's another day
It's another day
It's another day
Good morning, freedom
A fee fa fou fafafafa fouu

Is the same old game
A city tired living is the game to play
Loving thy neighbour is
There's only one way to get the people to sing
