Haven't you heard what's new
There is a rumour
Going around that suddenly I've found you
Better believe it's true
I got a feeling
This is for real and nobody else will do


You are my princess
You make me smile
You make my life seem worthwhile
You are my princess
You are the one
You make the sun shine on me
You're one fine lady
You're my princess
You're my princess

Haven't you heard them say
I was a prisoner
Buried alive now suddenly I've been freed
But love is the sweetest way
Oh I was lonely
And now you're the only lover that I'll ever need
