I once knew all the answers, I stood on certain ground
A picture of true happiness, confidence so effortless
No brighter could be found


I never asked the questions that trouble me today
I knew all there was to know, love worn lightly, put on show
A conquest on display

And who would have thought his love could be so good
Not me, not me
My secrets and my passions understood
Not me, not me

Who would have guessed he'd throw his world away
To be with someone till his dying day
Not me, not me

I shall not envy lovers, but long for what they share
An empty room is merciless, don't be surprised if I confess
I need some comfort there

And who would have thought his love could be so good
Not me, not me
My secrets and my passions understood
Not me, not me

Who would have guessed he'd throw his world away
To be with someone till his dying day
Not me, not me

But not me, oh not me
