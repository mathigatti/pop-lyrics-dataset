Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Never released


I watch the raindrops falling on my window pane
All the bloomed forget-me-nots won't falter in the rain
Electric light bulbs cannot replace the sun
And picture postcards can't reveal all the things we've done

And the flowers will never ever die
And the flowers will never die
And autumn in the country cannot withhold the sky
And the flowers will never die


He spreads his cloudy blanket on a raging sea
And calms the cruel waves with the help of powers that be
The hours fly by, the clock ticks on maneuvering its hands
While the autumn leaves fall from the trees and return into the land
