Timothy
Why are you following me
Why don't you take a few chances
while you got time on your side

Timothy
How can I make you see
Somebody's got all the answers
but it sure ain't me


You know that love's a game
And I played it once or twice
Oh you're asking for advice
That I can't give you


'Cause it just don't feel the same
If you haven't paid the price
It's something that you're just gonna
Have to live through


Timothy
Why are you following me


Timothy
I'm not the person to tell you
What you should do with your life


Timothy
The joke's on me
You got yourself more to handle
Than I will ever be


You know that love's a game
You can guarantee to win
Love has always been a game of learning


'Cause it just don't feel the same
When you're outside looking in
And it's still the same old question keeps returning


Timothy
Why are you following me


Well you know that love's a game
You play the best you can
It's hard to understand
Though we keep trying


'Cause it just don't feel the same
When you lose the master plan
I sometimes have to laugh
