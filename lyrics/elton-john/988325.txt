In the summertime
When the weather is high
You can stretch right up
An' touch the sky
When the weather's fine
You got women, you got women on your mind
Have a drink, have a drive
Go out an' see what you can find


If her daddie's rich
Take her out for a meal
If her daddie's poor
Just do as you feel
Speed along the lane
Do a ton, or a ton an' twenty five
When the sun goes down
You can make it, make it good in a lay-by

We're not grey poeple
We're not dirty, we're not mean
We love everybody but we
Do as we please
When the weather's fine
We go fishing, or go swimming in the sea
We're always happy
Life's for living, yeah, that's our philosophy

When the winter's here
Yeah, it's party time
Bring a bottle, wear your bright clothes
It'll soon be summertime
And we'll sing again
We'll go driving, or mayby we'll settle down
If she's rich, if she's nice
