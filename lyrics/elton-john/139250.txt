Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week
I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well, she's really going fine for eighty-four
Well, she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl, she needs a hand to run the farm


And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going home

Down at the well, they got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah, but that ain't natural, yeah, well, so old Clay would say
You see, he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going back home
And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going back home

Now the old fat goose is flying across the sticks
The hedgehogs done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chairs are creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
It's the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comforts in a truck that's going home
Oh, country comforts in a truck that's going back home, yes, it is
Country com-comforts in a truck that's going back home
