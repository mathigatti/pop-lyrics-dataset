I'm staring down a mile of disappearing track
Is this the best that we could do
I'm leaning through the rain but you ain't looking back
What did I ever have to prove


`Cause it feels like electricity hitting an open field
When am I ever gonna to learn
Married life's two people trying to grab the wheel

Oh and we must have got lost
Living on Dark Street
Looking for an exit
Sleeping on the concrete
You can't see it with your eyes
You can't find it with your feet
All I know is that we're lost baby
And we're living on Dark Street

All the layoffs and the pay cuts cripple me inside
I pay the price for living everyday
Trying to keep us all together along with a little pride
What'll it take to make you stay

But I've dreamed about an island
And all I got's a bucket of sand
I'd give my eyes to give you all your dreams
Now I get to see my family slipping through my hands
