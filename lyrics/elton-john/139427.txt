I have to say, my friends
This road goes a long, long way
And if we're going to find the end
We're going to need a helping hand
I have to say, my friends
We're looking for a light ahead
In the distance, a candle burns
Salvation keeps the hungry children fed


It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation

A chance to put the devil down
Without the fear of hell
Salvation spreads the gospel 'round
And free you from yourself

It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation

I have to say, my friends
This road goes a long, long way
And if we're going to find the end
We're going to need a helping hand
I have to say, my friends
We're looking for a light ahead
In the distance, a candle burns
Salvation keeps the hungry children fed

It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation

Oh, it's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation
