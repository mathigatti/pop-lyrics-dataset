Tread on my face if you like little lady
Turn me inside out if you have to baby
But don't you cross me off your list
I am young and I ain't never been kissed
Never been kissed by a lady called Amy


You're far out, you're fab and insane
A woman of the world, it's quite plain
My dad told me Amy's your name
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game
But he can bust my neck `cause I love you all the same

Amy I know you don't have to show your affection
`Cause the big boys like you and to you I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town Amy

I'm beaten on the streets `cause I loves you
I watch you go to work in the summer
I don't whistle at you down the street
I would if I could but I can't whistle you see

Amy I may not be James Dean
Amy I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams
