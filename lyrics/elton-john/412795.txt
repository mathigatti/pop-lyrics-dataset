I'm not the same as I used to be 
All the things you've heard seem hard to believe 
Haven't always been good, never really been bad 
Most times I've been happy, yea sometimes I've been sad 
Sure I've made mistakes, haven't we all 
I've been loose as a cannon and dumb as a wall 
Haven't always been sober in counting my ducks 
And if I look back now I've had my share of luck 


But the change didn't come over night 
I've been searching for you all my life 
All the habits that I couldn't handle 
I've swept them under the rug 
In exchange for the sweetest addiction 
You, my elusive drug 

I'm going to stay now, I really like it here 
I may paint your picture, and I might grow a beard 
There were times I was crazy couldn't handle my life 
Don't think you'd have liked me not at any old price 

But the change didn't come over night 
I've been searching for you all my life 
All the habits that I couldn't handle 
I've swept them under the rug 
In exchange for the sweetest addiction 
You, my elusive drug 

And I've taken the pills 
I got burnt out and chilled by the cold 
But I've no regrets and that being said 
You know cheap thrills can get pretty old 

Yeah, Yeah, oh Yeah 

But the change didn't come over night 
I've been searching for you all my life 
All the habits that I couldn't handle 
I've swept them under the rug 
In exchange for the sweetest addiction 
You, my elusive drug 

In exchange for the sweetest addiction 
You, my elusive drug
