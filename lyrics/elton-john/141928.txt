Hold my hand girl much tighter, much much tighter
'Cause what I've got to say I only hope and pray
Comes out as well as I rehearsed it yesterday


And baby when the first tear shows
It's a sign for you to go
And baby when the first tear shows
It's a sign for you to go and leave her alone
With the broken dreams that she owns

It's a crime for me to tell you
It's a sin for me to stay
And I'll never look behind me
When I start to walk away
Firl I'm sorry but it's all that I can say

you know that I used to love you so
Enjoy every moment together
Well I'm not the kind of man
To forever hold your hand
And I've said as much as I should say
