Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Available on the album Sleeping With The Past


Help me information
Get emotion on the line
This war that's raging in my heart's
Getting harder all the time
Our painted smiles are cracking
Our worried friends just frown
We got a runaway train on an empty track
That's trying to run us down

And I'm a stone's throw from hurtin'
Everything we put together
Knee deep in learning about burning this bridge forever
I'm a stone's throw, a stone's throw
A stone's throw from hurtin'
And I know it's never gonna get no better


Crippled conversation hangs inside this house
Our voices just get ugly
When our love gets all talked out
Your goodnight kiss ain't hungry
Our touches don't connect
We're just a couple of kids with a broken toy
That our idle fingers wrecked


Some things get broken
When stones get thrown
Some things get better
When you leave what you love
And you let what you love alone


Some things get broken
When stones get thrown
Some things get better when you leave what you love
And let what you love alone
