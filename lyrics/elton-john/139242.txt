Spring is here, the sky is blue
Birds will sing as if they knew
Today's the day, we'll say "I do"
And we'll never be lonely any more


Because we're going to the chapel
And we're gonna to get married
Going to the chapel
And we're gonna get married
Gee I really love you
And we're gonna get married
Going to the chapel of love

Bells will ring, the sun will shine
I will be hers, and she'll be mine
We'll love until the end of time
And we'll never be lonely any more
