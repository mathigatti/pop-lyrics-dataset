If you were me
And I was you
If you had to play my part out
What would you do
Two crazy stories
Two different views
If you were me
And I was you
If you were me
And I was you
What kind of crazy things
Would I have to do
Who likes to party
Who stays at home
If you were me
And I was you
Never like strangers
Though never the same
Two circus sideshows
That laughed in the rain
You stayed with the full moon
You searched for the stars
Thank God in His heaven
Here we both are
