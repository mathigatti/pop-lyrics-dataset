Oh it's great to see our homeland
Breathe the Iberian atmosphere
Just because we are Hispanic
Doesn't mean we're oceanic
Quite frankly we've had water up to here


We've made waves to last a lifetime
We've been saturated, almost drowned
We aer Spanish, not Caribbean
We are human, not amphibian
We'll seek our fortunes on Spain's solid ground

There's no future in the new world
Only fools believe the tales
Of the gold of El Dorado
Only suckers set their sails
We habe seen the way the tide is turning
Cortez is a charlatan
We are on the ball, discerning
We're anti-diluvian
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two very modern samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man

There are women who are lining
Every avenue in every port
Now at last we'll get to grips with
The things they never equip ships with
We habe sailed into our last resort

There's no gold mine in the new world
It's a trick to get recruits
On the boat to El Dorado
We're returning to our roots
We're going back to land locked ladies
Cortez never letz them board
All in all the point we've made is
We don't want to go abroad
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two terra firma samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man

Two very fine examples of
Two terra firma samples of
Sixteenth century man
