Often these days
And always these nights
I find I'm afraid
Of the turbulent heights
No matter how crazily
No matter how far
The moments of tenderness
Are those where you are


For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to calm down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me

Once in a while
I slip back to my past
Where I long to remain
But the dream does not last
In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go

For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to break down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me

In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go
Oh don't let me go

For when you are laughing
Lile silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And you love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to break down
Oh oh, oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
