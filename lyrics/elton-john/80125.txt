Tune me into the wild side of life
I'm an innocent young child sharp as a knife
Take me to the garretts where the artists have died
Show me the court rooms where the judges have lied


Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine
Light coloured candles in dark dreary mines
Look in the mirror and stare at myself
And wonder if that's really me on the shelf

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere let's get there soon
The song's got no title just words and a tune

Take me down alleys where the murders are done
In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun
Want to read books in the studies of men
Born on the breeze and die on the wind

If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
I'd study my subject and silently cry
Cry for the darkness to come down on me
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere let's get there soon
The song's got no title just words and a tune
