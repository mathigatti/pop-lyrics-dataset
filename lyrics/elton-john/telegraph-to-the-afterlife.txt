Hello, i said hello!
Is this the only place you thought to go
Am i the only man you ever had
Or am i just the last surviving friend?


Hello, baby hello!
Open up your heart and let you feelings flow
Your not lucky knowing me.
Keeping the speed real slow

Hello

Do you know what i mean
Have your eyes really seen

Do you know what i mean
Have your eyes really seen

Do you know what i mean
Have your eyes really seen...
