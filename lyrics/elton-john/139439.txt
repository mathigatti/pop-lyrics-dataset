I'm still in love with you oh shooting star
And when I start to wonder where you are
There you are, there you are, shooting star


You may have seen me at the early show
I sat and watched you from the second row
Oh, you were mine long ago way back when
Even then we both knew you'd go far, oh, shooting star

And with the spotlight shining in your eyes
It's sometimes hard to find your way
But maybe some night you might
Think of me, shooting star

And when that moment comes at last
And you remember who you are
Here I'll be, shooting star, shooting star
Here I'll be, shooting star, shooting star, shooting star
