I gotta quit this habit
It's like some drug for you
You've been my sweet, sweet addict
I've been your little white boy blue


You've got the same obsession
We ain't no cat and mouse
You linger on my lips like confession
You laid the traps in this house

Chorus: And it's no use, each way we lose
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue
Hit and run hearts collide here
True love passes through
Looks like we've got a wreck babe
Up on Blue Avenue
Up on Blue Avenue
Blue Avenue

Two hearts get entangled
Dirty minds they go to town
Everyone's got an angle
Little lies get spread around

Let them say what they want
You and me we already knew
Takes more than hocus pocus babe
to save you from Blue Avenue

And it's no use, each way we lose
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue
Hit and run hearts collide here
True love passes through
Looks like we've got a wreck babe
Up on Blue Avenue
Up on Blue Avenue
Blue Avenue
