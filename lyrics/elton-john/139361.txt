She looked so easy `cause she looked so young
With a geisha smile made in Taiwan
She got cherry bombs inside her eyes
And the luck of the Irish on her side


Don't let her tell you that she loves your mind
She's got her price, she can turn on a dime
Those crocodile tears ain't tears of pain
Look a little closer, that's acid rain


And I don't know
Why li'l frigerator you're so cold
Go li'l frigerator go
Get away from my soul
Li'l frigerator you're so cold


She's calculated with the kiss of death
Got a digital mind and expensive breath
She's an empty shell, you're a piece of meat
Just another statistic on her readout sheet
