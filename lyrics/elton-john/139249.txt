When I was a little bitty baby
My Momma done rocked me in the cradle
In them old cottonfields back home


It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cottonfields back home

Let me tell you now well I got me in a mess
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickety splits
I had to walk a long long way to town

Came along a nice old man
Well he had a hammer
Wait a minute mister, can you get me some direction
I'm gonna wanna be right off for home

Oh let them cotton balls get rotten
I got you baby, who needs cotton
In them old cottonfields back home

Well it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You should have seen their faces when they seen how I'd grown
In them old cotton fields back home
