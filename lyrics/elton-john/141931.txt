See the changes here on every street
As time goes marching to a different beat
Moving on into the restless age
As the kids today find their feet
(Long enough to hold on)


Young enough to chase our dreams
We were captured by romantic things
Touched by love until it made us cry
How our hearts could fly without wings?

Oh, won't somebody tell me
Tell me, where have all the good times gone?
Say that you remember
Remember all those good old Four Tops songs
Won't somebody tell me
Where have all the good times gone?

Stolen moments in the smoky room
Monday mornings that would come too soon
Crazy summers that would never end
When the time was spent loving you
(Yeah, we had a good time)

Some things never seem to last
Ain't it funny how we missed the past?
Love has changed, but the clock still turns
While the flame still burns for you

They've gone away
Gone, they've gone away
Gone, they've gone away
They've gone away

It's hard enough to lose the game
And sad to see it played again
What makes you happy for a while
Is gonna make you smile through the rain

Won't you, please, tell me where have all the good times gone?
