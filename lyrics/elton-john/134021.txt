There's a light on in your window 
There's a shadow on the street 
Two silhouettes tell me it's over 
The shadow knows the shadow's me 


I won't crawl or cause you trouble 
Well that's the last thing I'll ever do 
But before I leave your life completely 
Tell me who wears these shoes, darling 

Lord knows the days just get longer 
The nights grow cold with you on my mind 
And I feel like an old jukebox 
Playing the same song all the time 

If these crazy dreams don't kill me 
It's more than I can take from you 
Not knowing where or when I'll see you 
Not knowing darling who wears these shoes 

My friends all say don't got to pieces 
I say that's fine but if I lose 
I want to know who's in my foot steps 
I want to know who wears these shoes 

My friends all think I must be crazy 
I see the facts but if it's true 
I want to know who's in my footsteps 
I want to know who wears these shoes, darling 

Oh and it's a chilling feeling 
When I can't see him 
What do I do 
When I face the two of you
