I got feet sticking out of my shoes
I got heat more than I can use
I got love, I got all I need
I got soles that are wearing thin
I got holes where the rain gets in
I got you and that's enough for me


I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, long as I got your love

Clothes that are falling apart
I got a car that refuses to start
I got love, I do the best I can
I got bills piling up in the hall
I got paint peeling off the wall
I got you, I'm a happy man
