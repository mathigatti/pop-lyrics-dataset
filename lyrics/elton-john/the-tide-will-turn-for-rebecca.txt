Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Never released


Can you hear the floorboards crying
In a room on the second floor
That used to be owned by someone who's no one
But he don't live there anymore

Only Rebecca clasping her head in her knees
Trying to work out what it's about
And why someone had to leave


But dry up your tears
Stop counting the years
Don't worry what's coming
Forget all your fears


And the tide will turn for Rebecca
And the tide will turn for Rebecca
Her life will change
Her hopes rearrange
Into something that might really matter


She's all alone in a world of her own
With a key that fits her lonely world
You won't need a crowd to shout out aloud
What she says deserves to be heard
