Ain't no loving tonight
My woman says she ain't my woman
I sure put up a fight
To keep it right


I used a whole lot of pride to get her
I used a whole pack of lies and begged her
She just threw me the key
and said she's free

Thunder in the night
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night again

Frightening lightning hit me again
It's burning much deeper this time
I got them storm clouds hanging right over my head
And it's gonna rain harder this time

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder

Out here searching the streets
I gotta find my woman and tell her
I never wanted to cheat
But she cheated me

I never knew just how much I loved her
I never knew till I went and lost her
Now it's all too late
She's gone away
