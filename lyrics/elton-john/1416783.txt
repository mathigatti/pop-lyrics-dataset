I could really get off being in your shoes
I used to be stone sold on rhythm and blues
A heard of a place at the back of town
Where you really kick the shit when the Sun goes down


I really got buzzed when your sister said
Throw away them records 'cause the blues is dead
Let me take you, honey, where the scene's on fire
And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired

Oh, your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me

Somebody help me because the bug bit me
Now I'm in heaven with the aching feet
But I'll be back tonight where the music plays
And your sister rocks all my blues away

I really got buzzed when your sister said
Throw away them records 'cause the blues is dead
Let me take you, honey, where the scene's on fire
And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired

Oh, your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me

Oh, your sister can't surf but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me

Oh, your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me
