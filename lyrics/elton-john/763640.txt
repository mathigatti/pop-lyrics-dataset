Think the trees are shedding leaves
It looks that way and I might say
The same applies to me
'Cause it's autumn in my heart
And you're the reason dear
I should try to get you back
Instead of sitting being silly here


'Cause you're the last good man in my life
You left me half the woman that I was
But I'm gonna find the time
And you bet I'm gonna climb
Bacm into the arms of the last good man that I loved

Could have been me acting smart
But you know how I can't end what I usually start
You'll realize soemthing's gone
Sure hope you miss me then
But I wouldn't make a fool of you
I'd just pray that you might stay with me again
