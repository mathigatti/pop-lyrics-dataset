I know you
You're trying to do all you can for me
I appreciate your help
But it's best just to leave me be


There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So darling please don't you comfort me
I'll sort it out somehow

So sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Please don't you make me blue
Sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Girl I can do without you

Don't go breaking my heart
It would tear me apart
'Cause then I'd be finished for good
So sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Please don't you make me blue

I don't want you to think I'm mean
Refusing all your help
The time has come, but my need is none
And I want to be alone with myself

There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So darling please don't you comfort me
I'll sort it out somehow
