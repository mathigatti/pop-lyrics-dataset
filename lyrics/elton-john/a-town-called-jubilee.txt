Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said "I'm gonna keep this good luck
Piece of iron inside my truck"
The boy just whispered "OK"
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog


Dull as a ploughshare rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show,
For a dollar and a half

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
"Gone to California"
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that west bound stage

One less hallelujah
A little less sympathy
Lily and Jake, the old black dog
A pinewood box, a rocking horse
All gone to Jubilee
