In the morning there's a feeling
As I free my eyes of sleep
And think only of him running
To the promise he must keep


Such a love I've never known
It fills my life with joy
Oh the miracles the morning brings
The dark cannot destroy

You may find if he's there
It eases your mind
And besides he's so kind
It makes you feel fine
In the morning

Through my window comes a light
Like none that I have known
Well the night has passed between us
And the love has grown and grown

Like a river through a valley
Where the waters never end
Spinning down and always onward
As he come to me again
