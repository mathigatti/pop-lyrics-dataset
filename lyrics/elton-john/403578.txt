If you want my loving take me back
If you miss my touch little girl take me back
When the dreams you lean on are beginning to crack
Open up your heart little girl and take me back


If you want my loving then take me back
If you're on your own little girl take me back
When the nights grow longer turning blacker than black
Open up your heart little girl and take me back

Playing a part you're well prepared for, there you stand
With all I ever cared for in your hand
I'm waiting all the time
For some kind of sign from you
And I'll go on and on this way
Waiting for the day
When I will hear you say
You'll take me back

If you want my loving well take me back
If you're feeling down little girl
Then you'll take me back
When you look around you for the love that you lack
Open up your heart little girl
You got my heart little girl
Make a start little girl
And say you'll take me back
Take me back
