Lonely man, get up and fly
Come on dance, get up and try
Everyone knows you got what it takes
All you need is one or two good breaks


Lonely man, this is your time
Come on dance, you're on the line
This just could be the only throw you got
Get on up and give it your best shot

You gotta make it lonely man
You can take it lonely man
Oh do da do da day
You gotta do it lonely man
Get to it lonely man
Oh take it all the way

Lonely man, you are the one
So come on dance, your chance has come
Destiny gonna put you to the test
Face the music and disregard the rest
