Written By Nick Drake
Recorded by Elton John, but unreleased


Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
Someday our ocean
will find its shore


So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love


Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn


Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say


And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'Till there's no more to hide


So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love


Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind


And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For some day our ocean
