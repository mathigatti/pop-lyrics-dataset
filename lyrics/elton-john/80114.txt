Well, she looked a peach
In the dress she made
When she was still her mama's little girl,
And when she walked down the aisle,
Everybody smiled
At her innocence and curls


And when the preacher said
"Is there anyone here
Got a reason why they shouldn't wed?"
I should have stuck up my hand
I should have got up to stand
And this is what I should have said

I wanna kiss the bride yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride yeah!
Long before she met him
She was mine, mine, mine
Don't say I do
Say bye, bye, bye
And let me kiss the bride, yeah!

Underneath her veil
I could see a tear
Trickling down her pretty face
And when she slipped on the ring
I knew everything
Would never be the same again

But if the groom would have known
He'd have had a fit
About his wife and the things we did
And what I planned to say
Yeah, on her wedding day
Well, I thought it but I kept it hid

I wanna kiss the bride yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride yeah!
Long before she met him
She was mine, mine, mine
Don't say I do
Say bye, bye, bye
And let me kiss the bride, yeah!
