Thought I knew,
Now I know,
Way alone,
Now I know.


Turn around and say "good morning" to the night,
Turn around and say "good morning" to the night,
Turn around and say "good morning" to the night.

Thought I knew,
Now I know,
Way alone,
Now I know.

Turn around and say "good morning" to the night,
Turn around and say "good morning" to the night,
Turn around and say "good morning" to the night,
Turn around and say "good morning" to the night.

Tonight, why not approach with less defiance,
Do we have to fight again,
Turn out the light,
Tonight.

Turn around and say "good morning" to the night,
Turn around and say "good morning" to the night,
Turn around and say "good morning" to the night,
Turn around and say "good morning" to the night.
