You're too low to see me smiling
When I'm flying in the air
But you're too high to frighten me
Pretend you didn't see me
Pretend you didn't need me
Pretend you didn't see me
Pretend you didn't need me


To frighten away all the lost and the lonely
The sacred forgotten of yesterday's problems
Your wooden construction was meant for infliction
To penetrate pain with the thoughts from my mind

Can you see me scarecrow
Can you still feel free
For all your love scarecrow
And will you still be there tomorrow
And will you still be there tomorrow

Like moths around a light bulb, your brain is still bleeding
From visions and pictures of nature's young raincoat
If only my eyes were not pinned to your table
My arms would be grasping the lilies of summer
It's no good to be a scarecrow post
And I've said it before, and I'll say it some more
