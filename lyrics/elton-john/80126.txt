You can win the fight
You can grab a piece of the sky
You can break the rules
But before you try


You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You can stop the world
Steal the face from the moon
You can beat the clock
But before high noon

You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You've got one life with a reason
You need two hearts on one side
When you stand alone and there's no one there
To share the way it feels inside and baby

You can cheat the devil
And slice a piece of the sun
Burn up the highway
But before you run

You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

When you're gonna play with fire
You let someone share the heat
When you're on your own and there's no one there
To cool the flames beneath your feet and baby

You can win the fight, you can
Grab a piece of the sky
You can break the rules
But before you try

You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
