It's never too late to turn things around
Recover, unravel the path to confound
The doubters and losers that line up despair
Will tell you it's over, you're going nowhere
It's never too late, I hope
It's never too late


It's never too late to get back on track
To get at least some, if not all of it back
I thought I was happy, and sometimes I was
The sadness is just as important because
Got to carry the weight and hope
It's never too late

Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time will start to move too fast, the time is now, my friends
I'm a long way from the start, but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late

It's never too late to get up off the ground
Don't have to be noticed, don't have to crowned
I get what I done and I don't try to hide
I lost many things, but never my pride
It's never too late, I know
It's never too late

Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time will start to move too fast, the time is now, my friends
I'm a long way from the start, but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late

I used to say I don't have time, I'm sleepin' tonight
A day doin' nothin' is doin' it right
No hurry, no hurry, take as long as it takes
You might as well sleep for all the difference it makes
I didn't find love or the peace or the breaks
These aren't excuses, but a string of mistakes
I won't go back there, not goin' back there

Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Never too late to fight the fight, babe
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away

Time will start to move too fast, the time is now, my friends
I'm a long way from the start, but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late

It's never too late 
Oh, it's never too late 
It's never too late
It's never too late
