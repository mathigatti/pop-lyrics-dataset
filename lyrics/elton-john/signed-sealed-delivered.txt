Signed Sealed Delivered
Like a fool/ I went and stayed too long/ Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong


Ooh baby/ Here I am/ Signed sealed delivered/ I'm yours.

Like that time I went and said goodbye/ Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry.

Ooh baby/ Here I am/ Signed sealed delivered/ I'm yours.

Here I am baby/ Uh signed sealed delivered/ You got the future in your hands/ Here I am baby / Uh signed sealed delivered/ You got the future in your hands.

I gotta lot a things to say/ I've gotta really didn't mean.

Uh/ Seen a lot of things in this old world/ When I typed them they said.

Ooh baby/ Here I am/ Signed sealed delivered/ I'm yours.

Ooh singing this song/ That's why I know you are my only desire.

Ooh baby/ Here I am/ Signed sealed delivered/ I'm yours.

Here I am baby/ Uh signed sealed delivered/ You got the future in your hands/ Here I am baby / Uh signed sealed delivered/ You got the future in your hands.

I gotta lot a things to say/ I've gotta really didn't mean/ I've got the bridges broken down/ Oh here I am.
