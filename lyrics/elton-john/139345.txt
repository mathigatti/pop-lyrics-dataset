Many a tear has to fall
But it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know has love


You have words with him
And your future's looking kind of dim
But these things
Your heart can rise above

Once in a while he won't call
Oh but it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet "OK"

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away

Come on sing it now
Do-do-do-do-do do doo, oh yeah

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away
