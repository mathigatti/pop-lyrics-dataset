Whenever i hear good-byes, remind me baby of you
I break down and cry, next time i'll be true, yeah
Fever for lost romance, remind me baby of you
i took a crazy chance and next time i'll be true, i'll be true, i'll be true


Footsteps on the dancefloor, remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time i'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room, she cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

And the music dont feel like it did when i felt it with you
Nothing that i do or feel ever feels like i felt it with you

When im dancing round, remind me baby of you
I really let you down, next time i'll be true yeah
I took a crazy chance, she cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

Footsteps on the dancefloor, remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time i'll be true yeah
Whispers in the powder room, she cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

And the music dont feel like it did when i felt it with you 
Nothing that i do or feel ever feels like i felt it with you

Hurting deep inside, she cries on every tune
I break down and cry, she cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

Footsteps on the dancefloor remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time i'll be true yeah
Whispers in the powder room, she cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

And the music dont feel like it did (no, no) when i felt it with you (no, no)
Nothing that i do or feel ever feels (never feels) like i felt it with you (no, no)
And the music dont feel like it did (no, no) when i felt it with you
Nothing that i do or feel ever feels like i felt it with you (woahhh, woahh, woahhh, woooooahhhh)

Fever for lost romance,
i took a crazy chance, 
lovers holding hand
remind me baby of you, 
next time,  i'll be true (fade)
