737 coming out of the sky
Won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride
I want to move, yeah
Playing in a travelling band, yeah
Well I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band

Take me to the hotel
Baggage gone, oh well
Come on, come on, won't you get me to the room
I want to move, yeah
Playing in a travelling band, yeah
Well I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band


Listen to the radio
Talking about the last show
Someone got excited, had to call the state militia
I want to move, yeah
Playing in a travelling band, yeah
Well I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band


Here we come again on a Saturday night
With your fussing and your fighting, won't you get me to the right
I want to move, yeah
Playing in a travelling band, yeah
Well I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band


Well I'm playing in a travelling band
Playing in a travelling band
Playing in a travelling band
Well I'm playing in a travelling band
Well I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band
