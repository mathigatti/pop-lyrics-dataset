There's a chance we may lose it all
All those hollow souls
Can't hope to hold that wall


What I breathe used to be my life
How come a good thing dies
And the evil still survive

Oh I've got to paint it red
Wake up and colour all the pieces
Don't sleep without your faces, and
Oh I've got to paint it red
Put your eyes back in your head
And oh paint it red

Where's the dance they may never dance
All those open hands
Can't hope to have a chance

What I see used to be a smile
How come your lips are sealed
And your spirit never flies

Cash on delivery
That's all they ever said
Grey tones can't be trusted
I say paint it red
