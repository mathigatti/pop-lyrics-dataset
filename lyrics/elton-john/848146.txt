City boy, city girl
Arm in arm in our city world
A lot of love, a lot of hope
Hope our love don't go up in smoke
I feel so good, yeah I feel so fine
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
Feeling good, yeah I'm feeling fine
Now you're mine, now you're mine, now you're mine


Warm love in a cold world
Warm love in a cold world
Hope we're gonna make it
Hope we're gonna make it
Warm love in a cold world
Warm love in a cold world
Girl we gotta make it
Girl we gotta make it
Warm love in a cold world
sure we're gonna make it
Sure we're gonna make it
Sure we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it

Never knew, but thanks to you
I'm finding out just what love can do
You picked me up, I've come alive
I'm seeing life in another light
Feel so good, yeah I feel so fine
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
Feeling good, yeah I'm feeling fine
Now you're mine, now you're mine, now you're mine
