White man danger
He's come to stay
Red man, it's all over
You're in the way


White man danger
Time on his side
Red man, you don't know it
But your world just died

Let's hear it for the white man
He feels no pain
Let's hear it for the white man
He feels no shame

White man danger
His day has come
Red man got two chances
Slim chance and none

White man danger
He's come to stay
Red man, it's all over
You're in the way
