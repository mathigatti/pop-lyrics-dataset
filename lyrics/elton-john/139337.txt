Tune in, wouldn't it be something
Rumours spreading into panic
I've seen movements in the clearing
Someone sent you something satanic


I have to leave you, radar's calling
Outside somebody landed
Crazy wavelengths leave you helpless
Oh don't forget me I'm so stranded

I wouldn't fool you but I've seen the saucers
So many times I'm almost in tune
Watching them flying in formation
Thinking how I could be so immune

I've seen them I've been there with them
I can tell you all you want to know
Something touched me and I was only sleeping
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to go

Stars climbing into their planets
Systems won, controlled from birth
Empty living on this highway
Can you see me mother earth

It's so endless whirling onwards
Wonder what's cooking at home tonight
Maybe if I promise not to say a word
They can get me back before the morning light
