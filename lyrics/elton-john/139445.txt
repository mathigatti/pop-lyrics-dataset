I'm just sitting doing nothing
Wondering where I should go
People tell me I'm just lazy
Weather or not it's true I don't know


So I'm just sitting doing nothing
Wondering where I should go
Many people that I've encountered
Say they wish that they were free

And I know that secretly
All those people would really like to be me

So even though they tell me I'm idle
Why should I do what they say
For they're in the same place all the time
But I'm only there for a day

So I'm just sitting doing nothing
Wondering where I should go
