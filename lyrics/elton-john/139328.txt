Baby what's wrong
Is it something that someone has said about me
What have you heard
Is there anything that you want to say to


And baby please don't you cry
Don't let the tears drown your eyes
Baby listen to what I say
I love you and that's all that matters

Come and sit down
And tell me just what is wrong with you
Don't you believe
The stories that tell you that I'm not true

I'd like to know
About the things you have heard
I'd hate to think of the things
Which mighht have occured

Baby believe me
I'll always love you
And please, please don't you cry
Don't let the tears drown your eyes
Baby listen to what I say
I love you and that's all that matters
