He would recount the stories he had learned so well
Fourteen years is a long time in one cell
When the pipe is passed the opium does its rounds
Papa Legba sitting pretty in a chicken little town


His textured skin, like leather in the sun
Fingers beating hard upon a native drum
He picks his teeth with a splintered back rib bone
Papa Legba bears his fangs and lays alone

Hey Papa Legba, hoo-boo-be-do
Hey Papa Legba, no one gonna bother you
Hey Papa Legba, hoo-boo-be-do
Shake Papa Legba, no one's gonna bother you tonight, alright

He was free to dance alone where the spirits run
His almond eyes would twinkle on a hundred sons
His champagne toast and white meat on a spit
Papa Legba's drunken with a smile upon his lips
