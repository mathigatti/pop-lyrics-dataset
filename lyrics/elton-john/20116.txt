You're not a ship to carry my life
You are NAILED to my love in many lonely nights
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love.  Your love protects my fears


And I wonder sometimes, and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
Oh I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold

Did you paint your smile on when I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you
We're related in feeling, but you're high above
You're pure and you're gentle, with the grace of a dove

And I wonder sometimes, and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
Oh I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold
