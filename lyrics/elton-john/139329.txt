Well, she swept through the church
Like a sweet sunday prayer
While the choir sang "Son of Heaven"
And the groom just walked on air


I was killing time with Jesus
When the wedding bells began
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Getting married to a handsome man

And she walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name

Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

In the shadow of the holy
Oh, I heard my tell-tale heart
Whisper words that never reached her
As her vows were made at last

Oh, the preacher with his blessing
Pronounced them man and wife
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Make a promise to be kept for life
