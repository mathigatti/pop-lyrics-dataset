Take me in my dreams recurring 
Cheerful as a childhood dance 
Into one more taste of freedom 
One more longing backward glance 


In the sway of somber music 
I shall never, never understand 
Let me slip into the sweeter 
Chorus of that other land 

The gods love Nubia, the beautiful, the golden 
The radiant, the fertile, the gentle and the blessed 
The pain of Nubia is only of the moment 
The desolate, the suffering, the plundered, the oppressed 

The gods love Nubia, their glorious creation 
Their songs roll sweetly across the harvest plain 
The tears of Nubia, a passing aberration 
They wash into the river and are never cried again! 

(picks up speed) 

The gods love Nubia, we have to keep believing 
Though scattered and divided, we are still its heart 
The fall of Nubia, ephemeral and fleeting 
The spirit always burning though the flesh is torn apart 
Oh, yeah 

(pure gospel sound) 

Take me in (Take me in) 
My dreams recurring (My dreams recurring) 
Cheerful as (Cheerful as) a childhood dance (a childhood dance) 
Oh, into one (into one) more taste of freedom (more taste of freedom) 
One more longing backward glance (one more longing backward glance) 

The gods love Nubia, oh the beautiful (the beautiful) 
The golden (the golden) the radiant (the radiant) the fertile (the fertile) 
the gentle and the blessed (and the blessed!) 

The pain of Nubia is only of the moment 
The desolate (the desolate) the suffering (the suffering) 
The plundered, the oppressed 

The gods love Nubia, we have to keep believing 
Though scattered and divided we are still its heart 
The fall of Nubia, ephemeral and fleeting 
The spirit always burning though the flesh is torn apart 
The spirit always burning though the flesh is torn 
(Aida) 
Is torn apart 

(Chorus) 
Take me in my dreams recurring 
One more longing backward glance
