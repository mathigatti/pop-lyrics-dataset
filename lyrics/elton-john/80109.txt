Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time I look away
I find a hiding placeIf you knew me like you knew him
You would know just how I feel
Slipping through someone's fingers
Falling under someone's wheelsIt's easier to walk away
Better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom
Walk away and don't look backNever seen you looking back through
Smiling eyes and tears
Never knew you holding on to
Memories and fearsJust release me I can't take it
Can't you see a change has come
Strangled by infatuation
Buried under someone's thumbIt's easier to walk away
Cover and fade to black
When love scars and leaves you branded
Walk away and don't look backEvery time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time I look away
I find a hiding place
