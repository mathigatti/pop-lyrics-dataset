I don't make the rules around here
A tear starts at the edge
It takes two hands to rip it
It takes a lot more than either one of us has said


But I come from indecision
A place you ain't never been
Living in the state of confusion
On a map that runs like the veins under your skin

We got Miss Communication kicking out the stool
We got mass determination making up the rules
But saving us is something that we can't do
And it's easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool

And love is just another means
by which we hang ourselves
It takes two to execute
One to leave with innocence and one to leave with guilt

But I just see no reality
Just shades drawn on remorse
We've whipped this beast beyond the limit
Staggered out of breath along this course

It's easier to lose a rope around a fool
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool
A ring of your indifference thrown anywhere you choose
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool
Rope around a fool
