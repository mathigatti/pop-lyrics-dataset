I work for the foundry for a penny and a half a day
Like a blind street musician I never see those who pay
It's dirty work in Birmingham
Better deal for a Sheffield man
If he can rivet then his kids can buy
Candy from the candy man


And the van that comes around weekends
Selling fancy city things
Sold by the man with the trilby hat
And the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh you can hear him sing
Can I put you on, people can I put you on
Tell you that I love you people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on

And a second cousin works in the pits in Newcastle on Tyne
And he don't care if it rains outside, there's coal dust on his mind
It's dirty work in Manchester
But the crew gets paid its gelt
Bang on the bell on Friday
You buys a little something for yourself

And the van that comes around weekends
Selling fancy city things
Sold by the man in the trilby hat
And the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh you can hear him sing
Can I put you on, people can I put you on
Tell you that I love you people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on
