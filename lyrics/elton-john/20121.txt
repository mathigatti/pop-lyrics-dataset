When I look back
Boy, I must have been green
Boppin' in the country
Fishin' in a stream


Lookin' for an answer
Trying' to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights
Honey, I was blind

They said, get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh, oh, oh, oh, the change is gonna do me good

You better get back, Honky Cat
Livin' in the city ain't where It's at
It's like tryin' to find gold in a silver mine
It's like tryin' to drink whisky from a bottle of wine

Well I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high class ladies
Down in New Orleans
And all the folks back home, well, said I was a fool
They said, oh, believe in the Lord
Is the golden rule

They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh oh oh oh, oh, change is gonna do me good

They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh oh oh oh, oh, change is gonna do me good

They said stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
Livin' in the city, boy
Is gonna break your heart
But now can you stay when your heart says no
How can you stop
When your feet say go

You better get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh oh oh oh, oh, change is gonna do me good

You better get back, Honky Cat
Livin' in the city ain't where It's at
It's like tryin' to find gold in a silver mine
It's like tryin' to drink whisky from a bottle of wine

Get back honky cat, get back honky cat, get back
