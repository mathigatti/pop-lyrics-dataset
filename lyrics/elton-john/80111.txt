Why's it never light on my lawn,
Why does it rain and never say good-day to the new-born?
On the big screen they showed us a sun,
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one


And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey sealI

never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye.

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey sealI

Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots, your roots were twisted then
I was re-born before all life could die
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I.

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey sealI.
