"I meant to do my work today
The brown bird sang in the apple tree
I know that's why....
And a butterfly flittered accross the field
And all the leaves were calling me
And the buttercups nodded their smiling heads
Greeting the bees who came to call
And I asked the lizard the time of day....."
And the wind went sighing over the land,
Tossing the grasses to and fro,
And a rainbow held out its shining hand
