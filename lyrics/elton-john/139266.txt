Steamboat waiting by the waterside
Sunlight shining on the morning tide
Got my ticket in my hand
Got some celebrating planned


Can't remember when I felt so fine
I've been waiting such a long long time
Just to hear those engines hum
Look out dreamboat here I come

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
All aboard, make it fast
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last

If you love me like you did before
Be there waiting on the distant shore
When my steamboat comes inside
Then I know we'll be alright

And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride
Stem on steamboat to the other side
Turn the crank, change the gear
Raise the flag and let's get out of here

Feels so good to know that soon I'll see
You've been saving all your love for me
For honey if there's any doubt
Just be sure I don't find out

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Cast the line, check the fuse
save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise

Tell the captain not to take too long
Keep that big wheel turning fast and strong
Fires are burning down below
Come on steamboat don't be slow

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Wind the springs, set the course
Pull some strings before I turn to force

Dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Ring the bell, sound the horn
Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
All aboard and make it fast
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last

And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride
Stem on steamboat to the other side
Turn the crank, change the gear
Raise the flag and let's get out of here

Dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Cast the line, check the fuse
save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise

You're me dreamboat, yes you are

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Ring the bell, sound the horn
Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born

You're my dreamboat, yes you are
