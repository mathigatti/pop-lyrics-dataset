Oh little Jeannie, you got so much love, little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes and give it to the likes of me
Oh little Jeannie, she got so much love, little Jeannie
So I see you when I can, you make me all a man can be


And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh little Jeannie, you were always someone's fool

Little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years, you still retain the fears of youth
Oh little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
But you're burning it up so fast, searching for some lasting truth

And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others who would treat you cruel
But oh Jeannie, I will always be your fool

And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others, and I've known quite a few
But oh oh Jeannie, I'm still in love with you

Stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh Jeannie I'm so in love with you
Stepped into my life from a bad dream
