Nothing looks as bad
After staying up all night
And the cruel words that cut you down
I never meant to write
And what came out as anger
Oh was a lack of self control
Billy won't you hold me
Once before you go


Clever lies keep coming
Some men never change
I'm a hand that's raised in anger
The blow that causes pain
But I just can't be trusted
with a bottle and a child
Billy it's no wonder
You say I've never tried

Oh so leave me now
Oh don't turn around
It's the best thing you ever did
But it's hard for me to say goodbye
To Billy and the kids
