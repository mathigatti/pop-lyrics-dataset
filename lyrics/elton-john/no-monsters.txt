I dreamt in color for the first time
Finding someone I could trust
You felt like melting into honey
After years of seeing love being to rust


Picked up the phone and found your voice
Warming up my point of view
You asked if I recalled your name
And with a smile I said, "Oh I remember you"

I made mistakes that I regret now
I don't deny our rocky star
But I was damaged and adrift then
Afraid I'd break your pure and perfect heart

No monsters anymore
They're all behind me now
You were standing in the airport
I still remember how
After all these years
Thinking back I'm sure
I knew right then and there
There'd be no monsters anymore

You were the one so sure I'd love you
Though I just needed breathing space
And it still haunts me after years now
I could have lost it all without your trust and faith

I'd lived a lifetime in a short while
Each time i thought I'd got it right
I went stumbling through those minefields
Tired and worn out by the constant fight

I made mistakes that I regret now
I don't deny our rocky star
But I was damaged and adrift then
Afraid I'd break your pure and perfect heart

There'd be no monsters anymore
