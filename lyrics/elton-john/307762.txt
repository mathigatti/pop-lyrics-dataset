A few more days and we'll be home in glory
Already they'll be getting out the flags
With Memphis, high, in mode adulatory
For me, I only see a lot of snags


The prospect above all I find distressful
Is having to give up the soldier's life
If anything I'm rather too successful
They made me hand my sword in for a wife

For just because I've triumphed as a slaver
Brought booty back to Egypt by the ton
Of this and every month, I'm now the flavor
And scheduled to do things I've never done

And why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met
A woman who in hours from now I'll certainly forget
Anonymous and undemanding
Enchantment passing through
My secrets and my confidence are safe enough with you

My days out on the field are all but ended
They'll put me out to grass which means the throne
Bedecked and bejeweled alongside my intended
I feel as though my heart is set in stone

But maybe I am being far too gloomy
Yes, maybe I'll make waves in pastures new
Find goverment and politics come to me
As naturally as I now talk to you

For just because I've triumphed as a slaver
Brought booty back to Egypt by the ton
Of this and every month, I'm now the flavor
And scheduled to do things I've never done

And why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met
A woman who in hours from now I'll certainly forget
Anonymous and undemanding
Enchantment passing through
My secret lack of confidence is safe enough with you

Why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met
A woman who in hours from now I'll certainly forget
Anonymous and undemanding
Enchantment passing through
My secret lack of confidence is safe enough with you
