Did you see the first man on the moon? 
Have you seen the first light of day? 
When there wasn't someone stuck inside 
Something like the moon 
Something like a star that's lost its way 
Did you go to Dallas on that day? 
Have you been to where they broke a dream? 
Where there really isn't room for doubt 
Somehow we got lost 
And the truth is buried somewhere inbetween 


And everyone, everywhere 
Take time and dry your eyes 
'Cause too many tears, too many tears 
Have been cried 
Just look into that beautiful blue 
That beautiful blue, blue sky 
And know too many tears, too many tears 
Have been cried 

The mystery of why they had to leave 
I'm only one of thousands saying why 
Why a balcony in Memphis Tennessee 
Seems trapped in time 
Just an angry finger pointing at the sky 

Would you wait to stand inside his shoes? 
And is the best all you have to give 
The barefoot man lived a simple life 
I guess he knew 
Something's die so other things might live 

So everyone, everywhere 
Take time and dry your eyes 
'Cause too many tears, too many tears 
Have been cried 
Just look into that beautiful blue 
That beautiful blue, blue sky 
And know too many tears, too many tears 
Have been cried 

Oh come on everyone, everywhere 
Take time and dry your eyes 
'Cause too many tears, too many tears 
Have been cried 
Just look into that beautiful blue 
That beautiful blue, blue sky 
And know too many tears, too many tears 
Have been cried
