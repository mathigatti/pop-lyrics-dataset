And when we start say forever
We say we care, we need, we feel
We read the movement of our eyes
But in our hearts we still believe


The end will come, before we know
The silent rule of love applies
We light the fuse and let it burn out
We just accept that love must die

And so they say, the end will come for us
And so the world, slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
But I don't believe, I don't believe
That the end will come for us
No I won't believe, the end will come for us

The end will come like sudden rain
The end is never what it seems
We sink the ship before it sails
We just accept what failure means

And so they say, the end will come for us
And so the world, slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
But I don't believe, I don't believe
That the end will come for us
No I won't believe, the end will come for us

And so they say, the end will come for us
And so the world, slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
But I don't believe, I don't believe
That the end will come for us
No I won't believe, the end will come for us

Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
But I don't believe, I don't believe
That the end will come for us
No I won't believe, the end will come for us
