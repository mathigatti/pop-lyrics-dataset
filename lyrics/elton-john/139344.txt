It ain't gonna be easy from now on
You've been messing around while I've been gone
But sometimes telling the truth can be unkind
Folks who suffer guilt can be so blind


It ain't gonna be easy, I can tell
Just how empty I'm feeling you know damn well
I'm telling you it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out, honey, you're playing with my heart

It ain't gonna be easy that's for sure
Changing things back the way they were before
Once you've lifted the lid on such pain
It ain't easy to put it back again

It ain't gonna be easy to forget
You've been seeing a man that I ain't met
I'm telling you that it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out, baby, you're playing with my heart

It ain't gonna be so easy this time around
Turning back the clock on what's gone down
Oh there comes a time when you need to make a stand
You gotta play your cards or fold a losing hand

And it ain't gonna be easy, that's no lie
But if you're willing to try it so am I
It ain't gonna be so easy from the start
You better look out, darling, you're playing with my heart
