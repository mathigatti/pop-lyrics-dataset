Are you still in control of the boat that you row
Or do you still cling to me when it's sinking?
I never condemnde you. I only consoled you
When candlelight made me a King


For the wide-eyed and laughing
Passed like a season
Erasing a passion to sin
For no-one kenw better than the tealeaves and the tarots
That the wide-eyed and laughing
Where just one step ahead of the wind

And the hearts that you played on the porch swing for me
Was a song that I'd heard in the past
For I had an audience somewhere inside you
That applauded whenever you laughed

Gone is a word that I now rarely use
Though sometime in the course of the day
I go racing back like a man possessed
By the wide-eyed and laughing daughters of some different age
