I'm counting on a memory to get me out of here
I'm waiting for the fog around this spooky little town to clear
All this time I spent being someone else's friend
Just one more time, for old time's sake
I'd like to go back home again


The world had seven wonders once upon a time
It's sure enough the favored nations aided their decline
And all around me I've seen times like it was back when
But like back then, I'd say amen
If I could get back home again

If I could go back home
If I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving
But wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again

Could have been a jailbreak and a spotlight hitting me
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963
In the old part of Valencia, on the coast of Spain
Never tiring once of hearing songs about going home again

If I could go back home
If I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving
But wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again

If I could go back home
If I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leavin
But wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again
