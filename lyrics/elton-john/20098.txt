Remember belgium
And the brussels museum
Where we piled on the front steps
Like stray cavaliers
Our code of living
Meant little to others
The few francs we saved
Bought some cheap souvenirs


But the red lights where the catfights
Make it just like belgium
See us face down on the floor
Of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out
Of your spare change
And your swee madame makes it seem
Just like belgium
Just like belgium

Just like a hustler
When they look attractive
ItÂ´s nothing much more
Than a slap on the back
The price tag of being
Just a little bit different
The first rule to learn
Is to keep your own distance

But the red lights...
