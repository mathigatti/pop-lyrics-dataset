And it's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people who made you cry


I believe in the ___ of every man
Where ___ take notice of ___
If you see the road turning straight ahead
Got to run on down, never never be afraid

I know a man, well he's six feet tall
Buckskin jacket ____
From the Boston town, yeah, is educated well
And he ____ about himself

Behind the curtain, upon the shelf
Lived a man ___
Behind his his eyes, behind his smile
What's going on, anybody in the world can tell
