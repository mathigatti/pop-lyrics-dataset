Don't close the shades
I'm scared of the darkness
I'm cold as a razor blade
Inches from madness


Don't let me sleep here
They're all trying to kill me
I've seen the walls moving
They've all heard me screaming, screaming

Feed me
Feed my needs and then just leave me
Let me go back where you found me
`Cause I miss my basement
The sweet smell of new paint
The warmth and the comforts of home
So feed me
Give me my treatment and free me
My arms are so hungry so feed me

The room's so distorted
And filled with mad shadows
I feel like a carcass
White like a marrow bone

It all seems so long ago
I remember them laughing
I heard the ambulance scream
I saw the red light flashing, flashing
