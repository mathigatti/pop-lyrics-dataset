There was a time
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun
I need to tell ya
How you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay


And I can´t explain
But  there´s something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It´s that feeling I get about you deep inside
And I can´t describe
But there´s something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

With a smile
You pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty
I´m speechless and I don't know where to start

And I can´t explain
But there´s something about the way you look tonight
Oh takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you deep inside
And I can´t describe
But there´s something about the way you look tonight,
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
