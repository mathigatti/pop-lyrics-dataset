[Amneris]
It's so strange he doesn't show me
More affection that he needs
Almost formal, too respectful
Never takes romantic leads
There are times when I imagine
I'm not always on his mind
He's not thinking what I'm thinking
Always half a step behind
Always half a step behind


Oh,  oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh

[Radames]
I'm in every kind of trouble
Can't you tell? Just look at me
Half ecstatic, half dejected
All in all I'm all at sea
Easy terms I thought I wanted
Fill me now with chilling dread
You could never know the chaos
Of a life turned on it's head,
Of a life turned on it's head
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Radames &amp; Amneris]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Aida]
I am certain that I love him
But a love can be misplaced
Have i compromised my people?
In my passion and my haste?
I could be his life companion
Anywhere but where we are
Am I leader? Am I traitor?
Did I take a step to far?
Did I take a step to far?

(Begin singing Amneris' Part Again)
(Begin singing Radames' Part over Amneris)
(Begin singing Aida's Part over Rademes)

[Aida]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Aida &amp; Radames]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Aida, Radames &amp; Amneris]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Did I take a step too far?
