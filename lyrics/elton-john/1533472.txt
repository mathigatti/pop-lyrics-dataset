They must have had the whole thing planned
There must have been a hundred
If we make a stand I think we'll be outnumbered
If I'd had the chance then I could understand
Why I'm a juvenile delinquent in an East End gang


And if you think you've seen gasoline
Burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, tell yourself it's good to be
It's good to be alive, oh

Just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
Those street kids making news just being around

I've been bottled and been brained squealers can't be trusted
If we fight tonight you can bet we'll all be busted
I'd like to break away from the rut I'm in
But beggars can't be choosers, yeah and I was born to sin

And if you think you've seen gasoline
Burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, tell yourself it's good to be
It's good to be alive, oh

Just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
Those street kids making news just being around

Hey for the street kids making news just being around
Let's hear it for the street kids making news just being around
Let's hear it for the street kids

And if you think you've seen gasoline
Burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, tell yourself it's good to be
It's good to be alive, oh

Just another street kid making news just being around
Just another street kid, just another street kid
Just another street kid making news just being around
Just another street kid, just another street kid
Just another street kid making news just being around

Street kid, street kid
Making news just being around
Street kid, street kid
Making news just being around
Street kid, street kid
Making news just being around
Street kid, street kid
Street kid, street kid

Street kid, street kid
Street kid, street kid
Making news just being around
Just another street kid, just another street kid
Just another street kid making news just being around

Street kid, street kid
Street kid, street kid
