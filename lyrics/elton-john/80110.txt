I hope the day will be a lighter highway
For friends are found on every road
Can you ever think of any better way
For the lost and weary travellers to goMaking friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all rightIt seems to me a crime that we should age
These fragile times should never slip us by
A time you never can or shall erase
As friends together watch their childhood fly
