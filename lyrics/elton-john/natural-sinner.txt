Sometimes I feel too old to work, too young to die
I'll drink my whisky, I'll keep smoking 'till I die
I wear a suit of sadness made by experience
I believe that in the end time will head what's nagging me

I'm a natural sinner, born a sinner's son
Evil's been my motto, distrust everyone
I'm a natural sinner, born a sinner's son
Evil's been my motto, distrust everyone


Remember _____, now they're not hard to find
Now they ain't got no good side
