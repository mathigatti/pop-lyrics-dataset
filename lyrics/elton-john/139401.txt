You are my weakness
You are my friend
Nothing I have in the world
Makes better sense
'Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea
When we're together
Or when we're apart
There's never a space in-between
The beat of our hearts
'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree


One day at a time
Is all we do
One day at a time
Is good for you, you, you

You are my woman
I am your man
Nothing else matters at all
Now I understand
That I'm the door and you're the key
And every morning
I wake in your smile
Feeling your breath on my face
And the love in your eyes
'Cause I'm the honey and you're the bee
