See my eyes and I see my arms
The seagulls say you've gone
It was just a game of let's pretend
And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears


Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind

If you're quick enough to rise
With the sleep still in your eyes
You'll see the shadow of the sun above my mind
I know that only you can help me now

Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind

But a dandelion sighs
And it tries to tell the wind
That crying's not a bad thing
Worrying is a sin

If they sent a cloud from heaven
I would ride into the skies
To escape all of my troubles
And to cast away your lies

Purple rains have turn to gold
The clouds of yesterday
And a dandelion dies in the wind

I see my eyes and I see my arms
The seagulls say you've gone
It was just a game of let's pretend
And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears

Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind
