I'm not a rat to be spat upon
Locked up in this room
Those bars that look towards the sun
At night look towards the moon


Everyday the swallows play
In the clouds of love
Make me wish that I had wings
Take me high above

And I looked high
Saw the empty sky
If I could only
Could only fly

I'd drift with them
In endless space
But no man flies
From this place

At night I lay upon my bench
And stare towards the stars
The cold night air come creeping in
And home seems, oh, so far

If only I could swing
Upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens
Upon the ones I love

And I looked high
Saw the empty sky
If I could only
Could only fly

I'd drift with them
In endless space
But no man flies
From this place, flies

Hey, the lucky locket
Hangs around your precious neck
Some luck I ever got with you
And I wouldn't like to bet

That sooner or later you'll own
Just one half of this land
By shining your eyes on the wealth
Of every man

And I looked high
Saw the empty sky
If I could only
Could only fly

I'd drift with them
In endless space
But no man flies
From this place, flies

Just send up my love
Ain't seen nothing but tears
Now I've got myself
In this room for years
