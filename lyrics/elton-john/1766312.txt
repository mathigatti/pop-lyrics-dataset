I hear you singing, "I Shall Be Released"
Like a chainsaw running through a masterpiece
But that's all right, that's OK
Grab the bottle and slide my way
You dreamt of a devil down below
Sprinkled cayenne pepper in your sugar bowl
But he's a fool and he's a thief
Got silly little horns and pointed teeth


Roll back the covers and raise the shades
We don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day

There's a canyon where an echo hangs
Like the ancient bells of Notre Dame
It's beyond the hills out of sight
Thought I heard 'em ringing all last night
Hear the mating call of the morning dove
Like Romeo angels in the roof above
Rains will come sweet and clean
Let the tears of God keep the mountains green

One big sun coming up
Old moon going down
Thunder breaking in the east
I'm gonna love you 'til it comes around

You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
