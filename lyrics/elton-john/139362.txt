Some lie about who they love
Some lie about the truth
Some lie to save their lives
Some lie about their youth


Some lie about age and beauty
The conquest of sex
Most lie about the night before
A woman lies for a prty dress

I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you

And we lie, lie, lie
On a streetcar camed desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie
For that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tenesse Williams
If I could only hear something
That sounds like the truth

Some lie in the face of death
Some lie about their fame
Somee kneel and lie to God
Some lie about their name

Some lie in words and speeches
With every living breath
The young lie with their guitars
The old lie for a little respect

I've lied to lie with dabger
I've lied for a drug or two
I've lied about most everything
But I've never lied to you

And we lie, lie, lie
On a streetcar camed desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie
For that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tenesse Williams
If I could only hear something
That sounds like the truth

I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you
