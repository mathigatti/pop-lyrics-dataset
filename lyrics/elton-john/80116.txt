Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on


Want to get on (want to get on)
He want to get on (he want to get on)
Want to get on (want to get on)
He want to get on (he want to get on)

To make a chain of fools
You need a matching pair
One hypocritical fool
And a crawd that's never there
There's anger in the silence
There's wheels upon the jail
A black train bulit of bones
On a copper Rail

Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on

Want to get on (want to get on)
He want to get on (he want to get on)
Want to get on (want to get on)
He want to get on (he want to get on)

Company conductor
You need the salt of tears
Falling on a ticket
That no one's used in years
Non-commercial native
Is tattooed in your veins
You're living in a blood bank
And riding on this train

Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on

Want to get on (want to get on)
He want to get on (he want to get on)
Want to get on (want to get on)
He want to get on (he want to get on)

The spirit's free, but you always find
Passengers stand and wait in line
Someone in front and someone else behind
But passengers always wait in line


Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on

Want to get on (want to get on)
He want to get on (he want to get on)
Want to get on (want to get on)
He want to get on (he want to get on)
