Mighty waves come crashing down, 
The spray is lashing high into the eagle's eye 
Shrieking as it cuts the devil wind, 
is calling sailors to the deep 
But I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear 
Surf is high an' the sea is awash 
An' a haze of candy floss, glitter and beads 
Rock that we sat on and watched in the sun 
That was hot to touch 
And the sea was emerald green 
I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear 
And I can see you smile 
Surf comes rushing up the beach 
Now will it reach the castle wall and will it fall
Catfish dappled silver flashing 
Dogfish puffing bubbles in my deep
