Far, far, far away, way
People heard him say, say
I will find a way, way
There will come a day, day
Something will be done
Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall


Now, now, now is the time, time
Time to be, be, be aware
Carter's father saw him there
And knew the Rhull revealed to him
The glowing soul of Hereward the Wake

Oh, my, something in my eye, eye
Something in the sky, sky
Waiting there for me
The outer lock rolls slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes
Was lucy in the sky

Oh, oh, did you ever know, know
Never ever will they
I cannot say
Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
The psychic emanations fly
