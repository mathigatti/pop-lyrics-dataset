Heaven sent the promised land
Looks all right from where I stand
'Cause I'm the man on the outside looking in
Waiting on the first step
Show me where the key is kept
Point me down the right line
Because it's time
To let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowin' in my soul
And I think I'm growing old
Flash the readies
Wots..uh the deal?
Got to make it to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel
Mile after mile stone after stone
You turn to speak but you're alone
Million miles from home you're on your own
So let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowin' in my soul
And I think I'm growing old


Fire bright by candlelight and her by my side
And if she prefers we never stir again
Someone sent the promised land
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now I'm the man on the inside looking out
Hear me shout
Come on in
What's the news? where you been?
'Cause there's no wind left in my soul
And I've grown old
