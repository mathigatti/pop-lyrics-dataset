In a churchyard by a river
Lazing in the haze of midday
Laughing in the grasses and the graze
Yellow bird, you are not lonely in singing and in flying on
In laughing and in leaving


Willow weeping in the water
Waving to the river daughters
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds
On a trip to Cirrus Minor, saw a crater in the sun
A thousand miles of moonlight later
