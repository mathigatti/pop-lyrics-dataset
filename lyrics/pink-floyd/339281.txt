I'm so afraid of the mistakes that I've made,
Breaking every time that I wake,
I feel like a cardboard and cut-out man,
So give me a time when the characters rhyme
and the storyline is kind.


I've aged an age since the first page,
I've lived every line that you wrote,
Take me down, take me down, from the shelf above your head,
And give me a time when the characters rhyme
and the storyline is kind.

And if I am left on the shelf like the rest,
And if the epilogue reads like a sad song.
Please pick-up your camera and use me again
And give me a time when the characters rhyme
and the storyline is kind.
