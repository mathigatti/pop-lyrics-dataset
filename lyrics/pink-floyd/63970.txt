Ooh, babe
Don't leave me now
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooh, babe
Don't leave me now
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a saturday night
Ooh, babe
Don't leave me now
How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh, babe
Why are you running away?
Ooh, babe
