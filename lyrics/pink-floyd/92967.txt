Come in here dear boy have a cigar
You're gonna go far,
You're gonna fly high
You're never gonna die,
You're gonna make it if you try
They're gonna love you


Well I've always had a deep respect
And I mean that most sincerely
The band is just fantastic
That is really what I think
Oh, and by the way, which one's pink?

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy
We call it "Riding the gravy train"

We're just knocked out
We heard about the sell out
You've gotta get an album out
You owe it to the people
We're so happy we can hardly count

Ev'ry body else is just green
Have you seen the charts?
It's a helluva start
It could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy
We call it "Riding the gravy train"
