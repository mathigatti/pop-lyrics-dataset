Big man, pig man, ha ha, charade you are
You well heeled big wheel, ha ha charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost a joker
With your head head down in the pig bin
Saying: Keep on digging
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find?
When you're down in the pig mine
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry


Bus stop rat bag, ha ha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag, ha ha charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hat pin
And you're good fun with a hand gun
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry

Hey, you, Whitehouse
Ha ha charade you are
You house proud town mouse
Ha ha charade you are
You're trying to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?

You gotta stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside
Mary, you're nearly a treat
Mary, you're nearly a treat
But you're really a cry
