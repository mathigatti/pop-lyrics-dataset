Speech has allowed the communication of ideas
Enabling human beings to work together
To build the impossible


Mankind's greatest achievements
Have come about by talking
Our greatest hopes could become
Reality in the future

With the technology at our disposal
The possibilities are unbounded
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking'
