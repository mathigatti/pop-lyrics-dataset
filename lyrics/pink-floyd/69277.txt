Into the distance a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone my senses real
A fatal attraction holding me fast how
Can I escape this irresistible grasp?


Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue tied and twisted, just an earth bound misfit I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

(Hello again, this is now 129. 4)
129. 4. It's to go
(You may commence your takeoff, winds over 10 knots)
3-8-Echo
Easy on the brakes. Take it easy. Its gonna roll this time
Just hand the power gradually, and it

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, A state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I
