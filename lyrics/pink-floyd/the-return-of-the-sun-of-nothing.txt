Planets meeting face to face
Bound to the air of light, how sweet!
If purposely we might embrace
The perfect union deep in space


Ever might this once relent
And give us leave to shine as one
Our two lights shining better than one light can

And in that longing to be one
The parting "suns" shine as one
I see you've got to travel on
And on and on, around the sun

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And i am you and what i see is me

And do i take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best i can

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
And no one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Cloudless everyday you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise

And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings

A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
And no one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun
