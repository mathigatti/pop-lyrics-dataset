The black and green scarecrow
As ev'ryone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat
Ans straw everywhere
He didn't care...
He stood in a field where barley grows
His head did no thinking his arms didn't move
Except when the wind cut up rough
And mice ran around on the ground
He stood in a field where barley grows
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he's resigned to his fate
'Cause life's not unkind
He doesn't  mind
He stood in a field where barley grows.
