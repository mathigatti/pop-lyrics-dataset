There was a boy whose name was Jim
His friends, they were very good to him
They gave him tea, and cakes, and jam
And slices of delicious ham


Oh Mother, tell me more!

Why’d 'ya have to leave me there
hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They’re scribbly black and everything shines

The chief defect of Henry King
Was chewing little bits of string
At last he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes they did

In finding she was left alone
Went tiptoe to the telephone, 999
and summoned the immediate aid
Of London's Noble Fire Brigade

For all the time spent in that room
The doll’s house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

Oh Mother, tell me more!
Tell me more!

Aaah
Aaah
Aaah
