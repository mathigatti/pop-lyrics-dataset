Remember when you were young?
You shone like the sun
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on, you crazy diamond


You were caught in the crossfire
Of childhood and stardom
Blown on, the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend
You martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed to the light
Shine on you crazy diamond
Well you wore out your welcome

With random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you piper
You prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers
And I'll be joining you there
Shine on, you crazy diamond

And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on, you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on, you miner for truth and delusion
And shine
