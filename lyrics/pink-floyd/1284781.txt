Oh my girl fading in the sun
Go buy a candy and a currant bun
I'm high! Don't try to spoil the fun
Go cry or I'll have another one 


Ooh don't touch me child
Please, you know you drive me wild
Please, you know I'm feeling frail 

Ooh don't talk to me
Please, just walk with me
Please, you know I'm feeling frail 

It's true sun's shining very bright
It's you I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream tastes good if you eat it right
Ice cream tastes good if you treat it right 

Ooh don't talk to me
Please, you know you drive me wild
Please, you know I'm feeling frail 

Oh my girl fading in the sun
Go buy a candy and a currant bun
I'm high don't try to spoil the fun
Go cry or I'll have another one
