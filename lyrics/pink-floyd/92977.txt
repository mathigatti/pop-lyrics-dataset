I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times
Who's gonna show this stranger around?


Oh I need a dirty woman
Oh I need a dirty girl

Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man
Take this rock and roll refugee
Oh, babe, set me free

Oh I need a dirty woman
Oh I need a dirty girl
Oh I need a dirty woman
Oh I need a dirty girl
