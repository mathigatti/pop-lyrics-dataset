Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do


Forward, he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
And the general sat and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who?
Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round and round

Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?
The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

(I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he get off lightly
'Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion, but really
I mean, good manners don't cost nothing do they?)

Down and out
It can't be helped, but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?

Out of the way it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died
