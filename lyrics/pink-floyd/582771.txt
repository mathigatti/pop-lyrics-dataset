Cadence and Cascade
Kept a man named Jade
Cool in the shade
While his audience played
Purred, whispered, "Spend us too:
We only serve fo you"


Sliding mystified
On the wine of the tide
Stared pale-eyed
As his veil fell aside
Sad paper courtesan
They found him just a man.

Caravan hotel
Where the sequin spell fell
Custom of the game
Cadence oiled in love
Licked his velvet gloved hand
Cascade kissed his name.

Sad paper courtesan
They knew him just a man
