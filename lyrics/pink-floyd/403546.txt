Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink
Drink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink


What a way to spend that evening!
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
But in the scene I should have been far away
Away - away - away - away - away
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do?
I can't think what to say
She'll see through anyway
Anyway - anyway - anyway - anyway - anyway

Out of the front door I go
Traffic moving rather slow - arriving late
There she waits looking very angry
As cross as she can be
Be - be - be - be - be

Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget
