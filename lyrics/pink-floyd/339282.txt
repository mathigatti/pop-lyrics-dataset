Would you like to be one in a million?
Would you like to be one in five?
Would you like to know all the hidden meaning?
Before they tell you you've run out of time
Would you like to be one in a million?
Would you like to be one in five?
When they tell you you ain't going nowhere
When they tell you you can't live your life.
(repeat one of the verses...)
