Howling the pack in formation appears
Diamonds and clubs, light misted fog, the dead
Waving us back in formation
The pack in formation
Bowling they bat as a group
And the leader is seen so early
The pack on their backs, the fighters
Through misty the waving the pack in formation
Far reaching waves
On sight, shone right
I lay as if in surround
All enmeshing, hovering
The milder i gaze
All the animals laying trail
Beyond the bough winds
Mild the reflecting electricity eyes
Tears, the life that was ours
Grows sharper and stronger away and beyond
Short wheeling - fresh spring
Gripped with blanched bones, moaned
Magnesium, proverbs and sobs
Howling the pack in formation appears
Diamonds and clubs, light misted fog, the dead
Waving us back in formation
The pack in formation
