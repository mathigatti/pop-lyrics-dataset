Would you like to say something before you leave?
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we've said hello


I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud
From your bed I came today and lost a bloody year

And I would like to know

How do you feel? (How do you feel?)
How do you feel? (How do you feel?)

Not a single word was said, the night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need
I felt the cold far too soon in a room of ninety-five

My friends are lying in the Sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man

Just you let me know

How do you feel? (How do you feel?)
How do you feel? (How do you feel?)

Goodbye to you
Charlotte Pringle's due
I've had enough for one day
