Long live the child and the man
Long live the mother and the lad
The hills behind us and the sea
Reach out to welcome you and me
Valley deep and mountain tall
Lie upon the ground before us all
Strange are the colours of the turf
Heralding the rebirth of the earth
Gather all your energy and try
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
(Everytime you think about it)
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
(Hear me tellin' you)
Give birth to a smile
(Give birth to a smile)
Give birth to a smile
(Give birth, give birth)
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
(Every day of your life)
Give birth to a smile
(Give a little birth to a smile)
Give birth to a smile
