A cloud of eiderdown draws around me
Softening the sound
Sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side
And she's breathing low, and the candle dies


When night comes down you lock the door
The book falls to the floor
As darkness falls and waves roll by
The seasons change the wind is warm

Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields, a cold rain
Is falling in a golden dawn

And deep beneath the ground the early morning sounds
And I go down
Sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side
And she's breathing low
And I rise like a bird,
In the haze when the first rays touch the sky
And the night winds die
