I've got a bike.
You can ride it if you like.
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and
Things to make it look good.
I'd give it to you if i could,
But i borrowed it.


You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything
If you want things.

I've got a cloak. it's a bit of a joke.
There's a tear up the front. it's red and black.
I've had it for months.
If you think it could look good,
Then i guess it should.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything
If you want things.

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.
I don't know why. i call him gerald.
He's getting rather old,
But he's a good mouse.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything
If you want things.

I've got a clan of gingerbread men.
Here a man, there a man,
Lots of gingerbread men.
Take a couple if you wish.
They're on the dish.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything
If you want things.

I know a room full of musical tunes.
Some rhyme, some ching.
Most of them are clockwork.
Let's go into the other room
And make them work.
