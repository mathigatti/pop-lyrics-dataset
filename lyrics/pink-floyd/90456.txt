Stay and help me to end the day
And if you don't mind we'll break a bottle of wine
Stick around and maybe we'll put one down
Cause I wanna find what lies behind those eyes
Midnight blue burning gold
A yellow moon is growing cold


I rise looking through my morning eyes
Surprised to find you by my side
Rack my brain to try to remember your name
To find the words to tell you goodbye
Morning dues newborn day
Midnight blue turned to gray

Midnight blue burning gold
A yellow moon is growing cold
