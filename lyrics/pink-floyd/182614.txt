Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket
Blam, blam, your pointers, point your pointers
Wattle with apples to granchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing buffles on all fours
Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket


Fling your arms madly, old lady with a daughter
Flat top supposes, Moses, hoses
Hiddle and Diddle are sitting back
Watching the telly for all hours
(Telly time)
Fling your arms madly, old lady with a daughter

Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket
Blam, blam, your pointers, point your pointers
Wattle with apples to granchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing buffles on all fours
Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket
