You got to be crazy
Gotta have a real need
Got to sleep on your toes
And when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
Then moving in silently downwind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right
Without thinking


And after a while
You can work on points for style
Like the club tie and a firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's gonna get harder, harder and harder as you get older
Yeah, and in the end, you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

And when you lose control
You'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone

And it's too late to loose the weight
You used to need to throw around
So have a good drown as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

Gotta admit
That I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me
As if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off
This creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground
How can I find my way out of this maze?

Deaf, dumb and blind
You just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable
And no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do
Would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart everyone's a killer

Who was born in a house full of pain?
Who was trained not to spit in the fan?
Who was told what to do by the man?
Who was broken by trained personel?
Who was fitted with colar and chain?
Who was given a pat on the back?
Who was breaking away from the pack?
Who was only a stranger at home?
Who was ground down in the end?
Who was found dead on the phone?
Who was dragged down by the stone?
Who was dragged down by the stone?
