I can take or leave it, won't be the woebegone
Don't need a model universe to hang your pictures on
You hide somewhere, you die somewhere and then this senseless thought:
By hating more, you're feeling more, and that's how you get caught
They're never gonna make it easy, of this you can be sure
I'll greet you from your wilderness, i'll stay inside your door


There is no cage or prison, they have no fence too tall
You die more times than anyone and there's still no place to fall
They're never gonna keep it simple, this comes down from above
I have no helm, no secret realm, i dream to be at the heart of love, a part
Of love

I bet you can conceal it, but that's just a dead-end track
I'll cover you like the driven snow, and then i'll bring you back
You'll see, you'll feel like, you'll feel like a banner, unfurled and gently
Blown
And there before your opening eyes the self you've never known
They're never gonna make it easy, of this you can be sure
You'll feel untied, beatified, and loved forever more...
