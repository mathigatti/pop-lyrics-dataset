Come on, my friends let's make for the hills
They say there's gold but I'm looking for thrills
You can get your hands on whatever we find
'Cause I'm only comin' 'long for the ride
Well, you go your way, I'll go mine
I don't care if we get there on time


Ev'rybody's searching for something they say
I'll get my kicks on the way
Over the mountain, across the seas
Who knows what will be waiting for me?
I could sail forever to strange sounding names

Faces of people and places don't change
All I have to do is close my eyes
To see the sea gulls wheeling in those far distant skies
All I want to tell you, all I want to say
Is count me in on the journey
Don't expect me to stay
