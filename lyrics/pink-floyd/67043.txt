Take all your overgrown infants away somewhere
And build them a home, a little place of their own.
The Fletcher Memorial
Home for Incurable tyrants and kings


And they can appear to themselves every day
On closed circuit T.V.
To make sure they're still real
It's the only connection they feel
"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, Reagan and Haig
Mr. Begin and friend, Mrs. Thatcher and Paisly
"Hello, Maggie!"
Mr. Brezhnev and party
"Who's the bald chap?"
The ghost of McCarthy
The memories of Nixon
"Goodbye!"
And now, adding color, a group of anonymous latin-american Meat packing glitterati

Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?
They can polish their medals and sharpen their
Smiles and amuse themselves playing games for awhile
Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead

Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye
With their favorite toys
They'll be good girls and boys
In the Fletcher Memorial Home for colonial wasters of life and limb

Is everyone in?
Are you having a nice time?
Now the final solution can be applied
