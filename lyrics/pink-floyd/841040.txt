Following the path as it leads toward 
The darkness in the north 
Weary stranger's faces show their sympathy 
They've seen that hope before 


And if you want to stay for a little bit 
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit 
For you the night is beckoning 
And now you can't delay 
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way 

Mystery swelling, creatures crawling 
Hear the roar ger louder in your ears 
You know the folly was your own 
But the force behind can't conquer all you fears 

And if you want to stay for a little bit 
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit 
For you the night is beckoning and you know 
And now you can't delay 
You hear the night birds calling you 
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way 

Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when love was life with every morning 
Perhaps a day will come when the match for me the
curlers past warning 

And if you want to stay for a little bit 
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit 
For you the night is beckoning 
And now you can't delay 
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way
