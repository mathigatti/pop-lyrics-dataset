Wasting my time, 
Resting my mind 
And I'll never pine 
For the sad days and the bad days 
When we was workin' from nine to five. 
And if you don't mind 
I'll spend my time 
Here by the fire side 
In the warm light and the love in her eyes. 
And if you don't mind 
I'll spend my time 
Here by the fire side 
In the warm light of her eyes
