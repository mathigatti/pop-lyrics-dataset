The path you tread is narrow and the drop is shear and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by
Apprehension creeping like a tube train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final cuplet rhyme
And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline
Please wake me


Butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in there's no where you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling colored photographs to magazines back home
And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline
Please wake me

The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
Suddenly it strikes you that they're moving into range
Doctor Strange is always changing size
And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline
Please wake me

And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline
