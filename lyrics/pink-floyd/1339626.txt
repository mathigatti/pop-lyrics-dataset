He's the little boy 
That Santa Claus 
Forgot
And goodness knows 
He didn't want a lot
He sent 
A note to Santa 
For some soldiers 
And a drum
It broke 
His little heart 
When he found 
Santa didn't come


In the street 
He envies 
All those lucky boys
Then wanders home 
To last year's 
Broken toys
I'm so sorry 
For that laddie 
He hasn't got 
A daddy
The little boy 
That Santa Claus 
Forgot

I'd like 
To tell you 
About a boy 
Who lives 
Across the way
To this little guy
Well, Christmas 
Is just another day
So tell you 
Kids this story 
And hug them close 
And hold them near
And hope 
That little boy 
Will have 
A real Christmas 
This time next year

In the street 
He envies all 
Those lucky boys
Then wanders home 
To last year's 
Broken toys
I'm so sorry 
For that laddie 
He hasn't got 
A daddy
The little boy 
That Santa Claus 
Forgot
