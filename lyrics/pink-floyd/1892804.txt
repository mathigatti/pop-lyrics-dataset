{a version of grantchester meadows}

Icy wind of night, be gone
This is not your domain
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied a deathly silence that lay all around
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog-fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the king-fisher
Flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea


In the lazy water meadow i lay me down
All around me, golden sunflakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday in to my city room
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog-fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the king-fisher
Flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down.
All around me,
Golden sunflakes covering the ground,
Basking in the sunshine of a by gone afternoon,
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room.
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea.
