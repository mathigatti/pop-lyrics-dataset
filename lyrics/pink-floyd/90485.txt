Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war in 1944


Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red, and blue
He found it in the zoo

Dear, dear were they really sad for me?
Dear, dear will they really laugh at me?

Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?

Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain
He's never been the same
No one is to blame

Corporal Clegg recieved his medal in a dream
From Her Majesty the Queen
His boots were very clean
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?

Corporal Clegg
Corporal Clegg
