Leave, when I ask you to leave, Lucy
Please, far away from me, Lucy
Oh, go little girl
Seen, is (oh so) broken up about you, Lucy
Mean, treat me and done me harm, Lucy
Been, in love with you and your charms, Lucy
Oh, go little girl
I'm in love with you, Lucy


You got my heart
You got my heart, oh no!
You tear me apart
You just won't let me go
You hold on so tight, so tight I just can't breath
Now Lucy leave, Lucy

Leave, when I ask you to leave, little girl
Please, far away from me, little girl
Yeah! go little girl
Seen, is (oh so) broken up about you, Lucy
Yeah!
Go.
