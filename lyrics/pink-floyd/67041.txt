In my rear view mirror, the Sun is going down
Sinking behind bridges in the road
And I think of all the good things
That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions
Confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come


The rusty wire that holds the cork
That keeps the anger in
Gives way
And suddenly, it's day again
The Sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset
Hmm
Could be the human race is run

Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck
(Oh no!)
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear
And you'll never hear their voices
(Daddy, daddy!)
And you'll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore

And as the windshield melts
And my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally, I understand the feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds
Foe and friend
We were all equal in the end

And now the weather
Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers spreading from the east
With an expected high of 4000 degrees Celsius
