Jesus christ, i might as well be dead
I can't see how dangerous
It must feel to me
Training human cogs for the machine
Without some shell-shocked lunatic like me


Bombarding their still soft shells

With sticks and stones
That were lying around
In the pile of unspeakable feelings i'd found

When i turned back the stone
Turned over the stone
Of my own disappointment back home
