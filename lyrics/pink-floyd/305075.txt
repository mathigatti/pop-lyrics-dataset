All is love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small


Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
Never seen the light of day

All around I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear
Red the light and dark the night
I feel my dawn is near

Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Whisper low, here I go
I will see the sunshine show
