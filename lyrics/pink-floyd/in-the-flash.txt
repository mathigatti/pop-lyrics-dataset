So ya thought ya might like to
Go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow


I're got some bad news for you, sunshine
Pink ins't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're going to find out where you fans
Really stand

Are there any queers in the theater tonight
Get 'em up against the wall (get them up)
Now, there's one in the spotlight
He don't look right to me
Them up against the wall (get them)

Now, that one look jewish
And that one's a coon
Who let all this riffraff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint
And another with spots
If I had way, I'd have all of them shot
