Tell me true, tell me why, was Jesus crucified
Is it for this that Daddy died?
Was it for you? Was it me?
Did I watch too much T.V.?
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?
If it wasn't for the nips
Being so good at building ships
The yards would still be open on the Clyde
And it can't be much fun for them
Beneath the rising sun
With all their kids committing suicide
What have we done, Maggie what have we done?
What have we done to England?
Should we shout, should we scream
What happened to the post war dream?
Oh Maggie, Maggie what have we done?
