I always said he'd come to no good
In the end your honor
If they'd let me have my way
I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today
Crazy toys in the attic I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
Crazy toys in the attic he is crazy
They must have taken my marbles away
You little shit, you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should talked to me more often
Than you did
But no you had to go your own way.
Have you broken any homes up lately?
Just five minutes Worm your honor him
And me alone
Come to mother baby let me hold you in my arms
I'm red I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me
Worm your honor let me take him home
Crazy over the rainbow I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in
Crazy over the rainbow he is crazy
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for
The jury to retire
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before of
Some one more deserving
The full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer
Your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with an urge to defecate
But my friend you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers
Tear down the wall
