Hearts break too fast
When the sentimental
Won't stay, won't last
When it's love at first sight
So why are my convictions
Blinded by your spotlight
Can't breathe, can't sleep
Cause the medication
I'll kiss goodbye to my reservations
I know there's other fish out in the sea
Not for me
I want you


If I can't have you
Then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I can't have you
Then all the damage has been done
Baby
We can break these rules
If you wanna have some fun
If you wanna have some fun
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)

Hot beat, cold sweat
Thoughts slippin' under
Can't fight, no threat
Cause there's just no use
One look no hesitation
I'm slippin' into you
Forgive these eyes
These lips are chasin'
No time to waste on an invitation
My shame, my self control
Has suffered enough
And everybody wants to be loved

If I can't have you
Then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I can't have you
Then all the damage has been done
Baby
We can break these rules
If you wanna have some fun
If you wanna have some fun
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)

I haven't seen the best that love has had to offer
They say perfection's always right around the corner
Could be true

But if I can't have you

If I can't have you
Then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I can't have you
Then all the damage has been done
Baby
We can break these rules
If you wanna have some fun
If you wanna have some fun
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
(If I can't have you)

Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you
