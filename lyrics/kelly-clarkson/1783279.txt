Wednesday, never felt so cold here
Found your letter
Didn't know your words could hurt me still
Laying on the ground, nothing I can do
But wait it out
Creeping in, slowly wearing me down
And I remember
Changing everything I used to need
His arms don't fit the way yours did
But at least they're holding me
He will never leave me, he will never break me
Like you do
And he will never be you


So just tonight I let you in
Close my eyes and I pretend
That it's you instead of him
I kiss his face, hold him close
Whisper softly so he won't know
I'm remembering you again
And I remember

Closer, closer than I like to be
Loving him and letting go of you isn't easy
Nothing you can do, nothing he can be
Nothing I can ever say
I'll keep you here till you fade away

So just tonight I let you in
Close my eyes and I pretend
That it's you instead of him
I kiss his face, hold him close
Whisper softly so he won't know
I'm remembering you again
And I remember

I could fight it, try and forget you
I could fight it but I don't want to

So just tonight I let you in
Close my eyes and I pretend
That it's you instead of him
I kiss his face, hold him close
Whisper softly so he won't know
I'm remembering you again

So just tonight I let you in
Close my eyes and I pretend
That it's you instead of him
I kiss his face, hold him close
Whisper softly so he won't know
I'm remembering you again
And I remember you
