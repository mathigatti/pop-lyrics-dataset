I know that I hurt you
With these words that just keeps slipping from my tongue
From my tongue
I know I desert you before you can win
I think you're gonna run, if you don't run
Love is complicated
My heart it hesitates
No love seems far and distant for some
For some
Don't let go I'm almost there
Don't say things you can't take back


Don't you say
Don't you say that you're walking away from me
Lover Stay
Lover Stay
I can't help my mind to think
I won't change if you won't change
My heart breaks when you go away
So lover stay, lover stay with me
Oh oh, Oh oh

I know my first skin is where I'm
Holding to your heart but I'm trying
I'm trying
Letting go is never mean to easy
For no longer but in time
But in time
Love it takes the breath away
Love it leaves no choice to make
Love means everything for some
For some
I will let you in but please
When I do remember one thing

Don't you say
Don't you say that you're walking away from me
Lover Stay
Lover Stay
I can't help my mind to think
I won't change if you won't change
My heart breaks when you go away
So lover stay, lover stay with me
Oh oh, Oh oh
