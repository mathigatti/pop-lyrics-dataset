I´ve been wonderin´ if it´s time
To say what´s on my mind
´Cause I´m in the dark
What was in your heart


(What´s in your heart)
I don´t even know your name
But the thought of you remains
Suddenly my pulse is jumping
Do you feel the same

Talk it over with my friends
And I guess it all depends
How you really feel, but can you comprehend
You could be just around the corner now
Hoping this love is yet to be found

It´s not too late to call my name
So don´t you look the other way
Open your eyes and you´ll see
My heart won´t wait, don´t hesitate
We got a chance, we´ve gotta take
It feels like you could be
Forever part of me

Can be right under my skin (right under my skin)
I don´t know where to begin
Would I look the fool
Should I play it cool
Or jump right in

How am I supposed to know
Whether I should come or go
Think it´s time we let our feelings show
We might let the moment just pass us by
Then it´s gone in the blink of an eye

It´s not too late to call my name
So don´t you look the other way
Open your eyes and you´ll see
My heart won´t wait, don´t hesitate
We got a chance we´ve gotta take
It feels like you could be
Forever part of me
