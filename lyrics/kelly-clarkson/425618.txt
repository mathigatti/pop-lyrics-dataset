I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes yeah
You've built a love but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark


Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems 
The feeling of belonging to your dreams 

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

And there are voices that want to be heard. 
So much to mention but you can't find the words.
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been 
When love was wilder than the wind. 

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, 
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.

Listen to your heart mhmmmmm
I don't know where your going and I don't know why
Listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye
