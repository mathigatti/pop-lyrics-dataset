I can remember exactly how you taste
I still walk the road we met
Watching the time melt away
And I wonder how
can I get you now?
But our worlds-a-changin now


If you're listening
I'm missing
the way you got under my skin
Cause I'm slippin
on your memory
Everything
oh everything I was thinking
I was living your ghost of memories
If you're listening
come back to me

Sometimes I wish I never held your hand
If I never held you I wouldn't have to understand
Why you can't hold me close
Why my heart is chasing ghosts
and why you can't come home

If you're listening
I'm missing
the way you got under my skin
Cause I'm slippin
on your memory
Everything
oh everything I was thinking
I was living your ghost of memories
If you're listening
Come back to me
Oh

All the black inside of me
Mournin' for the heart that couldn't bleed for you
every breath I take you twist your fate right in front of me
I'm needing you

Oh come, come
Come back to me
oh come, come
come back to me

If you're listening
(I know you're listenin')
I'm missing
the way you got under my skin
I'm slipping
on your memory
on everything, everything now
oh, come back to me
oh, oh
come back to me
