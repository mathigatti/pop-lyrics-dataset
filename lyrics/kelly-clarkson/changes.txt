I feel unhappy, I feel so sad
I've lost the best friend, that I ever had
She was my woman, I love her so
But it's too late now, I've let her go


I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

We shared the years, we shared each day
In love together, we found a way
But soon the world, had it's evil way
My heart was blinded, love went astray

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

It took so long, to realize
And I can still hear her last goodbyes
Now all my days, are filled with tears
Wish I could go back, and change these years

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
