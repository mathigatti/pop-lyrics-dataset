Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yule-tide gay
From now on,
Our troubles will be miles away


Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years
We all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
