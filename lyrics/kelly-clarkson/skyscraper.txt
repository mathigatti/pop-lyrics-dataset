Skies are crying, i am watching
Catching teardrops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like
There is nothing left of me?


You can take everything i have
You can break everything i am
Like i'm made of glass
Like i'm made of paper

Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper!
Like a skyscraper!

As the smoke clears, i awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
To watch me while i bleed?
All my windows still are broken
But i'm standing on my feet

You can take everything i have
You can break everything i am
Like i'm made of glass
Like i'm made of paper

Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper!
Like a skyscraper!

Go run, run, run
I'm gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear, yeah

Go run, run, run
Yeah it's a long way down
But i am closer to the clouds up here

You can take everything i have
You can break everything i am
Like i'm made of glass
Like i'm made of paper, oh

Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper!
Like a skyscraper!
Like a skyscraper!
Like a skyscraper!
