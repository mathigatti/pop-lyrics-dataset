I know I've seen that smile before, baby
Tuesday's never felt so cold
Always crossing fingers, holding back
Drawing circles on the floor


Pretending you don't see me
Blinding yourself completely
Running from the hands that hold you up

Hold on this time
I will take you to where you belong
Hold on this time
You don't have to bleed for me

My heart is broken
I get so tired
Chasing shadows in the dark
Why won't you run to me?
Why am I not enough?
Why is loving you so hard?

Pretending you don't see me
Blinding yourself completely
Running from the hands that hold you up

Hold on this time
I will take you to where you belong
Hold on this time
You don't have to bleed for me
You don't have to bleed for me

But I need you to know
That I won't let you go
I will be breathing for you

Whatever it takes
For all of the way
You have my love

Hold on this time
I will take you to where you belong
Hold on this time
You don't have to bleed for me
You don't have to bleed for me
You don't have to bleed for me
You don't have to bleed for me
