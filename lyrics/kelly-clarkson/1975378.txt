I can see the wait there in your eyes
I can feel the thorn in your side
Your knuckles are bruised from a losing fight
One way down a dead end street
Broken glass underneath your feet
You think the day won't break the sunless night


The sun will riiisee
The sun will riiisee
When you've lost your lights
The sun will riiisee
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

I've been in stuck in a storm before
Felt the wind raging at my door
Couldn't move, could't breathe, couldn't find a way out

Somehow my clouds disappeared, somehow I made it here
Maybe just so you could hear me say
The sun will riiisee

The sun will riiisee
When you've lost your lights
The sun will riiisee
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

Although you can't see it
So hard to believe it
Sometimes you just need a little faith
There's an answer to your prayer
And I swear that there'll come a day...

The sun will riiisee
The sun will riiisee
The sun will riiisee

The sun will riiisee
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

The sun will riiisee
