Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind


Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like
A natural woman

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
Cause if I make you happy U don't need to do more

Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like
A natural woman

Oh, baby, what you've done to me
Oooo you make me feel so good inside
And I just want to be close to you
You make me feel so alive

You make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like
A natural woman
