He drowns in his dreams
An exquisite extreme I know
He's as damned as he seems
More Heaven than a heart could hold


And if I tried to save him
My whole world would cave in
Just ain't right
Just ain't right

Oh and I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
He's such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

He's magic and myth
As strong as what I believe
A tragedy with
More damage than a soul should see
But do I try to change him
So hard not to blame him
Hold on me tight
Hold on me tight

Oh cause I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
He's such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

I'm longing for love and the logical
But he's only happy hysterical
I'm searching for some kind of miracle
Waiting so long
Waiting so long

He's soft to the touch
But frayed at the ends he breaks
He's never enough
And still he's more than I can take

Oh cause I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
He's such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

He's beautiful
Just a beautiful disaster...
