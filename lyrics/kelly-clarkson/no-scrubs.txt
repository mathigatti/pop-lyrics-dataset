A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talkin about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so


No, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine, and
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time, and

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

But a scrub's checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit a deadbeat ass

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine, and
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes, son
I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh yes, son
I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty but you don't show love
Oh yes, son
I'm talking to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no
I don't want no, oh

No scrub, no scrub
No, no, no scrub
No, no, no, no
No scrub, no, no

See?
If you can not spacially expand my horizons
Then that leaves you in the class with a scrub never risin'
I don't find a surprise
And if you don't have the G's to please me
And bounce from here to the course of all the seas
So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget to focus on the picture in front of me
I do it clear as DVD on digital TV screens
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular, and then I'll get back to ya
With diamond-like precision
Insatiable is what I invision
Can't detect acquisition
On your friend's expedition
Mr. Big Willie, if ya really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a Silly Ho
Not with T-boz and all my se√±oritas
Steppin' on your fellas but you don't hear me though

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
