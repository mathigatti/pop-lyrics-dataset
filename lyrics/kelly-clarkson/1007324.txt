Looks like I made a mess again
Heartbreak everywhere I step
This fire is getting hot again
But I touch the flame 'cause I'm a curious cat
Creeping where I don't belong
Finding out what I knew all along
Crying all alone
And it's all my fault, all my fault


Yeah, I did it again...again

Oh, I'm getting tired of believing
Even sicker of pretending
That it's not so bad, just wait it out
Oh, I think you're feeding me lies again
The only good man left wasn't him
And that's how I feel right now so just let me be
Let me be

It seems every time I find a good man
He's got a good little wife
I'm not jealous but I won't lie
I don't want to hear about your wonderful life
And babies everywhere I look
Trophy wives with their little black books
At this rate I'm gonna end up alone
It's probably all my fault, all my fault

Oh, another dead end…again

Oh, I'm getting tired of believing
Even sicker of pretending
That it's not so bad, just wait it out
Oh, I think you're feeding me lies again
The only good man left wasn't him
And that's how I feel right now

Bitter pill that I've swallowed
Just how low can my heart sink
Fairy tales from so long ago
Save them for someone that's not smart enough to know

'Cause I, I'm getting tired of believing
IÂ'm through pretending
Yeah I'm broken and sad so I'll sit this one out
Oh I think you're feeding me lies again
The only good man left wasn't him
And that's how I feel right now

How I feel right now
How I feel right now
How I feel right now
Let me be
How I feel right now
How I feel right now
How I feel right now
Let me be
