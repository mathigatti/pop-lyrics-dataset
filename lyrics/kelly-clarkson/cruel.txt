Am I supposed to close my eyes and fall asleep when you're not home?
'Cause I wanna believe you, but I wonder if you're all alone
These nights (these nights)
They take forever long and I can't breathe
I'm tired (I'm tired)
If I could do the things you do to me


You wouldn't like that, no, no, you wouldn't like that
Runnin' round 2, 3 o'clock in the mornin'
Hey, hey, hey you better believe me
Loving you ain't easy
I'm halfway to losing my mind

Don't be cruel
It's takin' all of me to love someone like you, you
Don't be cruel
It's takin' all of me to love someone like you, ooh

Trying to see your side of things, but you've been playing so unfair (ooh)
Talkin' like you love me, but then go on like you just don't care
Look out (look out)
I come swingin' around, can't keep me down
I love ya (I love you)
But I'm losing myself in this run around

Am I being jealous?
Are you being selfish?
Runnin' round 2, 3 o'clock in the mornin'
No, no, no, you better believe me
Loving you ain't easy
I'm halfway to losing my mind

Don't be cruel
It's takin' all of me to love someone like you, you
Don't be cruel
It's takin' all of me to love someone like you

Oh, baby
Don't be cruel, baby (no, don't be)
No, no, no, don't be cruel (no, don't be)
Don't be, don't be, no (no, don't be)
Don't be, don't be (no, don't be)

Don't be cruel
It's takin' all of me to love someone like you (someone like you, yeah)
You're being, you're being so cruel, baby
It's takin' all of me to love someone like you
Don't be
You're being so cruel
