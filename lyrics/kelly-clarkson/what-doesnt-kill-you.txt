You know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know i dream in color
And do the things i want


You think you got the best of me
Think you had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that i'll come running back
Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean i'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and i
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

You heard that i was starting over with someone new
But told you i was moving on over you

You didn't think that i'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me but you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean i'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and i
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

Thanks to you i got a new thing started
Thanks to you i'm not a broken hearted
Thanks to you i'm finally thinking bout me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end...

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean i'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and i
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and i
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
