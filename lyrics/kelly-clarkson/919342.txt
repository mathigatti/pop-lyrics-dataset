Anytime you feel like you just can't hold on
Just hold on to my love and I'll help you be strong
But you're so afraid to lose, and baby I can't reach your heart
I can't face this world that's keeping us apart
When I can be the one to show you
Everything you missed before
Just hold on now, cause I could be the one to give you more
Let you know


[Chorus]
Anytime you need love baby I'm on your side (hey)
Just let me be the one I can make it alright (I can make it alright)
Anytime you need love baby you're in my heart
I can make it alright

I look into your eyes, and I feel it coming through
And I can't help but want you more than I want to
So baby take all of your fears, and cast them all on me
'Cause all I ever wanted was just to make you see
That I could be the one to give you
All that you've been searching for
Just hold on to my love, and baby let me give you more
You know, anytime

Anytime you need love baby I'm on your side (I'm on your side)
Just let me be the one I can make it alright (I can make it alright)
Anytime you need love baby you're in my heart
I can make it alright

And now there's no way out
And I can't help the way I feel
'Cause baby you're the fire and I'll be waiting right here
You know my love is real, baby
Yeah yeah yeah

Anytime you need love baby I'm on your side, you know
Just let me be the one I can make it alright (I can make it all, make it all, make it alright)
Anytime you need love baby you're in my heart
I can make it alright, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Anytime you need love baby I'm on your side (I'm on your side)
Just let me be the one (let me be the one let me be the one let me be the one alright)
Anytime you need love baby you're in my heart (you're in my heart)
I can make it alright
