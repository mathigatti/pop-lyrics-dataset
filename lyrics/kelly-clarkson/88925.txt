Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray


Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed, I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance,
 make a change and breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the Sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance,
 make a change and breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane far away
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, 
make a change and breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the Sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the Sun
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Breakaway
Breakaway
