All the girls can be shakin´ in the bounce tonight
Gonna do it like we do when the bounce is right
If it´s cool we can rock until the morning light 
Can you feel the vibe? 
Tell me can you feel the love?
And these fellas will be checkin´ out the ladies right
And if they´re in the mood then it´s on tonight
All we wanna do is rock until the bounce is right
Make ´em feel the vibe
Tell me can you feel the love?


Hey there sweet thing
I´m feeling the attraction
Are you lookin´ for distraction?
Well you found it here in me

Tall, short, dark, blonde
Who´s the right decision?
Boy I need a vision if you wanna dance with me

Did that girl just look my way?
Look like she just wants to play,
So go over, no I´ll stay
´Cause I don´t know just what to say

Won´t you tell me where you´re from?
Don´t I know you from back home
We really need to be alone
´Cause tomorrow you´ll be gone

All the girls can be shakin´ in the bounce tonight
Gonna do it like we do when the bounce is right
If it´s cool we can rock until the morning light (Can you feel the vibe?)
Can you feel the vibe? (Can you feel the vibe?)
Tell me can you feel the love?
And these fellas will be checkin´ out the ladies right
And if they´re in the mood then it´s on tonight
All we wanna do is rock until the bounce is right
Make ´em feel the vibe
Tell me can you feel the love?

Look at you boy
You really got me flyin´
And you aint even tryin´
That´s why I wanna be with you

There´s no doubt
You´re the hottest thing around here
Come on and say you´ll stay here
We can party till the day is gone
I´ve been watching you awhile
And I really like your smile
I can see you got a line
But I know for right now 
That we could be just fine

Should we really play this game?
Can you tell me what´s your name?
Does it matter all the same?
You can see in my eyes that we´ll meet up again

All the girls can be shakin´ in the bounce tonight
Gonna do it like we do when the bounce is right
If it´s cool we can rock until the morning light 
Can you feel the vibe? 
Tell me can you feel the love?
And these fellas will be checkin´ out the ladies right
And if they´re in the mood then it´s on tonight
All we wanna do is rock until the bounce is right (feel the vibe)
Make ´em feel the vibe
Tell me can you feel the love?
