You said the moon was ours, yeah
You said the moon was ours
To hell with the day
The sunlight will always
Take love away
Brings up suspicions
And we got alibis
But I can see through
Your tear-blinded eyes
Lies, lies, lies
Ohh, lies
I got a stone
Where my heart should be
I got a stone
Where my heart should be
And nothing I do
Will make you love me
I'd leave this time
For break all my pride
Be no more
Use for any disguise
Lies, lies, lies
Ohh, lies
I wanna die
Without pain
I wanna die
Oh, without pain
And all this deception
I can't maintain
The sun, the moon
The stars in the sky
It'd hurt me too bad
If you said goodbye
So i listen to your lies, lies, lies
Ohh, lies
