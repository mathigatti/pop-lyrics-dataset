I think I might be a fortune teller
I read your face just like a letter
The funny thing about forever
Is it comes with a side of never never


I can't buy into what you're selling
And no it's not that I don't want it
Believe me I'd love to close my eyes, enjoy the ride
But you reek of indecision and I...

I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know

You're only gonna let me down
When it counts, you countdown
You're only gonna turn me out
As I burn, you burn out
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
But when I think we could be something
You go and let me down, let me down, oh

I am too smart to let you in here
But I'm just dumb enough to linger
I wanna think that you'll be different
Smoking mirrors are so clever clever
I picked him and things went so bad
Then what you say won't actually happen
I've been dying to open my eyes
See you try instead of always leaving me out to dry

You're only gonna let me down
When it counts, you countdown
You're only gonna turn me out
As I burn, you burn out
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
But when I think we could be something
You go and let me down, let me down, oh

I need to be there when you say you're gonna be
I care to much and you care enough to leave
I want some place to rest my head without worrie
It's not fair, It's not fair, It's not fair, It's not fair
It's not fair to me, cause I know by now

You're only gonna let me down
When it counts, you countdown
You're only gonna turn me out
As I burn, you burn out
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
But when I think we could be something
You go and let me down, let me down

You're only gonna let me down
When it counts, you countdown
You're only gonna turn me out
As I burn, you burn out
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy
But when I think we could be something
You go and let me down, let me down, oh
