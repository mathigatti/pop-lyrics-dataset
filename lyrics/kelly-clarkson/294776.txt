Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half past ten 
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men


It's raining men
Halleluia
It's raining men

Tall, Long, Dark and lean
Rough, and tough as u ever seen

In the thunder
Don't you lose your head
Rip of the roof and stay in bed

It's raining men
Halleluia
It's raining men
single women
