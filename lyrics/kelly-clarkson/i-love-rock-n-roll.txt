I saw him dancing there by the record machine
I knew he must have been about seventeen
The beat was going strong
Playing my favorite song


And I could tell it wouldn't be long
Until he was with me, yeah, me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
Until he was with me, yeah, with me

Singing

I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me

I love rock 'n' roll
Cause it suits my soul
I love rock 'n' roll

I said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
And next thing we were moving on
And he was with me, yeah, me,
And we were moving on
And singing that same old song, yeah, with me

Singing

I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
I love rock 'n' roll (I love rock 'n' roll)
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
(Dance with me)

I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby

I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time
So come and take your time
So come and take your time and dance with me
