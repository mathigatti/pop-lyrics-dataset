I woke up today 
Woke up wide awake 
In an empty bed 
Staring at an empty room 
I have myself to blame 
For the state I´m in today 
And now, dyin´ doesn´t seem so cruel 


And oh, I don´t know what to say 
And I don´t know anyway, anymore 

I hate myself for losing you 
I´m seeing it all so clear 
I hate myself for losing you 
What do you do when you look in the mirror 
And staring at you is why he´s not here

You got what you deserved 
Hope your happy now 
Cause everytime I think of both of you 
It´s killing me inside 
And now I dread each day 
Knowing that I can´t be saved 
From the loneliness of living without you 

And oh, I don´t know what do 
Not sure that I´ll pull through 
I wish you´d know 

I hate myself for losing you 
I´m seeing it all so clear 
I hate myself for losing you 
What do you do when you look in the mirror 
And staring at you is why he´s not here

I hate myself for losing you 

And oh, I don´t know what to do 
Not sure that I´ll pull through 
I wish you knew 
I wish you knew 
And oh, I don´t know what to say 
And I don´t know anyway, anymore 

I hate myself for losing you 
I´m seeing it all so, I´m seeing it all so clear 
I hate myself for losing you 
What do you do when you look in the mirror 
And staring at you is why he´s not here

What do you say when everything you said 
Is the reason why he left you in the end 
How do you cry when every tear you shed
Won´t ever bring him back again
I hate myself for loving you
