Shaking your head like it's all wrong
Before you're here you're already gone
And even with the light all around you
You're all alone in the dark.


You're breaking your own heart
Taking it too far down the lonely road
You say it's just one love
But when it's close enough you just let it go
The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.

Too many tears, too many falls
It's easy to hear behind these walls
But you don't have to walk in the shadows
Life is so hard.

You're breaking your own heart
Taking it too far down the lonely road
You say it's just one love
But when it's close enough you just let it go
The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.
You're breaking your own heart.

It's not too late, I'm still right here.
If only you let go of your fears.

You're breaking your heart
Taking your own heart down the lonely road
You say it's just one love
But when it's close enough you just let it go
The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.

You're breaking your own heart.
