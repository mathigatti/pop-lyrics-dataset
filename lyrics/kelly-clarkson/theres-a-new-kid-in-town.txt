We're looking for The King
The new Messiah
We're following the star
Shining brighter
Old man won't you help us if you can
He shook his head
But he pointed his hand


There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem

I see you've traveled far
Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for
The new Kings pleasures
Well I've heard
That a King might come
But up 'til now there hasn't been one

There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem

There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem
