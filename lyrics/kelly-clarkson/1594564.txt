And I try not to think about dinner for one
Close my eyes and pretend that this house is a home
'Cause I've got to believe
I'm not the only one


And I try not to dream about finding someone
Who might share all the reasons why love hasn't come
'Cause I've got to believe
I'm not the only one

Breathing
I'm not the only heart beating
There's nothing worse than just feeling
The weight of walking alone
Tell me
I'm not the only one

And I keep all my hopes from clouding my eyes
Keep my distance, my chin up, and talk with a smile
'Cause I've got to believe there's more than barely

Breathing
I'm not the only heart beating
There's nothing worse than just feeling
The weight of walking alone
Tell me
I'm not the only one

Empty and crawling
Wincing and falling
Back into this skin
Said I'm leaving
It's not what I wanted
The will I keep on

Breathing
Be the only heart beating
There's nothing worse than just feeling
The weight of walking alone
Tell me
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
Am I the only one?
