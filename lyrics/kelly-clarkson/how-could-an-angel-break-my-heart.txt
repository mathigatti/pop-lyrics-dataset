I heard he sang a lullaby
I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out, thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine
I heard he sealed it with a kiss
He gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because his kiss belonged to me
How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard


Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?
I heard her face was white as rain
Soft as a rose that blooms in May
He keeps her picture in a frame
And when he sleeps he calls her name
I wonder if she makes him smile
The way he used to smile at me
I hope she doesn't make him laugh
Because his laugh belongs to me
How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch may falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah

Oh, my soul is dying, it's crying
I'm trying to understand
Please help me
How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?
