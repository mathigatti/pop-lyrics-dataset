Walkin controdiction I cant understand a word you say
Building up the tension playin all your little games
I'm through tryin intervention didnt work
Your standing there smiling saying thats just how you are
Well the way you are is eating under my skin


You need to get out of my face
You always leave a bad taste when you come around
You seem to like it on the fence
Better pick a side before I knock you to the ground
Your standing in the way
Its time that someone put you in your place
Your standing in the way
If no one will I'll be the one to say
You need to shut your pretty face

All your rambleing all I wanna do is drown you out
Or maybe kick the door in
Ruffle feather weigh you down

You need to get out of my face
You always leave a bad taste when you come around
You seem to like it on the fence
Better pick a side before I knock you to the ground
Your standing in the way
Its time that someone put you in your place
Your standing in the way
If no one will I'll be the one to say
You need to shut your pretty face

Too much of your mouth
I cant ignore it
Any longer

You need to get out of my face
You always leave a bad taste when you come around
You seem to like it on the fence
Better pick a side before I knock you to the ground
Your standing in the way
Its time that someone put you in your place
Your standing in the way
If no one will I'll be the one to say
You need to shut your pretty face
You need to shut your pretty face
You need to shut your pretty face
