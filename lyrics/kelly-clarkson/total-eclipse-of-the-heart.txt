(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit lonely and
you're never coming round
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit tired of
listening to the sound of my tears
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit nervous that
the best of all the years have gone by
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit terrified and
then I see the look in your eyes
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart


(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit restless and I
dream of something wild
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit helpless and
I'm lying like a child in your arms
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit angry and I
know I've got to get out and cry
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit terrified but
then I see the look in your eyes
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart

And I need you now tonight, and I need you more than
ever
And if you only hold me tight, we'll be holding on
forever
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never
be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all
of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time, I was falling in love
But now, I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time, there was light in my life
But now, there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

(Turn around, bright eyes)
(Turn around, bright eyes)

(Turn around)
Every now and then, I know you'll never be the boy you
always wanted to be
(Turn around)
But every now and then, I know you'll always be the
only boy who wanted me the way that I am
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I know there's no one in the
universe as magical and wondrous as you
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I know there's nothing any better,
there's nothing that I just wouldn't do
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart

And I need you now tonight, and I need you more than
ever
And if you'll only hold me tight, we'll be holding on
forever
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never
be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all
of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time, I was falling in love
But now, I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time, there was light in my life
But now, there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
