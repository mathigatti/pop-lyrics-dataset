I know I break your heart
With everything I'm not
Don't ever give up on me
Remember that we're strong
And even as we fall
Don't ever give up on me


These tears I'm holding back, could
Could turn my whole face black and
I don't know if you love me
If you saw me like that
Would you

Would you follow if I turned my back?
Could you love me through this broken glass?
I know, I'm not who I was or where I need to be
But don't ever give up on me
Don't ever give up on me

My heart would tend to run
But even when I'm gone
Don't ever give up on me
I'm trying deep within
If you could hold my hand
Don't ever give up on me

This war I'm fighting in hell, it
It turns me inside out and
I don't if you love'd me
If you saw me right now
Would you

Would you follow if I turned my back?
Could you love me through this broken glass?
I know, I'm not who I was or where I need to be
But don't ever give up on me
Don't ever give up on me

How do you, how do you
Still believe in me?
Even when, even when
All my colors bleed?
Holding out, holding out
Will you love the rest of me?

Would you follow if I turned my back?
Could you love me through this broken glass?
I know, I'm not who I was or where I need to be
But don't ever give up on me
Don't ever give up on me
