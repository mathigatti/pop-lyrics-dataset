For all I know, you could be near 
and every breath I take, you could feel 
For all I know, you're just a thought that crossed my mind 
What I wouldn't give to live that thought of mine. 


For all I know is nothing's changed 
Nothing ever will if I don't leave this place 
For all I know, you're waiting for me to whisper your name 
What I wouldn't give to kiss your sweet face 

Cause all I know is I need you here 
And all I have, I would give away so I could save these tears 
All I feel, oh I tried so hard to not feel 
It's killing me 

For all I know, you forgot me 
For all I know, you're different, completely 
And everything we had was never what I thought it was 
But for all I know, oh it was love. 

Cuz all I know is I need you here 
All I have, I would give away to so I could save these tears 
All I feel, oh I tried so hard to not feel 
It's killing me 

Now everyone has a name 
And every face always somehow looks the same 
I always feel so alone, especially when it rains 
For all I know, boy, you do the same, yeah 

Yeah I didn't know that I need you here 
All I had, I gave away cause I was still afraid to feel 
All I feel, oh I tried so hard to not feel 
It's killing me, it's killing me 

All I know 
All I know 
For all I know
