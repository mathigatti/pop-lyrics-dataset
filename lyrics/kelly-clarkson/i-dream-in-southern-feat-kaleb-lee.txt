Some people dream of what they may be
Where they may go, what they may see
Just down the road around the bend
Oh, but me, I dream of where I've already been


I dream in blue jeans, ol' Fords
Boxe fans, back porch
Cotton growin' up to your knees
I dream in Mississipi moon pies
Mason Jars, Fireflies

William Faulkner, ol' New Orleans
The only Paris for me is in West Tennessee
If I'm never any other when I lay down to sleep
I dream in Houndstooth, Church pews
Rural roots, you'll never outrun 'em
I dream in Southern

I've hung this hat in so many places
I've seen the beauty in so many faces that don't feel like home
But that's alright
'Cause every time I close my eyes

I dream in Blue Bell ice cream
Momma calling through the screen
Suppers almost ready to eat
I dream in football, Graceland

Barbecue and Alabama sand slippin' under my feet
If I can't spend my time in sweet Carolina
Don't take too long 'fore Georgia's back on my mind
I dream in symphonies of trains and crickets
Where it's always Christmas or summer (Yeah, Yeah)
I dream in Southern

They say you can't go back
But I can always come back

I dream in blue jeans, ol' Fords
Boxe fans, back porch
Cotton growin' up to your knees
I dream in Mississipi moon pies
Mason Jars Fireflies

William Faulkner, ol' New Orleans
The only Paris for me is in West Tennessee
If I'm never any other when I lay down to sleep
I dream in Houndstooth, Church pews
Rural roots, you'll never outrun 'em
I dream in Southern

Oh yeah
I dream in Southern
