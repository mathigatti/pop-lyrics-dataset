Saw it with my naked eye
Seeing is believing
Funny when you realize
You gotta stop feeling


Watch you leave my side
When it really matters
Watch you stay faceless
Saying it will be alright
It's alright

Can't take that what you can't change
Can't fix what's more than broken
Can't tell me paranoias to blame
I saw it with my naked eye
My naked eye

Saw it with my naked eye
I'm losing a battle
Were you ever on my side?
It's never been settle
Watch you fall away sad
When it really matters
Watch you waste my heart
You know it's not alright
Alright

Can't take that what you can't change
Can't fix what's more than broken
Can't tell me paranoias to blame
I saw it with my naked eye
My naked eye

Hands all wrapped
(It's too late now)
Words so cheap
(It's too late now)
Broken promises
(It's too late now)
Breaking me

Can't take that what you can't change
Can't fix what's more than broken
Can't tell me paranoias to blame
I saw it with my naked eye
My naked eye
