Rolling down the road
Going nowhere
Guitar packed in the trunk
Somewhere around mile marker 112
Papa started hummin' the funk
I gotta jones in my bones before we know
We were singing this melody
Stop the car pulled out the guitar
Halfway to New Orleans


Said take me home
Take me home

Could feel the sun about to rise
When I realized we had nothing to fear
It's just me and my daddy and a kid named Cope
Making music that nobody would hear
And then the sun let up and it split the night
Spillin' over our jubilee
Ten thousand cars by the side of the road
Groovin' far as the eye can see

Said take me home
Take me home
Said take me home
Said take me home

This Greyhound is delta bound mama
Baby boy finally found
Said this Greyhound is delta bound mama
Baby boy done finally found his way home
Said take me home

Here we go
Hot damn you should have felt the groove
Like I was swimming in a sea of soul
The sun was rising and the day was hot
And we was all about to lose control
My daddy turned his face up towards the sky
And I knew that there was nothing to lose
I felt the crowd breathe in and I closed my eyes
And we disappeared into the groove

Said take me home
Said take me home
Take me home
Said take me home

Straight from the water
Straight from the water, children

You don't know nothin' about this

Take me home
Said take me home
