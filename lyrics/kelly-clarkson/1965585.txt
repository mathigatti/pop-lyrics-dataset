You say it's easier
Alone and undisturbed
You said yes and danced before
And got your feelings hurt
You say most days you're good
It's not so bad this room
What chance the rain today
Even though it's clear and sunny
And you fight it so hard
How to tell if it's real or not


Take a breath and listen
Open up stop wishin'
All that you've been missin'
Standing in front of you
Everything you're fearin'
All the walls you're buildin'
Take a chance you're reason
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you

You start to sway again
Feelin' good in your skin
You start to remember when
You didnt have to try
And then the glitter turns to dust
The color fades enough to make out pictures of a fire
That burns like love
You can close your eyes don't worry
I'll still be here in the morning

Take a breath and listen
Open up stop wishin'
All that you've been missin'
Standing in front of you
Everything you're fearin'
All the walls you're buildin'
Take a chance you're reason
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you

And they wont break us
And they cant get through
Cause I'm gonna be here
Standing in front of you

Take a breath and listen
Open up stop wishin'
All that you've been missin'
Standing in front of you
Everything you're fearin'
All the walls you're buildin'
Take a chance you're reason
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you
Standing in front of you
