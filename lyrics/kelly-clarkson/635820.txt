Hear me,
Don't tempt me anymore,
It was all a dream,
Resist your feelings stranger,


Don't call me, don't write,
Don't lose any sleep over me,
Cause I'm sleeping just fine,
Yeah,

I don't cry,
And I don't want you to anymore,
I'm ok,
You are better as long as you're far,
I don't want you hanging around my door,
Anymore, anymore, anymore,

Hear this, Take the hint and all the signs,
Hear me, I don't want to talk anytime,
I don't know or need you anymore,
And I like it,
Yeah,

I don't cry,
And I don?t want you to anymore,
I'm ok,
You are better as long as you're far,
I don't want you hanging around my door,
Anymore, anymore, anymore,

For once, just let me be,
For once, you can think of me,
For once, I'm happy,
So don't do it, don't ruin it,
Don't say it cause I don't want to hear it anymore,
I know you feel it,
Don't call me, don't write,
Don't lose any sleep over me,
Cause I'm sleeping just fine,
Yeah,

I don't cry,
And I don't want you to anymore,
I'm ok,
You are better as long as you're far,
I don't want you hanging around my door,
Anymore, anymore, anymore,
