You see perfect
Or pretty damn close
You see beautiful
When I know
I'm not what you see
It's not what you think
Inside of me
Inside of me


I'm scared cause I know
I'll screw it up, I'll let you down
So afraid, so I'll walk alone
I'm trying to help you out
Things aren't as they seem
In my heart I have seen who I am
Don't get close
You don't want to come in
The real me isn't what you're thinking

You say you love me
But your love is like a child
You think I'll love you
Even though I tell you otherwise
I'm not you want
I’m not what you need
Why won't you listen to me
Why won't you listen to me, listen to me

I'm scared cause I know
I'll screw it up, I'll let you down
So afraid, so I'll walk alone
I'm trying to help you out
Things aren't as they seem
In my heart I have seen who I am
Don't get close
You don't want to come in
The real me isn't what you're thinking

I know my heart
And I don’t wanna hurt you
I know, my fault
Better than you do
I’m not trying to make you cry
I never wanted to make you cry

I'm scared cause I know
I'll screw it up, I'll let you down
So afraid, so I'll walk alone
I'm trying to help you out
Things aren't as they seem
In my heart I have seen who I am
Don't get close
You don't want to come in
The real me isn't what you're thinking
