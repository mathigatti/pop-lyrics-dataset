[Kya]
Honey, I can tell by the wonderin´ look in your eye, you´re just a little boy
With about a thousand lines


[Kelly]
And the girl you say is always on your mind
Ya just sit and watch her walk outta your life

(Well you) talk too much (and)
Talk is cheap
(And you) change your mind 
(Like you) change your sheets
(And me)
You´re doin´ things that I don´t like 
(But still)
It ain´t right 

[chorus]
(Well, it must be the madness) must be the madness
And the magic that I feel inside
Must be the music
And the rhythm
Playin´ with my mind
Must be the chemistry, you and me
That I can´t deny
I wanna tell you I love you, love you, love you, but I can´t decide

-- bump, bump, bump diget. bump, bump, bump diget... 
DIGET DIGET DIGET - [Kya]
It´s funny, you can´t tell by the way I use my words
That I´m all fed up
And it´s so absurd

[Kelly]
That the whole wide world can see whatchu done
I´m just a simple girl
Not what you want

(Well you) talk a lot (cuz)
Talk is cheap
(And you) can´t handle me 
(And me)
I´m looking for a whole, new vibe
(But still)
You look right

(Well, it must be the madness) must be the madness 
And the magic that I feel inside 
Must be the music (it must be the music)
And the rhythm 
Playin´ with my mind 
Must be the chemistry, you and me 
That I can´t deny (wanna tell you I love you)
I wanna tell you I love you, love you, love you, but I can´t decide 

-- bump, bump - bump diget... bump, bump - bump diget... 
bump, bump - bump diget...DIGET DIGET DIGET - (yeah)

Well, it must be the madness) must be the madness 
And the magic that I feel inside 
Must be the music (it must be the music)
And the rhythm 
Playin´ with my mind 
Must be the chemistry, you and me 
That I can´t deny I wanna tell you 
I love you, love you, love [Kelly: Love you..Love you..] 
you, but I can´t decide
