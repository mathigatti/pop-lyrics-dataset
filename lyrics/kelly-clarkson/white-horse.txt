Say you're sorry
That face of an angel comes out
Just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth
All this time cause
I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl I should've known, I should've known


I'm not a princess
This ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
I never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

I'm not a princess
This ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but, I'm so sorry

Cause I'm not your princess
This ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone some day
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world
That was a small town, there in my rearview mirror
Disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to
Catch me now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Try and catch me now ohh
Its too late
To catch me now
