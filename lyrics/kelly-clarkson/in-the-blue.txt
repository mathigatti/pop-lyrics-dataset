Some days I barely miss you, some days I'm almost alright
And some nights I turn to kiss you but you're not beside my side
Got this same damn conversation playing over and over in my mind
Yeah my heart is wet and heavy but my body's on the run
Cause the night is gonna get me and it's only just begun
I keep livin' on the memory of you and me, you and me in the sun


No matter where you are
A little piece of my heart
Will be forever with you
In the blue, in the blue
In a thousand years
We'll be far from here
I'll be forever with you
In the blue, in the blue

Yeah I'm runnin' from this city like a diamond in the sky
And I'm tryna count my blessings 'stead of all the tears I've cried
I keep driving in this darkness to get you, to get you off my mind
I'll start over in a new place, put my feet back on the ground
Can't believe the mess that I've made, just tryna drown you out
Baby one day I won't miss you, I'll stop looking for you in the crowd
In the crowd

No matter where you are
A little piece of my heart
Will be forever with you
In the blue, in the blue
In a thousand years
We'll be far from here
I'll be forever with you
In the blue, in the blue

I see your face in every stranger
Footsteps down the hall
Warm breath, back of my neck
Shadows on the wall
And your voice is loud as thunder
I can hear it crashing in my head

No matter where you are
A little piece of my heart
Will be forever with you
In the blue, in the blue
In a thousand years
We'll be far from here
I'll be forever with you
In the blue, in the blue
