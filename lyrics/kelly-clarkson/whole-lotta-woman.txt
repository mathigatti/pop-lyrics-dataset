What you say?
She call me fat, girl
This my fat ass


You ain't know?
Texas women do it bigger
What, say it ain't so
In the south it gets no realer baby
Pot full of grits
I'm hotter than your mama's supper boy
Better get with it
Better watch your mouth I might burn you boy
You go, uh downtown go to work
Good Lord like dessert
If you scared go to church
Woo woo, on alert
Hold on tight little country boy
I ain't no girl, I'm a boss with orders
All I'm needin' is a baby love me like a warm biscuit on a Sunday mornin'

I got what you want
I'm aimin' to please
I got what it takes
I sure got the means
I got what you want
Sugar, honey, iced tea
All eyes on me, oh oh baby

I'm a whole lotta woman
From the way I walk and toss my hips
I'm a whole lotta woman
From the sound of my voice to the gloss on my lips
I'm a whole lotta woman
Anything I see, I want, I get
I'm a strong, badass chick with classic confidence, yeah

One time for the green and
Rollin' like Tina
Lovin' hard ain't easy
Woo woo, if you mean it
Hold on tight little country boy
I ain't no girl, I'm a boss with orders
All I'm needin' is a baby love me like a warm biscuit on a Sunday mornin'

I got what you want
I'm aimin' to please
I got what it takes
I sure got the means
I got what you want
Sugar, honey, iced tea
All eyes on me, oh oh baby

I'm a whole lotta woman
From the way I walk and toss my hips
I said, I'm a whole lotta woman
From the sound of my voice to the gloss on my lips
I'm a whole lotta woman
Anything I see, I want, I get
I'm a strong, badass chick with classic confidence, hey

Ain't no competition, babe
It's just can you keep up with me?
I can't do a thing about my wicked ways with gravity
Higher than the leafs that fall from trees like D-O-Double-G's
I reside in Tennessee but Texas still flows deep in me

I'm a whole lotta woman
From the way I walk and toss my hips (hey)
I'm a whole lotta woman
From the sound of my voice to the gloss on my lips
I said, I'm a whole lotta woman
Anything I see, I want, I get
I'm a strong, badass chick with classic confidence, hey

Come on!
Wait, do it againï»¿
