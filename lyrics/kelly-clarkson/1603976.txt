It's not like I don't feel love
The taste of it's warmest touch
It's not like I lose sleep
It's like I don't sleep at all


It's not like I don't hurt like you
The closer I get, I lose
It's not like you don't know love
It's like you don't know the cost

How long til my heart breaks
So much that I can take
One more day, one more hour
Of waiting on something that might never happen
How long til my tears stop
How every salted drop
Bruises the skin, I'm stuck in betrayal
Empty as I am

It's not like I don't want to hold
Every part of you whole
It's not like I can't walk up to you
It's just that I wouldn't know what to do
The smell of you runs
Right through my veins
Thoughts of you linger
How I betray
My broken heart, my stubborn fist
How did our story
End up like this?

How long til my heart breaks
So much that I can take
One more day, one more hour
Of waiting on something, that might never happen
How long til my tears stop
How every salted drop
Bruises the skin, I'm stuck in betrayal
Empty as I am

I see you there
Just out of reach
Whisper your name
Cuz if I scream
I might wake up
You might just be
Only a dream
And if you don't love me

How long til my heart breaks
So much that I can take
One more day, one more hour
Of waiting on something that's not gonna happen
How long til my tears stop
How every salted drop
Bruises the skin, I'm stuck in betrayal
Empty as I am
