I'm hearing sleigh bells
I'm seeing snow
I've waited all year, baby, just to see those reindeer
Watch 'em as they go
Home by the fireside
Twinkling lights
I've waited all year, baby, just to see that sleigh fly into the night


All the lights, all of the fun, all of us here, all of us one
Only a gift, only a toy, only for a good girl and boy
The greatest party you ever did see

I'm hearing sleigh bells (hear those sleigh bells ring)
I'm seeing snow (I see those snowy scenes)
I've waited all year, baby, just to see those reindeer
Watch 'em as they go
Home by the fireside (home by the fireside)
Twinkling lights (all of those pretty lights)
I've waited all year, baby, just to see that sleigh fly into the night

All of the laughs, all of the dreams, all of the songs, all of us sing
Only a wish, only a star, only a leap from where you are
For those who believe on Christmas eve

I'm hearing sleigh bells (hear those sleigh bells ring)
I'm seeing snow (I see those snowy scenes)
I've waited all year, baby, just to see those reindeer
Watch 'em as they go
Home by the fireside (home by the fireside)
Twinkling lights (all of those pretty lights)
I've waited all year, baby, just to see that sleigh fly into the night

A party for you and for me
A party for a magical scene
Ain't no party like Christmas Eve

I'm hearing sleigh bells (hear those sleigh bells ring)
I'm seeing snow (I see those snowy scenes)
I've waited all year, baby, just to see those reindeer
Watch 'em as they go
Home by the fireside (Home by the fireside)
Twinkling lights (all those pretty lights)
I've waited all year, baby, just to see that sleigh flying to the night
