One more song to cover
One more goodbye, lover
One more night I wonder why
One more hope I hope for
One more lie I fell for
One more reason to hide


I keep on giving but I'm lonely now
Lost someone whose settling down
One more face to forget now

Wipe out one more fear,
Add it to the wounds that got me here
Maybe this time I won't fight it
Maybe I will
Keeping your number
when I don't need it anymore
And I don't need you anymore
Maybe this time
Maybe I'll get it right
Oh

One more thought emerges
One more small step forward
It's not easy but I'm getting by
One more lonely night
One more blink of my eye
Finally get some sleep tonight

I keep on living like you're gone for good
And everybody thinks I'm used to
One more fight I've got to lose

Wipe out one more fear,
Add it to the wounds that got me here
Maybe this time I won't fight it
Maybe I will
Keeping your number
when I don't need it anymore
And I don't need you anymore
Maybe this time
Maybe I'll get it

Right now I can't see the reasons
There ain't nothing left from bleeding
Dragging me down cause he's, cause he's sad
Well I thought that this love was different
That you and I were the perfect fit
I didn't think that I would have thought of you ever again

Wipe out one more fear
Add it to the wounds that got me here
Maybe this time I won't fight
Maybe I will
Keeping your number
when I don't need it anymore
I don't need you anymore
Maybe this time
Maybe I'll get it right

Maybe I'll get it right
