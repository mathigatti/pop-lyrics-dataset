I see how your trying to weasel
Your way in
Boy I know how you maneuveur
With your confusion


You tell me that I'm your only
And how bad that you want me
Well then why are you so shady
If I'm supposed to be your lady

Why should I believe anything you say
And how could you shame me that way

Tell me where where did you get the nerve
To even think that you you could
Play me wrong

You thought we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your covers blown
Cause we both know now

You thought you had us fooled
At your beck &amp; call
But now who's the joke
And look who's laughing now

Now your trying to use us against one another
But it won't work

I see right though your game boy
And I know exactly where to play boy
You tried to deny all your actions
For once in your life be a real man
At least give me the proper respect
Of the truth I already know you did it

Why should I believe anyting you say
And how could you shame me that way

Tell me where did you get the nerve
To even think that you could
Play me wrong

You thought we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your covers blown
Cause we both know now

You thought you had us fooled
At your beck &amp; call
But now who's the joke
And look who's laughing now

I see right through you baby
Try not to be like you don't want me
Why don't you get it through your thick head
Cause I've seen this game before
And I'm not trying to see it no more
Shut your mouth
I'm not trying to hear your lies
No not again
Sorry you couldn't be a better man

You thought we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your covers blown
Cause we both know now

You thought you had us fooled
At your beck &amp; call
But now who's the joke
And look who's laughing now
Guess you thought wrong
Look who's laughing now
You stupid
