Drawing hearts on the foggy glass
New love, chase away my past
Nothing but the open road, saddle up, here we go
1-2-3


First winter here in your arms
Flames rising as we fall like the stars
Making angels in the snow, warm fuzzies, frozen toes
Is this a dream?

Don’t wake me up
If this is love
Please, let me be

Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve, I became We
Don’t wake me please
From this winter dream

Winter dream
Winter dream

Build a fire to escape the cold
Bing crosby on the stereo
Tracing letters on my skin, slowly starts sinkin' in
You love me

Oh don’t wake me up
If this is love
Please, let me be

Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve, I became We
Don’t wake me please
From this winter

Dreaming dreams while I’m wide awake
The tree, the lights, staying up late
It’s true
I’m in love with you

Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe scene is turning me
This Christmas Eve, I became We
Don’t wake me please
From this winter dreams

Winter dreams
Winter dreams
