When I was younger I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and
I watched as he tried to re-assemble it
And my mamma swore she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist
But darling...


You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I swored to myself
That I'm content with loneliness,
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

But you are the only exception
But you are the only exception
But you are the only exception
But you are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality,
But I can't let go of what's front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up,
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

Whooa...

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh and I'm on my way to believing...
