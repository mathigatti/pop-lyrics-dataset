Why do we build up all these idols
Just to watch 'em fall?
You're wearin' the crown, toast of the town
Then no one takes your call
Yeah, maybe I been down, down, down, down
But I always come back around, 'round, 'round, 'round, yeah


You can't forget about me
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher
Say what you want about me
Your words are gasoline on my fire
You can hate me, underestimate me
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me
Just when you think I'm at the end
Any second I'ma catch my second wind
Na na na na, na na na na

An airplane's only paper 'til it finds a breeze
But don't you know that it's the low that makes the high so sweet
When they try to break, break, break you
That's when you get your break, break, break through, yeah

You can't forget about me
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher
Say what you want about me
Your words are gasoline on my fire
You can hate me, underestimate me
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me
Just when you think I'm at the end
Any second I'ma catch my second wind
Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na

I been down, down, down, down
But I always come back around, 'round, 'round, 'round, yeah

You can't forget about me
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher
Say what you want about me
Your words are gasoline on my fire
You can hate me, underestimate me
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me
Just when you think I'm at the end
Any second I'ma catch my second wind
(Na na na na, na na na na)
I'ma catch, I'ma catch, I'ma catch my second wind, yeah
I'ma catch my second wind
I'ma catch my second wind
I'ma catch my second wind, yeah

(Na na na na) I'ma catch my second wind
(Na na na na) I'ma catch my second wind
