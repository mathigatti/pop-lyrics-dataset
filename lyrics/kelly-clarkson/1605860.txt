He said:
leave me alone
for a little while
Let it rest, just let it die
Stop pushing me,
It's not time


He keeps her picture
Just in case
Can't remember what was said
But he sees her face all the time
Never says a word
About that day
Never looks back,
"What's the point?"
He says
So he says

He won't break and he won't bend
Tears are for the weak ones and
he wasn't one of them
No he'll never be one of them
So he says

He came home late one night
Thought I was sleeping
Thought I wouldn't hear him cry
In the next room,
that man was dying
Tonight

He said I was too young
to see some things
He's a good man
But a fool to think

But he didn't break and he didn't bend
Cause tears are for the broken and
he wasn't one of them
No he wasn't gonna be one of them
So he says

He was a good man
But a fool to think
That I was too young
That I couldn't see
Through what he said
Through what he said
