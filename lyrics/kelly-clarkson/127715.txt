What you want
Baby I got it, mmm
What you need, you know I got it
All I´m asking, is for a little respect when you get home
Hey baby, when you get home 
Just a little bit, mista


I ain´t gonna do you wrong, while your gone
I ain´t gonna do you wrong, cause I don´t wanna
And all I want you do for me 
Is give it to me when you get home, alright now
When you get home, just a little bit mista

R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it means to me
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, take care TCB

Nooo, a little respect

Gonna say it one more time

R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it means to me 
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, take care TCB

A little respect
