At first I was afraid, I was petrified,
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me


Go on now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause your not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no not I
I will survive!
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
I'll survive
I will survive, hey hey

(Musical interlude)

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in
And just expect me to be free
Well now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Oh now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause your not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no not I
I will survive!
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
I'll survive
I will survive 
Oooh !

Now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause your not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no not I
I will survive!
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
I'll survive
I will survive 

I will survive !
