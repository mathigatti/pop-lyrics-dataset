How's life on that mountain you've been climbin' baby?
Is it what you thought you wanted, what you were needin'?
How's life in that rear view, that mirror you don't mention?
Is it hard seein' how you were and what you're becoming?


When you look back on love do you think of us?
When it's all said and done is it all enough?
When you weigh the loss to all you've gained, tell me does it all add up?
When you look back on us, would you call that love?

How's life in that fast lane, that pavement you've been chasin'?
Is it all greener without me or is something missin'?
How's life with that feelin', that loneliness you're hidin'?
Is it hard thinkin' about me, all that you were given?

When you look back on love do you think of us?
When it's all said and done is it all enough?
When you weigh the loss to all you've gained, tell me does it all add up?
When you look back on us, would you call that love?

We can't go back
We can't undo what's done
A place to rest your head, I hope you find one
I forgive as you forget too much
When you look back on us, would you call that love?

When you look back on love, do you think of us?
When it's all said and done is it all enough?
When you weigh the loss to all you've gained, tell me does it all add up
When you look back on us, would you call that love?
No, would you, would you call that love?
No, would you, would you call that love?
Would you, would you call that love?
Would you, would you call that love?

Baby, would you call that love?
Mâ€™m, would you call that love?
