I'm gunna live it up
i'm gunna let go
i'm not perfect baby
but i'm afull close
i'm gunna stop time
i'm gunna keep em guessin
i'm here to party baby
i'm not here to listen


I just walked inside
and i already caught you lookin' at me
bragin's not my style but what the hell
i'm feelin good
so put the speakers on eleven
shake my body left and right
i'm not lookin for forever
i just wanna dance tonight

Turn it up, turn it up
turn me on, turn me on
turn it up
and its on
here it is, here it is
here it comes, here it comes
turn it up, turn it up
turn me on, turn me on

I'm gunna dish it out
i'm gunna have some fun
i'm not crazy baby
unless you want some
i'm gunna roam around
till i find the one
who likes to turn it up
who likes to turn me on

I just walked inside
and i already caught you lookin' at me
bragin's not my style but what the hell
i'm feelin good
so put the speakers on eleven
shake my body left and right
i'm not lookin for forever
i just wanna dance tonight

Turn it up, turn it up
turn me on, turn me on
turn it up
and its on
here it is, here it is
here it comes, here it comes
turn it up, turn it up
turn me on, turn me on

i'm gunna
