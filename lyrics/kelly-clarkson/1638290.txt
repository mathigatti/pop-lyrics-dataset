That I would be good even if I did nothing
That I would be good even if I got the thumbs down
That I would be good if I got and stayed sick
That I would be good even if I gained ten pounds


That I would be fine even if I went bankrupt
That I would be good if I lost my hair and my youth
That I would be great if I was no longer queen
That I would be grand if I was not all knowing

Oh oh oh... Oh oh oooooh... (2x)

That I would be loved even when I numb myself
That I would be good even when I am overwhelmed
That I would be loved even when I was fuming
That I would be good even if I was clinging

Well, you know that I could use somebody
Well, you know that I could use somebody
Please, you know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
'Cause you know that I could use somebody

That I would be good even if I lost sanity
That I would be good whether with or without you
