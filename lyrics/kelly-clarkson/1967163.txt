Every head is turned
Eyes opened wide
Look what just walked in tonight
What I left behind
What I never intended to find
Is hunting me, killing me
Can't get you out of my mind


Baby Blue Eyes, the way that you walk in the room
I could leave off your smile
All this time your stealing me, breathless like he used to

Baby Blue Eyes, I can not I can not get enough of you
Does it matter, how long it's been
In the end I still leave you

A reason of you brings me to my knees
I can't escape what I need
I'm fully aware he looks but don't touch
But honey you're teeling me, hanging it,
Braving your love

Baby Blue Eyes, the way that you walk in the room
I could leave off your smile
All this time your stealing me, breathless like he used to

Baby Blue Eyes, I can not I can not get enough of you
Does it matter, how long it's been
In the end I still leave you

Was it so hard for me to just resist your love?
Tell me why am I always, always longing for your touch
Tell me how can I get you alone for just one night

Baby Blue Eyes, the way that you walk in the room
I could leave off your smile
All this time your stealing me, breathless like he used to

Baby Blue Eyes, I can not I can not get enough of you
Does it matter, how long it's been
In the end I still leave you
