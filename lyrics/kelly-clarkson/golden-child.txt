You look at me
You think you see inside
These eyes won't let you see the parts of me I must hide
You don't understand what it's like
You're searching hard, looking deep to find
I won't allow you to come into my world
You'll destroy everything, the beauty you don't deserve
To see the core in me, no I think I sit back and let you squirm
See what it's like


Fall down, everyone's watching
As I ran out and you're still starting
It’s not fair and no one cares
Stop crying and smile
Too bad you slipped up, darling
What will you do when they start asking
What happened to our golden child

I can't mess up cause I know you'll be right there to watch me fall
So condescending, so careless of anything at all, anything at all
You watch me burn so you could warm yourself by the fire
You'll take turns to see who's got the upper hand in my demise
You think it’s easy standing up here so high
Well be my guess, give it a try

Fall down, everyone's watching
As I ran out and you're still starting
It’s not fair and no one cares
Stop crying and smile
Too bad you slipped up, darling
What will you do when they start asking
What happened to our golden child

Be my guest, jump right in
See what it’s like
In my skin

Fall down, everyone's watching
As I ran out and you're still starting
It’s not fair and no one cares
Stop crying and smile
Too bad you slipped up, darling
What will you do when they start asking
What happened to our golden child
