Don't be sad that it's over
Just be happy that it happened to us
Don't look back and remember
Drunken tears, oh remember the love


In my head, I see you laughing from the words I said
Felt like a new beginning
In my head, I see you standing there the words you said
Felt like a story ending

(We will never) ever be the same
(The picture changes) but not the frame
(When I'm sleeping) I still kiss your face
(I can't have it) when I'm awake

Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted
You can't turn back the hands of time
Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Nostalgic

I wonder if you're wearing
That gold chain with a promise from me
Honestly felt so real then
Even now it's not hard to believe

In my head, I see you laughing from the words I said
Felt like a new beginning
In my head, I see you standing there, the words you said
Felt like a story ending

(We will never) ever be the same
(The picture changes) but not the frame
(When I'm sleeping) I still kiss your face
(I can't have it) when I'm awake

Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted
You can't turn back the hands of time
Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Nostalgic

We will never, ever be the same
We will never, ever be the same
We will never, ever be the same
Never be the same

Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted
You can't turn back the hands of time
Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted
You can't turn back the hands of time
Even though we lost it
I still get nostalgic
Nostalgic
