No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing will harm you
My words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here, with you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you


Say you love me
Every waking moment
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you, now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you

Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light.
You're safe: no one can find you
Your fears are far behind you

All I want is freedom
A World with no more night
And you always beside me
To hold me and to hide me

Then say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you want me with you here, beside you
Anywhere you go,let me go too
That's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime

Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning

Say you love me

you know I do

Love me
That's all I ask of you

Anywhere you go let me go too
Love me
That's all I ask of you
