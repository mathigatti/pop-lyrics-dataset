Love wandered inside
Stronger than you
Stronger than I
And now that it has begun
We can not turn back
We can only turn into one


I won't ever be too
Far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
That part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call

And I'm truly inspired
Finding my soul there in your eyes
And you have opened my heart
And lifted me inside
By showing me yourself undisguised

And I will pray for you each day
Confort you through all the pain
Gently kiss your fears away
You can turn to me and cry
Always understand that I
Give you all I have inside
