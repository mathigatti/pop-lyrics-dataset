If you go
They say you're following
If you don't
Then you're too good for them
If you smile
You must be ignorant
If you don't - what's your problem?


If you're down - so ungrateful
And if you're happy - why so selfish?
And you can't win, no
You can't win, no

The one who doesn't quite fit in
Underdressed
Under your skin, oh
A walkin' disaster
Everytime you try to fly you end up falling out of line
Oh, you can't
You can' win, no

If you're thin
Poor little walking disease
If you're not
They're all screaming obese
If you're straight
Why aren't you married yet?
If you're gay why aren't you waving a flag?
If it's wrong, you're knowing it
If it's right, you always miss
You can't win, no
You can't win, no

The one who doesn't quite fit in
Underdressed
Under your skin, oh
A walkin' disaster
Everytime you try to fly you end up falling out of line
Oh, you can't
You can' win, no

And you try
You try so hard
But it's written on your heart
And you play
You play the game
But you pay
You pay for it
You can't win, no
You can't win, no

If you speak
You'll only piss 'em off
If you don't
You're another robot
If you stop
They just say you quit
If you don't
You might lose your shit
You can't win, no
You can't win, no
You can't win, no

The one who doesn't quite fit in
Underdressed
Under your skin, oh
A walkin' disaster
Everytime you try to fly you end up falling out of line
Oh, you can't
You can' win, no
