there are times I swear I know 
your near. But then again your 
heart can play so many tricks on 
you but I still wish that I could 
be 


[Chours: Both] 
Where you are 
Where we had danced toghether 
Where you are 
will be kissing under the stars 
tonight only than will I be where 
you are. 

[Kalan] 
and I can see your face but 
it hurts everytime I do cause you 
my love .... 

[Chours: Both] 
Where you are 
Where we had danced toghether 
Where you are 
will be kissing under the stars 
tonight only than will I be where 
you are.
