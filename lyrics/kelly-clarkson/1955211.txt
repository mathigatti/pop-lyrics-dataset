Mr. know it all
Well ya think you know it all
But ya don't know a thing at all
Ain't it something y'all
When somebody tells you something about you
Think that they know you more than you do
So you take it down another pill to swallow


Mr. bring me down
Well ya like to bring me down, don't ya?
But I ain't laying down
Baby, I ain't going down
Can't nobody tell me how it's gonna be
Nobody's gonna make a fool out of me
Baby, you should know that I lead not follow

Oh, you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me
Acting like you own me lately
Yeah baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

Mr. Play your games
Only got yourself to blame
When you want me back again
But I ain't falling back again
'Cause I'm living my truth without your lies
Let's be clear baby, this is goodbye
I ain't comin' back tomorrow

Oh, you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me
Acting like you own me lately
Yeah baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

So what you've got the world at you feet
And you know everything about everything
But you don't
You still think I'm comin' back, but baby you'll se

Oh, you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me
Acting like you own me lately
Yeah baby, you don't know a thing about me
Yeah, don't know a thing about me

Mr. know it all
Well ya think you know it all
But ya don't know a thing at all
Yeah baby, ya don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me
