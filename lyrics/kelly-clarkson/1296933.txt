I don't mind waiting here
I know you're coming
Even though the others left right here
But I'm not one to give up
We said forever so I'm standing here
I'm standing here


And I don't mind
You would never leave me behind
If you break, I break too
When you're lonely, I'll hold on to you
I see you closing down, but I won't give up now
I'm gonna fight for you tonight
Close Your Eyes

You might fall and I might cry
Covered in bruises
I refuse to let this tear apart our lives
Others talk, let them talk
Love isn't easy but it's worth for you
You're worth it yeah

No I don't mind
I could never leave you behind
If you break, I'll break too
When you're lonely I'll hold on to you
I see you closing down, but I won't give up now
I'm gonna fight for you tonight
Close Your Eyes

And I'm kissing you
Kiss away those fears and hold on too
And I feel it too
And if you start to fall, I promise I'll fall with you

No I don't mind waiting here
I know you're coming even though the others left right here
But I'm not one to give up
We said forever so I'm standing here
I'm standing here

If you break I break too
When you're lonely I'll hold on to you
I see you closing down, but I won't give up now
I'm gonna fight for you tonight
Close Your Eyes
Yeah, Close Your Eyes
Close Your Eyes
