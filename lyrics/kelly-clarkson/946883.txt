Got my headlights shining
Down an old dirt road
Smoke my cigarettes
I should quit, i know


The radio's playing
Old country songs
Someone's leaving
Someone's cheating
On and on

I think i might like
The quiet nights
Of this empty life

'cause someday maybe somebody
Will love me like i need
And someday i won't have to prove
Cause somebody will see
All my worth but until then
I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes
And this old dirt road

See I left another
Good man tonight
I wonder if he'll miss me
Lord knows I tried

But I think that maybe
The thing that I did wrong
Is put up with this bullshit for far too long

I think i might like
The quiet nights
Of this empty life

'cause someday maybe somebody
Will love me like i need
And someday i won't have to prove
Cause somebody will see
All my worth but until then
I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes
And this old dirt road

I ain't gonna sleep
I don't want to dream about
The things that i used to be
I ain't gonna cry
Don't wanna live a lie
I'm just gonna drive
Oh, oh

Cause someday maybe somebody will love me
And someday i won't have to prove

All my worth but until then
I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes
And this old dirt road

'cause someday maybe somebody
Will love me like i need
And someday i won't have to prove
Cause somebody will see
All my worth but until then
I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes
And this old dirt road
