Tired 
Of everything around me
I smile 
But I don't feel a thing no


I'm so far from where I need to be 
I've given up on faith, on everything 
All I want, all I need
Is some peace

There's a hole 
Inside of me
It's so cold 
Slowly killing me

Secrets 
Eating at the core of me 
Shut off 
Trusting all the lies I breathe

I'm so far from where I need to be 
I've given up on faith, on everything 
All I wanted, all I needed
Was some peace

There's a hole 
Inside of me
It's so damn cold 
Slowly killing me

Sinking ever so slowly
So far from where I should be
No hands reaching out for me
Help me, help me

Something's gone
I can feel it
It's all wrong
I'm so sick of this

There's a hole 
Inside of me
It's so cold
Slowly killing me
There's a hole 
Inside of me
It's so damn cold 
Slowly killing me
