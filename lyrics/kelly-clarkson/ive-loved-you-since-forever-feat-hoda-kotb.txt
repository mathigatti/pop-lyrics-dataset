Before birds flew over rainbows
And monkeys swung on trees
There was you, and there was me


Before the sun set in the sky
And honey came from bees
There was you, and there was me

Before the moon lit up the night
And elephants wandered free
There was you, and there was me

Before otters swam together
And rivers reached the sea
There was you, and there was me

Waiting for the day our paths would cross
And you and I turned into we
Oh, I've loved you since forever
And forever's how long you'll be loved by me
