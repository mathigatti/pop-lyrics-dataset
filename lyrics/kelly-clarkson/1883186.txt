All these thought of you and me are driving me crazy
When I see you all I need just a kiss then your chasin me
I know you got your girl but I think she's diggin me
So if your not so scared to share your toys play with me
I'm not the type to leave you dancin alone
I like her style she more then welcome to come
I know you will so don't act like you won't
I see it in your eyes and she's already to go


Ohhhh (ready to go)
Ohhhh (ready to go)
Ohhhh (ready to go)
Ohhhh (ready to go)

Don't you turn me off cause kiss and tellins for rookies
If you want me now behind me cuz i'll fulfill your needs
I'm bringgin out the best parts of everybody
The nights stick together like we do in our dreams
I'm not the type to make a scene so I won't
But you keep lookin at me turing me on
I don't mind she and come if she can roll
Let's ditch this place I'm ready to go

Ohhhh (ready to go)
Ohhhh (ready to go)
Ohhhh (ready to go)
Ohhhh (ready to go)

No need to rush it baby we got all night
If your uncomfortable just say the word i'll make it right
The only rule is to do whatever you like
But tell me are you ready for me tonight
Oh oh oh

Ohhhh (ready to go)
Ohhhh (ready to go)
Ohhhh (ready to go)
Ohhhh (ready to go)

Ready to go
I see it in your eyes and she's all ready to go
Ready to go
I see it in your eyes and she's all ready to go
