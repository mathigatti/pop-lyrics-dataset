What gets me through this
What makes it worth is the hope for a better day
What u don't notice
What u lost focus on is I'm not the type to break


8 years of eggshell calloused feet
9 lives spent workin' on this dream
Six feet under, but breathin'
One drink to celebrate my pain
Three drinks and I'm brand new again
One voice is all it takes and I won't stop

I take the heat, I feel the sting
Of another loss, and while I grieve
I keep on tryin' cos' it's just a matter of time
I see the light, even if it's fine
I won't bow down, I'm goin' to show u till u see me
Till u recognize this fire

What I am chasin'
What I have faith in is that chance to test my wings
What u don't know is
What u lost focus on is I'm not goin' away

Eight years of sitting on the bench
Nine lives spent tangled in your web
Six feet under, but breathing
One drink to celebrate my pain
Three drinks and I'm brand new again
One voice is all it takes
And I won't stop

I take the heat, I feel the sting
Of another loss, and while I grieve
I keep on tryin' cos' it's just a matter of time
I see the light, even if it's fine
I won't bow down, I'm goin' to show u till u see me
Till u recognize this fire

So u keep on keep on pushin'
And I'll keep on fightin'
U try and break me as I break the silence

Taking off, lift off the ground and sing
Trading offers over dreams
Is it what we're meant to be?
Tryin' so hard to make u see
I don't need ur hands, I got my own
There is no fear, that comes and goes
I'm not goin' to crawl no more!
I've got my stairs, I've locked my window

8 years of eggshell calloused feet
9 lives spent workin' on this dream
Six feet under, but breathin'

I take the heat, I feel the sting
Of another loss, and while I grieve
I keep on tryin' cos' it's just a matter of time
I see the light, even if it's fine
I won't bow down, I'm goin' to show u till u see me
Till u recognize this fire

So you keep on keep on pushin'
And I'll keep on fightin'
You try and break me as I break the silence
You keep on keep on pushin'
And I'll keep on fightin'
You try and break me as I break the silence
