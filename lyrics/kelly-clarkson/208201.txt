Don't play that song for me 
Because it brings back the memories 
Of the days that I once knew 
Of the days that I spent with you 


Oh no, don't let it play 
It fills my heart with pain 
Please stop it right away 
Because I remember just what it said 
It said, darling 

You know that you lied 
Boy, you know that you lied 
You know that you lied 
You lied, you lied, you lied 

Remember on our first date 
You kissed me 
Then you walked away 
And I was only seventeen 
I never dreamed that he could be so mean 

Oh darling, don't you play no more 
Don't you dare play that song 
You know you lied 

Ohh
