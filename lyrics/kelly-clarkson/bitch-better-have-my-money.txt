Bitch better have my money
Y'all should know me well enough
Bitch better have my money
Please don't call me on my bluff
Pay me what you owe me
Ballin' bigger than LeBron
Bitch give me your money
Who'd ya'll think y'are fronting on
Like brap brap brap


Louis xiii and it's all on me
Nigga you just bought a shot
Kamikase
If you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot
I call the shots
Like brap brap brap

Pay me what you owe me
Don't act like you forgot
Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money

Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my money

Turn up to rihanna
While the whole club fucking wasted
Every time I drive by
I'm the only thing you're playin'
In a drop top, doin' hundred
Y'all in my rearview mirror racin'

Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?
Like blah blah blah
Louis xiii and it's all on me
Nigga you just bought a shot
Kamikase
If you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot
I call the shots
Like brap brap brap

Pay me what you owe me
Don't act like you forgot
Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money

Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money

Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my money

Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
