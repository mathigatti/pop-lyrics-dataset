You're going crazy,
Running on empty,
You can't make up your mind,
You try to hide it,
But you had to say it,
Restless all this time,
So completely drained from every thing that's in your life,
It's so wrong but you had to scream every thought you kept inside,


One minute you laugh,
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black,
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts,
I keep trying to get up but I keep falling back,
And you love,
And you hate,
And you wait,
Cause one minute goes fast,

You just can't escape it,
You're losing patience,
You wonder what went wrong,
Everything changes,
Happy then jaded,
Always a different song,
Playin' in your head just when you think you've got it down,
Out of nowhere you realize it's different music playing now,

Choir

One minute goes fast,
Fast,
Fast,
Fast,
One minute goes fast,
Yeah,
Yeah,

One minute you laugh,
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black,
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts,
I keep trying to get up but I keep falling back,
And you love,
And you hate,
And you wait,
Cause one minute goes,
One minute goes,
One minute goes,
Fast,
