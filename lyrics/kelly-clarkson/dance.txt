Everything about you just makes me wanna
Everytime I see you I just wanna
If you only knew how much I
You'd reconsider foolin' with me
If I told you that I wanna
How fast would you run I wonder
You will know the sound thats comin'
I'm playin' this song just special for ya


Red button, red botton
In my hand
Make them dance, make them dance

Dance, dance, dance for me
Atta boy, atta boy
So, so pretty
Dance, dance, entertain' me
Too much feelin' like I gotta
Ahhhh
Dance, dance, dance for me
Atta boy, atta boy
So, so pretty
Dance, dance, entertain' me
Too much feelin' like I gotta
Ahhhh

Haha
Haha
Everytime you speak I wanna
Give you a little taste I'm gunna
You will know the sound it's comin'
The tables crashin' down on ya

Triger happy, trigger happy
With my hands
Make them dance, make them dance

Dance, dance, dance for me
Atta boy, atta boy
So, so pretty
Dance, dance, entertain' me
Too much feelin' like I gotta
Ahhhh
Dance, dance, dance for me
Atta boy, atta boy
So, so pretty
Dance, dance, entertain' me
Too much feelin' like I gotta
Ahhhh

Lookin' closer at the fine print here
Those chains are strings and now my heart's black tears

Now you can
Dance, dance, dance for me
Atta boy, atta boy
So, so pretty
Dance, dance, entertain' me
Too much feelin' like I gotta
Ahhhh
Dance, dance, dance for me
Atta boy, atta boy
So, so pretty
Dance, dance, entertain' me
Too much feelin' like I gotta
Ahhhh
