You left me standing there
You didn't even care
You just walked away
I felt so scared
You never even looked back at me
So unaware of how cruel you could be
I was always there
Did you ever care?


Did you ever care for me?
Did you ever believe in me?
Did you ever love me?
Did you? Did you? Did you?

You didn't have to fall
I didn't need your tears
I didn't want your pity
Just any feeling at all would have been sufficient
I never felt so small, so insignificant
You left me naked with nothing at all
How could I be so blind?

Did you ever care for me?
Did you ever believe in me?
Did you ever love me?
Did you? Did you? Did you?

Falling down
Darkness surrounds me
I open my eyes
I bow my head and cry

Did you ever believe in me?
Did you ever even love me?

Did you ever care for me?
Did you ever believe in me?
Did you ever love me?
Did you? Did you? Did you?

Did you ever care for me?
Did you ever love me?
