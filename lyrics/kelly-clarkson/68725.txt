Prayed for an angel
To come in the night
And shine some sweet light on me
Found only strangers
Then you came to me
Just when I'd given up
You gave me love(you gave me love)
My world was tumbling down
You turned it around, baby


You, you're some kind of miracle
Baby you are, you're a miracle to me
Sweet revelation
That look in your eyes
Your touch in the night
I find the sweetest salvation
In your arms, baby
Warm as the morning sun
Your tender love(your tender love)
Came and just lifted me up
Look what you've done, baby

You, you're some kind of miracle
You, you, you are
You're a miracle to me
You brought joy to my heart
I found love in your arms
See what you've done to me
You set my soul so free
You came and you gave me the love that I need

You, you're some kind of miracle
Baby and you are, you're a miracle.
A miracle to me.
Baby you are, a miracle to me
