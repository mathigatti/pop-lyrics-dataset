If then was now
And I had you back somehow
I would hold you more
I should have told you more
If now was then
And we were together again
I would listen more
But now I miss you more


And never, I've been to a dark place
Stared loneliness in the face
At the lowest of my lows

There ain't nothin' so broken
Love can't heal, I feel
Every day I grow older
Time reveals, reveals
That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on

That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on

In my dreams
You would come to me
Through the door
Like before
When I wake
Every breath I take
Is for you
Now would do

Whatever to look upon your face
I wish I could change my place
Will this pain ever go?

There ain't nothin' so broken
Love can't heal, I feel
Every day I grow older
Time reveals, reveals
That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on

That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on

How do I fill this emptiness?
How do I fill this emptiness?
This heaviness I bear
This heaviness I bear
How do I go on giving my all
When part of me isn't there?
Yeah
Oh, baby

There ain't nothin' so broken
Love can't heal, I feel
Every day I grow older
Time reveals, reveals
That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on

That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on
