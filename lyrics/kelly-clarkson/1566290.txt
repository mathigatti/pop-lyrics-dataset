My tired eyes
Are beckon for release
For sleep
I always seem
To want the one who's just a little
Out of reach
Maybe I just can't love
What I can keep


My love, you are
The best friend that I'll ever have

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes
Over my head
And fade all the light
What can you say
To not hurt someone
After the love is gone

His lips try not to tremble
When he speaks
My tired breath falls so heavy
On his cheek

But I'll never know
Just what I have
Unless I leave
Here in the end
I hope that
I'm not just running again

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes
Over my head
And fade all the light
What can you say
To not hurt someone
After the love is gone

Here in the end
I hope that
I'm not just running again
Here in the end
I hope that
I'm not just running again

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes
Over my head
And fade all the light
What can you say
To not hurt someone
After the love is gone

The sun will come up
Cover my eyes
Over my head
And fade all the light
What can you say
To not hurt someone
After the love is gone
