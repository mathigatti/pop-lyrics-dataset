Tear up the photographs
But yesterday won't let go
Everyday, everyday, every minute.
Here comes the emptiness
Just can't be lonely, you know
Everyday, everyday, hey hey.


This second-chancin's really getting me down
You give and takin' everything I dreamed about
It's time you let me know, let me know, just let go.

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene
Where every lie reveals the truth
Baby cause I all ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you

I'd rather walk alone
Don't wanna chase you around
Everyday, everyday, every minute.
I'd Fall a thousand times
For I let you drag me down
Everyday, everyday, hey hey.

Your new beginning was a perfect ending
But I keep feeling we've already been here before
It's time you let me know, let me know, just let go.

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene
Where every lie reveals the truth
Baby cause I all ever wanted
All I ever wanted was...

Tell me with so many out there
Why I always turn to you (Turn to you)
Your goodbyes tear me down every time
And it's so easy to see that the blame is on me

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene
Where every lie reveals the truth
Baby cause I all ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you
