Watch a tear fall, let them fall, fall and I'll
Make the seas calm, take you in my arms, you cry
Let your tears fall, let your tears fall, let your tears fall
It's not a crime to fall apart sometimes
It's not a crime to ask why, to ask why, you cry
Let your tears fall, let your tears fall, let your tears fall


I will come, no, I won't run
I'm not scared to care
Come to me when you're in need
Set it free, let the truth breathe

Tell me all your secrets
Tell me all your fears
I won't push you away
I'll only pull you near
No, I won't judge you
I'mma help you through
Tell me all your secrets
Share in your pain
Confess it all in me
No matter, tell me your name
No, I won't judge you
I'mma help you through
Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall
Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall
No, I won't judge you
I'mma help you through

So give it all, give it all to me
And you can call whenever you need me, you'll cry
Let your tears fall, let your tears fall, let your tears fall

I will come, no, I won't run
I'm not scared to care
Come to me when you're in need
Set it free, let the truth breathe

Tell me all your secrets
Tell me all your fears
I won't push you away
I'll only pull you near
No, I won't judge you
I'mma help you through
Tell me all your secrets
Share in your pain
Confess it all in me
No matter, tell me your name
No, I won't judge you
I'mma help you through
Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall
Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall
No, I won't judge you
I'mma help you through
Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall
Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall
No, I won't judge you
I'mma help you through

I know you been on your knees
I'll run to your side baby
I run to your side baby, oh
I know you've been on your knees
I'll run to your side baby
I'll run to your side baby

Tell me all your secrets
Tell me all your fears
I won't push you away
I'll only pull you near
No, I won't judge you
I'mma help you through
Tell me all your secrets
Share in your pain
Confess it all in me
No matter, tell me your name
No, I won't judge you
I'mma help you through
Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall
Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall (let your tears fall)

Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall
Let your tears fall, let your, let your tears fall

Oh (oh)
Oh, let your tears fall
