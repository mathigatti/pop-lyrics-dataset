Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear saviour´s birth


Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
´Til he appeared
And the soul felt it´s worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angels voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night, Oh night divine

Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear saviour´s birth

Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
´Til he appeared
And the soul felt it´s worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night, Oh night divine
