You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think
That they would come crashing down
No


You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance, for you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
But girl I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
Bridges are burned, now it's your turn to cry

Cry me a river
Cry me a river girl
Cry me a river
Cry me a river girl (yeah, yeah)

I know that they say
That some things are better left unsaid
But it wasn't like you only talked to him
And you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it)
All of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head
(Messin' with my head)
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
(Yeah)

You don't have to say, what you did
(Don't have to say, what you did)
I already know, I found out from him
(I already know, uh)
Now there's just no chance, for you and me
There'll never be
(No chance, you and me)
And don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
(All alone)
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
(When you call me on the phone)
But girl I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
(I'm not like them baby)
Bridges are burned, and now it's your turn
(It's your turn)
To cry

Cry me a river
(Go on and just)
Cry me a river girl
(Go on and just)
Cry me a river
(Baby go on and just)
Cry me a river girl

The damage is done
So I guess I'll be leavin'

So I guess I'll be leavin'

You don't have to say, what you did
(Don't have to say, what you did)
I already know, I found out from him

Now there's just no chance, for you and me
There'll never be
(No chance, you and me)
Don't it make you sad about it?
