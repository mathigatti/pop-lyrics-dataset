Give me a break
Give me a freakin' moment
To swallow what I just found out
Give me some space
Give me some mercy
Oh I could use a good stiff drink
Right about now


You say you're sorry
You say you're just not sure
That you're not happy anymore

Well you didn't mind before
When I got you in the door
You didn't wine like this
When I got your name on the list
You used to love me then
When I paid for you and your friends
You say people change
Well I say you are full of shit and fame
Full of shit and fame
Shit and fame

Let me get this straight
Just so I know I'm hearing you
You say I'm holding you back
Baby get this straight
When things start falling apart
I won't be holdin' on
I'll watch you fall flat on your ass

You say you're sorry
You say you're just not sure
That you're not happy anymore

Well you didn't mind before
When I got you in the door
You didn't wine like this
When I got your name on the list
You used to love me then
When I paid for you and your friends
You say people change
Well I say you are full of shit and fame
Full of shit and fame
Shit and fame
