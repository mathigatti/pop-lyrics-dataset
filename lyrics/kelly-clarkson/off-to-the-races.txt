My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny
The way he holds my hand
And he grabs me
He has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have
A Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have
A L. A. Crass way about me
He loves me
With every beat of his cocaine heart


Swimming pool glimmering, darling
White bikini off
With my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sit sipping on your Black Cristal, oh, yeah

Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little Scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he's got a soul as sweet
As blood red jam
And he shows me he knows me
Every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have
A flat broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks
It's what he might like about me
Admires me
The way I roll like a rolling stone

Likes to watch me in the
Glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress
Putting on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me
Gimme them coins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little Scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

Now I'm off to the races
Laces, leather on my waist
Is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down

God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief, and
I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when he may, if he may
I'm not afraid to say
That I'd die without him

Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you
I'll never leave you
They would rue the day
I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said: Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man

And we're off to the races
Places, ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're going in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin

Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
