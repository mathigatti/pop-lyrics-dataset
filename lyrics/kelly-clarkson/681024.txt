And i never thought i'd feel this way
And as far as i'm concerned
I'm glad i got the chance to say
That i do believe i love you


And if i should ever go away
Well, then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today,
And then if you can remember,

Keep smiling, keep shining,
Knowing you can always count on me
For sure
That's what friends are for

For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more.
That's what friends are for

I never thought i'd feel this way
Well you came and opened me
And now there's so much more i see
And so, by the way, i thank you.

And then for the times when we're apart
Well, then close your eyes and know
These words are coming from my heart
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me
For sure
That's what friends are for

In good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forevermore
That's what friends are for
