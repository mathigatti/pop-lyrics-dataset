I can't take the pressure of new
Give me old
Rip it off
Let's see if it sticks to the wall again
They're too dumb to see
See the truth
Give it to 'em
They will never notice
So what's stop stop stopping us


Does it sound familiar
Does it linger in your ear
Like something you remember from just last year
Like sweet little lullabies in your ear
Wash, rinse, repeat
Hi I'm originality

I'll be playing God and you can be my (bleep)
The only compromise is you get to pick
Which of these formulas is your perfect fit
Wash, rinse, repeat, why are you fighting it?
(No, no, no)
Don't get crazy keep between those lines
(We loved him)
Here's what we have in mind
We've worked with everyone
Trust us and see
Wash, rinse, and repeat

Wash, rinse, and repeat
Wash, rinse, and repeat

Hi my name is POO
And I'm here to run everything
Spreading like a cancer
I will die and take you all with me
Let you have a little bit
While secretly I'm waiting
To rip that rug from underneath
Can't believe you fell for it

Music from the past, from the present
Well, just last week
We will change a note and get away with it
(Wait and see)
Just when you think that we've changed
Like an addict we sweep right back in with a dose of reality

I'll be playing God and you can be my (bleep)
The only compromise is you get to pick
Which of these formulas is your perfect fit
Wash, rinse, repeat, why are you fighting it?
(No, no, no)
Don't get crazy keep between those lines
(We loved him)
Here's what we have in mind
We've worked with everyone
Trust us and see
Wash, rinse, and repeat

Wash, rinse, and repeat
Wash, rinse, and repeat
Wash, rinse, and repeat
Wash, rinse, and repeat

The definition of insanity
Is to repeat the same thing over and over
Expecting a different result
I'm insane (I'm insane)
Just wash, rinse, and repeat

I'll be playing God and you can be my (bleep)
The only compromise is you get to pick
Which of these formulas is your perfect fit
Wash, rinse, repeat, why are you fighting it?
(No, no, no)
Don't get crazy keep between those lines
(We loved him)
Here's what we have in mind
We've worked with everyone
Trust us and see
Wash, rinse, and repeat

Wash, rinse, repeat
You love this song
Everybody can do it
This song is the most amazing song you have ever heard (It's easy)
Anybody can do it (And I mean anybody)
This song is completely different from that other song
That sounds exactly the same
Yes it is
Yes it is
Yes it is
