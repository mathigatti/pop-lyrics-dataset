I'm on a tightrope
You've got your reasons
When did it get so hard to breathe
Hot in the spotlight
I'm feeling so tired
Your hands are burned from holding me
And maybe you and I will fall in time eventually
Maybe we'll both die trying but I can't bring myself to leave
'Cause I've looked


And I ain't seen nothing like you, the way you light up every room tonight
So easily
And I have moved mountains, babe, just to stumble into your good grace and I
I still can't compete

You're on the tightrope
I've got my reasons
How did we get so tangled
You turn, I stay straight
I bend as you break
We're so messed up but I know
That you and I will fall in time eventually
Or maybe we'll both die trying

'Cause I ain't seen nothing like you, the way you light up every room tonight
So easily
And I have moved mountains, babe, just to stumble into your good grace and I
I still can't compete

Oh, you and I will fall in time eventually
Or maybe we'll both die trying

'Cause I ain't seen nothing like you, the way you light up every room tonight
So easily
And I have moved mountains, babe, just to stumble into your good grace and I
I still can't compete
