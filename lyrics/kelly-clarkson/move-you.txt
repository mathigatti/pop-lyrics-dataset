Like a montage in a movie, right before the hero dies
Like the first time that you listen to your favorite singer live
Like an echo in a canyon
Like tears, but you're not sad
Like a sunrise on a mountain
I wanna move you like that
Oh, I wanna move you like that


Like a symphony at sundown in the middle of July
When a lyric really gets ya and it breaks you down inside
Like the home that you were raised in
Like faded photographs
Like the thrill of Christmas morning
Yeah, I wanna move you like that
Oh, I wanna move you like that

Like a solemn hallelujah
Like a choir shouts amen
Like your first time falling in love or a stairway up to heaven
Like a soldier who is falling as he holds his country's flag
And he fights for freedom's calling
I wanna move you like that

Ooh, I wanna move you like that
Oh, I wanna move you like that, yeah
Ooh, like that, oh, yeah
I wanna move you like that, oh (like that)
I wanna move you

Like an endless fire burning
Like a hope that fuels the light
Like the hands that simply hold you when words can't make it right
Like the first time that I met you
I fell so hard, so fast
Like that montage in a movie
Mmh, the way you move me
I wanna move you like that
