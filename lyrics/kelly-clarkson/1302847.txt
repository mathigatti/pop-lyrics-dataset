I have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Just won't be the same darling, if you're not here with me.


And when those blue snow flakes start falling,
That's when those blue memories start calling,
You'll be doing alright, with your Christmas of white,
but I'll have a blue... blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas.

You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
but I'll have a blue blue Christmas.
