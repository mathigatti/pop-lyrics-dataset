It doesnt matter where we go
Silver blue white or way home
It doesnt matter who you are
You know we’re coming when you see the star


We’re layin down tracks you’re never gonna walk in
A head of our time while you were busy watching
Everybody wants to be a lonestar a hero
But only Texas has it all

So get up on your feet (Get up, Get up)
Now if you wanna scream (Get up, Get up)
We’re turnin up the heat (Get up, Get up)
Let me hear you sing (Get up, Get up)

I wanna be a cowboy baby I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be a cowboy baby I wanna be, I wanna be

Get up, Get up Get up, Get up

It doesnt matter what you say
We’re growing stronger each and every day
It doesn’t matter how we do
it We came, we saw, we conquered what you couldn’t

We’re layin down tracks you’re never gonna walk in
A head of our time while you were busy watching
Everybody wants to be a lonestar a hero
But only Texas has it all

So get up on your feet (Get up, Get up)
Now if you wanna scream (Get up, Get up)
We’re turnin up the heat (Get up, Get up)
Let me hear you sing (Get up, Get up)
