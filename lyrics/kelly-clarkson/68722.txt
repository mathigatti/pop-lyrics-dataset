I wonder how I ever made it through a day
How did I settle for a world in shades of grey?
When you go in circles, all the scenes looks the same
And you don't know why
When I looked into your eyes
The world stretched out in front of me
And I realized


CHORUS
I never lived before your love
I never flaw before your touch
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive
But then again, I wasn't really living
I never lived before your love

I wanted more than just an ordinary life
All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky
I stand before you and my heart is in your hands
And I don't know how
I survived without your kiss
Cause you're giving me a reason to exist

CHORUS
I never lived before your love
I never felt before your touch
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive
But then again I wasn't really living
I never lived, I never lived before your lov

BRIDGE
And I don't know why
Why the sun decides to shine
But you breath your love into me just in time

CHORUS
I never lived before your love
I never felt before your touch
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive
But then again I wasn't really living
I never lived, I never lived before your love
