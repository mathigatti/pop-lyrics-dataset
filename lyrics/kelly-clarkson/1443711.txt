Never Saw 'I Love You' as a trend
'Cause I don't really work like that
I mean what I say when it leaves my lips,
Oh...
Nothin' you could say would change my heart
'Cause I don't really love like that
If you'd only let me in I'd show ya
But I'm tired of workin' so hard


You keep pushin' me away tearin' down your walls
Is forcing me to break
Don't know what to say
Will you ever let me in?
It's hard for me to pretend
So tell me what you wanna do
Tell me is there any other way

'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Tell me there's a reason to stay
Cause I'm about to get up and run
Better think about the words you say
If you don't wanna end up alone
Tell me is there any room for me
Cause when it's all said and done babe
I'm tired of singin'
Oh, ooooooooh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, ooooooooh
Goodbye's on the tip of my...

Never confuse me with where you've been
Cause I don't really work like that
If I'm holdin' you then I'm all in
I know you're scared, yeah
You've been burned
But I won't ever hurt you like that
If you'd take a chance I'm not like them

Give and get nothin' in return
You don't seem to care
You're not the only one who hurt
Tell me is there any other way

'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Tell me there's a reason to stay
Cause I'm about to get up and run
Better think about the words you say
If you don't wanna end up alone
Tell me is there any room for me
Cause when it's all said and done babe
I'm tired of singin'
Oh, ooooooooh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue,
Oh, ooooooooh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue,
Oh, ooooooooh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue,
Oh, ooooooooh
Goodbye's on the tip of my...

Why ya gotta pull away
Pull away and leave me hangin'
Why ya gotta make me say
Don't make me say what you've been thinkin' all along

Oh, ooooooooh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, ooooooooh
I'm about to get up and run
Is there any other way?
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Tell me there's a reason to stay
Cause I'm about to get up and run
Better think about the words you say
If you don't wanna end up alone
Tell me is there any room for me
Cause when it's all said and done babe
I'm tired of singin' oh oooooh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, ooooooooh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, ooooooooh
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
Oh, ooooooooh
Goodbye's on the tip of my...
