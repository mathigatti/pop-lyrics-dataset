You wanna cry tonight
You wanna give it up
Your saying not enough
Well its all in your head
You wanna ditch your skin
You wanna different face
You wanna change your name
Be somebody else


Well I think your perfect in your skin
I wouldn't change a single thing
I know its been a rough ride baby
But I love you just the way you are
Just the way you are

You need to change your pace
You need a different scene
Retired beauty queen
In a hand me down dress
You say you've lost your grace
You want yesterday
Well than a fool can see
How the freckles on your face
Create the perfect hiding place
You keep

Well I think your perfect in your skin
I wouldn't change a single thing
I know its been a rough ride baby
But I love you just the way you are
Just the way you are

You lovely
Dont you run away
Now that I recognize your beautiful eyes
You we're made for me
Just the way you are

Well I think your perfect in your skin
I wouldn't change a single thing
I know its been a rough ride baby
But I love you just the way you are
Just the way you are

Well I think your perfect in your skin
I wouldn't change a single thing
I know its been a rough ride baby
But I love you just the way you are
Just the way you are
Just the way you are
Just the way you are
Just the way you are
Just the way you are
