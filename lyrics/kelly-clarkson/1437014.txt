If anyone ask, I'll tell them we both just moved on
When people all stare I pretend that I don't hear them talk
Whenever I see you
I'll swallow my pride and bite my tongue
Pretend i'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong


Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?

If anyone ask I'll tell them we just grew apart
And what would I care if they believe me or not?
Whenever I feel your memory is breaking my heart
I'll pretend i'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?

I'm talking in circles
I'm lying, they know it
why won't this just all go away?

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?
