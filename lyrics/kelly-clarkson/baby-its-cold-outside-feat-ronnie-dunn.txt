I really can't stay, baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away, baby, it's cold out there
This evening has been, been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice, I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice


My mother will start to worry beautiful what you're hurry
And father will be pacing the floor listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more, put some records on while I pour

And the neighbors might think, baby it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink? No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no sir, mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried, what's the sense of hurtin' my pride?
I really can't stay, baby don't hold out
Baby but it's cold outside

I simply must go, but baby it's cold outside
The answer is no, I say it's cold out there
The welcome has been, how lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm, look out that window, at the storm

My sister will be suspicious, gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door, waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious, gosh, your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more, oh, never such a blizzard before

I've got to go home, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb, it's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand, I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see, how can you do this thing to me

There's bound to be talk tomorrow, think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied, if you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay, get over that hold out
Oh but it's cold outside
