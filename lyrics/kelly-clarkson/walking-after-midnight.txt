I go out walking after midnight,
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do.
I’m always walking after midnight, searching for you.


I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that’s just my way of saying “i love you”.
I’m always walking after midnight, searching for you.

I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow, maybe he’s crying for me.
And as the skies turn gloomy,
The night winds whisper to me i’m lonesome as i can be.

I go out walking after midnight, out in the starlight,
Just hoping you may be somewhere
Walking after midnight, searching for me.

I stopped to see a weeping willow,
Crying on his pillow, maybe he’s crying for me.
And as the skies turn gloomy,
The night winds whisper to me i’m lonesome as i can be.

I’m always walking after midnight out in the moonlight,
Just hoping you may be somewhere
Walking after midnight, searching for me.

I’m always walking after midnight
Searching for me.
