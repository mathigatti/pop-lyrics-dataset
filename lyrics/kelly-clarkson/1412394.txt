Guess this means you're sorry
You're standing at my door
Guess this means you take back
All you said before


Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again

Because we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

Maybe I was stupid
For telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong
For trying to pick a fight

I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way, I found out
I'm nothing without you

Because we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

Being with you is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you
But I can't let you go
Oh yeah

Because we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

Because we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you
