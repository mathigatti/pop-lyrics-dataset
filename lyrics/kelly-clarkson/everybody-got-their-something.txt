My face to the sky
Dreaming about just how high
I could go
And if I'll know
When I finally get there


Taking off my glasses
Sun pokes through my lashes
And somehow I know
There's a time for every star to shine

Everybody got their something
Everybody got there something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

People keeping score
Say better hurry up and get yours
Cause somebody else
Got your spot
Before you even dropped

Seek and you shall find
Everything in your own sweet time
I'll take my chances
With what I believe is only mine

Busy holding on
So the roof don't fly
Keep you from moving on
So get it right
Turn the tide over
Like a love song
Like a butterfly
Believe if you hand it over
You'll come out all right

Everybody got their something
Everybody got there something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

Illuminate the silly things
Shed some light on all that's wrong
Everybody need it
Sometime
Sometimes the only thing you got
is what makes you feel like
You're something else altogether
You have everything don't need
another reason to be something
I've been on a ride
and caught up in the landslide
But I'm gonna spread my wings and fly

Everybody got their something
Everybody got there something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

There's a time for every star
There's a time for every star
