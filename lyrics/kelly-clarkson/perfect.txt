Made a wrong turn
Once or twice
Dug my way out
Blood and fire


Bad decisions
That's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated
Misplaced, missunderstood
Miss know it, it's all good
It didn't slow me down

Mistaken
Always second guessing
Underestimated
Look I'm still around

Pretty pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect

Pretty pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're perfect to me

You're so mean
When you talk
About yourself
You're wrong

Change the voices
In your head
Make them like you instead

So complicated
Look how we are making
Filled with so much hatred
Such a tired game

It's enough
I've done all I can think of
I've chased down all my demons
I see you do the same

Pretty pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect

Pretty pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're perfect

The whole world is scared
So I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking
Is an ice cold beer

So cool in lying
And we tried tried tried
But we try too hard
It's a waste of my time

Done looking for the critics
Cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans
They don't get my hair

Stringe ourselves
And we do it all the time
Why do we do that? Why do I do that?
Why do I do that?

Yeah?

Oooh?

Oh pretty pretty pretty

Pretty pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect

Pretty pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're perfect to me

You're perfect
You're perfect

Pretty pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect

Pretty pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're perfect to me
