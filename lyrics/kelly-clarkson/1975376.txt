I watch the days rush by me like a river
I shouldn't wait, but I'm scared to touch the water
I let the phone ring, why won't you believe?
I wait for silence, it takes a lot not to answer


All I have to say is
You don't deserve me, you don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away 'cause you don't deserve me
And you're not worthy

And I won't let you pour me in
Because I know you're gonna win
(The war is over) but the war is over (the war is over)
And I won't fight you anymore
I never been so sure
(The war is over) cuz the war is over

I used to let you paint a pretty pictures
You got me caught up with your you're my girl forever
So I forgive you, it felt good when you hold me
Yeah you owned me
Now you wish you had really known me

All I have to say is
You don't deserve me, you don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away, 'cause you only hurt me
And you're not worthy

And I won't let you pour me in
Because I know you're gonna win
(The war is over) but the war is over (the war is over)
And I won't fight you anymore
I never been so sure
(The war is over)

This is not my surrender
I'm not running for cover
I'm right here, I know you see me
But your words no longer to feed me

In the night when you're lonely
You'll remember how much you miss me
So you call, but I swear
You can try a million times, you'll get the same answer

All I have to say is
You don't deserve me, you don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away 'cause you only hurt me
And you're not worthy

And I won't let you pour me in
Because I know you're gonna win
(The war is over) but the war is over (the war is over)

The war is over, the war is over, the war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
