Give me a second, I
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom,
Getting higher than the Empire State.
My lover, she is waiting for me
Just across the bar
My seats been taken by some sunglasses
Asking about a scar and,


I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm trying hard to take it back

So if by the time
The bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home...

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I
I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight

The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come
And carry me home

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight
