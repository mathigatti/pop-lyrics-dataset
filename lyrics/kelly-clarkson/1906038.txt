Oh

Simple math
Our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies plus time
I'm going out of my mind
It was heavy
When I finally figured it out alone


And I know I'm wrong sometimes, oh
But it ain't rocket science, no
And I may not be Einstein
But I know
Dumb + dumb = you
Dumb + dumb = you, yeah
Dumb + dumb = you (you)

Even had the nerve to flirt with her in front of my face
Here's your keys
Your bags
Your clothes
And now get out of my place
You say I'm crazy
And that we're happy
Is that supposed to comfort me, oh yeah

And I know I'm wrong sometimes, oh
But it ain't rocket science, no
And I may not be Einstein
But I know
Dumb + dumb = you
Dumb + dumb = you, yeah

Dumb + dumb = you (you)

All of your promises plus
A thousand apologies just
Take out the pain and then it leaves us
With nothing at all
No nothing at all

You can stop wasting my time
Without you I'm just fine
Why did it take me so long to figure out
Dumb + dumb = you
Equals you, yeah

And I know I'm wrong sometimes, oh
But it ain't rocket science, no
And I may not be Einstein
But I know
Dumb + dumb = you (dumb + dumb = you)

Simple math
Our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies plus time
I'm going out of my mind
and I may not be Einstein but I know
Dumb + dumb = you
Equals you
