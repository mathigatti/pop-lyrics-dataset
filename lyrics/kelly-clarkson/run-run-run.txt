Hmm, hmm

I wonder how your body tastes
Inside of someone else's place
Pull away your eyes, there's nothing left to heal
I'm alone but I know everything you feel


And you waited on the rain
Through tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate
And we rise and rise again

And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

Tell me how you closed the door
Knowin' nobody could love you more
Telling all your friends that this love is just made for bleeding
Hung up underwater but still we keep on trying to breath in

And you waited on the rain
Through tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate
And we rise and rise again

And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

Our lust for fighting
Tied up in silence

And you waited on the rain
Through tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate
And we rise and rise again

And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run

And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

Our lust for fighting
Tied up in silence
