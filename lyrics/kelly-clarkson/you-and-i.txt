It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leavin' without you


You taste like whiskey when yoü kiss me awe
I'd give anything again to be your babydoll
This time I'm not leaving without you

He said, sit back down where yoü belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time
And yoü said to me

Somethin', somethin' about this place
Somethin' 'bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Somethin', somethin' about
My cool Nebraska guy
Yeah somethin' about
Baby yoü and I

It's been two years since I let yoü go
I couldn't listen to a joke or rock n'roll
And muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart

On my birthday yoü sang me Heart Of Gold
With a guitar hummin' and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without yoü

Sit back down where yoü belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time
And yoü said to me

Somethin', somethin' about this place
Somethin' 'bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Somethin', somethin' about
My cool Nebraska guy
Yeah somethin' about
Baby yoü and I

Yoü and I, yoü yoü and I
Yoü yoü and I, yoü yoü and I
Yoü and I, yoü yoü and I
Oh yeah I'd rather die, without yoü and I

(Come on put your drinks up)

We gotta whole lotta money but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that Imma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and Nebraska and Jesus Christ

(There's somethin')
Somethin', somethin' about the chase
(Six whole years)
I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face
There's somethin', somethin' about just knowin' when it's right

So put your drinks up for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska I love you

Yoü and I, yoü yoü and I
Baby I'd rather die, without yoü and I

Yoü and I, yoü yoü and I
Nebraska I'd rather die, without yoü and I

It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leavin' without you
