Breathe in
Breathe out
Restless, waitin' for anything
Tension is thick in the air
Are you gonna lead or follow me?
Full speed, turn up the overdrive
Makes me feel glad that I'm alive
It's time we finally made our move
So come on, come on, come on now


Let's go, let's jump right in
Scream into the wind, feed the fire within
I can't ignore this burnin' in my soul
Come on, baby, let's go
We might go fast, we might go hard
But I can take it, I need to know
So come on, baby, go

Fever, in my eye
Starts racing back and forth in my mind
I feel emotions rush through me
Stirring such passion inside of me
Are we regressing or taking flight
I'd rather be laughing than just stay quiet
It's time to make a move
It's time, we’ve nothing to lose
So come on, come on, come on now

Let’s go, let’s jump right in
Scream into the wind, feed the fire within
I can’t ignore this burning in my soul
Come on, baby, let's go
We might go fast, we might go hard
But I can take it, I need to know
So come on, baby, go

No one to stand in our way
And nothing’s holding us back
Doesn’t matter what they say
It’s just you and me
I'm so glad
It turns out what I didn’t know and I was too scared to show
Lose control of my soul
Come on now

Let’s go, let’s jump right in
Scream into the wind, feed the fire within
I can’t ignore this burning in my soul
Come on, baby, let's go
We might go fast, we might go hard
But I can take it, I need to know
So come on, baby, go

Breathe in
Breathe out
Go
Breathe in
Go
Breathe out
