Far, away from it all
You and me with no one else around
A brand new start
Is all we need, it's all we need to mend these hearts
Back to the beginning


Be still
Let it go

Before we lost hope
When we still touched and love wasn't so hard 

Be still
I already know

Foolish one with the smile
You don't have to be brave
Every time we fall down 
But we're falling from grace
I'll gladly climb your walls if you'll meet me halfway

Slow, slow it down
Why do we run, we're missing so much babe
Just lay in my arms for a while

Be still
We should've known

Foolish one with the smile
You don't have to be brave
I'll gladly climb your walls 
If you'll meet me halfway
Every time we fall down
But we're falling from grace
Here's my hand and my heart
It's yours to take

Be still
