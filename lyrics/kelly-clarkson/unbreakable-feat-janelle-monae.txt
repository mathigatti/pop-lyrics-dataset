There's always gonna be someone tryna tear you down
Mocking you for your mistakes, oh
There's always gonna be someone messing your head around
Watching you to see you break, so


Don't you let em call you out
Brush away the shame and doubt
Remember what you're all about and then

Show 'em who you are
Show 'em that you're strong
Show 'em that you know where you belong
Open up their eyes, force 'em all to see
Let 'em know you are and you'll always be
Unbreakable, unbreakable
Unbreakable, unbreakable, yeah

There's always gonna be someone saying you're something less
Let 'em talk, you know your heart, oh
There's always gonna be someone calling you second best
Shut 'em down, don't fall apart, no

Don't you let 'em in your head
Doesn't matter what they said
Get up on your feet instead, and then

Show 'em who you are
Show 'em that you're strong
Show 'em they've been seeing you all wrong
Open up their minds, throw away the key
Tell 'em that you are and you'll always be
Unbreakable, unbreakable, yeah

You define yourself, oh (hey, yeah)
You and no one else

Show 'em who you are
Show 'em that you're strong
Show them that you've known it all along
Open every door, own your destiny
Live as if you are what you were
And you've been and you'll always be
Unbreakable, unbreakable
Unbreakable, unbreakable
Unbreakable
