If you wanna lead, be a leader
If you wanna dream, be a dreamer
Climb to the top of that mountain ans scream it, but
Remember when you get to the top
Everything you say is gonna matter
Everything you do is gonna add up
It's what you asked for, so
Don't get mad when it's not what you thought


Careful now girl with them Jezebel ways
Crown on your head but you're queen of clich√©s
Little one playing with the big boys now
Hope you're ready when it comes back around

I had a dream that we were more
A generation to behold
Lighting fires with our words
Instead of useless smoke that blurs
The lines of right and wrong
Expression that lives on
An army with a song
That lingers when we're gone
I had a dream

If you wanna preach, be a preacher
If you wanna teach, be a teacher
Remember that the footprints you're leaving will
Tell us all who you really are
It's too bad you can't see what you're worth
Spreading your legs instead of using your words
Character is shown by the thins that we do
The one thing you're never gonna hide is the truth

'Cause anyone can tell when they're selling out
And anyone can fly when they're are falling down

I had a dream that we were more
A generation to behold
Lighting fires with our words
Instead of useless smoke that blurs
The lines of right and wrong
Expression that lives on
An army with a song
That lingers when we're gone
I had a dream

I had a dream

I had a dream that we were more (I had a dream that we were)
A generation to behold (to behold)
Lighting fires with our words (lighting fires with our words)
Instead of useless smoke that blurs
The lines of right and wrong
Expression that lives on (lives on)
An army with a song
That lingers when we're gone (when we're gone)
I had a dream (I had a dream)
I had a dream
I had a dream
