Are you there?
Are you watching me?
As I lie here on this floor
They say you feel what I do
They say you're here every moment
Will you stay? 
Stay 'till the darkness leaves
Stay here with me
I know you're busy, I know I'm just one
But you might be the only one who sees me
The only one to save me


Why is it so hard?
Why can't you just take me?
I don't have much to go 
Before I fade completely

Can you feel how cold I am?
Do you cry as I do?
Are you lonely up there all by yourself?
Like I have felt all my life
The only one to save mine

How are you so strong?
What's it like to feel so free?
Your heart is really something 
Your love, a complete mystery to me

Are you there watching me?
As I lie here on this floor
Do you cry, do you cry with me?
Cry with me tonight 

Are you there? 
Are you watching me?

You're not worth it babe
The trouble you bring the noise you keep
And you don't even care

I'm so sick of you babe
Nights wasted I'm through faking
You don't turn me on
You don't do anything at all

Baby I can't stand the sight of your face
Baby I don't even want to hear your name

Don't know what I saw
But are you seeing it now
Woke up this morning, bitterness in my mouth

Guess I fell too fast
Guess I learned my lesson
So much for true love
I'll take this chivas instead

You're too high maintenance babe
All the time you spent trying to fit in and noone even cares
It's so rediculous babe
Watching you turn as I burn
It's like you're not even there

Baby don't you try and hold my hand
Maybe you should keep your eyes on your new girlfriend

Don't know what I saw
But are you seeing it now
Woke up this morning, biterness in my mouth
Guess I fell too fast
Guess I learned my lesson
So much for true love
I'll take this chivas instead

I'll take this chivas instead
Over your bed
It wasn't even good
Trust me
I must have been so so so so lonely
You are crap, yeah
You should keep your eyes on your new little friend
It's hard not to look I know
I'm amazing
I love you chivas.
