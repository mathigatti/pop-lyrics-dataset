You look at me like you always do
You don't have a clue
You smile at me, you hug me
But, you don't know I want you
You play with me
You flirt with me
You tell me all your secrets
I'm always the one you run to 
But to you, I'm just your friend


Don't say I love you
Don't say you need me 
Don't say I trust you
My heart can't take it
Don't say you want me
Don't say you miss me
Don't hurt me 
Don't say you love me

Oh, no no no no

I've tried my best to rid these thoughts
Of you and I, it's so hard
When you come to me, I fall back on my knees
I've learned to hate love
You kissed me on the cheek and said 
You'd never make it without me
It's getting harder everyday
Please don't say to me

Don't say I love you
Don't say you need me 
Don't say I trust you
My heart can't take it
Don't say you want me
Don't say you miss me
Don't hurt me 
Don't say you love me

Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me 
Don't say you love me 
My heart can't take it
I love you so much
But you don't see me
I hate love 

Don't say I love you
Don't say you need me
Don't say I trust you
Unless you mean it 
Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me 
Don't hurt me, no 

Don't say I love you
Don't say you need me 
Don't say I trust you
My heart can't take it
Don't say you want me
Don't say you miss me
Don't hurt me 
Don't say you love me
