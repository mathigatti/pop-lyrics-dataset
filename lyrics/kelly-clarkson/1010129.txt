Dreams can come true
Dreams can come true


Move a step closer 
You know that I want you
I can tell by your eyes 
that you want me too
Just a question of time 
I knew we'd be together
And that you'd be mine
I want you here forever

Do ya hear what I'm sayin?
Gotta say how I feel
I can't believe you're here
But I know that you're real
I know what I want 
And baby it's you
I can't deny my feelings 
Cos I know they are true

Dreams can come true
Look at me babe I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you've got to be strong

Dreams can come true
Look at me babe I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong

I've seen you some times
on your own and in crowds
I knew I had to have you
my hopes didnt let me down
Now you're by my side
And I feel so good
I've nothing to hide
Don't feel that I ever could

Do you hear what I'm saying?
Gotta say how I feel
I can't believe you're here
But I know that you're real
I know what I want
And baby it's you
cant deny my feelings
Because they are true

Dreams can come true
(2x)

I'm not making plans for tomorrow
Let's live for tonight
I know I want you baby
So hold me so tight
Put your arms around me
You make me feel so safe
Then you whisper in my ear
That you're here to stay

Dreams can come true
