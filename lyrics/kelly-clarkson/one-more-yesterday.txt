Looking back, what we had before the bridges burned
The plans we made, give or take, so little in return
There's nothing left, we lost ourselves somewhere along the way
What I'd give for one more yesterday?


I was never gonna let you down, this solid ground and the world rushing
How could we come to this? I'ma tryina fix all the things I'm breaking,
I remember when we fall too late to rest upon ourselves, and washed away
What I'd give for one more yesterday?

The memories they used to be a complicated thing
The what have been's, the could've been's are suffocating me
Now you got 'em shocking on they always come out long
What I'd give for one more yesterday?

I was never gonna let you down, this solid ground and the world rushing
How could we come to this? I'ma tryina fix all the things I'm breaking,
I remember when we fall too late to rest upon ourselves, and washed away
What I'd give for one more yesterday?

I know we both said
Moving on it's all for the better
I know we both left
But how we could've been locked together?
See it in time we'll make us all
Should've never let us go!

I was never gonna let you down, this solid ground and the world rushing
How could we come to this? I'ma tryina fix all the things I'm breaking
I remember when we fall too late to rest upon ourselves, and washed away
What I'd give for one more yesterday?
What I'd give for one more yesterday?

Yeha yeha, oh
