You don't know how you shine
I guess no one told you,
So let me be the first to show how I
Love your eyes when you smile
Can't resist you even when I try


One day you'll see
One day you'll believe me

I don't know why they left
I won't ever understand foolish hearts and careless hands
I'm not like the rest of them
I'll be here forever
Til my last breath

One day you'll see
One day you'll believe me
One day you'll know
One day I won't have to show you

All I know is that I've found what I've been looking for
Held you once, and took a chance, and asked for a little more
You don't know how you light up every room or how you shine
I guess no one ever told you
If you don't mind

One day you'll see
One day you'll believe me
One day you'll know
One day I won't have to show you
