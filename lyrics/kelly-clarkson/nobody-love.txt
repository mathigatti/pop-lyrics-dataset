Ah yeah, ah yeah
Everybody's looking for that something
No one ever wants to pay the price (alright, alright)
Everybody's scared of going nowhere
But we ain't going anywhere tonight


I should be more cynical and tell myself it's not okay
To feel this good when I'm with you
Try my best to fight it, say I hate you but I always stay
Ohh 'cause

Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
(Wait hold up)

Everbody's talking about the next thing
Feel like what they got ain't good enough (oh, oh yeah)
But all I wanna do is release the tension (alright, alright)
Bring the conversation back to us (oh yeah)

I should be more cynical and tell myself it's not okay
To feel this good when I'm with you
Try my best to fight it, say I hate you but I always stay
Ohh 'cause

Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do

Can we stop all the yelling baby, hear me out
I want you here and now
Try my best to fight it, say I hate you but I always stay
Heyy
Heyy
Heyy Ohh Yeaahh

Yeah, alright
Everybody's looking for that new thing
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Ain't nobody nobody nobody love
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
(Oh it's over)
