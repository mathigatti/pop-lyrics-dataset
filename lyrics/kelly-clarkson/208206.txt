Ooh 
Don't think I can't feel that there's something wrong 
You've been the sweetest part of my life for so long 
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light 
And you and I know 
There'll be a storm tonight 
But baby this is serious 
Are you thinkin' 'bout you or us


Don't say what you're about to say 
Look back before you leave my life 
Be sure before you close that door 
Before you roll those dice 
Baby think twice 

Baby this is serious (this is serious) 
Are you thinking 'bout you or us

Baby (don't say what your about to say) 
No, no, no, no 

Look back before you leave my life (don't leave my life) 
Be sure before you close that door 
Before you roll those dice 

Baby, think twice 
I depend on you 
Before you sacrifice 
Before roll those dice 
Baby, think twice
