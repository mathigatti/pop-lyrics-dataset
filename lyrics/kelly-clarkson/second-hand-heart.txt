The light of the morning finds you sleeping in my bed
And it's not like the stories, it's never like what they said
I know who you want me to be, but I'm just not there yet
Yeah, the broken road's always been home and it's so hard to forget


Wait for me now
Will you wait for me now?

I might think too much, drink too much, stay out too late
I know I'm just a fool, but I swear I can change
I can't steal you the stars
But I can give you this second hand heart
All your friends think I'm hopeless, they don't understand
That this imperfect love can start over again
It's been broken apart
Will you still take my second hand heart?

Will you still take my second hand heart?

If you let me show you, I could love you the same
And I can't steal you the stars, but I can try every day
Oh, you know they'll never tear us apart
And I'm just a fool, but I swear I can change
I can't steal you the stars, but I can try every day
And you know, you've got my second hand heart

You might think too much, drink too much, stay out too late
I know you've been a fool, but I swear you can change
