I woke up and called this morning
The tone of your voice was a warning
That you don't care for me anymore


I made up the bed we sleep in
I looked at the clock when you creep in
It's 6 AM and I'm alone

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending
To the bad day I was just beginning
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake

Your friends are sorry for me
They watch you pretend to adore me
But I'm no fool to this game

Now here comes your secret lover
She'll be unlike any other
Until your guilt goes up in flames

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending
To the bad day I got used to spending
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake

You're my favorite mistake
Maybe nothing lasts forever
Even when you stay together
I don't need forever after
It's your laughter
Won't let me go so I'm holding on this way

Did you know
Could you tell
You were the only one
That I ever loved
Now everything's so wrong

Did you see me walking by
Did it ever make you cry
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake
