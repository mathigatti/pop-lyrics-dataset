You closed every door right in my face
You chose to ignore my presence in this place
You thought I'd never make it without you
And now you're watching me from your living room


You left me on the outside looking in
You saw me as a risk not worth takin'
You slammed the door before you could realize
Behind this average girl there's a fire inside

Hear me, I bet you hear me now
See me, you're seein' clearer now aren't you?
Treat me a little better now
Now that I'm here who's lookin' down on who now?

You led me to think I was a fool
The only words from you were 'stupid little girl'
You tried your best to kill my hopes and my dreams
Too bad you couldn't see the strength inside me
You pushed and pushed me out, thinking you'd win
Feeding me lies about a world I'd never fit in
Why would I ever wanna just fit in?
I know I'm better than that
I'm something worth remembering

Hear me, I bet you hear me now
See me, you're seein' clearer now aren't you?
Treat me a little better now
Now that I'm here who's lookin' down on who now?

Hear me creepin' through your stereo
See me, not bad for a small town girl
You can't escape me, I'm all around
Everywhere you turn, my voice, my face, my sound

Hear me, I bet you hear me now
See me, you're seein' clearer now
Treat me a little better now
Now that I'm here who's lookin'...

Hear me
See me, you're seein' clearer now
Treat me a little, a little better now
Now that I'm here who's lookin' down on who now?

Hear me
See me
Treat me, you're treatin' me better now
Now that I'm here who's lookin' down on who now?
