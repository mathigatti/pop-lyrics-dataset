There was a time
When I was so brokenhearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind, listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that you kissed me


I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin to forget you
Your Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me

Now there's not even breathin' room
No, no, no
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah you cry when we're makin' love
Must be one and the same

'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
'Till you give your heart away
Yeeeaaahhh
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin to forget you
Your Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cos to let you
Do what you down on, down on, baby, baby, baby

Baby, yeah
