I don't wanna be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time


Catching my breath, letting it go,
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know, this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath,
No one can hold me back,
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath,
Won't let them let me down,
It's all so simple now

Addicted to the love i found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith when it comes around
I will spent the rest of my life

Catching my breath, letting it go,
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know, this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath,
No one can hold me back,
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath,
Won't let them let me down,
It's all so simple now

You helped me see
The beauty in everything

Catching my breath, letting it go,
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know, this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
(catch my breath)

Catch my breath,
No one can hold me back,
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath,
Won't let them let me down,
It's all so simple now (it's all so simple now)

Catching my breath, letting it go,
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know, this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath, no one can hold me back,
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath,
Won't let them let me down,
It's all so simple now
