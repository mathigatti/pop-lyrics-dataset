Lay back, enjoy the fall lover I won't hurt you
I take it all on if you trust me
Don't hesitate let it go, let me know, baby show me
I don't read minds but I'm trying my best to read yours


Yeah
Let me know, let me know
Yeah
Let me know, it's all for you

Help me help yourself
I want to give it all to you but
Don't make me second guess, I don't want to play games no more
For sure I've got your back, I've never wanted anything more than you and your sexy smile
I love you so try not to blow it this time

Yeah
Let me know, let me know
Yeah
Let me know, it's all for you

Everything inside you, about you
I want to know, taste, hold, love you anytime I want to
Let me show you, let me give you everything I have saved just for you
I know you love me but I'm gonna need more than what you're giving me
I want to feel you but I feel empty
You gotta help me, you gotta meet me halfway
There I see you, can you see me, closer now
Just tell me, show me, what it's gonna take to get you to trust me, love me like I know you can

Yeah
Let me know, let me know
Yeah
Let me know, it's all for you
