I've been holding every breathing and
it's all I can do
Haging on every word and
Just like a fool, I throught I could get over you


So Call me, when you fall in love
So I can get on with my life
Call me, when you find the one
I've been thinking what I was all this time
When you fall in love
Call me

Taking the long away hope and
When I get home
It's all just been a bad dream
Then I'm not alone
And you aren't gone and move on

So Call me, when you fall in love
So I can get on with my life
Call me, when you find the one
I've been thinking what I was all this time
When you fall in love
Call me

Even know I know its wrong
The holding to this holding on
Its coping, what could it be?
I know the truth, and know it hurts
And now I know its not the worst
Letting go it's not give in


So Call me, when you fall in love
So I can get on with my life
So call me, when you find the one
I've been thinking what I was all this time
When you fall in love
Call me
