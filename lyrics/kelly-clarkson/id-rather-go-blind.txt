Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said
Cry Girl
When I saw you and that girl
Walking around


I would rather
I would rather
Go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away
From me, child

Oooh, So you see I love you so much
That I don't want to watch you leave me, baby
Most of all I just don't
I just don't want
To be free, no

I was just
I was just
I was just
Sitting here thinking
Of your kisses

And your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection
In the glass that I held
To my lips now, baby
Revealed the tears
That was on my face, yeah

And baby, baby
I would rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away
See you walk away from me, yeah
Baby, baby, baby
I'd rather be blind now
