If I could recapture
All of the memories
And bring them to life
Surely I would


Hear the distant laughter
Wasn't it you and me
Surviving the night
You're fading out of my sight
Swiftly

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing
Oh, I was so enraptured
No sensibility
To open my eyes

I misunderstood
Now you're fading faster
It's suddenly hard to see
You're taking the light
Letting the shadows inside
Swiftly

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing, oh
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing, oh

Reaching out into the distance
Searching for spirits of the past
Just a trace of your existence to grasp
And if somehow I could recapture
All of the memories

And bring them to life
Lord knows I would
But now you're fading faster
Getting so hard to see
Taking the light
Letting the darkness inside

Swiftly
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing, oh
You're vanishing
Drifting so far away
Oh, (vanishing) vanishing, oh, yeah (vanishing) away
