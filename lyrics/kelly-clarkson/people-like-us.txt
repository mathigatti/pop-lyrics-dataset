We come into this world unknown
But know that we are not alone
They try and knock us down
The change is coming, it's our turn now


Hey, everybody loses it
Everybody wants to throw it all away sometimes
And, hey, I know what you're going through
Don't let it get the best of you
You'll make it out alive

Oh, people like us
We've gotta stick together
Keep your head up
Nothing lasts forever
Here's to the damned, to the lost and forgotten
It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom

Oh, oh, oh
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh, oh, oh
Sing it for the people like us
The people like us

Hey, this is not a funeral
It's a revolution
After all your tears have turned to rage
Just wait, everything will be ok
Even when you're feeling like it's going down in flames

Oh, people like us
We've gotta stick together
Keep your head up
Nothing lasts forever
Here's to the damned, to the lost and forgotten
It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom

Oh, oh, oh
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh, oh, oh
Sing it for the people like us
The people like us

Oh, oh, oh
You just gotta turn it up loud when the flames get higher
Oh, oh, oh
Sing it for the people like us
The people like us

They can't do nothing to you
They can't do nothing to me
This is the life that we choose
This is the life that we lead
So throw your fists in the air
Come out, come out, if you dare
Tonight we're gonna change forever

Everybody loses it
Everybody wants to throw it all away sometimes

Oh, people like us
We've gotta stick together
Keep your head up
Nothing lasts forever
Here's to the damned, to the lost and forgotten
It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom

Oh, oh, oh
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh, oh, oh
Sing it for the people like us
The people like us
Oh, oh, oh
You just gotta turn it up loud when the flames get higher
Oh, oh, oh
Sing it for the people like us
The people like us
Oh, oh, oh
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh, oh, oh
Sing it for the people like us
The people like us
Oh, oh, oh
You just gotta turn it up loud when the flames get higher
Oh, oh, oh
Sing it for the people like us
The people like us
