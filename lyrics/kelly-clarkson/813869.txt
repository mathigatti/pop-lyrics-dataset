you need to understand,
I need to tell you.
All the times i had the chance,
i let them pass by,
I never knew, till it was to late,
I didnt think it would be this way.
Im here with all the guilt, and everything to say.


I didnt appritiate you,
i took it for granit, just like i always do.
im standing all alone,
at the end of the line, paying no mind...
It happened once, it happened again.

chorus
try as i might, i could never explain,
when i see you, when i hear your name,
memory gained, bringing it all back. (X2)
so much pain, driving me insane.

I got it wrong,
thinking you were easy,
not listening when they told me.
i swore i had you, i thought i could never lose,
too much damage, so many lies, promises broken,
everything cant be forgotten..the truth is,
i used you, i didnt realize.
Now its to late, im sorry
so much left i need to say.

Chorus
try as i might, i could never explain,
when i see you, when i hear your name,
memory gained, bringing it all back. (X2)
so much pain, driving me insane.
