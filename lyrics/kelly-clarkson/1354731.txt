I\'ll be perfect and You\'ll be sweet
I\'ll be contempt and You\'ll forgive me
I\'ll forget and You\'ll be numb
Help undo the damage we\'ve become
You\'ll quit smoking and I\'ll be sober
Hide the marks that bend us broken underneath the covers


With a little bit of luck we\'ll survive
You don\'t ask me questions babe and I won\'t have to lie
With a little bit of luck I won\'t leave
I\'ll stay here with You and You\'ll be nice to me

You\'ll be kind and I\'ll be a lady
I\'ll be soft and You don\'t lay a hand on me
I\'ll be happy and You don\'t mind
I\'ll watch my temper and we\'ll stop picking a fight

With a little bit of luck we\'ll survive
You don\'t ask me questions babe and I won\'t have to lie
With a little bit of luck I won\'t leave
I\'ll stay here with You and You\'ll be nice to me

Yeah You\'ll be nice to me
I won\'t have to lie, You\'ll be nice to me
