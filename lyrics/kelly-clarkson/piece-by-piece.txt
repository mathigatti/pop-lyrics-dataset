And all I remember is your back
Walking towards the airport leaving us all in your past
I traveled 1500 miles to see you
Begged you to want me but you didn't want to


But piece by piece he collected me up off the ground
Where you abandon things, yeah
Piece by piece he filled the holes
That you burned in me at 6 years old
And you know he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
He loves me
Piece by piece he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself and now you wanna come back
But your love it isn't free, it has to be earned
Back then I didn't have anything you needed so I was worthless

But piece by piece he collected me up off the ground
Where you abandon things, yeah
Piece by piece he filled the holes
That you burned in me at 6 years old
And you know he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
'Cause he loves me
Piece by piece he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece

Piece by piece I fell far from the tree
I will never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you I'm going to put her first
And you know he'll never walk away
He'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things
He'll love her and
Piece by piece he'll restore my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great

Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
