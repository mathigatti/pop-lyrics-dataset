At last, my love has come along,
My lonely days are over,
And life is like a song,


Ohhh at last
The skys above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover,
The night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream that I, can call my own,
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to,
A thrill that I, have never known,

Ohhh you smile, you smile
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven,
For you are mine, at last!
