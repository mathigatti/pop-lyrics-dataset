Roll over baby, the time has come
to make a little bit more room
I've hung around you, it's getting tough
I think I'm gonna break down soon


I remember, crying in the park, it was getting dark
Suddenly I looked up
You were my sky
So go on and
Sleep darling
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
It's such a shame
We just missed the train

Be quiet angel, don't make a sound
Save it for a rainy day
Oh can't you see me, I'm such a mess
trying hard to find my way

Do you remember, wasting all that time, we were feeling fine
Though we couldn't walk a line
We were alright

So go on and
Sleep darling
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
It's such a shame
We just missed the train

Oh, why'd that train just pass us by
Didn't anyone see
We were stuck at the light
Or we would've made it on time

So sleep darling
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
It's such a shame
We just missed the train
