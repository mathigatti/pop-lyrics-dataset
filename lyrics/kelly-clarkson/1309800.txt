Frozen,
Forgetful again,
The Part where I
Loose My Head
The scene where I'm supposed to speak,


But instead,
I sit,
And Listen Again,
I'm Stuck,
With These Cards

I Guess,
Leaping,
From this cliff in my thoughts,
I fly like,
Like the stones in my heart,
Drowning in doubt,
For what reason,

I Sit,
So Patiently,
Drenched in,
What you want me to be,
I can't escape,

I'm Ready Now,
Oh, I'm Ready Now,
Oh, I'm Ready Now,
Come Get Me

Fearless,
With Cape In Hand,
Conquer,
What I need two to mend,
Little Girls Get So Broken.

I Sit,
So Patiently,
Drenched in,
What you want me to be,
I can't See No Escape,

I'm Ready Now,
Oh, I'm Ready Now,
Oh, I'm Ready Now,
Come Get Me

Through with golden roads and perfect love
Too much of your mouth is like too much sun
How I burn, how I burn?
I was so patient waiting for my turn
I fly like stone as I break every bone
Come get me

I'm Ready Now,
Oh, I'm Ready Now,
Oh, I'm Ready Now,
Come Get Me
