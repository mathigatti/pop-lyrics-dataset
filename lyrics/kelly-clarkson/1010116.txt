Wonder how I ever made it through a day.
How did I settle for a world in shades of gray?
When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same and you don't know why. Then I looked into your eyes.
Where the road stretched out in front of me
And I realized...


-Chorus-
I never lived before your love.
I never felt before your touch.
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive.
But then again I wasn't really living.
I never lived before your love.

I wanted more than just an ordinary life.
All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky.
I stand before you and my heart is in your hands
And I don't know how I survived without your kiss
'Cause you've given me a reason to exist.

-Chorus-
I never lived before your love.
I never felt before your touch.
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive.
But then again I wasn't really living.
I never lived before your love.

I never lived before your love!

-Interlude-

And you don't know why
Why the sun decides to shine.
But you've breathed your love
Into me just in time.

I never lived before your love.
I never felt before your touch.
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive.
But then again I wasn't really living.
I never lived
I never lived
Before your love.
