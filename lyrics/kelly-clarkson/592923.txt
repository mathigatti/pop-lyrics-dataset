I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons 
Finally content with a past I regret 
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness 
For once I'm at peace with myself 
I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long 
I'm movin' on 


I've lived in this place and I know all the faces 
Each one is different but they're always the same 
They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it 
They'll never allow me to change 
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong 
I'm movin' on 

I'm movin' on 
At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me 
And I know there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone 
There comes a time in everyone's life 
When all you can see are the years passing by 
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone 

I sold what I could and packed what I couldn't 
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town 
I've loved like I should but lived that I shouldn't 
I had to lose everything to find out 
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road 
I'm movin' on 

I'm movin' on 
I'm movin' on
