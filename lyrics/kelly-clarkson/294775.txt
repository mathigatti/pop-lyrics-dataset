The boys are bad, The boys are good 
They would all love me if only they could 
It's only playin', It's only pretend 
'Cause I can see through all these men now 


Who am I supposed to be? 
A girl who stays at home alone? 
No, baby needs a fantasy 
Someone who'll never let me go 

Could I be forgiven 
For how I want my life to be? 

I'm gonna wish upon a star 
I wanna go a bit too far 
Need a little love to get me by 
Let's start with you and I 

I'm gonna wish upon a star 
I wanna go a bit too far 
Need a little love to get me by 
Let's start with you and I 


I'm gonna wish upon a star 
Don't you think I'm goin' too far? 
Need a little trouble to get me by 
Let's start with you and I 

Da dum, da dum 
Da dum, da dum 
Da, Da, Da, Da 

If you like what you're seeing 
You can believe I'm 
Gonna have it my way 
So you better watch out 
And you should have no doubt 
I don't care what people say 

I'm gonna wish upon a star 
Need a little love to get me by 

I'm gonna wish upon a star 
I wanna go a bit too far 
Need a little love to get me by 
Let's start with you and I 

I'm gonna wish upon a star 
Do you think I'm goin' too far 
Need a little trouble to get me by 
Let's start with you and I 
(you and I) 

I'm gonna wish upon a star 
I wanna go a bit too far 
Need a little love to get me by 
Let's start with you and I 

I'm gonna wish upon a star 
Don't you think I'm goin' too far 
Need a little trouble to get me by 
Let's start with you and I 
(You and I)
