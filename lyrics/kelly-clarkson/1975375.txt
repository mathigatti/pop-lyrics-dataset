Could you love somebody like that
Could you attract someone like that
Could you go where people can see someone like me
Could you do that


Would you face me, make me
Listen to the truth even if it breaks me
You can judge me ,love me
If you are hating me
Do it honestly

All I see are stepford like lives
Needles and knives
Beautifull lies
Bringing out the green in your eyes
A perfect disguise for envy and pride

Face me, make me
Listen to the truth, even if it breaks me
Jugde me, love me
If you are hating me do it honestly

Face me, make me
Listen to the truth, even if it breaks me
You can jugde me, love me
If you are hating me

Would you face me, make me
Listen to the truth even if it breaks me
Judge me ,love me
If you are hating me
Do it honestly

You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me

If you're hating me, do it honestly

You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
You can tell me
