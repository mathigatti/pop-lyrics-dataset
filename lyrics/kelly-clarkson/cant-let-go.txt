There you are
Holding her hand
I am lost
Dying to understand
Didn't I
Cherish u right
Dont u know
U were my life


Even though I try
I can't let go
Something in your eyes captures my soul
And everynight I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I cant let go

Just cast aside
U dont even know I'm alive
U just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am still holding on
I cant accept my world is gone
No no

Even though I try
I cant let go
Something in your eyes captures my soul
And everynight I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I cant let go

Do you ever realise
The sorrow I have inside
Everyday of my life
Do you know the way it feels
When all your love just dies
I try and try to deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind

Even though I try
I cant let go
Something in your eyes captures my soul
And everynight I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
