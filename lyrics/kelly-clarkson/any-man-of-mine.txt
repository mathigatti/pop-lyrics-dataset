This is what a woman wants
Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, he still better love me
And I can be late for a date that's fine
But he better be on time
Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day
And if I change my mind
A million times
I want to hear him say


Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah, I like it that way
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fire breathin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine
Well any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's lookin' better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He better say, mm, I like it like that, yeah
And if I change my mind
A million times

I want to hear him say
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah I like it that way
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fire breathin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Yeah, I like it that way
any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fire breathin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine
You gotta shimmy shake
Make the earth quake

Kick, turn, stomp, stomp, then you jump
Heel to toe, do si do
'Til your boots want to break
'Til your feet and your back ache
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
Come on everybody on the floor
A-one two, a-three four
Hup, two, hup
If you want to be a man of mine, that's right
This is what a woman wants
