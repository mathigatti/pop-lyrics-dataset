Watch you grow away from me in photographs
And memories like spies
And salt betrays my eyes again
I started losing sleep and gaining weight
And wishing I was ten again
So I could be your friend again


These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six am and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up

I heard you found some pretty words to say
You found your little game to play
And there's no one allowed in
Then just when we believe we could be great
Reality it permeates
And conquers from within again

These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six am and I'm all messed up
I didn't maen to waste your time

So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
I know we're ok
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
I know we're ok

These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six am and I'm all messed up
I didn't maen to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up
