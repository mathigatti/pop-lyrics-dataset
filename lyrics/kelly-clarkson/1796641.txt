When you hit the bottom
When you're left with nothing
When you can't tell the difference, yeah
You still won't know what it's like


When you think you're drowning
When it's overwhelming
When you can't get past it, yeah
You still won't know what it's like
What it's like

You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen
You haven't lived enough to know what it means
To feel the pain in love turned cold
To taste the end before it's over

When your heart is broken
And you can trust no one
When you think you're lonely, yeah
You still won't know what it's like

When you feel like nothing
You just can't take it
When your heart is breaking
You still won't know what it's like
What it's like

You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen
You haven't lived enough to know what it means
To feel the pain in love turned cold
To taste the end before it's over

You don't know the person suffering
So before you start trading stocks for sympathies
Take a look at what's left of me
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me

Every day I fight a war with God
And every time I think you've figured it out?
No it's not

You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen
You haven't lived enough to know what it means
To feel the pain in love turned cold
To taste the end before it's over

You don't know the person suffering
So before you start trading stocks for sympathies
Take a look at what's left of me
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me

You don't know the person suffering
So before you start trading stocks for sympathies
Take a look at what's left of me
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me
