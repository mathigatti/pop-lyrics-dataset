You and me
We used to be together
Every day together always


I really feel
that I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe
This could be the end

It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real,
Well I don't want to know

*CHORUS*
Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories
They can be inviting
But some are altogether
Mighty frightening

As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands
I sit and cry

*CHORUS*
It's all ending
I gotta stop pretending who we are...

You and me
I can see us dying ... are we?

*CHORUS*
I know you're good
I know you're good
I know you're real good oh
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
Don't, don't
Ohh Ohh

Hush me hush me darling
Hush me hush me darling
Hush me hush me, don't tell me 'cause it hurts
