Baby I've been livin' in the dark
The only friend I got here's my broken heart
Feelin' like I've finally had enough
Livin' like an animal can be so rough


I've been waitin' so long for you to come my way
And now I, I can't wait another day

When you hold me, I finally see
When you say love I know what it means
I was broke down so long in the dark
Until you showed me the light, baby
'Cause when you kiss me I know who I am
And when you let me feel it I understand
When I'm lost I just look in your eyes
You show me the meaning of life
Meaning of life, life, life, life
You show me the meaning of life
Meaning of life, life, life, life
You show me the meaning of life

Every time I spend a lonely night, yeah
Thinkin' I won't make it till the morning light
All I do is think of you and I
Suddenly the wrongs, they start to feel so right (feel so right)

I've been waiting so long for you to come my way (come my way, yeah)
And now I, I can't wait another day

When you hold me, I finally see (when you hold me I see)
When you say love I know what it means (I know what it means, yeah)
I was broke down so long in the dark
Until you showed me the light (until you showed me the light)
'Cause when you kiss me I know who I am (I know who I am)
And when you let me feel it I understand (ooh, I understand)
When I'm lost I just look in your eyes
You show me the meaning of life
Meaning of life, life, life, life
You show me the meaning of life
Meaning of life, life, life, life
Show me the meaning of life

You show me love
You lift me up
You take me higher and higher
The truth is I'm in love
Can you feel us
We're flyin' higher
Oh, you show me love
You lift me up
You take me higher and higher
The truth is I'm in love
Can you feel us
We're flyin' higher

Meaning of life, life, life, life
You show me the meaning of life
Meaning of life, life, life, life
Show me the meaning of life
Show me the meaning of life
Ooh, show me the meaning of life
