You're complicatin' things
I need some room to breathe
I gotta get back to simplicity
If you want more than this
Then tell me what it is I gotta do
oh, this is killin' me
I need you to see
That somethin's gotta change


Can we go back to the way we used to be
Back to the butterflies
Starin' deep in your eyes
Can we go back to how we used to be
'Cause livin' and lovin' was easy
We gotta find a way to fool reality
And go back to the way we used to be

When did we mess it up
What happened to love
We had it good
But it wasn't enough
We shouldn't let it fade all the way
We're over thinkin' this way too much
I want you next to me
But somethin's gotta change

Can we go back to the way we used to be
Back to the butterflies
Starin' deep in your eyes
Can we go back to how we used to be
'Cause livin' and lovin' was easy
We gotta find a way to fool reality
And go back to the way we used to be

Oh, can we go back

No it doesn't have to be this hard
And this isn't the way we are
Our love was effortless
Now it's tearin' us apart
Oh, I'm getting tired of the fight
We can't pretend that it's alright
I'm slowly losing hope
Baby can we try

Can we go back to the way we used to be
Back to the butterflies
Starin' deep in your eyes
Can we go back to how we used to be
'Cause livin' and lovin' was easy
We gotta find a way to fool reality
And go back to the way we used to be

And go back to the way we used to be
