I see how you're tryin' to
Weasel your way in and boy, I
Know how you maneuver
With your, your confusion
You tell me that I'm your only
And how bad that you want me
Then why are you so shady
If I'm supposed to be your lady


Why should I believe anything you say
And how could you shame me that way
Tell me where, where'd you get the nerve
To even think that you, you could play me, boy

You thought we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your cover's blown
'Cause we both know now, oh no
You thought you had us both
At your beckon call
But now who's the joke
And look who's laughing now

Now you're trying to use us
Against one another but it won't work
I see right through your game, boy
And I know exactly where the blame falls
You, you try to deny all your actions
For once in your life be a real man
At least give me the proper respect of the truth
I already know you did it

Why should I believe anything you say
And how could you treat me that way
Tell me where, where'd you get the nerve to even think that you
You could play me boy

Now I see right through you baby
You try to tell me you want me
Can't you just get it through your thick head
'Cause I have seen this game before and
Now I'm showing you the door so
Shut your mouth I'm not tryin' to hear your lies, no, not again
Sorry you couldn't be a better man
Guess you thought wrong
Look who's laughin' now
