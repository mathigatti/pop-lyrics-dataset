You know I was broke down
I had hit the ground
I was crying out
Couldn't make no sound
No one hears the silent tears collecting
You know I had lost hope
I was all alone
Never been so low
'Til you came along
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting


Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause I can take on so much more than I have ever dreamed
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause baby I am ready to be free

Now I am invincible
No I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah I am invincible
What was I running for
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm

Now I am a warrior
A shooting star
You know I got this far, I had a broken heart
No one hears the silent tears collecting
'Cause it's being weak that's strong
In the truth I'm found
I have courage now
Gonna shout it out
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting

Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause I can take on so much more than I have ever dreamed
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause baby I am ready to be free

Now I am invincible
No I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah I am invincible
What was I running for
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm

I was running from an empty threat of emptiness
I was running from an empty threat that didn't exist
I was running from an empty threat of abandonment
I was running from an empty threat that didn't exist

But now I am invincible
No I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah I am invincible
What was I running for
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm

Now I am invincible
No I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah I am invincible
What was I running for
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm
