I gues my silver lining is here in front my sight
'Cause I can't see much reason to go on pretending
I guess I tried too hard, pushed us too much, too far
What can I say to change it, I'll never know 'cause baby


You're not here, he's not you
And I'm too scared to even move
Oh, what am I gonna do?
It's not fair, she's not me
It's hard enough just to breathe
I can't lose, I can't lose you

It's been too long since I kissed your face
Yeah, I've been so lost since you ran away
No, I can't keep crying any longer, baby
I can't lose, I can't lose you
Torn enough, but you're not around
But I can't stand you in other's arms
Yeah, I know we said goodbye
But now I know I can't lose, I can't lose you

I guess it's not surprising
Who wouldn't love your smile?
She doesn't know what she has
My love, I need you back
Well I guess I'm way too late
My pride, my foolish ways
To kill away, my baby
What can I say to change this?

You're not here, he's not you
And I'm too scared to even move
Oh, what am I gonna do?
It's not fair, she's not me
It's hard enough just to breathe
I can't lose, I can't lose you

It's been too long since I kissed your face
Yeah, I've been so lost since you ran away
No, I can't keep crying any longer, baby
I can't lose, I can't lose you
Torn enough, but you're not around
But I can't stand you in other's arms
Yeah, I know we said goodbye
But now I know I can't lose, I can't lose you

I close my eyes and make believe
That it's not him, it's you kissing me
Trying to convince myself we're through
But it's no you, no you
Baby it's no you

You're not here, he's not you
And I'm too scared to even move
Oh, what am I gonna do?
It's not fair, she's not me
It's hard enough just to breathe
I can't lose, I can't lose you

It's been too long since I kissed your face
Yeah, I've been so lost since you ran away
No, I can't keep crying any longer, baby
I can't lose, I can't lose you
Torn enough, but you're not around
But I can't stand you in other's arms
I know we said goodbye
But now I know I can't lose, I can't lose you
I can't lose you, I can't lose you
