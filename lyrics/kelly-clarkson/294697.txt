Maybe i'm a fool, 
to feel the way i do
but i would play the fool forever, 
just to be with you forever! 


I believe in miracles 
lots of miracles, 
and yes, baby your my dream come true!

I was lost,
now im free!
Oh baby please try to believe,
I do, believe in you and me!

See i was lost 
now i'm free
