I know you don't mean to be, mean to me
'Cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong
We belong...
Lately, I feel like all I am is a backup plan
I say I'm done and then you smile at me and I forget
All I've said...
I buy into those eyes and into your lies


You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll change, but I know you won't

I wish you were where you're supposed to be
Close to me
But here I am just staring at this candle burning out
And still no sound
Footsteps on my stairs
Your voice anywhere

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll change, but I know you won't

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll change, but I know you won't

I know you won't.
