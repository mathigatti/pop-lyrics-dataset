There's so much life, I've left to live
And this fire's burning still
What would happen if they ever knew
I'm in love with you


Cause I'd surrender everything
To feel the chance to live again
I reach to you, I know you can feel it too
I surrender

Every night, getting longer 
And this fire's getting stronger, baby
I swallow my pride, and I'll be alive
Did you hear my call
I surrender

I surrender everything
To feel the chance to live again
I reach to you, I know you can feel it too
I surrender
