You're tall, dark, and handsome
You're charming and then some
Know how to romance 'em
But I see through it all
You do everything too fast
You move like a whiplash
You're missin' the romance
And I see through it all


How did you go from being a mama's boy to a ladies' man?
I'm not goin' home with you tonight
But you can hold my hand
And we can take it slow
And I can show you how to slow dance
We can take it slow
And I can show you how to slow dance

You're so unassuming
You know what you're doin'
You're lookin' right through me
And you don't realize
I just see a scared boy who's lookin' for new toys
Just tryin' to fill a void and you don't realize and

How did you go from being a mama's boy to a ladies' man?
I'm not goin' home with you tonight
But you can hold my hand
And we can take it slow
And I can show you how to slow dance
We can take it slow
And I can show you how to slow dance

How did you go from being a mama's boy to a ladies' man?
I'm not goin' home with you tonight
Oh, but you can hold my hand
We can take it slow
And I can show you how to slow dance
We can take it slow (take it slow)
And I can show you how to slow dance
And we can take it slow
And I can show you how to slow dance
We can take it slow
And I can show you how to slow dance
