I never held my hand out
And asked for something free
I got pride, I could roll out
For miles in front of me
I don't need your help
And I don't need sympathy
I don't need you to lower the bar for me


I know I'm superwoman
I know I'm strong
I know I've got this
Cause I've had it all along
I'm phenomenal and I'm enough
I don't need you to tell me who to be

Can someone just hold me?
Don't fix me
Don't try to change a thing
Can someone just know me?
'Cause underneath
I'm broken and it's beautiful

I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful

We walking on the ocean
Turning water into wine
We bury our emotion
And pretend that we're just fine
The only way to live now
Is to know you're gonna fly
Don't listen to the lying liars and their lies

I know I'm superwoman
I know I'm strong
I know I've got this
Cause I've had it all along
I'm phenomenal, I'm enough
I don't need you to tell me who to be

Can someone just hold me?
Don't fix me
Don't try to change a thing
Can someone just know me?
'Cause underneath
I'm broken and it's beautiful

Hey, I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful
Hey, I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful

I'm tired
Can I just be tired?
Without piling on all sad and scared and out of time
I'm wild
Can I just be wild?
Without feeling like I'm failing and I'm losing my mind

Can someone just hold me?
Don't fix me
Don't try to change a thing
Someone just know me?
'Cause underneath
I'm broken and it's beautiful

I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful

It's beautiful
It's beautiful
It's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful

It's beautiful
It's beautiful
It's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful
