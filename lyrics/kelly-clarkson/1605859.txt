I wish you knew
all the ways I love you
I pray each night
For just a second of your time
And I watch you dance
And I can't help but wonder
if I took this step
Would you notice me at all?


It's just so hard to be so brave
Try to say it all but I never say it
Try to stand so tall but I'm so damn afraid
So afraid

Underneath it all
we're just kids with big dreams
and a stubborn heart
behind smiles and hand me downs
We're all looking for that light
A little scared
Of the dark

Sometimes I glance
Longer than I should, yeah
Hoping I might catch your eyes
Wandering around this big ol' room
Sink or swim
One day I will whisper
In your ear and tell you
Everything I've been dying to

It's just so hard to be so brave
I try to say it all but I never say it
Try to stand so tall but I'm so damn afraid
So afraid

Underneath it all
we're just kids with big dreams
and a stubborn heart
behind smiles and hand me downs
We're all looking for that light
A little scared

Underneath it all
we're just kids with big dreams
and a stubborn heart
behind smiles and hand me downs
We're all looking for that light
A little scared
Of the dark
