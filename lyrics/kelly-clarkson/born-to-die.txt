We don't hope for makin' things better
All we want is to keep it together
Every day is a rainy day, no changin' the weather
This kind of life has made our hearts as hard as leather


And all these tears are from the dust in our eyes
And all these years just keep on passin' us by
And all this misery makes it hard to deny
We all know that we're just born to die
That's the way it goes when you're just born to die

I hear the voice of a whip-poor-will singin'
She don't know all the comfort she's bringin'
We all know the sound of when the truth is ringin'
Yeah, it hurts your soul just like a bumblebee stingin'

All these tears are from the dust in our eyes
And all these years just keep on passin' us by
And all this misery makes it hard to deny
We all know that we're just born to die
That's the way it goes when you're just born to die

All these tears are from the dust in our eyes
And all these years just keep on passin' us by
And all this misery makes it hard to deny
We all know that we're just born to die
'Cause we all know that we're just born to die
That's the way it goes when you're just born to die
