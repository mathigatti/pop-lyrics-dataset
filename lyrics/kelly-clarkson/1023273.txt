Everybody says you're no good for me
Nothing but trouble is what you bring
Everybody thinks you're out to get me
Helpless little fool they must think I am
Everybody thinks that we're both crazy
Well it's just my luck


Is anybody out there
I'm standing here all alone
And I, I just don't know
Is anybody this weird
Will someone ever get my twisted thoughts, my ways
I guess not today

Everybody says I'm no good for you
Nothing but trouble is what I bring
Everybody thinks I'm out to get you
Well it's just my luck

Is anybody out there
I'm standing here all alone
And I, I just don't know
Is anybody this weird
Will someone ever get my twisted heart, my ways
I guess not today

You look like a mess
I'd like to know
How about moving just a little closer
I think maybe one day I
I could love you

Is anybody out there
I'm standing here all alone
And I, I just don't know
Is anybody this weird
Will someone ever get my twisted thoughts, my ways
I guess not today

Not today
Guess not
Today
Not today
Not today
