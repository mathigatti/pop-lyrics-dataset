Baby Baby
I just lost my heart
I dont know just where to find it
I think that I will never find it
oh I lost my heart


I was walkin with you that night
You thought that I would take it easy
But, you were wrong
Thats when I lost my heart

That empty space I had inside of me.
lasted for all eternity
I new that i couldn't love again
When i lost my heart
because of your foolishness

OH I CANT GO ON
now that I lost my Heart

Oh it is gone
