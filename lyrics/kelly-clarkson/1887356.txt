Can't ever get it right
No matter how hard I try
And I've tried
I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives
And I'm tired


As you break my heart again this time

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen
Listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That your needin distance
Distance
Tell me anything but don't you say shes what your
Missin baby
If she's the reason that your leaving me here tonight
Tell me
Tell me a lie

You're the charming type
That little twinkle
In your eye
Gets me every time
And well there musta been a time
I was the reason for that smile
So keep in mind

As you take
Whats left of you and I

Tell me Im a screwed up mess
That I never listen
Listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That your needin distance
Distance
Tell me anything but don't you say she's what your missin baby
If she's the reason that your leavin me here tonight
Cause baby what your thinkin

Tell me
tell me a lie
Tell me
tell me a lie
Tell me
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie

Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen
Listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That your needin distance
Distance
Tell me anything but don't you say she's what your missin baby
If she's the reason that your leavin me here tonight

Tell me tell me a lie
