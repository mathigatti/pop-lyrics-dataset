You said you need some space to breathe
A little time away from me should fix this
I don't understand your ways, no
If I'm such a big problem
Maybe you should be on your way
Why should I waste my time with a child
That can't stick around long enough to figure things out
Why should I wait around?
When I could be searching for my future
'Cause obviously it's not with you


Why can't I find someone who loves me, needs me, feels me
Ooh, oh why
Why do I waste all of my time on little boys who can't keep up with me
Oh, why, why, why, why

You said you want some time apart
You need to be away from me to really appreciate me
Ooh, you must be kidding me
Boy, stop wasting my time, get away from me
Maybe now just not my time for love
Maybe I'm not ready or maybe it's not ready for me
Seems I'm always searching, I can't ever find you
Where are you? Where are you?

Why can't I find someone who loves me, needs me, feels me
Ooh, oh why, why
Why do I waste all of my time on little boys who can't keep up with me
Oh, why, why, why, why

Where are you? Where are you?
I'm feeling tired
I need you here with me, oh
Why can't I just find you
Someone who knows me
Won't you please find me, find me, no?

Why can't I find someone who loves me, needs me
Ooh, oh
Why do I waste all of my time on little boys
On little boys who can't keep up with me
Oh, no, no
No, why do I waste all my time, all my time, ooh
Oh
