Hey you
Do you think you could make it any worse
Hey you
Keep trying, but I don't think it's gonna work.
I have no more heart to break
You took what's left of me
Down on my knees, I see you're not through
Taking, take what you want, you're gonna do it anyway
Too damn sad to fake
No smiles on this face
I'm through pretending I'm okay
I'm not okay


It's been so long since I've felt the sun, I need to
It's been too long since I've felt the touch of anyone
It's been far too long, far too long
I'm going home
I'm going home

Hey you
Do you think you could push me anymore
Hey you
Keep pushing as I, I sit here and burn
I have no more tears to cry
I feed into your lies
To make you satisfied
I push myself aside

It's been so long since I've felt the sun, I need to
It's been too long since I've felt the touch of anyone
It's been far too long, far too long
I'm going home
I'm going home

It's been so long since I've felt the sun, I need to
It's been too long since I've felt the touch of anyone
It's been far too long, far too long
I'm going home
Home
Home
