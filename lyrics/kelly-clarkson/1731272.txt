Somewhere in the night, there is darkness, there is light
And I'm reaching within to find where the sadness ends
Cause maybe then I'll know why I always feel alone
I need something to hold something to call my own


Find a wishing well or a shooting star
Find a fairytale that takes me so far
Away from here I just want to feel more

Cause I've been waiting all my life
For a fire to burn and a lesson to learn
Nothing ever turns out right
But I'll still believe that someday I'll see that
It's never too late to find
Love in these eyes
Love in these eyes

Sometimes I get tired
It's like this road goes on for miles
And nobody knows how hard it is to smile
Smile

Find a wishing well or a shooting star
Find a fairytale that takes me so far
Away from here I just want to feel more

Cause I've been waiting all my life
For a fire to burn and a lesson to learn
Nothing ever turns out right
But I'll still believe that someday you'll see that
It's never too late as long as it takes
It's never too late to find
Love in these eyes

Someday I'll look in the mirror
And staring at me

Will be the person I am
And the person that I always thought I could be

Cause I've been waiting all my life
For a fire to burn and a lesson to learn

And nothing ever turns out right
But I'll still believe that
Someday you'll see that
It's never too late as long as it takes
It's never too late to find
Love in these eyes

Love in these eyes, in these eyes
