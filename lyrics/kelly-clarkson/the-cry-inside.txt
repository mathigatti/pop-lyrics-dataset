To whom do I talk when I talk to God?
To whom do I really pray?
Where's the song
When the words have come
Do I pray to a lonely light?


I poured my soul in a heart of glass
Then the Autumn sun turned red
The only thing they did not take
Was your cry inside my head

I prayed for the light from a dying star
That dies in its flames every day
I pray for the light that comes from the night
That comes from that star far away

I poured my soul in a heart of glass
Then the Autumn sun turned red
The only thing they did not take
Was your cry inside my head

I'll cry alone, I'll cry in vain
I'll cry out your father's name
At the water's edge, I'll hold you, child
Hold you, hold you
Hold you in my arms again

I'll cry out your father's name
I'll hold you in my arms again

I poured my soul in a heart of glass
Then the Autumn sun turned red
The only thing they never take
Was that cry inside my head

The only thing they did not take
Was that cry inside my head

Your cry inside my head
Your cry inside my head
