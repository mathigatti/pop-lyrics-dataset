Bells will be ringing
The glad, glad news
Oh, what a christmas
To have the blues
My baby's gone
I have no friends
To wish me greetings
Once again


Choirs will be singing
"silent night"
Christmas carols
By candlelight
Please come home for christmas
Baby please come home for christmas
If not for christmas
By new year's night

Friends and relations
Send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above

It's christmas yea
It's christmas
The time of year
To be, with the one you love

Then won't you tell me
You'll never more roam
Christmas and new year's
Will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow
No grief no pain
Then I'll be happy, happy
Once again

There'll be no more sorrow
No grief and pain
Then I'll be happy
Christmas
Once again
