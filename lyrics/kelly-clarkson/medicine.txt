Bet you won't like to hear that
Since we've been over got that stress off my back
I'm livin' my life like a celebration
Changed up my vision like a revelation
You gave me fever love but too much drama
And I ain't even worried 'bout it 'cause I'm too far gone now
Far gone now, oh yeah


I ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
I ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
Don't talk about ya
Almost forgot about you
Said I ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
I ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
Don't talk about ya
Almost forgot about you

So watch out
'Cause your love's not allowed
You touch don't heal now
I'm good (ooh)
And I know without it I'm strong
Can't hold me down long
I'm not bothered anymore

Ya can't get me high
Never got me lit
Never bring me up
Always drag me down
I'm through with it
You ain't my medicine

I gave you plenty chances
To hear my soul but you just caused more damage
How does it feel to know I'm better off without you
Playin' games around my head a thousand times?
I almost damn near lost my mind

I ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
I ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
Don't talk about ya (no, no)
Almost forgot about you
I ain't even thinkin' 'bout you (no, no, no)
I ain't even thinkin' 'bout you
Don't talk about ya
Almost forgot about you

So watch out
'Cause your love's not allowed
You touch don't heal now
I'm good (Iâ€™m good, baby)
And I know without it I'm strong
Can't hold me down long
I'm not bothered anymore

Ya can't get me high
Never got me lit (got me lit)
Never bring me up
Always drag me down
I'm through with it (yeah)
You ain't my medicine
Like damn
Always felt so cold
Always felt so cold
Had to let that go
I'm better on my own
You ain't my medicine

You ain't my med-
You ain't my med-
You ain't my medicine
You ain't my med-
You ain't my med-
You ain't my medicine

You ain't my med-
You ain't my med-
You ain't my medicine
You ain't my med-
You ain't my med-
You ain't my medicine

So watch out
'Cause your love's not allowed
You touch don't heal now
I'm good (oh)
And I know without it I'm strong
Can't hold me down long
I'm not bothered anymore

Ya can't get me high
Never got me lit
Never bring me up
Always drag me down
I'm through with it
You ain't my medicine
Like damn
Always felt so cold
Always felt so cold
Had to let that go
I'm better on my own
You ain't my medicine
