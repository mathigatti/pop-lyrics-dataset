I know that you need it
I know that you don't need me to repeat it
But everything I have to give, I'll give to you
It's not like we planned it
You tried to stay, but you could not stand it
To see me shut down so slow
as though it was an easy thing to do


Listen when
All of this around us'll fall over
I tell you what we're gonna do
You will shelter me my love
And I will shelter you

I left you heartbroken, but not until those very words were spoken
Has anybody ever made such a fool out of you
It's so hard to believe it
Even as our eyes do see it
The very things that made you live are killing you

Listen when all of this around us has fallen over
I tell you what we're gonna do
You will shelter me my love
And I will shelter you
We will shelter you
I will shelter you
We will pray with you
we will pray with you
Shelter you
We will shelter you

Listen when
All of this around us has fallen down
We will gonna shelter you
