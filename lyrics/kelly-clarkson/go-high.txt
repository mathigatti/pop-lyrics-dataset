It's too much, can't see
It's too much, can't breathe
It's so not for me
Way too much


And I get lonely on the high road
Everywhere that I go
Stand for nothin' fall short
But not me

But I won't give up
I'll keep givin' love
It runs through my blood
I'll never give up, yeah

When you go low, I go high
I go high, I go high
When you go low, I go high
To get by, to get by
Sometimes I don't wanna be nice (n-nice)
But I try (but I try)
When you go low, I go high

It's all good, move on
It's all good, I'm strong
It's not what I want, what I want

And I get lonely on the high road
Everywhere that I go
Stand for nothin' fall short
But not me

But I won't give up
I'll keep givin' love
It runs through my blood
I'll never give up, yeah

When you go low, I go high
I go high, I go high
When you go low, I go high
To get by, to get by
Sometimes I don't wanna be nice (n-nice)
But I try (but I try)
When you go low, I go high

High as the note that I sing
High as the kite with no string
High is what I have to be
When you go low, I go high just to breathe
High as the smoke that you blow
High as you think I can't go
High as this lonely road
When you go low, I go high just to breathe

When you go low, I go high
When you go low, I go high
To get by, to get by
When you go low, I go high
When you go low, I go high
To get by (to get by), to get by (to get by)

But I won't give up (I won't give up)
I'll keep givin' love (I'll keep givin' love)
It runs through my blood (it runs through my blood)
I'll never give up, yeah (never give up, never give up, never give up)

When you go low, I go high
I go high, I go high
When you go low, I go high
To get by, to get by
Sometimes I don't wanna be nice (n-nice)
But I try (but I try)
When you go low, I go high
