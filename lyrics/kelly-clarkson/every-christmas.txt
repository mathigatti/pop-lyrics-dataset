Every Christmas
It’s always the same
I’m still here waiting
Praying for you to finally come my way


It’s been so long
Since I’ve seen your face
If Santa cared for me at all then you wouldn’t be
So, so far away

Santa isn’t listening, no
And I’m losing hope
Oh God if it isn’t too much
Please bring my baby home

Every Christmas
Counting the days
Maybe this year will be different
And I won’t be, be alone again

Under the mistletoe
Let it snow
Come on home
Every Christmas I’ll wait

Oh every Christmas
I turn on all the lights
And I make a fire so maybe the smoke can clear
That you’re home tonight

But I just don’t know (I don’t know)
We’ll know deep inside (deep inside)
I know that you should be here, how I feel
We’re slowly running out of time

Every Christmas
Counting the days
Maybe this year will be different
And I won’t be, be alone again

Under the mistletoe
Let it snow
Come on home
Every Christmas I’ll wait

Every Christmas, Every Christmas
Every Christmas, Every Christmas
Every Christmas… I’ll wait
