Seems like just yesterday, you were a part of me
I used to stand so tall, I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight, everything it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong


Now I can´t breathe, no I can´t sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can´t deny it, can´t pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won´t get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything, opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright, for once in my life
Now all that's left of me, is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can´t deny it, can´t pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you wont get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can´t deny it, can´t pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you wont get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can´t deny it, can´t pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you wont get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
