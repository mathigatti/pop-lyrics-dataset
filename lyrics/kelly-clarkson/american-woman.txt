American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama, let me be


Don't come hangin' around my door
I don't wanna see your face no more
Got more important things to do
Than spend my time growin' old with you

Now, woman, stay away
American woman, listen what I say

American woman, get away from me
American woman, mama, let me be

Don't come knockin' 'round my door
I don't wanna see your shadow no more
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

Now, woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say, hey

American woman, said get away
American woman, listen what I say

Don't come hangin 'round my door
I don't wanna see your face no more
I don't need your war machines
I don't need your ghetto scenes
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

Now, woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say
American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama, mama, let me be

I gotta go, I gotta get away (American woman)
I gotta go, I wanna fly away (American woman)

You're no good for me, and I'm no good for you
I'll look you right straight in the eye
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, yeah
I'm gonna leave you, woman
You know I gotta go
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I gotta go
American Woman
