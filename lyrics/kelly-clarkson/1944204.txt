Any chance you get to play the warn out pity card
Any opportunity to push my buttons hard
It's getting old, your 'poor me' thoughts
Believe me boy when I say 'so what'


This broken record thing has got to stop
I'm losing interest in your pillow talk

And uuhuuhuuh it's not looking good
And uuhuuhuuh I'm not in the mood
And uuhuuhuuh I can't get through
To youhuuhuuh uuhuuhuuh

Don't be a girl about it
'Cause I didn't say yes
Don't be a girl about it
'Cause I wouldn't pretend
Don't be a girl about it
Now you're whining again
Don't be a girl about it
You're such a girl about it

And uuhuuhuuh I'm sleeping with the enemy ohoh
And uuhuuhuuh I'm counting sheep while you're in love

Now you're up in arms because I say we're not working out
You wonder if I loved you from the start well I tell you what
I knew a guy who changed my world
And then he grew to a little girl

This metamorphoses is just too much
You're crossing lines that I just can't let go of

And uuhuuhuuh it's not looking good
And uuhuuhuuh I'm not in the mood
And uuhuuhuuh I can't get through
To youhuuhuuh uuhuuhuuh

Don't be a girl about it
'Cause I didn't say yes
Don't be a girl about it
'Cause I wouldn't pretend
Don't be a girl about it
And now you're whining again
Don't be a girl about it
You're such a girl about it

And uuhuuhuuh I'm sleeping with the enemy ohoh
And uuhuuhuuh I'm counting sheep while you're in love

I guess it's true that love can grow in different directions
I chose the high road and you chose to be a girl
I know you're mad at me now
And it's all my fault somehow
Here comes my favorite part
You're so misunderstood

And uuhuuhuuh it's not looking good
And uuhuuhuuh I'm not in the mood
And uuhuuhuuh yeah I'm so through
To youhuuhuuh uuhuuhuuh

Don't be a girl about it
'Cause I didn't say yes
Don't be a girl about it
'Cause I wouldn't pretend
Don't be a girl about it
And now you're whining again
Don't be a girl about it
You're such a girl about it

And uuhuuhuuh I'm sleeping with the enemy ohoh
And uuhuuhuuh I'm counting sheep while you're in love

Don't be a girl about it
'Cause I didn't say yes
Don't be a girl about it
'Cause I wouldn't pretend
Don't be a girl about it
And now you're whining again
Don't be a girl about it
You're such a girl about it
