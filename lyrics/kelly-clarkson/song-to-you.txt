This is my song to you
The closest I will get
All these words for you
That I'll probably regret
But my heart won't settle
And my mind won't let me be
This is my song to you
From me


This is my prayer tonight
While you're fast asleep
Yea, I know its not right
But I see how she needs you
But my will is week
And my faith so tired
Runnin' away from you is impossible
I'm finding you're the poison I've been dyin' to try
If I could see what it'd be like

Just to taste you
Flowin' through my veins
For one night with you
I would trade everything, everything
If I could just touch you
Break this glass that's keeping us apart
Instead of just a song you'd have my heart

I'm gonna lie to you
'Cause you should never see
This hole in my heart
The way you actually pick me
But her grip is strong
And your heart was never mine
Runnin' away form you is impossible
I'm finding you're the poison I've been
Fighting just to breathe you in one time

Just to taste you
Flowin through my veins
For one night with you
I would trade everything, everything
If I could just touch you
Break this glass that's keeping us apart
Instead of just a song you'd have my heart

This is my song to you
The closest I will get
All these words for you
That I'll probably regret

Just to taste you
Flowin' through my veins
For one night with you
I would trade everything, everything
If I could just touch you
Break this glass that's keeping us apart
Instead of just a song you'd have my heart
