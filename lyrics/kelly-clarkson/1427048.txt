What happened to the man who used to take me
Straight into misery
I want you back and now I must admit it shames me
How could this be


Tell me whats this desperation
Cuz i dont recognize these chains
I think i made a bad mistake

Cause once I ran away
I've loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (heart heart heart heart)
Its more than I can take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (part, part part part)
Now everything is coming under
Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart

I must admit the grass looks so much greener
On the other side
Since you left i notice now you're so much meaner
And it's something I think i like

Tell me whats this desperation
Cuz I don't recognize these chains
I think I made a bad mistake

Cause once I ran away
I've loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (heart heart heart heart)
It's more than I can take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (part, part part part)
Now everything is coming under
Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart

I made a bad mistake
Used to pray for sins
Drowning through time
And mend my wicked ways

Cause once I ran away
I love you since the day, the day I broke your heart
It's more than I take
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart
Now everything is coming under (coming under)
cause You were the chance I can't afford to waste
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart
The day we fell apart
