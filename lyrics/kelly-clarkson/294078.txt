Dark hair, such a sexy smile..
sweet lips ooh how I wish they were mine...
Falling and i cant catch my breath,,,
Dont leave me hanging here by myself..


Ohhhhhhhh noooo.. Ohhhhhh.. yeeaaaah.. whoooooaa...

Tension.. oooh it's rising...
I see you looking at me and I think I like it..
I feel bad, cause I know I shouldnt..
But I dont care.. Take me, Take Me,take me there...

I see you and I , I lose control.. yeahhh..
Boy, I crave for you like a beggar needs a home.. yeaah. yeaah..

Well, come here, dont waste my time, darlin..
I ain't into games, unless we're both playing.. well come here..
Dont make me chase you darlin... well come here, come here..

Come, come, come, come, come here
Come, come, come, come, come over here
Come, come, come, come, come here
Boy, come here, come here

Well, come here, dont waste my time, honey..
I ain't into games, unless we're both playing.. well come here..
Dont make me chase you darlin... well come here, come here..

Come, come, come, come, come here
Come, come, come, come, come over here
Come, come, come, come, come here
Boy, come here, come here, yeeaaaahh
