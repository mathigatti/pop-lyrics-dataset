Blue, I'm getting kinda close to you
Like a shadow I can't lose
Hey, you've been hangin' with me every day
Now you're gettin' in my way
I know you understand me
But don't ya think that maybe it's time to move on


[refrão]
What's up lonely
Seems you're my only
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache
What's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today
Just when I think that you're gone
You're in the mirror lookin' back at me
So what's up lonely

Sometimes, I wish you weren't by my side
Can't you find another shoulder, cause I
I wanna leave this broken heart behind
We been wastin' too much time
Find someone else to rain on
I'm really getting' tired of singin' this sad song

[refrão]
What's up lonely
Seems you're my only
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache
What's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today
Just when I think that you're gone
You're in the mirror lookin' back at me
So what's up lonely

Don't wanna give you a reason
To hang around anymore
You won't be hurting my feelings
If you find another broken heart you can lean on

[refrão]
What's up lonely
Seems you're my only
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache
What's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today
Just when I think that you're gone
You're in the mirror lookin' back at me
So what's up lonely

What's up lonely
Seems you're my only
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache
What's it gonna take...
