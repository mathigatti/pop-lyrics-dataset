Mmm
I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally
Well as far as I can see
You will always be the one for me
Oh yes you will


I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost now I'm free
Cuz I believe in you and me

I will never leave your side
I'll never hurt your pride
All the chips are down baby
See I will always be around for you
Just to be right where you are
My love you know I love you boy

I will never leave you out
I will always let you in boy
Oh baby 
To places no one's ever been
Deep inside 
Why can't you see
That I believe in you and me

Maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
But I will play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

I believe in miracles
Lots of miracles
And yes baby you're my dream come true
I was lost now I'm free
Cuz I believe 
I do believe in you and me

See I was lost now I'm free
Cuz I believe in you and me

Ooh 
Believe in you baby and me
