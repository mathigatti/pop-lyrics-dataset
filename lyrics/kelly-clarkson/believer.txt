First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh


Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail,
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That looked at me took to me,
shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down,
you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, they came from
Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the clouds
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived,
ebbing and flowing inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and it rained down
It rained down, like

Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down,
you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, they came from
Pain!
You made me a,
you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future,
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived,
ebbing and flowing inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and it rained down
It rained down, like

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down,
you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, they came from
Pain!
You made me a,
You made me a believer, believer
