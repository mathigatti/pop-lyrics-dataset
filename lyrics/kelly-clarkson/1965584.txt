Simple math
Our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies plus time
I'm going out of my mind
It was heavy when I finally figured it out alone


Didn't get it the first time
But don't think I've been so blind
And I may not be Einstein
But I know

Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you

Even had the nerves to flirt with her in front of my face
Here's your keys, your bags, your clothes
And now get out of my place
You said I'm crazy, and that we're happy
Is that supposed to comfort me?

Didn't get it the first time
But don't think I've been so blind
And I may not be Einstein
But I know

Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you

All of your promises, flushed
A thousand apologies
Just, take out the pain and let it leaves us
With nothing at all, no, nothing at all

You can stop waisting my time
Without you I'm just fine
Why did it take me so long to figure it out

Dumb plus dumb equals you, equals you

Didn't get it the first time
But don't think I've been so blind
And I may not be Einstein
But I know

Dumb plus dumb equals you, equals you

Simple math
Our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies plus time
I'm going out of my mind
And I may not Einstein

But I know dumb plus dumb equals you, equals you
