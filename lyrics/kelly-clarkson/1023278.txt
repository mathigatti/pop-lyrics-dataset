I've been thinking
How you're wasting all that loving on someone else 
I can't take it
I will make you
Forget all about the one I'll be replacing
So just say it
I know you've been thinking 'bout it
I see you looking round
I will give you
What you're missing
What you see in me when you think no one's watching


Don't wait too long
I'm not that strong
I can't hold on much longer

Oh I see him now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh I got you now
I found your dirty little secret
You don't touch
You don't talk
You don't look me in the face
Your dirty little secret

Oh yeah,
I don't care
What they say
I'll deal with anything if it gets you next to me
I don't want just a taste
I want you anytime I feel a little craving

I'm not that strong
I can't hold on

Oh I see you now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh I got you now
I found your dirty little secret
You never touch,
You never talk
You never look me in the face
Your dirty little secret

What are you hiding in your covers?
Locked away little lover
What will you do when they discover your eyes on another?
Why you running round in circles?
Trying so hard to discourage
Now the secrets that have surfaced
One way or another

Oh I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh oh I got you know
I found your dirty little secret
You never touch
You never talk
You never look me in the face
You never touch
You never talk to me
You never look me in the face
Dirty little secret
Dirty little secret
Dirty
Dirty
