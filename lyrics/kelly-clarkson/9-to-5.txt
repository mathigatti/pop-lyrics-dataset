Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawnin', stretchin', try to come to life


Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
And folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Workin' 9 to 5
What a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy, if you let it

9 to 5
For service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me

They let you dream just to watch you shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams they'll never take away

You're on the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll you away

Workin' 9 to 5
What a way to make livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy, if you let it

9 to 5
Yeah, they got you were they want you
There's a better life
And you think about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game
No matter how they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet
9 to 5
