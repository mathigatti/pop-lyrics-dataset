Nothing's changed here
It's like you never left
I kept everything the same
Even left your socks at the end of the bed


Everyone keeps telling me
You're not coming back
But for my sanity I'm holding on
It's the only thing I have

I can't let go of your memory baby
Always in my head, oh

It's the only thing that keeps me going lately
Since you left
Oh suddenly I can't remember

What happened here
Why did you leave
Are you coming back

What happened here
Why did you leave
Are you coming back home
Are you coming back to me

Can you hear me calling
Can you still feel my touch
Wont you find your way back home
Back to me my love

Still feel your footsteps
Coming down the hall
I still feel you next to me when I know you're not there
I'm so lost

Without you I don't smile
Without you I don't laugh
I don't feel at all, no

Without you I don't care
Without you I'm scared.
When I'm trying?
I can't remember

What happened here
Why did you leave
Are you coming back

What happened here
Why did you leave
Are you coming back home
Are you coming back to me

I'm tired of crying all night long
I used to be so strong
My foolish heart was wrong

I try to hard just not to picture you
But every day I do
Lord I do
Everything reminds me of you

What happened here
What happened here

I can't let go of your memory baby
Always in my head, oh

It's the only thing that keeps me going lately
Since you left
Oh suddenly I can't remember

What happened here
Why did you leave
Are you coming back

What happened here
Why did you leave
Are you coming back yeah
Are you coming back to me

What happened here
Why did you leave
Are you coming back
