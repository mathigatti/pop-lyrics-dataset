You're all I need to get by 

You're like the sweet mornin' dew 
I took one look at you 
And it was plain to see 
You were my destiny 


With my arms open wide 
I threw away my pride 
I'll sacrifice for you 
And dedicate my life for you 

Ooh, I'll be gone, when you leave 
Always there in time of need 
And when I lose my will 
You'll be there to push me up the hill 
There's no, no looking back for us 
We've got a love and sure enough it's enough 
You're all, you're all I 
Won't stop for, do a little more 
You're all, all the joy under the sun 
You're number one 

You're all, you're all I need 
You're all I need, oh yeah, yeah 
You're all I need to get by 

Ooh, you are 
Ooh, you are 

Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Ooh, oh yeah
