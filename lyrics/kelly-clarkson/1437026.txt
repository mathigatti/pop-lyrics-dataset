Hot temper, with the shortest fuse, you're
Such a mess, with an attitude, you
Broken heart, but you're pain more, you
Never talk, if you don't have to
You, have a job, but you hate the man who
Takes it all like Uncle Sam


I want
You, you, you,
You, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I
I want you

Out of gas, so you walk for miles, to
pick me up, in your worn out shoes, you
never settle, never take too much, you
count on me, just like I count on you
Kiss me
Like when I first saw you
Figured out, couldn't be without you

You, you, you,
You, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I
I want you
I want you, you, you
You, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I
I want you

No one else will do
I want, no one makes me smile
I want, no one gets me how
I want, no one else is
You, you, you
I want you, you, you
You, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I
I want you
I want you, you, you
You, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I
I want you

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're so hot tempered
With the shortest fuse
You're such a mess
And with an attitude

You, you, you,
you, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I
I want you
I want you, you, you
You, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I
I want, I want, I want, I want

No one else will do
I want, no one makes me smile
I want, no one gets me how
I want, no one else is
You, you, you
I want you, you, you
You, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I
I want you

I want you, you, you
You, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I
I want you
I, I, I want you

You and me walking together
Screwing up, for worse, or for better

You, you, you,
You, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I
I want you
