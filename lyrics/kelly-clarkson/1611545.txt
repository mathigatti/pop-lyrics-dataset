Wonder what went wrong
Or who's to blame
Was it my fault
or your petty ways?


I'm Figuring out what's causing my pain
It's the words you twist
It's the fame you fake

Don't get close things aren't the same
You've lived here once
and once is all I can take

Forget your face, forget my name
No good for you, no good for me, yeah

Figured out
We're too far from home
I feel as though
We can only love but we cannot hold, hold
It's too easy to point
So easy to say
We can make this work
What the hell has changed?

Change ourselves
Everyone's so vein
After all is said and done we still complain
Wanting more
So insecure
Falling for
Everything we said we'd never be

I'm Figuring out
we're too far from home
I feel as though
We only love but we cannot hold, hold
Just a little bit
Oooh just a little bit
Oh just a little bit

I'm Figuring out
we're too far from home, oh yeah
I feel as though
We only love but we cannot hold, hold

I'm Figuring out
we're too far from home
Yeah, I feel as though
We only love but we cannot hold, hold

Ooh, just a little bit
