If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life,
And I had to start again
with just my children and my wife,
I'd thank my lucky stars
to be living here today,
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
and they can't take that away.


I'm proud to be an American
where at least I know I'm free,
And, I won't forget the ones who died
who gave that right to me.
And I'll gladly stand up
next to you
and defend her still today.
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land...
God Bless the U.S.A.!

From the lakes of Minnesota
to the hills of Tennessee,
Across the plains of Texas
from sea to shining sea,
from Detroit down to Houston,
and New York to L.A.,
There's pride in every American heart
and it's time we stand and say:

I'm proud to be an American
where at least I know I'm free,
And, I won't forget the ones who died
who gave that right to me.
And, I'll gladly stand up
next to you
and defend her still today.
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land...
God Bless the U.S.A!!
