I locked the door and I'm shuttin all the windows
To my heart
I can not pretend to be forgiveness and forget what I will not
Swallow all the words that cramp your style
And I can see the end coming
You're as useless as a broken record
You were always coming


All I ever hear from you is just another promise
Everytime I turn around your pretending like a promise
Six feet under there with the comfort of your promise
Choking on the view of you and all your promise
You promised to be there with never holding of the hand
When everyone else seconded guess you wouldn't ask
No secrets to consider promise me until the end
I guess a promise wasn't really what you meant

I will not reduce what we once had
And asking if you came to face
If you could keep a promise I would ask you to forget me
But then again

All I ever hear from you is just another promise
Everytime I turn around your pretending like a promise
Six feet under there with the comfort of your promise
Chocking on the view of you and all your promise
You promised to be there with never holding of the hand
When everyone else seconded guess you wouldn't ask
No secrets to consider promise me until the end
I guess a promise wasn't really what you meant
