Lights of London, lights of Spain
Lights of New York, lights of L.A
Streets of laughter, streets of pain
The morning crashes, still the night remains
The night remains


And when the music starts and the lights go down
We will all be found
No one's fighting anyone, we're all dancing on the ground

Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Feel the music like a lover's kiss
Feel the rhythm like a warm embrace
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
I'm wide awake, yeah

It's 4 AM and the room won't stop
My heart is pounding, how your body rocks
Your body rocks
My lips, they quiver on your skin
Let's take this dance and just breathe you in
Breathe you in

And when the music starts and the lights go down
We will all be found
No one's fighting anyone, we're all dancing on the ground

Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Feel the music like a lover's kiss
Feel the rhythm like a warm embrace
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
I'm wide awake, yeah

Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on and dance with me

Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Feel the music like a lover's kiss
Feel the rhythm like a warm embrace
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
I'm wide awake, yeah

Come on and dance with me
I'm wide awake, yeah
