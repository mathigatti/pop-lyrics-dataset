Running around
Trying to figure out now
Where you put your smile down
You cant let them see you like this
Thinking what mask is gonna front you
Grab the nearest one
You take your place


Amongst these faceless others
Underneath the surface
Everything's so backwards
It's all a lie

Run away
Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading

Don't move
Sit there in a trance
Do not make a sound
For what were you thinking
Fallen no one's gonna call
No hands were up at all
You're all on your own again

Walls are closing in
You can't feel anything
Becoming one of them
Come back to me

Run away
Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading
Fading

Run away
Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading away
Save yourself, let it go
It's too late
I'm losing you
You're fading
Fading, fading
