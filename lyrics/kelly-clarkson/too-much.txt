Another day when we don't communicate
Another hour of mindless numbing boring conversation
Another time we've nothing in common
I think I might be losing my mind
It must be hard being you
Yeah, you really got it rough, don't you?


Will you pull your head out of your ass
And listen to me
Would you stop running your mouth
And try something new
Is it too much to ask for?
Is it too much to ask for?

Another night when you sit and talk about yourself
Another night wishing I were lying somewhere else
I say I'm fine as you turn over to sleep
I say I'm fine cause I know you don't give a damn about me
It must be hard being you
Yeah, you really got it rough, don't you?

Will you pull your head out of your ass
And listen to me
Would you stop running your mouth
And try something new
Is it too much to ask for?
Is it too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for

Did I say something wrong?
Was the truth hard to swallow?
Am I out of line?
Why are you so surprised?
You don'’t know what to say
Let me help you, baby
You're too much, I can’t take you

Another night when you talk about yourself
Another night whishing I was with somebody else
I say I’m fine, can’t you see
I say I’m fine cause I know you don’t give a damn about me

Will you pull your head out of your ass
And listen to me
Would you stop running your mouth
And try something new
Is it too much to ask for?
Is it too much to ask for?

Yeah, too much to ask for
Too much
