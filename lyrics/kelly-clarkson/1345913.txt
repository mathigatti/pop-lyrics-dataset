Prejudice, wrote a song about it.
Like to hear it? Here it go.


I wear tight clothing, high heeled shoes
It doesn't mean that I'm a prostitute, no, no, no
I like rap music, wear hip hop clothes
That doesn't mean that I'm sellin' dope no, no, no
Oh my forgive me for having straight hair, no
It doesn't mean there's another blood in my heir, ya, ya
I might date another race or color
It doesn't mean I don't like my strong black brothers.

oh la la, oh la la, oh la la, oh la la
Why oh why must it be this way?
oh la la, oh la la, oh la la, oh la la
Before you can read me you got to learn how to see me, I said

Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow.
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow

So I'm a sistah
Buy things with cash
That really doesn't mean that all my credit's bad, oooh
So why dispute me and waste my time
Because you really feel the price is high, for me
I can't look without being watched, and oh
You rang my buy before I made up my mind, OW!
Oh now attitude, why even bother
I can't change your mind, you can't change my color

oh la la, oh la la, oh la la, oh la la
Why oh why must it be this way?
oh la la, oh la la, oh la la, oh la la
Before you can read me you got to learn how to see me, I said

Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallowâ€¦
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind don't be so shallow....Free Your mind!

oh la la, oh la la, oh la la, oh la la
Why oh why must it be this way?
Before you can read me you gotta learn how to see me, I said

Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow....Free your mind!
