And you got me, like oh
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
And I tried to buy your pretty heart
But the price too high
Baby you got me like oh
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
So you can put me together
And throw me against the wall


Baby you got me like ah, woo, ah
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me (loving me)

Oh, and baby I'm fist fighting
With fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe?
And I run for miles
Just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue
But it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain

Then you keep loving me
Just love me, yeah
Just love me
All you need to do is love me yeah
Got me like ah-ah-ah-ow
I'm tired of being played like a violin
What do I gotta do to get in
Your motherfuckin' heart?
Baby like ah, woo, ah

Baby you got me like ah, woo, ah
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me (loving me)

Oh, and baby I'm fist fighting
With fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe?
And I run for miles
Just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue
But it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I'm not good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain
