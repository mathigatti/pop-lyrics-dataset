Standing there with only hope
Fighting off your Sunday ghost
No one told you not to come
So you showed up just in time to silence everyone
Called it off, let them see
What's a heart if it never bleeds?
Floating by the eyes that keep you in between the lines
They'll never understand


So it doesn't really matter anymore
It doesn't really matter anymore
People change a little
But they're always keeping score
Don't you know
So let it go

Lay you down
Get it all out
Run beyond the walls of this worn out town
Hypocrites confusing me
Chains of those who choose them
Oh

It doesn't really matter anymore
It doesn't really matter anymore
People change a little
But they're always keeping score
Don't you know
Don't you know

You with the bluish eyes
You a different kind
You with your callous stares
Youâ€™ll be broken

Cause it doesn't really matter anymore
It doesn't really matter anymore
People change a little
But they're always keeping score
Don't you know
So let it go
Let it go

Running out as fast as you can
