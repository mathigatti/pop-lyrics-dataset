Don't look at me

Everyday is so wonderful, and suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then, I get insecure from all the pain
I'm so ashamed


I am beautiful, no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends, you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom, ooh
Trying hard to fill the emptiness, the peace is gone
Left the puzzle undone, is that the way it is?

You are beautiful, no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do (no matter what we do)
No matter what we say (no matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune (yeah, oh yeah)
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine (sun will always shine)
But tomorrow we might awake on the other side

'Cause we are beautiful, no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, oh no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

Oooh, yeay yeay yeay
Don't you bring me down today
Don't you bring me down humm, today
