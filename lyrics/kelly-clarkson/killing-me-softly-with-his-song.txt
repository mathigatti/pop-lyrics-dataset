Struming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life
With his words
Killing me softly with his song


I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see
And listen for a while

And there he was this young
Boy
A stranger to my eyes
Struming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softy with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life
With his words
Killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letter
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Struming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softy with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life
With his words
Killing me softly with his song

He sang as if he knew me
In all my darkness fair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Struming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softy with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life
With his words
Killing me softly with his song

Struming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softy with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life
With his words
Killing me (softly)

He was strumming my pain
Yeah he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
