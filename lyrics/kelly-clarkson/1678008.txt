We're back in 1876 an ol' boy named Bell
Invented a contraption that we know so well
By the 1950's they were in everybody's home
It's a crazy little thing they call a telephone
Now there's one on every corner, in the back of every bar
You can get one in your briefcase, on a plane or in your car


So tell me why haven't I heard from you
Tell me why haven't I heard from you
I say my darlin', honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?

There's no problem gettin' to me
Baby you can dial direct
I got call forwarding, call waiting
You can even call collect
The service man he told me that my phone was workin' fine
And I've come to the conclusion the trouble isn't with my line
I'm sure the operator would be glad to put you through
So dial zero for assistance if this all confuses you

So tell me why haven't I heard from you
Tell me why haven't I heard from you
I say my darlin', honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?

There better been a flood, a landslide of mud
A fire that burns up the wires
And thunder so loud with a black funnel cloud
A natural disaster I know nothing about

Tell me why haven't I heard from you
Tell me why haven't I heard from you
I say my darlin', honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?

Tell me why haven't I heard from you
Tell me why haven't I heard from you
I say my darlin', honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?
