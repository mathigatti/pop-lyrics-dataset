Why can't you read my lips
Why cant you understand
You've changed so much my love
And things are getting out of hand, understand


I crave someone who sees me
Someone who gets just who i am
I can't believe I've wasted so much time on you, on nothing
We used to be so lovely
We used to read each others minds
But something changed in you
Had it, through with all your petty lies
All I wanted was the old you
But what I got instead was

You looking down on me
Satisfied with nothing
No matter how hard I try
To please you, nothings changed
No comments from your mouth
Just ways to push me down
I would have given anything for just a simple smile

I cant go on like this
Constantly tip-toeing around
To make sure you're alright
When you the one who's holding you down, down down down
You say I'm selfish, you say i don't care at all
But honey but if I didn't care why would I write this song
You think I'm wrong when I say
You only think about yourself
But then you prove me right
And you just walk away
All I wanted was the only you
But what I got instead was

You looking down on me
Satisfied with nothing
No matter how hard I try
To please you, nothings changed
No comments from your mouth

Just ways to push me down
I would have given anything for just a simple smile

What happened to the one
I used to love so much
It's hard to remember
A time you were you once had my love
No I wont waste my time
You and your selfish pride
If you won't help yourself, neither will I

I gotta get away-ay
I need to get away-ay
Get away-ay
I gotta get away-ay
I need to get away

I tried so hard to fight for us
But you just simply gave me nothing
Holding you up became too hard
You need to stand up on your own
Love is not what you've been giving me
All I get is your back
I won't go on like this
I don't love you, can you hear that?

You looking down on me
Satisfied with nothing
No matter how hard I try
To please you, nothings changed
No comments from your mouth
Just ways to push me down
I would have given anything for just a simple smile

What happened to the one
I used to love so much
It's hard to remember
A time you were you once had my love
No I wont waste my time
You and your selfish pride
If you won't help yourself, neither will I
