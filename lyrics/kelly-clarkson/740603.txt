ooh 
[Kelly] 
Watchin every motion in 
the foolish lovers game. On 
This endliss ocean Finally lovers 
no shame. Turning and returning to 
some secert place inside watchin in slow 
motion as you turn around and say my love 


[Chours: Both] 
Take my breath away 
Take my breath away 

[Kalan] 
Watching I keep waiting 
still anticipating love never 
hisating to become the faded 
ones. Turning and returning to 
some secert place inside watching 
in slow motion as you turn around 
and say 

[Chours: Both] 
Take my breath away 
Take my breath away 

[Both] 
Through the hour glass 
I saw you in time you slipped away 
when the mirrior crashed I called to you 
and say 

[Kelly] 
If only for today I'am unfraid 

Repeat Chours 

[Kelly] 
Ohh you take my breath away kalan. 
ohhh 

[Both] 
TAKE MY BREATH AWAY 

[Chours: Both] 
Take my breath away 
Take my breath away 
[Repeat till fade]
