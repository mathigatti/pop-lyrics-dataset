This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long


You, where the hell did you come from
You're a different, different kind of fun
I'm so used to feeling numb
Now I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a lifetime

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up, all night long
Oh, up up all night long

I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I'd have known where I'd be now
Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh, I could do this for a lifetime

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up, all night long
Oh, up up all night long

Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I ever breathed without you
Baby you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time
One more time

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up, all night long
Oh, up up all night long

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up, all night long
Oh, up up all night long
