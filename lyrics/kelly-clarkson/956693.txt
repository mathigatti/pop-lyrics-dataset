How can I explain this?
(take it from the top)
When we started movin
(Oh yeah!)


Didn't wanna stop
(then why did you?)
It was just amazing

We were all alone
(and then?)
I'm tellin you it's crazy guys but,

These feelings were unknown

Cause every now and then, something goes your way
and when you look at me, i can hear you say
are you ready for love?
You can reach for the Brighter Star
shining love on down
it'll never be too far
you can reach for the Brighter Star
spreading love around
it'll never be far

You know I had lost hope

Never thought i'd find
Someone who could hear my love song (oh yeah)

Who could fill my mind

But if you just let go, feelings start to grow
Are you ready for love?
You can reach for the Brighter Star
shinging love on down
it'll never be too far
you can reach for the Brighter Star
spreading love around
it'll never be far

You can reach for
You can reach for
it'll never be too far
You can reach for the Brighter Star
shinging love on down
it'll never be too far
you can reach for the Brighter Star
spreading love around
it'll never be far
