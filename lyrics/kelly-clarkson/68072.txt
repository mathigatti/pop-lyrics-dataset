Miss independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance, hmn
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said ooh, she fell in love


What is the feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open my door
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No more the need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

Misguided heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you want to use that line you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't want to end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside she felt a connection
She fell in love

What is the feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open my door (open my door)
Surprise, it's time (yeah)
To feel what's real (to feel what's real, what's real)
What happened to Miss Independent?
No more the need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true (when love is true)

When Miss Independence walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of why can't that be me
I'm so glad I finally feel

What is the feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open my door
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No more the need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true
