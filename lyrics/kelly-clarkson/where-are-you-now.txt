You said you'd be here
Well, I've been waiting way too long now
And still there's no sign of you in the distance
If you're even coming
I'm through praying
I keep getting God’s busy line


You said you'd be here
But don't worry, baby
You're not the first to disappear

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Just when I crumble
Now that I've fallen down
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Now that I need you the most
Just when I thought I was home

Well I've gotten used to it
I don’t even miss you
Can't remember why I've been crying
I don't feel it anymore
I'm so used to seeing that damn door close

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Just when I crumble
Now that I've fallen down
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Now that I need you the most

All your letters and
All your kisses and
All your words
They don't mean anything
All my thoughts and
All the time we spent
All those memories
I'm erasing
With all my heart and soul
I'm all out of hope
I guess I'm through with love and lying to myself

'Cause you said you'd be here
I'm looking around
And you're nowhere near, baby

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Just when I crumble
Now that I've fallen down
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Now that I need you the most

You're holding somebody else close

Just when I thought I was home
