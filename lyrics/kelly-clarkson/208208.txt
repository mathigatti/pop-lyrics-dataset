No, I can't forget this evening 
Or your face as you were leaving 
But I guess that's just the way the story goes 
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows 
Yes it shows 


I can't live 
If living is without you 
I can't live 
I can't give anymore 

I can't live 
If living is without you 
Can't live 
Can't give anymore 

Well I can't forget this evening 
Or your face as you were leaving 
But I guess that's just the way the story goes 
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows 
Yeah, yes it shows 

Can't live 
If living is without you 
Can't live 
I can't give anymore 
Can't live (no, can't live) 
If living is without you (No, I can't live) 
Oh, I can't live 
Can't give anymore, oh

(No, can't live) 
(No, I can't live) 
No, oh yeah, no, no, no, no, no
I can't live
