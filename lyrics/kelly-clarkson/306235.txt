"Ain't No Mountain High Enough"
(feat. Will Young)


Will:
Listen Baby,
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low,
Ain't no river wide enough baby,

Kelly:
If you need me call me,
No matter where you are, no matter how far

Will:
Don't worry baby.

Kelly:
I'll be there on a hurry
You don't have to worry

Both:
'Cause baby there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Will:
Remember the day
when I set you free
I told you could always, always count on me.

Kelly:
From that day on
I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
someday, somehow

Both:
'Cause baby there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Will:
oooo darling

Kelly:
No Wind, no rain
no winters cold
can stop me now

Will:
Don't stop me baby

Kelly:
Cause you are my goal
oooo baby

Will (While Kelly is singing):
when you are in trouble
I'll be there on the double
just send for me

(lots of chorus and random words)

Both:
'Cause baby there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Ain't no mountain high enough!
