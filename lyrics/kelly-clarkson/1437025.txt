Just woke up and thought I'd try
Try to step across the line
You know that I've been thinking 'bout it for a while
Yeah
Starting to think it's time I leave
Does me good to know I finally feel
Feel this pain, it's real, it's possible


(You say)
Can't change the winds you say
Won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far
Cause it's impossible
Can't rise above this place
Won't change enough, so I pray
Breaking down the walls to the impossible

Walking by myself I know
This lonely road's becoming my new home
But I don't stop
I just keep moving on, and on
Ain't no need to dry my eyes
I haven't cried in quite some time
Everyday I fight it,
You know it's possible

(You say)
Can't change the winds you say
Won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far
Cause it's impossible
Can't rise above this place
Won't change enough, so I pray
Breaking down the walls to the impossible

Someone tell me
Why it's so hard taking chances
You draw the line and think
That I won't ask for more
Yeah
I will stumble and I make my own mistakes
Yeah
But I won't worry about it anymore
It's impossible

Can't change the winds you say
Won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far
Cause it's impossible
Can't rise above this place
Won't change enough, so I pray
Breaking down the walls to the impossible

It's impossible to you
Not impossible to me
Not impossible for me
Can't rise above this place
Won't change enough so I pray
Breaking down the wall to the impossible

Just woke up and thought I'd try
Try to step across the line
