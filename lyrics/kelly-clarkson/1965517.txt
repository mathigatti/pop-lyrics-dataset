Ooooh
Ooooh
Stop, don't. I don't wanna hear anymore
I can't focus with all this loud noise
You say one thing but to the other
Your words are twisted right as they slip from your mouth
Why are so confusing?
How do you sleep knowing your love is
Drowning me
The waters too high I can't see
You're drowning me
Your waves are just too much to take
I can't breathe
I've gotta find my way out baby
Your love is killing me
Ooooooh
You try to hide it but I see
You're not who you used to be
Your eyes have slowly become a blank stare
You don't know what's wrong
All you know is that you simply don't care
Why do you always pull away from me?
How can I stay when your love is
Drowning me
The waters too high I can't see
You're drowning me


Your waves are just too much to take
I can't breathe
I gotta find my way out baby
Your love is killing me
Your love is calling me, pushing me down
Your love is changing me and it's changed you somehow
Your love is making me wanna run from you
Our love is sinking and I'm done trying to save you
Drowning me
The waters too high I can't see
You're drowning me
Your waves are just too much to take
I can't breathe
I've gotta find my way out baby
Your love is killing me
Drowning me
The waters too high I can't see
You're drowning me
Your waves are just too much to take
I can't breathe
I've gotta find my way out
Your love is killing me
Oooh, Pulling me down
No more of you pushing me down
No, I've gotta find my way out
Your love is drowning me
Drowning me
Drowning me
