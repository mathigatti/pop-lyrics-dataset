"Game over, there are no rules in this game except
win at any cost"


Your time has come once and for all
You've met your match
you will fall

Still every game we play is gonna bring us down
only one of us can wear the crown

the titles as easy as you thought it be
when its down to you verses me

I play ruff
I dont need to try 
you like to play me, but the score never lies 

Chorus:
Wo.... Game over
Wo.... game over
Wo.... game over for now

When in a game the only rule allowed
no mother love of cheers from the crowd

When the game begins you never thought you'd lose
but your time is up, ill play the rules

Look around and find you've lost your team
You tried your best but you've run out of steam 

I play ruff
I dont need to try 
you like to play me, but the score never lies 

Your all out of wishes cause your dreams 
collide it ends the same 

It's not wether you lose it's 
how you play the game

Chorus:
Wo.... Game over
Wo.... game over
Wo.... game over for now

Wo.....................
Wo.....................
Wo.....................
Wo.....................

(Guitar break)

Is that all you got?
Come on
Uh uh
bring it on

Chorus:
Wo.... Game over
Wo.... game over
Wo.... game over for now

Game over
