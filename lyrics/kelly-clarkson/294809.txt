I wish you could feel
The way i feel
This special feeling
That makes your spine curl
And it makes your heart throb
And i dont know what to do
But if i dont have you


Chorus
I dont know what to do
My heart will jump
I will feel so empty
So incomplete
I would feel what
Special love feels like(what special love feels like)

Before i met you
I felt like a stone
On the side of a road
All cold and lonely
But then you came along and cured me
You made me feel warm

Chorus
I dont know what to do
My heart will jump
I will feel so empty
So incomplete
I would feel what
Special love feels like(what special love feels like)

My love will help you
My love will heal you
But if you dont give love back
Then i i i will be alone!!!!!!!!!!
I need your love now
I need your heart now
I need your peace now
And i need you

Chorus
I dont know what to do
My heart will jump
I will feel so empty
So incomplete
I would feel what
Special love feels like(what special love feels like)

I love you and you will always be mine!!!!!!!!
