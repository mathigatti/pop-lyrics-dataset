(Empty handed, handed)
(Empty handed, handed)
(Empty handed, handed)
(Empty handed, handed)


When did you know that nothing was right
Were you just happy to hide
Behind dreams and broken lies
There's a crack in your perfect smile
That's been growing a while
Did you think you'd go out in style

With all that you know
How long did you know

You took me for granted
I don't understand it
While looking for answers
I came up empty handed
But don't worry about me
Cause I'm stronger then you think
And I know it's a blessing
I came up empty handed

(Empty handed, handed)
(Empty handed, handed)
(Empty handed, handed)
(Empty handed, handed)

Can you be whoever you like
You just turn off the lights
And find yourself a different disguise
So you hide the scars you built over time
Do you think I'm blind
You're still lovely on the inside

With all that you know
How long did you know

You took me for granted
I don't understand it
While looking for answers
I came up empty handed
But don't worry about me
Cause I'm stronger than you think
And I know it's a blessing
I came up empty handed
Empty handed

When did you know that nothing was right
Were you just happy to hide
Behind dreams and broken lies

With all that you know
Why didn't you just go

You took me for granted
I don't understand it
While looking for answers
I came up empty handed
But don't worry about me
Cause I'm stronger then you think
And I know it's a blessing
I came up empty handed
Empty handed
Empty handed
Empty handed
