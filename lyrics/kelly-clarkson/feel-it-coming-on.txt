It's a scratch on the skin
It's a tear in the screen
The first burn of the drip, of the sip as the drink's goin' down
A crack in the wall
Just a spot on the sun
The first pull of the seam of a dream as it's coming undone


You're not gone
But I feel it coming on

It's the peel of the paint
It's the tug of the sleeve
It's the kiss that you miss by the train as it's leaving town

You're not gone
But I feel it coming on

I don't know when
Or why
Or how you'll say goodbye
But it won't be long
I can feel it coming on

So pretend you're asleep
Keep me at bay
'Cause you don't wanna touch, wanna talk
You just say nothing's wrong
Oh
But I feel it coming on

I don't know when
Or why
Or how you'll say goodbye
But it won't be long

'Til the storm blows in
And the whole dam breaks
'Til you're standing there
Saying what you said you'd never say

It's the stop of a heart
It's the drop of a tear
It's the words on the tip of your tongue that I don't wanna hear
You're not gone
But I feel it coming on
It won't be long, no
But I feel it coming on
