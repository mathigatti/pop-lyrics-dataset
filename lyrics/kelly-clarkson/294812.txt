Ooohooh
If you see me walking down the street and i start to cry
Each time we meet
Walk on by...boy walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears just let me grieve
In private cuz each time i see you
I break down and cry
Boy walk on by
I just can't get over losing you and so if i seem broken and blue
Walk on by
Boy walk on by
Foolish pride is all that i can feel so let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me when you said goodbye
Boy walk on by
Oooh ooh yea make believe that you don't see the tears honey
Let me grieve in private cuz each time i see you i just break down
And cry ooh oh
Just walk on by
Walk on walk on
Ooooh ooh boy walk on by
