Gotta find your inner strength
If you can't then just throw life away
Gotta learn to rely on you
Beauty,strength,and Wisdom,too


You're beautiful inside and out
Lead agreat life without a doubt
Don't need a man to make things fair
'Cuz more than likely he won't be there
Listen girl,gotta know it's true
In the end all you've got is you
