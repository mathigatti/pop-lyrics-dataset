The door's unlocked
And you don't even have to knock
Or you can use the fireplace
I'll be waiting either way


You come and go
And no one is supposed to know
But ever since you caught my stare
You know I know that you are real

Well, Santa, I've been thinking
And I just need one thing
You to bring me
Something shiny

Oh, my diamond ring
Just a little something from Tiffany
Or a big ruby
You know how that's always looked good on me

I won't tell anyone
I've been good all year long
Oh, Santa, make my Christmas theme
4 carats, please

Oh oh
Oh

It's getting late
I know you have your rounds to make
But I've been waiting up for you
And now the clock has just struck 2

I'm looking out my windows
Looking for a red nose
My heart's sinking
Don't forget me

Oh, my diamond ring
Just a little something from Tiffany
Or a big ruby
You know how that's always looked good on me

I won't tell anyone
I've been good all year long
Oh, Santa, make my Christmas theme
4 carats, please

Oh oh
Oh oh

Hmm, something sparkly
Yellow canaries
Oh, yea, yea
Hmm, I'm waiting patiently
Santa, don't forget me
Don't forget me!

Oh, my diamond ring
Just a little something from Tiffany
Or a big ruby
You know how that's always looked good on me

I won't tell anyone
I've been good all year long
Oh, Santa, make my Christmas theme
4 carats, please

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
