Everybody's happy
Snow is falling down
Prayers are being aswered
Miracles all around


From afar I've loved you
But never let it shows
And every year another
December comes and goes

Always watching
Never reaching

But this Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall

So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white you'll see me like
You never seen me yet
Wrapped in red
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Blue is where I've been
Green can't buy me you
Silver bells remind me
That mistletoe's for two

So I found a color
That only tells the truth
That paints a picture
Of how I feel for you, oh, oh

This Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall

So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white you'll see me like
You never seen me yet
Wrapped in red
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'll never feel you
If I don't tell you

This Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall

So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white you'll see me like
You never seen me yet
Wrapped in red
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Wrapped in red
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
