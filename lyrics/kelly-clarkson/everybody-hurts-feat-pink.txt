When your day is long and the night
The night is yours alone
If you're sure you've had enough of this life
Well hang on
Don't let yourself go, 'cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts, sometimes


Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (hold on)
When you think you've had too much of this life
Well hang on

'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hands, oh no
Don't throw your hands
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much
Of this life, to hang on

Well everybody hurts
Sometimes, everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes
But everybody hurts sometimes
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Everybody hurts
You're not alone
