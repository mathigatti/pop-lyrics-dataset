Come on reindeers, you know your the mastermind
You better run run Rudolph, Santa's gettin' far behind!
Run run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town!
If Santa makes 'em high tail it, we can take the freeway down
You gotta run run Rudolph, racin' like a merry-go-round


Said Santa to the child, "Hey boy, what have you been longing for?"
He said "All I want for Christmas is a rock n' roll electric guitar"
And then away went Rudolph racin' like a shooting star

You gotta run run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town!
If Santa makes 'em high tail it, we can take the freeway down
Well run run Rudolph, racin' like a merry-go-round

Come on David, take it!!!

Well said Santa to the little girl "What is it that you wanna get?"
"A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"
Well away went Rudolph, racin' like a searing jet

You gotta run run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town!
If Santa makes 'em high tail it, we can take the freeway down
Well run run Rudolph, racin' like a merry-go round

Run run Rudolph
Racin' like a merry-go round

Run run Rudolph
