Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong, and sometimes it's right
For every win, someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale (yeah, yeah, say)


Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop

Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
When you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop

Ohh, hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
If you're searching for a place you know
A familiar face, somewhere to go
You should look inside yoursoul
You're halfway there

Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
But when you've got friend, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
