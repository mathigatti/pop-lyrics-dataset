Don't you pretend that you don't need a little more from me
You're actin' like it's nothin'
We both know it's somethin'
Even in the dark anyone can see


So don't you pretend that you're not wishin' I was next to you
Hot and cold as ever, want me but you never
Let your guard down and I need some proof

You make me want you but you don't know where this ends, baby
I wanna love you but I can't take the suspense

I said don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)
Don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)
Don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)
Don't you pretend, oh yea

Try to deny and be cool as you walk away from me
Steady as you go but tremblin' in your voice shows
There's a part of you slowly dyin'
I'm not gonna wait and just play victim to your vanities
I don't have the time babe, tell me that you're mine babe
Why you keepin' your feelings from me?

You make me want you but you don't know where this ends, baby
I wanna love you but I can't take the suspense

I said don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)
Don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)
Don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)
Don't you pretend, oh yea

Don't you run and hide
Let's find out tonight
I got a feelin' that you wanna fall
Tell me yes or no
I can't take no more
I want the real thing or nothin' at all

I just wanna see
Who you tryin' to be, yeah

I said don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)
Don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)
Don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)

Oh yeah, no, no, no
Don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)
Don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)
Don't you pretend (I just wanna see)
(Who's in front of me)
(Who you tryin' to be)
Don't you pretend, oh
