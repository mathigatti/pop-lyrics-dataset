I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming
But there's a voice inside my head saying
You'll never reach it


Every step I'm taking
Every move I make
Feels lost with no direction
My faith is shaken
But I, gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna want to make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm going to have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down
But no, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moment that I'm gonna remember most and
Just gotta keep going
And I, I got to be strong
Just keep pushing on, cause

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna want to make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes you're going to have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna want to make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm going to have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

Keep on moving
Keep climbing
Keep the faith
Baby
It's all about
It's all about the climb
Keep the faith
Keep your faith
