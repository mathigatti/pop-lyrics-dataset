I'm stumblin' through the darkness
There ain't no sign of a spark here
I'm used to feelin' that fire
You watered down that desire
I put my work in, day in, day out
Baby, I deserve it, don't let me down
You used to make me feel like a diamond
Now it don't even seem like you're tryin'


So give me one good reason I should need you

Oh, come turn this around
Oh, no, no don't let us down
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe
Oh, wanna feel alive
Oh, like my heart's in the wild
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe

I'm slippin' out of your fingers
Keep coolin' down like November
I'm used to feelin' that fever
I wanna dive in you deeper
I put that work in, day in, day out (day in, day out)
Baby, I deserve it, don't let me down, no (don't let me down)
Give me one good reason I should need you, yeah

Oh, come turn this around
Oh, no, no don't let us down
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe
Oh, wanna feel alive
Oh, like my heart's in the wild
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe

Better than that
Better than that
You know I love you
Better than that
Better than that
So come on love me
Better than that
Better than that
Oh, we can do much
Better than that
Better than that

Oh, come turn this around
Oh, no, no don't let us down
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe
Oh, wanna feel alive
Oh, like my heart's in the wild
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe

Better than that
Better than that
You know I love you
Better than that
Better than that
You know I love you, you know I need you
You know I love you, you know I need you, oh yeah

Better than that
Better than that
You know I love you
Better than that
Better than that
So come on love me
Better than that
Better than that
Oh, we can do much (you know I love you)
Better than that
Better than that
