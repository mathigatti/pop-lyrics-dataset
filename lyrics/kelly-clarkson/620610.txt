I'm strong but I break
I'm stubborn and I make plenty of mistakes
Yeah, I'm hard
And life with me is never easy
To figure out, to love
I'm jaded but I'm so lovely
All you have to do is hold me
And you know, and you see just
How sweet it can be
If you trust me
Love me, let me, maybe
Maybe
Someday when we're at the same place
Or we're on the same road when it's okay to hold my hand
Without feeling lost without all these excuses


When it's just because you love me
You let me you need me maybe maybe
Baby all you have to do is hold me
And to know and to see just how sweet it can be
If you trust me love me let me baby maybe

I'm confusing as hell yeah I'm north and south
And I'll probably never have it all figured out
But what I know is I wasn't meant
To walk this world without you
And I promise I'll try I'm gonna try
To give you every little part of me
Every single detail you miss with your eyes
Maybe maybe oh maybe maybe maybe

One day we'll be together
You'll need me you'll see me completely
Every little bit of me oh and maybe you'll love me love me

I don't want to be tough and I don't wanna be proud
I don't need to be fixed and I certainly don't need to be found
I'm not lost I need to be loved I just need to be loved
I just want to be loved by you and I won't stop
Cause I believe that maybe yeah maybe
Maybe yeah maybe maybe yeah baby

I should know better than to touch the fire twice
But I'm thinking maybe, yeah maybe you might

Maybe, love maybe
