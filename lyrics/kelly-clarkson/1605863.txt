I should have kissed you
One last time
I would have held you
So much longer
If id known itd be the last time
If I could forget you
It would make all these memories fade to grey
Id rather not remember what I foolishly traded


I think I might be missing you
Like you said I would
I think I might have run away
Im a fool yeah im a fool
Think I meant I love you
I said that I don't care
Wish I could be lonely instead

I should have loved you
More than I did
Living without you
With your ghost and voice haunting my head
I couldn't see you
And now I see you everyday
but not with me
She seems so nice
She makes you smile
Like you use to smile at me

I think I might be missing you
Like you said I would
I think I might have run away
Im a fool yeah im a fool
Think I meant I love you
I said that I don't care
Wish I was just lonely instead

You were right
Im lying here
Wishing you were with me
Hoping that you might be
Missing me
Cause I cant seem to fight it honey
Wish I could erase every part of you ad me

I think I might be missing you
Like you said I would
I think I might have run away
Im a fool yeah im a fool
Think I meant I love you
I said that I don't care
Wish I could be lonely instead
I wish I was just lonely instead
