Where you going? Where you been?
Where you been leaving your fingerprints?
Just cause I don't see it, don't mean it ain't there
You come creeping in late at night
Covering the evidence like a crime
But I'm a black light, shining everywhere


Wipe down your lips, dust off your story
Make up the bed that came before me
You can wash your dirty hands
Why even bother?
No, you can't compete with soap and water

Soap and water
I'm hanging you on the line
Soap and water
I'm hanging you out to dry
Soap and water
Didn't think that you'd get caught, but it all comes out in the wash

You can turn crimson into wine
Bleach your lies and make them bright
Convince me I don't know what I'm talking about
But lock the drain that's in the sink
You're going down and I don't think you understand
The stain ain't coming out

Wipe down your lips, dust off your story
Make up the bed that came before me
You can wash your dirty hands
Why even bother?
No, you can't compete with soap and water

I'm hanging you on the line
Im hanging you out to dry
Didn't think that you'd get caught, but it all comes out in the wash

Wipe down your lips, dust off your story
Make up the bed that came before me
You can wash your dirty, dirty hands
Why even bother?
No, you can't compete with soap and water

Soap and water
I'm hanging you on the line
Soap and water
I'm hanging you out to dry
Soap and water
Didn't think that you'd get caught, but it all comes out in the wash

I'm hanging you on the line
I'm hanging you out to dry
Didn't think that you'd get caught but it all comes out in the wash

Soap and water (soap and water)
Soap and water (soap and water)
Soap and water (soap and water)
Soap and water (soap and water)
No you can't, no you can't come clean
