I gotta girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush
Ain't slowin' down


I got it real bad
Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's giving you now

I wanna taste her lips
Yeah, cuz they taste like you
I wanna drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume

I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, cuz maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I gotta girl crush
I gotta girl crush

I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peace
Thinking about her
Under your bed sheets

The way that she's whispering
The way that she's pulling you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't get her off my mind

I wanna taste her lips
Yeah, cuz they taste like you
I wanna drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume

I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, cuz maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I gotta girl crush
I gotta girl crush

Hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush
Ain't slowin' down
