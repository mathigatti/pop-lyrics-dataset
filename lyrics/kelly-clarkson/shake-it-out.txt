Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play


And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around

All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
So I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah

It's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh woah

And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah

It's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh woah

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
And given half the chance
Would I take any of it back?
It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
It's always darkest before the dawn

Oh woah, oh woah

And I'm damned if I do
And I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark
At the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer
And I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me
But what the hell
I'm gonna let it happen to me

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah

It's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh woah

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah

It's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh woah
