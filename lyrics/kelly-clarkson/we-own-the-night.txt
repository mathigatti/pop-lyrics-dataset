Yeah, uh uh

Is it alright if it's just us for the night?
Hope you don't mind if I stay by your side
We can drive in your car, somewhere into the dark
Pull over and watch the stars
Oh-oh, we can dance, we can drink
Do whatever we think as long as I'm in your arms


When we are together it's the time of our lives
We can do whatever, be whoever we like
Spend a weekend dancing 'cause we'll sleep when we die
Don't have to worry 'bout nothing
We own the night,
We own the night

It's all a blur, it's getting late
But I don't care, I don't care
I don't know where we'll end up
And that's okay!
We can drive in your car, somewhere into the dark
Pull over and watch the stars
Oh-oh, we can dance, we can drink
Do whatever we think as long as I'm in your arms

When we are together it's the time of our lives
We can do whatever, be whoever we like
Spend a weekend dancing 'cause we'll sleep when we die
Don't have to worry 'bout nothing
We own the night
Ooh, we own the night

Nothing lasts forever
Let's live it up
When we're together
Nothing lasts forever
So, let's live it up
Just do whatever

When we are together it's the time of our lives
We can do whatever, be whoever we like
Spend a weekend dancing 'cause we'll sleep when we die
Don't have to worry 'bout nothing
We own the night

When we are together it's the time of our lives
We can do whatever, be whoever we like
Spend a weekend dancing 'cause we'll sleep when we die
Don't have to worry 'bout nothing
We own the night
(Just do what you like)
Ooh, we own the night
(Do whatever you like)
We own the night
(Just do what you like)
'Cause we own the night
(Do whatever you like)
Uuh uh uuuh
