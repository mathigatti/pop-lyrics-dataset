Yes I stumbled into the night
We're touching but I feel like you're still out of reach
The people here are buzzing like a bug on a light,
I'm feeling like I always see them, but they can't see me


Sentimental feelings..
Never get me anywhere
My heart concern is bleeding
Is there anybody, anybody?

Hello, hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go! 'Cause everyone let's go of me,
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone

Yeah I'm coming through this desert of stone
These faces on the statues that I used to know
Wishing I was more than what my story has told
Or hoping that I'm dreaming in day and this isn't happening

Gotta keep it altogether
Long and for her to hold
Keep clear on the shadows
Is there anybody, anybody?

Hello, hello
Is anybody listening?
Let go! 'Cause everyone let's go of me,
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone

Holding on to the memories of when I, I didn't know
Ignorance isn't wise but it beats being alone

Hello,
Is anybody listening?
Let go! 'Cause everyone let's go of me,
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone

Hello,
Is anybody listening?
Let go! 'Cause everyone let's go of me,
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone
