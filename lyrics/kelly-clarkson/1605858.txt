I wish I never started so I didnt have to quit
I wish I didn't let you make me feel like this
It's how it's gotta be, is what you're telling me


I'm never gonna win you over, I know better than that
... things with a smile things crops behind your back
counting of your traps.

How it falls so naturally from your lips,
how your charm kills every dream, I ever built

Well, I'm too tired to fight it out this time
I'm turning myself in, you win again, you wore me down
and I'm too tired to beat my sanity
but you calling me crazy doesnt change my mind
My heart says "no", my lips say "fine"

I wish I've seen it coming, cause I would have run like hell
it's full of lonely and it sounds much better than what you're selling.
Poison candy
I wish I wasn't always running on empty
I wish you could hear yourself
I wish you could hear me

How it falls so naturally from your lips.
How your charm kills every dream, I ever built

Well, I'm too tired to fight it out this time
I'm turning myself in, you win again, you wore me down
and I'm too tired to beat my sanity
but you calling me crazy doesnt change my mind
My heart says "no", my lips say "fine"

I wish I could be in your head just to see
how you think
how your reason the way everything is
so ... as you make it ok
How you push me away
How you push me away

Well, I'm too tired to fight it out this time
I'm turning myself in, you win again, you wore me down.
And I'm too tired to beat my sanity,
but you calling me crazy doesn't change my mind.
My heart says "no"
My heart says "no"
My lips say "fine"

I wish I never started so I didn't have to quit
