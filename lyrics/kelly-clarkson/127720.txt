Hear me, hear me 

You gotta be out there 
You gotta be somewhere 
Wherever you are
I´m waiting...


Cause there are these nights when 
I sing myself to sleep 
And I´m hoping my dreams bring you close to me 
Are you listening

Hear me, I´m crying out
I´m ready now 
Turn my world upside down, find me 
I´m lost inside the crowd, it´s getting loud 
I need you to see 
I´m screaming for you to please 
Hear me 
Can you hear me

I used to be scared of letting someone in 
But it gets so lonely, being on my own 
No one to talk to 
No one to hold me 
I´m not always strong 
Oh, I need you here 
Are you listening

Hear me, I´m crying out 
I´m ready now 
Turn my world upside down, find me 
I´m lost inside the crowd, it´s getting loud 
I need you to see 
I´m screaming for you to please 
Hear me 

I´m restless and wild 
I fall but I try 
I need someone to understand (can you hear me) 
I´m lost in my thoughts 
And baby, I faught for all that I´ve got 
Can you hear me 

Hear me, I´m crying out
I´m ready now 
Turn my world upside down, find me 
I´m lost inside the crowd, it´s getting loud 
I need you to see 
I´m screaming for you, to please 
Hear me [4x] 
Can you
Hear me [4x] 
Can you hear me (oh, no)
Hear me [3x]
