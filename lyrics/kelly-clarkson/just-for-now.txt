Just for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now


It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Dear, stop right here
I know we'll follow the bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

How did you know? It's what I always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will ya quit kicking me under the table?
I'm trying, will somebody make us shut up about it
Can we settle down please

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Dear, stop right here
I know we'll follow the bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

Bite tongue, deep breaths
Count to ten, nod your head

I think something is burning now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music had better quick, sharp, remove it
Pour me another, oh, don't wag your finger at me

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Dear, stop right here
I know we'll follow the bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Just for now
