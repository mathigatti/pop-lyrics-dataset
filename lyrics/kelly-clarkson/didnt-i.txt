Remember not long ago
You called me hysterical
I finally figured us out
My fire was hot enough
To burn on for the both of us
And your water keeps puttin' us out


And I should be steam
The way you love to rain over me
Then turn around and call me your queen
Too blind to see the way it stings, the pain it brings

Didn't I give you everything?
I gave you everything, baby (baby, baby)
Didn't I?
Didn't I give you everything?
You got the best of me, baby (baby, baby)
Didn't I
Hear you cryin' on my shoulder?
Beggin' hold me till it's over?
When you're lonely just remember
I gave you everything
D-D-Didn't I?

I'm over this tug of war
I've told you so many times before
Now I'm finally lettin' go of the rope
Yeah, well this game is too ugly boy
And these hands are tired from keepin' you up
And my heart hurts from holdin' out hope

And I can't stay clean
With all the dirt you're throwin' at me
Then turn around and call me your queen
Too blind to see the way it stings, or the pain it brings

Didn't I give you everything?
I gave you everything, baby (baby, baby)
Didn't I?
Didn't I give you everything?
You got the best of me, baby (baby, baby)
Didn't I
Hear you cryin' on my shoulder?
Beggin' hold me till it's over?
When you're lonely just remember
I gave you everything
D-D-Didn't I?

Didn’t I, didn’t I?
Didn’t I give you everything? (Baby)
Didn’t I, didn’t I, didn’t I?

Didn't I give you everything?
I gave you everything, baby (baby, baby)
Didn't I?
Didn't I give you everything?
You got the best of me, baby (baby, baby)
Didn't I
Hear you cryin' on my shoulder?
Beggin' hold me till it's over?
When you're lonely just remember
I gave you everything
D-D-Didn't I?

Didn't I, didn't I?
Didn't I give you everything, baby? (Baby)
Didn't I, didn't I?
Didn't I give you everything, baby?
Didn't I, didn't I?
Didn't I give you everything, baby?
Didn't I, didn't I?
Didn't I give you everything?
