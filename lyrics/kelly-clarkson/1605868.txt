Old man said I should smile more
Said he'd never seen such empty face
Didn't anyone ever tell you girl,
You worth more than living in this
Sad and lonely place
So i gave him my best smile
Trade my sorrows with some of that old man's fire
and ran to my feet


Old man said I should get away,
never been no where
never took a chance
and now his memories fade
so i headed out west
never looked back i not gonna live and die with regret
no i never looked back

Never wanted more
Just a place to rest my head
Never asked for much
Just a steady heart
To dance with
Never had too much,
Just enough to keep me safe,
Never wanted more
Until I saw,
That old man's face

oh he's far away from here
oh, his words ringing in my ear

Never wanted more
Just a place to rest my head
Never asked for much
Just a steady heart
To dance with
Never had too much,
Just enough to keep me safe,
Never wanted more
Until I saw,
That old man's face
