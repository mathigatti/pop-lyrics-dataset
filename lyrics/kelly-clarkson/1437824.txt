I used to be a little bit shy
I kept my deepest feelings inside
Speaking up to you about my emotions has always been hard
But this just can't wait
Tonight I feel a little bit brave
So I won't let one more day
Pass without you explaining what we are


This is gonna sound kind of silly
But I couldn't help but notice
The last time you kissed me
You kept both eyes open
Baby, can you tell me what does that mean
If you're lookin' over your shoulder
Then you don't need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on

Don't let me stop you from doin' what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool
Take no chance, get over you
No no, don't let me stop you
If you wanna leave, baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No, don't let me stop you

I'm mad at things I can take
Got a high threshold for pain
But let's get one thing straight
I'm not down to share you with anyone
If this not what you're lookin' for
Nice knowing you, but there's the door
'Cause I know that I can find someone
Who'll give me what I want

This is gonna sound kind of silly
If you're lookin' over your shoulder
Then you don't need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on

Don't let me stop you from doin' what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool
Take no chance, get over you
No no, don't let me stop you
If you wanna leave, baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No, don't let me stop you

Even if I end up broken hearted
I won't lie
I don't wanna hear goodbye
But either way I'll be alright

Don't let me stop you from doin' what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool
Take no chance, get over you
No no, don't let me stop you
If you wanna leave, baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No, don't let me stop you
