My love's a weapon and I'm knockin' 'em dead
I got a heart that's tough as leather
Get what I want and just forget 'em
This game you're playin' is a Russian Roulette
Just cause I'm sweet when we're together
Doesn't mean I'm yours forever
I never should have looked into your eyes
Now everybody's gonna see how I feel


Don't go ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation
Don't go tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em all the plans we've been makin'
Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You never see stars shinin' in my eyes
Yeah, ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation
Oh no, oh, oh no no
Oh no, oh, oh no no

Well I tell 'em, tell 'em, yeah you're nothin' to me
I tell 'em that you, you're just another
You're just like any other
Well I try to sell 'em but they ain't buyin' it
Baby they see me start to stutter
When they ask if you're my lover
I'm losing sleep, what's gotten into me?
I'm usually never weak, baby

Don't go ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation
Don't go tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em all the plans we've been makin'
Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You never see stars shinin' in my eyes
Yeah, ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation
Oh no, oh, oh no no
Oh no, oh, oh no no

I have got to pull myself together, but I can't control it
My lips, they know what they want, everybody knows it
Once a girl controlled the world with words that pierced the bone
Now I'm smiling like a lovesick pup and everybody knows it

(Don't go ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation)
(Don't go tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em all the plans we've been makin')
Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You never see stars shinin' in my eyes
Yeah, ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation
Oh no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no, no

Cause everyone knows that I don't cry
You never see stars shinin' in my eyes
Yeah, ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation
Oh no
