I don't know what to say,
I'm not sure if something's wrong
Is my heart playing tricks on me
Am I losing my mind or your love?


I may be crazy
I may be foolish
but you just walked away from me
Without a kiss...

And no I LOVE YOU's anymore
You don't hold me like before
I don't expect the earth to shake
But would it kill you just to take
A little more time, a little less over

I just can't let it go
Even as you walk away
I know what you've been thinking 'bout
And I don't wanna pretend it's all ok

You can ignore it
You can look the other way
But I'll still be here hanging on
Without your kiss...

Any words will do
just a glance from you
to let me know that I'm still your girl
all I need is a sign
just a little more time

And no I LOVE YOU's anymore
You don't hold me like before
I don't expect the earth to shake
But would it kill you just to take
A little more time, a little less over
