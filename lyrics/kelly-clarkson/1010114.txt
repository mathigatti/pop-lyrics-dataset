[Ms. Peachers singin]
Keep it real with me and I'll keep it real with you

[Master P speaks over singin]
I'ma let you shine, all the time
But when we roll, through the ghetto, tell them niggaz, you mine
I'ma let you shine, all the time
But when we roll, through the ghetto, tell them niggaz, you mine

My ghetto boonapalist, I wanna see you topless
Lie you in my bed like the six-fo', then drop this
to a deck, overlookin, a beautiful ocean sight
Take you out the ghetto, if it's only fo' one night
I'ma keep it real girl, I ain't gon' bullshit or stunt
See I make my money, every first of the month
If you could, be there for me like I'ma, be there for you
Everything that you could think about I'ma make it, come true
I 'member you used to visit me in jail, some say that love is blind
But I told you when I get out, I'ma make sure that you shine
A couple of carats around your finger, baguettes around your wrist
A couple of million in the bank, damn we the shit
Put the kids in private school, but still pack that tool
Cause you know them niggaz think we rich
they gon' act a fuckin fool

[Ms. Peachers singin]
Keep it real with me and I'll keep it real with you
No matter what the world may think, boy I'll always be your Boo

[Master P speaks over singin]
I'ma let you shine, all the time
But when we roll, through the ghetto, tell them niggaz, you mine
I'ma let you shine, all the time

[Ms. Peachers singin]
Keep it real with me and I'll keep it real with you

[D.I.G.]
Yo, but when I greet you I greet you like you a lady
I just ask your name, I never say "Yo whazzup baby?"
because you lookin fine, havin a beautiful day
Now it'll be my pleasure just to greet you up on your way
wherever you goin, we can even jump in the ride
I'll drive you round the city, be your chaffeur, make it live
Don't means I wanna creep witchu, just wanna be witchu
Girl you keep it real with me
and look I keep it real with you too Boo
All of these feelings I'm holdin inside
Some feelings I can never hide
I never keep a secret or tell a lie
I'ma let you shine all the time
And when you roll through the ghetto
let them niggaz know that you mine, ya heard me?

[Ms. Peachers singin]
Keep it real with me and I'll keep it real with you
No matter what the world may think, boy I'll always be your Boo

[Master P speaks over singin]

[Ms. Peaches]
You don't ever have to worry bout me sayin I'm your lady
Keep it real with me cause boy you know you really drive me crazy
All I want.. is for us, to be, together
No matter what.. I'll be there through stormy weather
Keep it real with me and I'll keep it real with you
No matter what the world may think, boy I'll always be your Boo
Keep it real with me and I'll keep it real with you
No matter what the world may think, boy I'll always be your Boo

[Master P]
My ghetto boonapalist ya heard me?
My boonapalist -- every thug need one
That's a woman that ain't gon', stress her man, ya heard me?
Every thug need a boonapalist, uh-heh
She know when you out there hustlin, she gon' be there for you
And when you locked down, she gon' be there for you
When things ain't right, she gon' be there for you
When yo' paper ain't right, her paper gon' be right, ya heard me?
That's a boonapalist, that's what I need
That's what I need a boonapalist
But all the homies out there
If your boonapalist straight, and you come up, huh
You take your boonapalist and, you put her on top, ya heard me?
That's that boonapalist love, ya heard me?
