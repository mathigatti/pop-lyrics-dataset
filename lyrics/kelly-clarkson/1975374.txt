Thick skin, Soft touch,
Heart of gold but it's na-na-na-not enough,
Forgiving arms, The higher road,
Working hard but it's na-na-na-not enough,
You say, I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough
But what you really mean is, You're not good enough, you're not good enough
You can't deliver so you turn it around


You didn't let me down, you didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes, while breaking my heart
You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think,
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me
You love me, you love me
You said you loved me but that I
I'm not good enough, i'm not good enough

Stronghold, but fun ride,
But rollercoasters aren?t just na-na-na-not enough,
I keep it in, you wear me out,
This kind of love is na-na-na-not enough,
Said I?m just a sinking ship, I?m just a sinking ship,

But what that really means,
Is you can?t handle this, you can?t handle this,
You couldn?t win so you turn it around...

You didn't let me down, you didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes, while breaking my heart
You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think,

You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me
You love me, you love me
You said you loved me but that I
I'm not good enough, i'm not good enough

Your love feels different
It?s like a blow to the head with your compliments.
Your love hurts deeper
It?s like a brick in the sea and I?m drowning with it

You didn't let me down, you didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes, while breaking my heart
You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think,
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me
You love me, you love me
You said you loved me but that I
I'm not good enough, i'm not good enough

So understand it means nothing when you say you love me
When you say you love me
When you say you love me
You love me, you love me

You didn't let me down, you didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes, while breaking my heart
You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think,
You just made me cry
While claiming that you love me
You love me, you love me
You know the truth is that
You're not good enough, you're not good enough
