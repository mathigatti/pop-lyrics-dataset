I've thrown away too much of my life
Holding you late at night
Just to catch you slippin' out the door
I'm over you it's gone to far
Girls like me are just to smart
Sayin sorry wont work anymore


The one thing worse than being alone
Is being in love on your own
If I cant have your heart than I'm through
Wasting kisses all of them on you

Theres always something wrong with you
Today its me tomorrow too
Complain at how you never catch a brake
Well its too late you'll never see
The kind of guy i thought you'd be
Cuz your too busy counting your mistakes
Like me

The one thing worse than being alone
Is being in love on your own
If I cant have your heart than I'm through
Wasting kisses

One day fool your gunna see
The big mistake was losing me
And when you call me up I'm gunna say

The one thing worse than being alone
Was being in love on my own
No you cant have my heart cuz its through
Wasting time on you

The one thing worse than being alone
Was being in love on my own
No you cant have my heart cuz its through
Wasting time on you

I'm wasting kisses
I'm wasting kisses
I'm wasting kisses
No you cant have my heart cuz its through
Wasting time on you
