No more midnight rides with you 
No more secret rendezvous 
I'm gonna miss all the things we'll never do 
I just can't believe you left me here alone 
How in this world can I make it on my own 


Remember I love you, I won't be far away 
Baby, close your eyes and think of yesterday 
And we'll be there together 
Love will turn back the hands of time 
Whoa oh turn back 
Whoa oh turn back the hands of time 
 
Whoa oh baby don't you know it's hard to let you go 

Save all your dreams and keep me in your heart 

It hurts to say goodbye no matter how I try 

Love will survive even though we have to part 

Stephanie please don't cry. 

Oh, it all seems so unfair, just when I found you I
lost you. 

That doesn't matter now, 
The only thing that matters is the time we had
together. 
 
But I don't even know your name. 

The only thing you have to know is that I love you 
And you're the only one that can keep our love alive. 
So Stephanie, don't forget me. 
 
I promise. 

Remember I love you, you won't be far away 
 
I just close my eyes, and bring back yesterday 
 
And we'll be there together 
Love will turn back the hands of time 
Whoa oh turn back 
Whoa oh turn back the hands of time 
Whoa oh turn back 
Whoa oh turn back the hands of time 

We'll turn back
