I've known about you for a while now 
When he leaves me he wears a smile now 
As soon as he's away from me 
In your arms is where he wants to be 


[Kelly]
But you're the one he rushes home to 
You're the one he gave his name to 
I'll never see his face in the early morning light 
You have his mornings, his daytimes 
And sometimes I have his nights 

[both]
But does he love you (Does he love you) 
Like he loves me (Like he loves me) 
Does he think of you (Does he think of you) 
When he's holding me 
And does he whisper (Does he whisper) 
All his fantasies 
Does he love you (Does he love you) 
Like he's been loving me 

[Kelly]
But when he's with me 
He says he needs me 
And that he wants me 
That he believes in me 

[Reba]
And when I'm in his arms 
Oh he swears there's no one else 
Is he deceiving me 
Or am I deceiving myself 
(Am I deceiving myself) 

[both]
But does he love you (Does he love you) 
Like he loves me (Like he loves me) 
Does he think of you (Does he think of you) 
When he's holding me 
And does he whisper (Does he whisper) 
All his fantasies 
Does he love you (Does he love you) 
Like he's been loving me 

[Reba]
Oh shouldn't I lose my temper 

[Kelly]
Oh and shouldn't I be ashamed 

[Reba]
Cause I have everything to lose 

[Kelly]
And I, I have nothing to gain 

[both]
But does he love you (Does he love you) 
Like he loves me (Like he loves me) 
Does he think of you (Does he think of you) 
When he's holding me 
And does he whisper (Does he whisper) 
All his fantasies 
Does he love you (Does he love you) 
Like he's been loving me 

[Reba] 
Oh does he love you
