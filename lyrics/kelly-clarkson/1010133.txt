She was abused he thought it brung amused but it really brought pain
the shame being known as the girl with no name it droved her insane
the lie's,rumors,and the blame she couldn't no longer take the rain


She was only 15 she didn't now where her dreams led she wanted to be a singer
but didn't know about the pain it might bring her fed up,fed up ohhh she was fed up

She thought she was in love with the boy that brung her down left her everyday
with a frown black eyes on her way too school but she always kept it cool
but the tears layed inside questions why pop in her head late at night while
she sit on her bed wishing she was dead.

Chorus repeat

Finally got loose left the nam she was abused by 19 and no more crys
now she's living her dream seeing the things that she thought she'll never
see I guess she was fed up by being dumped punched now it's all over
now she's stronger Iam sorry but her name couldn't be mentioned but all
you need too know was that we were real close

chorus repeat till end
