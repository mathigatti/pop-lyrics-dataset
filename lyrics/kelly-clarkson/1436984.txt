I felt it
The wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter
I never saw it coming
I started to black out and
Then someone said "Good morning"
I took it as a warning
I should've seen it coming
So now I take a chance on
This thing we may have started
Intentional or not I
Don't think we saw it coming
It's all adding up to something
That asks for some involvement
That asks for our commitment
I think I see it coming if we steped out on that limb


My heart beat beats me senselessly
Why's everything got to be so intense with me?
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot, but I say "Why not?"
If I say "Forget it" I no that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it but I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
'cause you're the best I got
So take the long shot

I realize that there is all this doubting
Since we're both scared about that
We'll never see 'em coming
Throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing
And 'til its fooling, no one
Will never see it coming
'til it's much to close to stop

My heart beat beats me senselessly
Why's everything got to be so intense with me?
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot, but I say "Why not?"
If I say "Forget it" I no that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it but I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
'cause you're the best I got
So take the long shot

Oh, I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming
But we'll make it

It's a long shot but I say "Why not?"
If I say "Forget it" I no that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it but I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
No chance
'cause you're the best I got

It's a long shot but I say "Why not?"
If I say "Forget it" I know that I'll regret it
(So take a long shot)
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it (You didn't expect this)
There's no chance

It's a long shot but I say "Why not?" (Oh, you never saw me coming)
If I say "Forget it" I know that I'll regret it (You didn't expect this)
It's a long shot just to beat these odds (Oh, you never saw this coming)
The chance is we won't make it (I'm the best you got)
But I know if I don't take it
There's no chance

It's a long shot...
