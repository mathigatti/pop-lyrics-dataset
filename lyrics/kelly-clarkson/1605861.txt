You're feeling brave
He just glanced your way
You shouldn't stay
But it's really not that late
So you say
As you flip your hair and bat your eyes his way
But honey you're mistaken


Cause he's my baby
And maybe you might catch his eye
But I ain't worried
cause girl he comes home to me at night
You're not the first
And probably not the last who's gonna try
But you'll find that you're all wrong
Meet Mrs. Right!

I don't blame you
He's really something else
I'd want him too
Oh wait! he's mine already
How rude of me to rub it in
But girl I'm through
Watching and I'm warning you

Cause he's my baby
And maybe you might catch his eye
But I ain't worried
cause girl he comes home to me at night
You're not the first
And probably not the last who's gonna try
But you'll find that you're all wrong
Meet Mrs. Right!

Just when the coast is clear
You move near
Inching closer, closer to him
And when that angel smiles
you suddenly see mine
One little problem
I'm not the sharing kind

Cause he's my baby
And maybe you might catch his eye
But I ain't worried
cause girl he comes home to me at night
You're not the first
And probably not the last who's gonna try
But you'll find that you're all wrong
You know that you're all wrong
I know that you're all wrong
Meet Mrs. Right!
