I was a heavy heart to carry
My beloved was weighed down
My arms around his neck
My fingers laced the crown


I was a heavy heart to carry
My feet dragged across ground
And he took me to the river
Where he slowly let me drown

My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall

I'm so heavy, heavy
Heavy in your arms
I'm so heavy, heavy
Heavy in your arms

And is it worth the wait all this killing time
Are you strong enough to stand protecting
Both your heart and mine
Who is the betrayer
Who's the killer in the crowd
The one who creeps in corridors
And doesn't make a sound

My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall

I'm so heavy, heavy
Heavy in your arms
I'm so heavy, heavy
Heavy in your arms

This will be my last confession
I love you never felt like any blessing, oooh
Whispering like it's a secret
In order to condemn the one who hears it
With a heavy heart

Heavy, heavy
I'm so heavy in your arms (I'm so)
Heavy, heavy
I'm so heavy in your arms (I'm so)
Heavy, heavy
I'm so heavy in your arms (I'm so)
Heavy, heavy
I'm so heavy in your arms

I was a heavy heart to carry
My beloved was weighed down
My arms around his neck
My fingers laced to crown

I was a heavy heart to carry
But he never let me down
When he had me in his arms
My feet never touched the ground

I'm so heavy, heavy in your arms
Heavy, I'm so heavy in your arms
