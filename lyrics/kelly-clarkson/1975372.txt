I am a woman
Cut in two
By ambitious pride
Stuck in my ways
Between you and my other life


Now i have been around enough to know when love has ended
And i believe that you and i deserve to be extended

Why don't you try
To make me stay
When it's time to go
Why don't you try
To stand in my way
Because we both know
I can't stop myself

Our empty house
You occupy
When i'm far away
Heavier hearts won't justify why i'm gone today

Now i have hung a cloud above our house from always leaving
I figured you would at least make me give a better reason

Why don't you try
To make me stay
When it's time to go
Why don't you try
To stand in my way
Because we both know
I can't stop myself

In the early mornings when i'm up before dawn
Say "why don't you stay" but you keep sleeping on
Maybe you're just too used to me being gone
Cause if you know that i go when i go

Then why don't you try
To make me stay
When it's time to go
Why don't you try
To stand in my way
Because we both know
I can't stop myself

Why don't you
Why don't you try
When it's time to go
Cause I don't wanna have to go and be the one to leave you holding on alone
But this, this is my goodbye
So why don't you try
