(Ruben Studdard)
When you walk through the storm,
Hold your head up high,
And don't be afraid of the dark.


(Kelly Clarkson)
At the end of the storm,
There's a golden sky,
And a sweet silver song of a lark.

(Fantasia Barrino)
Walk on through the wind,
Walk on through the rain,
Though your dreams be tossed and blown....

(Ruben Studdard)
Walk On! Walk On! With hope in your heart,

(Fantasia Barrino)
And you'll never walk alone....

(Kelly Clarkson)
You'll never walk alone

(Ruben Studdard)
Walk On! Walk On! With hope in your heart,

(Fantasia Barrino)
And you'll never walk alone....

(Kelly Clarkson)
You'll never walk alone.
