I don't believe
In the smile that you leave
When you walk away and say goodbye


Well I don't expect
The world to move underneath
Baby, but for God's sake, could you try?

I know that you're true to me
You're always there, you say you care
I know that you wanna be mine

Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need
I want your heart to bleed
And that's all I'm asking for
Where is your heart?

I don't understand
Your love is so cold
It's always me who's reaching out for your hand

I always dreamed
That love would be effortless
Like a petal falling to the ground
A dreamer following his dream

Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need
I want your heart to bleed
And that's all I'm asking for
Where is your heart?

It seems so much is left to say
But you can say anything
Oh anytime you need
Baby it's just you and me

I know that you're true to me
You're always there, you say you care
I know that you wanna be mine

Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need
I want your heart to bleed
And that's all I'm asking for

Where is your heart?
