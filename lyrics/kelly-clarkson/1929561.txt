I'm scared of the dark (scared of the dark)
Scared of the dark (scared of the dark)
Scared of the dark


I'm found my sleep
Don't wake me up tonight
Cause I'll be reaching out for my right
Wishing you were here by my side
It's not like me, to be afraid to be alone
I think daddy have to let me go
I've never let nobody get this close

I used to need my space a place
where I could call my own
But now it feel so cold
I'm lying wide awake
Thinking I see your face
I don't know what I feel
But I know when you're not here
I'm scared of the dark
Haven't slept for days
I hear you breathe my name
I wish I was in your arms
Baby you hold my heart
Now I'm scared of the dark
Now I'm scared of the dark

It's 3 a.m., I'm staring at the clock on the wall
I know it's probably to late to call
But it's my night to take the fall

I used to need my space a place
That I could call my own
But every time you're gone
I'm lying wide awake
Thinking I see your face
I don't know what I feel
But I know when you're not here
I'm scared of the dark
Haven't slept for days
I hear you breathe my name
I wish I was in your arms
Baby you hold my heart
Now I'm scared of the dark
Who possessed, come real and I know you can love me
Cause I think I love you too
I told you lies to protect being so lonely
When I could be with you

I'm lying wide awake
Thinking I see your face
I don't know what I feel
But I know when you're not here
I'm scared of the dark
Haven't slept for days
I hear you breathe my name
I wish I was in your arms
Baby you hold my heart
Now I'm scared of the dark
Now I'm scared of the dark
Scared of the dark
I'm scared of the dark
