Many nights we prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood


Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could
(Oh yes)

There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe
(Oh yeah)

In this time of fear
When prayers so often proved in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away

Yet now I'm standing here
My heart so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles when you believe
(When you believe)
Though hope is frail its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
(You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears (oh)
But when your blinded by your pain
Can't see your way straight though the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says love is very near (yeah yeah)

There can be miracles
(Miracles)
When you believe
(Lord when you believe oh ho)
Though hope is frail
(Though hope is frail)
It's hard to kill
(It's haaaard to kill oh oh)
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

You will when you believe
Just believe (oh yeah)
You will when you believe
