(duet with Justin Guarini) 

Justin
Baby come close, let me tell you this
In a whisper my heart says you know it too
Baby we both share a secret wish
And you're feelin' my love reachin' out to you


Both
Timeless...don't let it end, no
Now that you're right here in my arms where you should stay
Hold tight baby
Timeless...don't let it fade out of sight
Just let the moment sweep us both away
Lifting us to where we both agree
This is timeless love

Kelly
I see it all, baby, in your eyes
And when you look at me you know I feel it too (yes I do)

Both
So let's sail away and meet forever, baby

Kelly
Where the crystal ocean melts into the sky

Kelly
We should let the moment pass
It's makin' me shiver, let's make it last

Both
Why should we lose it? 
Don't ever let me go
Timeless...(yeah)

Justin 
Baby it's timeless 

Kelly
(oh baby it's timeless)

Both
Timeless...

Justin
don't let it fade out of sight

Kelly
Just let the moment sweep us both away 

Justin
(just let the moment)

Kelly
Lifting us to where 

Both
we both agree
This is timeless
This is timeless...love
