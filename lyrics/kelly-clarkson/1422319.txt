I can tell
I can tell
How much You hate this
Deep down inside
You know it's killing me
I can call, wish you well
And try to change this
But nothing I can say
Would change anything


Where were my senses?
I left them all behind
Why did I turn away?

I wish I could save you
I wish I could say to you
I'm not going nowhere
I wish I could say to you
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

I didn't mean
Didn't mean
To leave you standed
Went away 'cause I
Didn't want ro face the truth

Reaching out
Reach for me
Empty handed
You don't know if I care
You're trying to find the proof

There were times I'd wonder
Could I have eased your pain?
Why did I turn away?

I wish I could save you
I wish I could say to you
I'm not going nowhere
I wish I could say to you
It's gonna be alright

It's gonna be alright (Alright)
It's gonna be alright (Save you)
It's gonna be alright (I wish I could save you)

We can pretend nothing's changed
Pretend it's all the same
And there will be no pain
Tonight
It's gonna be alright (It's gonna be alright)

I wish I could save you
I wish I could say to you
I'm not going nowhere (Save you)
I wish I could say to you (Say to you)
It's gonna be alright

It's gonna be alright (Alright)
It's gonna be alright (Save You)
It's gonna be alright (I wish I could save you)
It's gonna be alright
