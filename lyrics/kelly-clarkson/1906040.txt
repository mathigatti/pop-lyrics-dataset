I forgive you, I forgive me
Now when do I start to feel again
I forgive you, I forgive me
Now when do I start to feel again


'Cause the lights are on
But I'm never home
But I'll be back with a brand new attitude
'Cause I forgive you

I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live
Doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And I forgive you

I forgive you
We were busy living the dream
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And I forgive you

I forgive you, I forgive me
Now do I start to feel again
If I hate you, what does that do
So I breathe in and I count to 10

'Cause the lights are on
And I'm coming home
Yes I am back
With a new heart in my hand
'Cause I forgive you

I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live
Doing it our way
No shame, no blame

'Cause the damage is done
And I forgive you

I forgive you
We were busy living the dream
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And I forgive you

I forgive you
For every time that I cried
Over some stupid thing you did to hurt me
That's alright, yeah I forgive you

I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live
Doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And I forgive you

I forgive you
We were just a couple of kids
Trying to figure out how to live
Doing it our way
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And I forgive you

I forgive you
We were busy living the dream
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us
No shame, no blame
'Cause the damage is done
And I forgive you
