Well I've been down 
to my last dime 
Down to my last dance 
Down to the last time 
Down to my last chance 


Well I've been down 
to nothing, 
left at all a time or two 
This time I think 
I'm down to something, 
I can't afford to lose 

Chorus: 
I think I'm down 
to my last broken heart 
I think I'm falling in love 
with you 
I'm just afraid to start 
But untill I know for sure 
our love won't fall apart 
Cause I think I'm down 
to my last broken heart 

Well I can feel 
the spark of love 
and it's a sweet dream 
But will there be enough 
to keep on burning 
Well I've felt the flame 
of love before 
And I watched it burning out 
This time 
I wanna know for sure, 
without a doubt 

Repeat chorus
