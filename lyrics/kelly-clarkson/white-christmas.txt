I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow


I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

'Oh, I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
