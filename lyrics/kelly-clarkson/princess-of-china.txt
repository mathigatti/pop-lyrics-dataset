Once upon a time, somebody ran
Somebody ran away seeing fast as I can
I got to go, I got to go
Once upon a time, we fell apart
You holding in your hand the two halves of my heart


Oh whoa, oh whoa

Oh whoa

Once upon a time, we runnin' bright
Now we all ever seem to do is fight, on and on
And on and on and on,
Once upon a time, on the same side
Once upon a time, on the same side
In the same game

And why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw over all of my things

I could've been the princess, you'd be a king
Could've have had a castle, worn a ring, but no
You let me go
I could've been the princess, you'd be a king
Could've have had a castle, worn a ring, but no
You let me go

You stole my star
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

You stole my star
La la la la la la

Oh whoa

Cause she really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
Cause she really hurt me
No, you really hurt me

Cause she really hurt me, oh
You really hurt me, oh
Cause she really hurt me, oh
You really hurt me
