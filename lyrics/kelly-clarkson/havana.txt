Havana, ooh na na (whoa)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na na (whoa)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na na na (whoa)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (huh huh)
Havana, ooh na na
He didn't walk up with that, "how you doin'?"
(When he came in the room)
He said, "there's a lot of girls I can do with"
(Oh but I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute
(That summer night in June)


And papa says he got malo in him
He got me feelin' like
Ooh, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Ooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na na na na na
Havana, ooh na na (whoa)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na na (whoa)
He took me backâ€¦
