I think you touched my hand
Or maybe hooked me again
What did you say that made me blush?
I think you laughed at me
First day it's always fun
I think that's when I fell in love


First kiss, first moment that I knew
First time you said I love you
First day I started to forget
I still have all your pictures
Sometimes I do remember
But you can and go like all the rest

It's been so long since I left
I can't remember my way back
I'm so lost, so lost
No where to go, walking alone
Without your love I have no home
I'm so lost, so lost

Sometimes I get a glimpse of
You and me and we're dancing
As if things they never change
You hold me closer to you
I watch you fade and soon you
You just slip away

'Cause it's been so long since I left
I can't remember my way back
I'm so lost, so lost
No where to go, walking alone
Without your love I have no home
I'm so lost, so lost

'Cause it's been so long since I left
I can't remember my way back
I'm so lost, so lost
No where to go, walking alone
Without your love I have no home
I'm so lost, so lost

'Cause it's been so long since I left
I can't remember my way back
So lost, I'm so lost
No where to go, walking alone
Without your love I have no home
So lost, so lost
