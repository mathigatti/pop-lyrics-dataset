This situation, if it gets any deeper could be critical
I'm not your love monkey so be taking back all the lies you sold
What did you want me to be
It's just too much now
So tell me so tell me so tell me one two three four


So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spending my time pleasing you
Why must you keep me underground
Tell me tell me, why you wanna bring me down?
Is it too much to give a damn
When I'm giving you one hundred and ten
Don't blink cause I won't be around
Tell me tell me, why you wanna bring me down

Now your transmission is on the negative
You're on a losing streak
This information is getting ordinary and you're losing me
What's with your hostility when the lie's on me?
Well you're down to the last chance
So tell me so tell me uno dos tres cuatro

So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spending my time pleasing you
Why must you keep me underground
Tell me tell me, why you wanna bring me down?
Is it too much to give a damn
When I'm giving you one hundred and ten
Don't blink cause I won't be around
Tell me tell me, why you wanna bring me down

Was it all just a waste of time
I don't wanna spend my whole life thinking bout it
Baby this is where I draw the line, I think I'm done

So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spending my time pleasing you
Why must you keep me underground
Tell me tell me, why you wanna bring me down?
Is it too much to give a damn
When I'm giving you one hundred and ten
Don't blink cause I won't be around
Tell me tell me, why you wanna bring me down
