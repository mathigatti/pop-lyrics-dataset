Every night I pray
That the ghost in your head will just fade away
All the ways I have tried to get in
I keep thinking I could break 'em down
All the walls in your heart would fall to the ground
But there are moments you look at me now and I wonder


Who, who, whoever loved you like that
Who, who, whoever broke your wings
I see you're hurtin' and where you got burned
But whoever did that wasn't me

Without any words slowly you move away
Without anything left for me left to say
Where'd you go
I've been holding on to little things
All these pieces of you I've been saving
Hoping one day I won't have to hold so tightly

Who, who, whoever loved you like that
Who, who, whoever broke your wings
I see you're hurtin' and where you got burned
But whoever did that wasn't me

If you cry I will too
When you call I won't walk I will run to you
If you ever lose sight of my love I won't hide
I'll find you

Cause who, who, whoever loved you like that
Who, who, whoever broke your wings
I see you're hurtin' and where you got burned
But whoever did that wasn't me

Yeah whoever did that wasn't me
