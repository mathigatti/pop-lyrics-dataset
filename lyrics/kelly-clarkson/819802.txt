This is Dedicated...(Dedicated) to my mama
Political prisoner, so called war on drugs (Dedicated)
Headed by this U.S. government...[U my worst enemy](Dedicated)
[I see you]...Uh, I'd ride for you [for pac dogg] 
I'd roll for you, I'd die for you, it's all for you
(Dedicated)

U R ripping us apart
Shit's, dedicated to crack, I dedicate it to that
Uh, Uh...before you came...Never...Never

{Echo}[Talking]
Before you came, the triangle never broke 
{the triangle never broke}[Word Up]
We were melted, and bonded as one (one), ONE (Dedicated)
But as the two pushed you away {But as the two pushed you away}
The one got weak and embrassed you {One got weak and embrassed you}

And now You R ripping us apart {And now you R ripping us apart} [Ripping us apart]

{Echo}[Talking]
The worst feeling, {The worst feeling of helplessness}
The greatest pain, has rested in my heart {has rested in my heart}
The vision of heaven fades {The vision of heaven fades} (Dedicated)
And the nightmare of loneliness has started {And the nightmare of loneliness has started} [You started it, I'ma finish it]
My hero has been defeated by you {My hero has been defeated by you}
And now what can I do {And now what can I do} [Whatchew want me to do]
Watch as you destroy us? {Watch as you destroy us} [Uh-huh, Uh]
And our love is finally through? {And our love is finally through} [No]

I know the worst is here {I know the worst is here}
