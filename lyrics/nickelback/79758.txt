Take away from me 
That what you just gave 
Nothing left to heal 
Nothing left to save
Given half a chance 
Given what we've spent
I will not repay 
I will not repent 
I don't wanna leave 
I don't wanna stay 
Get away from me 
Stay the hell away 
And I will give up my mind 
And I will give my way 
And I will pluck out my eyes 
Yes I will feel my way 
Yes I will Is there something wrong 
With the way I feel
I don't wanna beg
I don't have to steal 
Let me prove myself
Let me earn your trust 
Let me betray
The way that we discussed 
I don't want to thieve
I don't want to snatch 
Get away from me
Stay the hell away And I will give up my mind 
And I will give my way 
And I will pluck out my eyes 
Yes I will feel my way 
Yes I will In open hand, unopened gift 
Her broken bones, her head won't lift 
A decade since you've been gone 
Mend the cracks and say so long 
Say so long
