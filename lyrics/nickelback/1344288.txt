This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life,
The one we all dream of, but dreams just aren't enough,
So I'll be waiting for the real thing,


I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting,
Will play out like a scene, straight off the silver screen,
So I'll be holding my breath, right up to the end,
Until that moment when,
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

(Chorus)
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there,
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands,
There's gotta be somebody for me like that,

'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own,
Everyone wants to know they're not alone,
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight,
Out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right
It's just like déjà vu, me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath
Could this be the end?
Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there,
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares,
Someone to love with my life in their hands,
There's gotta be somebody for me like that,

'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own,
And everyone wants to know they're not alone,
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere,
There's gotta be somebody for me out there!

You can't give up, when your looking for that diamond in the rough
Because you never know, when it shows up
Make sure your holding on, 'cause it could be the one,
The one your waiting on..

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there,
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares,
Someone to love with my life in their hands,
There's gotta be somebody for me!
Ooooh....!

'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own,
And everyone wants to know they're not alone,
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere,
There's gotta be somebody for me out there!

Nobody wants to be the last one there,
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares,
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere,
There's gotta be somebody for me out there!!
