Father, tell me somethin'
Where do bad men go when they die?
And mother says you'll go there but
Wings for her and I and I don't mind
Cause I have always wanted to learn to...


Fly... learn to
Fly... learn to
Fly... learn to
Fly...

Brother, tell me somethin'
If I take this, am I going to die?
And he says no, so then I figure what the hell
I'll try cause it's my life
So light the match and you and I will...

Fly... learn to
Fly... learn to
Fly... learn to
Fly...

Cause I'm on my hands and knees I've crawled eternity to begforgiveness
And someday I'll be there I swear to you, God, as my witness
For all the trusts I've broke and, let justice know, it's justthat easy
Cause I'm a liar, I conspired, I'm a liar...

And father tell your son,
It's not your gun and bloody hands
Don't hide behind locked doors
In dresser drawers those bullets wait to fly...

Fly... wait to
Fly... wait to
Fly... wait to
Fly...

Cause I'm on my hands and knees I've crawled eternity to begforgiveness
And someday I'll be there I swear to you, God, as my witness
For all the trusts I've broke and, let justice know, it's justthat easy
Cause I'm a liar, I conspired, I'm a liar...
