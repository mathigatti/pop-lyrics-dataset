I wish I would've met you
Now it's a little late
What you could've taught me
I could've saved some face


They think that your early ending
Was all wrong
For the most part they're right
But look how they all got strong

That's why I say hey man nice shot
What a good shot man

A man
Has gun
Hey man
Have fun
Nice shot

Now that the smokes gone
And the air is all clear
Those who were right there
Got a new kind of fear

You'd fight and you were right
But they were just to strong
They'd stick it in your face
And let you smell what they consider wrong

That's why I say hey man nice, nice shot
What a good shot man

A man
Has gun
Hey man
Have fun
Nice shot

Nice shot Man

I wish I would've met you

I'd say
Nice shot
