Uh, hmm
Hurry up a bit
Yeah, yeah


Chorus (3x):

I like the way you do it, when you do it
When you doin, what you doin

Check this out right here, son
We about to move to make you feel some
A lot of positive vibrations to build from
'Cause all I wanna do is lose some and win some
Have a little of prosperity and then some
Livin my life handsome, has always been a dream but
Now it's time to really achieve by all means (Bust it)
I keep my shit, plus thirty in between
When an arm reach out to grab the supreme
'Cause I won't stop, and AP won't stop
And Tab won't stop until we reach the top
That means we won't quit, so we stay thick so you can enjoy it
I know you like the way it's goin down, honey, honey
I know you like the milky-mellow sound, honey, honey
Doin this ain't all about money, money
I know you like the way I sound, right, right

Chorus (4x)

As I enter the room I absorb the mood
Positive vibe supplied by a positive crew
And negativity exist and you must acknowledge
You can be intelligent and never go to college
'Cause the way we live in society
It ain't really the way that it's supposed to be
And don't get close to me if you're contaminated
Take a picture of your soul and get it laminated
Put them in your wallet next to your money
Money represents your whole and soul represents your honey
Ain't got honey then you ain't got bees
And if you ain't got no money I'ma still MC
Then empty L-O-V-E all over the track
Once you R-E-D then you never go back
'Til the end of studio with the Peas as Black
With Adam, Taboo, and alligator APL De AP

Chorus (4x)

I wanna travel the world and stop on every city
Rejuvenate your burnt out sea put down your Philly for a sec
Close your eyes and don't fret
Listen to the audible sounds and just let
Your soul feel the free feelin
Reprovide you with the ride, free fallin
To make your heart beat, skip, hipnotize you and
APL take you on a trip where your mind's at ease
Forget ballin 'cause I won't quit, and Will won't quit
And Tab won't quit so you can enjoy it
That means we won't stop
And I won't stop until we reach the rop
I'd rather be ready for the future
Do it for yourself 'cause no one else will suit ya
I juxtapose for mine to maintain
And segregate myself from evil and pain

Chorus (8x)
