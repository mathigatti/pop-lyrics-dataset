You know there's a dirty word
Never gonna say it first
No it's just a thought that never crosses my mind
Maybe in the parking lot
Better bring your friend along
Better rock together than just one at a time


S is for the simple need
E is for the ecstasy
X is just to mark the spot
Because that's the one you really want
(Yes!) sex is always the answer, it's never a question
'Coz the answer's yes, or the answers (Yes)
Not just a suggestion, if you ask a question
Then it's always yes, yeah! (Yes)

I'm loving what you wanna wear
I wonder what's up under there?
Wonder if I'll ever have it under my tongue?
I'll love to try to set you free
I love you all over me
Love hearin' the sound you make the second you're done
