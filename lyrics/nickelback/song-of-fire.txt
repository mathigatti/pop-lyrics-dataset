The first words that come out
And I can see this song will be about you
I can't believe that I can breathe without you
But all I need to do is carry on


The next line I write down
And there's a tear that falls between the pages
I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages
But it depends which one it's standing on

I write lines down, then rip them up
Describing love can't be this tough

I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you

I'm dying to show you
This could end happily ever after
There doesn't ever have to be disaster
And all you have to do is sing along

I write lines down, then rip them up
Impossible describing love

I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you

(I could set this song on fire)
Sing this song to you
(I could set this song on fire)

Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes
Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost
Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much

I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you

(I could set this song on fire)
Unless I sing this song to you
(I could set this, I could set this)
I wanna sing this song to you
(I could set this song on fire)
Sing this song to you
(I could set this, I could set this)
