Now, when I was just a little boy,
Standing to my Daddy's knee,
My poppa said, "Son, don't let the man get you
Do what he done to me."


'Cause he'll get you,
'Cause he'll get you now, now.
And I can remember the fourth of July,
Running through the backwood, bare.

And I can still hear my old hound dog barking,
Chasing down a hoodoo there.
Chasing down a hoodoo there.

Born On The Bayou
Wish I was back on the Bayou.
Rolling with some Cajun Queen.
Wishing I were a fast freight train,
Just a choogling on down to New Orleans.

Born On The Bayou
Do it, do it, do it, do it.
Oh, Lord.
Oh get back boy.

I can remember the fourth of July,
Running through the backwood bare.
And I can still hear my old hound dog barking,
Chasing down a hoodoo there.
Chasing down a hoodoo there.
Born On The Bayou
