Yes, he wore a cowboy hat
Each bone broken in his back
All the money and all the gold
Couldn't buy my love at 8 years old
I'm in love with a girl that's wrong for me
Ask her, she will disagree
Her father was a small town man
With small town dreams and small town head
But


But I was there when there was nobody home
Please believe me when I say I don't know
Gone for good in fact but what does it mean?
Within a year they always sold and bought

Easy enough to just look at her
Whole world on a silver platter
Was that that bad for me
If I was there the scotch is free
Won round one but its not over
He don't care cause he don't know her
True love is not the same
If I could lend a hand in shame
But

But I was there when there was nobody home
Please believe me when I say I don't know
Gone for good infact but what does it mean
Within a year they always sold and bought

If I was big
So much easier to see
Don't hide from me
That which I've already seen
You lie to me
More than occasionally
Don't lie to me
You lied to me

I'm as high as I'll ever be
I don't mind, stay and see
They've all gone, why don't we?
Holding hands, you and me
But I'm as high as I'll ever be
But later on, lies to see
My past is gone, only from me
I'm alive

But I was there when there was nobody home
Please believe me when I say I don't know
Gone for good infact but what does it mean
Within a year they always sold and bought

Remember when it was me
Driving come down just for me
And then we'll try as we've been
