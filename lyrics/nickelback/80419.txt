Hands on the mirror
Can't get much clearer
Can't make this all go away


Now that you're bleeding
You stare at the ceiling
Watch as it all fades away:

From what you do
Because of you

You know I can't be there each time that you call
I swore not to come, but I'm here after all
I know by the look that I see in your eyes
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die

From what you do ( what you do )
What becomes of you ? ( what you do )
What becomes of...

Now that you did this
You ask for forgiveness
Doctor, could you be my priest?
You say you're mistaken
But look what she've taken
You laugh as you lie through your teeth

From what you do ( what you do )
What becomes of you ? ( what you do )
Because of you

You know I can't be there each time that you call
I swore not to come but I'm here after all
I know by the look that I see in your eyes
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die

From what you do ( what you do )
Because of you ( what you do )
What becomes of...

From what you do!

Hands on the mirror
Can't get much clearer
Can't make this all go away

Now that you're bleeding
You stare at the ceiling
Watch as it all fades away:

From what you do
Because of you
You know I can't be there each time that you call
I swore not to come but I'm here after all
I know by the look that I see in your eyes
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die

From what you do ( what you do )
what becomes of you ? ( what you do )
What becomes of...
