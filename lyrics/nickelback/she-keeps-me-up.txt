She's got me nervous
Talkin' a hundred miles an hour
She's more than worth it
I swear she smells just like a flower
I'd fall to pieces if I went anywhere without her
I love when she says, "What's wrong with right here on the counter?"


Funky little monkey she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sisters Mr.
Coca-cola, rollercoaster
Love her even though I'm not supposed to
Funky little monkey she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sisters, Mr.
Coca-cola, rollercoaster
Love her even though I'm not supposed to

She keeps me up (I keep you up)
She keeps me up (I keep you up)
All night (all night)
All night (all night)
She keeps me up (I keep you up)
She keeps me up (I keep you up)
All night (all night)
All night

I need her so bad
Sometimes I think that I can taste it
This evil romance
So good I never wanna waste it
I can't trust my friends
'Cause she's what everybody chases
And I know where she's been
'Cause it's on everybodys faces

(Got got, gotta get it get it
Got got, gotta get it get it

Gonna, gonna, gonna, hey ey ey ey)

I'm looking for what I have to slow down
Gotta be a better way to come down
I've gotta stay awake somehow
(Gonna gonna gonna, hey ey ey ey)
