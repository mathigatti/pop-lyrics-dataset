wuz a wayward child
with the weight of the world
that I held deep inside.
Life wuz a winding road
and I learned many things
little ones shouldnt know


Chorus:
But I closed my eyes
steadied my feet on the ground
raised my head to the sky
and though times rolled by
still I feel like a child as i look at the moon
maybe I grew up a little too soon

La-da-da-da-da....

Funny how one can learn
to grow numb to the madness
and block it away
I left the words unsaid
let it all dissipate
as I try to forget

Chorus

Bridge:
Nearing the edge
oblivious I almost
fell right over.
Apart of me
will never be quite able
to feel stable.
Like with each other
nearing the side
were on the verge of dying
Thankfully I woke up in time....
