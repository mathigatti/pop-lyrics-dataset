Children all have saviours 
Children don't care who saves us 
Round the corner, round the bend 
Fingernails torn to the end Bring back, bring back 
Bring back, bring back on me 
On me I told them, we scold them 
Can't console them always 
Toy soldiers falling 
Dominoes, but who knows? Bring back, bring back 
Bring back, bring back on me 
On me Yeah and I dream of falling stars 
And tokes for all my friends 
And I will live forever 
Yeah and I dream of all I'm worth 
And all along the way 
And I will never even 
Yeah and I will coast through falling prayers 
And all along the way 
And I will always listen Bring back, bring back (I) 
Bring back, bring back (Or) 
Bring back, bring back (We) 
On me.... 
Bring it back, bring it back on 
Bring it back, bring it back on 
Bring it back, bring it back on
