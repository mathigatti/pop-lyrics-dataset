Father's hands were lined with dirt
From long days in the field
And mother's hands are serving meals
In a cafe on Main Street
With mouths to feed...
Just tryin' to keep clothing on our backs
And all I hear about...
Is how it's so bad, it's so bad


It's too bad, it's stupid,
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk

You left without saying goodbye,
Although I'm sure you tried
You call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive
But you weren't there
Right when I needed you the most
And now I dream about it...
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

It's too bad, it's stupid,
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

It's so bad, It's too bad, it's stupid
It's too late, so wrong, so long
Too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk

Father's hands are lined with guilt
From tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end,
Just look at where we are
We made it out... ...we still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it...
And how it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad,

It's too bad, it's stupid,
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

It's so bad, it's too bad, it's stupid,
It's too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

Long time, let's walk, let's talk
