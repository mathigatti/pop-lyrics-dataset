Forevers a lonely time and the dogs aren't always 
Aren't always on my mind 
Cause I didn't free them 
The scenery is burning me cause I'm still in it
So why don't you free me 
Cause its not my business 
What he's done to me 
Control is all you really need
And I guess I had it coming, my fault for not runnin 
I just dressed too tempting cause your heads fuckin empty 
And I can't believe it
I can't believe that you didn't see me Passing glances fall on me
like screams on deaf ears 
They're all laughing at me 
with encouraging cheers.
