I'm back in my hometown
And Main Street's dying now
It's like there's nothing left of it
No more high school grounds
They tore that building down
And everything with it I miss
I call up my old friends
So long since I've seen them
It's like we're back there instantly to me
We all meet at Shawn's
The backyard fire's on
And we start telling tales of how life used to be


The years have come and gone
But the stories carry on
Looking back they're better than they used to be

'Cause you should have seen the size of the guys we were fighting
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
But Mama always taught us to never tell a lie, ooh
And every ten-yard pass always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive

And the story goes on and gets a little better
Every time we're together

It's funny how we change
And some things stay the same
God, I miss the glory days always
With daylight getting near
We shed a few more tears
Lord, I love the memories we've made

The years have come and gone
But the stories carry on
Looking back they're better than they used to be

'Cause you should have seen the size of the guys we were fighting
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
But Mama always taught us to never tell a lie, ooh
And every ten-yard pass always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive

And the story goes on and gets a little better
Every time we're together

Well you should have seen the size of the guys we were fighting
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
But Mama always taught us to never tell a lie, ooh
And every ten-yard pass always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive

And the story goes on and gets a little better
Every time we're together

And the story goes on and gets a little better
Every time we're together
