It's getting late have you seen my date
Sometime let the boys get in.
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock,
Want to get a belly full of beer.


My old man's stronger than a barrel full of wanna
And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots with a handful of
grease in her hair.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh... Don't give us none of your aggravation,
We've had it with your discipline.
Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting, get a little action in.
I get about as oiled as a diesel train, gonna set this dance
alight.
Cause' Saturday Night's the night I like,
Saturday Nights Alright... Alright, Alright!

Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh...

Packed pretty tight in here tonight and I'm looking
for a woman who'll see me right.
I may use a little muscle to get what I need, and drink a little
jacket and scream out, "She's man!".

A couple of the sounds that I really like are the sound of a
switchblade and a motorbike.
I'm a juvenile product of the working class, who's best friend
floats in the bottom of a glass.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.........

Don't give us none of your aggravation, we've had it with your
discipline.
Saturday Night's Alright for fighting, to get a little action
in.
I get about as oiled as a diesel train, gonna set this dance
alight.
Cause Saturday Night's the night I like,
Saturday Night's Alright...
Alright, Alright!

Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Don't give us none of your aggravation, we've had it with your
discipline.
Saturday Night's Alright for fighting, to get a little action
in.
I get about as oiled as a diesel train, gonna set this dance
alight.
Cause Saturday Night's the night I like,
Saturday Night's Alright...

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday Night's Alright...

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday Night's Alright...

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday Night's Alright...
