Head high, protest line
Freedom scribbled on your sign
Headline, New York Times
Standing on the edge of a revolution


Hey, hey, just obey
Your secrets safe with the NSA
In God we trust or the CIA
Standing on the edge of a revolution

Yeah, we're standing on the edge of a revolution
Revolution, revolution, revolution

No, we won't give up
We won't go away
'Cause we're not about to live in this messed illusion
No we don't wanna hear another word you say
'Cause we know they're out
Depending on mass confusion
No, we can't turn back, we can't turn away
'Cause it's time we all rely on the lost illusion
No we won't lay down and accept this fate
'Cause we're standing on the edge of a revolution

Wall street, common thief
When they get caught, they all go free
A brand new yatch, and a finders fee
Standing on the edge of a revolution

Same shit, different day
Can't keep fed, if I can't get paid
We'll all be dead if this shit don't change
Standing on the edge of a revolution

Yeah, we're standing on the edge of a revolution
Revolution, revolution, revolution

No, we won't give up
We won't go away
'Cause we're not about to live in this messed illusion
No, we don't wanna hear another word you say
'Cause we know they're out
Depending on mass confusion
No, we can't turn back, we can't turn away
'Cause it's time we all rely on the lost illusion
No, we won't lay down and accept this fate
'Cause we're standing on the edge of a revolution

We'll all be dead if this shit don't change
