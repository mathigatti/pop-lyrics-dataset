How could this affect my life?
How could I affect the outcome?
So why even try? For what, for what, for what, for what?
A coward can save the day
When the bravest of men just stand by
So easy to say: so what, so what, so what?


So, what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we trade it all?
Complacency for a voice that won't be ignored
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore?

A candle's the smallest light
But a handful becomes a lighthouse
Cutting the night for us, for us, for us, for us
The one with the loudest voice is really the one to follow?
Silence the noise; so what, so what, so what?

So, what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we trade it all?
Complacency for a voice that won't be ignored
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore?

Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
What if we, what if we, what if we

What if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we trade it all?
Complacency for a voice that won't be ignored
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore?

Hurry up, the world needs this
Hurry up, the world needs this (the world needs this)
The world needs this
The world needs this
The world needs this
The world needs this
