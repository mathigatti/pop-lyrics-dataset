For eternity
Uhhuh
And you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
How you needed me
How we used to be
In loveHelplessly
I fell so deep
I was so naive
To let you in
Why did I let you in
To my heart(And you don't remember)
No
(Anything you told me)
Anything that you told me
(You were mine forever)
You were mine forever
For eternity
Yes you will
And you don't remember
(And you don't remember)
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
Together
How you needed me
How we used to be
In love
Hoooa
