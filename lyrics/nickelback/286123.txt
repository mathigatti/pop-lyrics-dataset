Uncle sam taught him to shoot
Maybe a little too well
Finger on the trigger, loaded bullet
He hit the stick so full of rage
And let the whole world know it
Six feet away, they heard'em say
Oh God, don't let him pull it


Please God, don't let him pull it
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched you do it

How could you take his life away?
(What makes you think you have the right?)
How could you be so full of hate?
(To take away somebody´s life?)
And when I heard you let him die
And made the world all wonder why
I sat at home and on my own,
I cried alone and scratched your name
In the side of bullet

And in the wake of his mistake
So many lives are broken
Gone forever from a loaded bullet
And no excuse that you could use
Could pull somebody through it
And to this day so many say
God why'd you let him do it?

How could you let him do it?
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched him do it

How could you take his life away?
(What makes you think you have the right?)
How could you be so full of hate?
(To take away somebody´s life?)
And when I heard you let him die
And made the world all wonder why
I sat at home
I cried alone
And on my own,

And scratched your name
On the side of a bullet
On the side of a bullet
