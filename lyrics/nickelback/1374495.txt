i wanna do it till the sun comes up
till we're both so good and sweaty that we can't stand up
i wanna do it till we're both about to drop
as long as we're caught in together we're never gonna stop.


i wanna go until the neighbors all complain
cause they heard somebody screamin and they think we're both in pain
i wanna go so long your parents think you died
there gonna call the cops the CIA and then the FBI

(chorus)
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down
hold on here we go
yeah, we're gonna go untill our legs give out
round and round we go
yeah, we're gonna do it hangin upside down
up and down we go
yeah, we're getting ready for the next go round
round and round we go

shut the windows lock the doors unplug the phone
for all intents and purposes there aint no body home
then we can do it till the batteries are gone
and borrow two from the tv remote to throw this thing back on

i wanna cover you with jello in the tub
we can roll around for hours without ever comin up
i want you naked with your favorite heels on
Rub John Deere across my ass and ride me up and down the lawn

(chorus)
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down
hold on here we go
yeah, we're gonna go untill our legs give out
round and round we go
yeah, we're gonna do it hangin upside down
up and down we go
yeah, we're getting ready for the next go round
round and round we go

(solo)
(repeat chorus)
