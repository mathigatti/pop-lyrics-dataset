Kiss it goodbye, goodbye,
Kiss it goodbye, goodbye,


Hollywood is plastic
But easy on the eyes
Big Apple is fantastic
But cuts you down to size

Treat you like a doormat
Expecting you to fail
Says right across your forehead
Integrity for sale

You'll be on TV
When it starts to snow in hell
You won't believe me
So go and see it for yourself

That brunettes move to New York
Blondes go California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow all your pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes
(Kiss it goodbye)

Stealing comes with practice
Lying comes with ease
But neither one is faster
Than falling to your knees

Money leads to fame
And fame is the disease
The latest epidemic
Reality TV

You'll be on TV
When it starts to snow in hell
You won't believe me
So go and see it for yourself

That brunettes move to New York
Blondes go California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow all your pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes

Fame
What's the last thing you get out of life
Watch your ass and kiss it goodbye
Fame
What's the last thing you get out of life
Watch your ass and kiss it goodbye

So let's move to New York
Or out to California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow all your pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes

Fame
What's the last thing you get out of life
Watch your ass and kiss it goodbye
Fame
What's the last thing you get out of life
Watch your ass and kiss it goodbye
