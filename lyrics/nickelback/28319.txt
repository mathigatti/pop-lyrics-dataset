Best of friends, where'd they all go?
Try to find but no one ever knows
This small town makes you wanna stay
Who the hell would want to anyway?
Well I'm leavin'


And I want it all
Thought I got it all
Then I finally saw
And I found out where it's all at

Better now than I'm before
Tried it once now I want it more
Memories all cut in half
Tell the truth then I want you to laugh
We're not laughing

And I want it all
Thought I got
Better find this all
And I found out where it's all at

Burn it all
Watch and learn
Sell it all watch and learn
Sell it all watch it burn

Steal a car we're all headed south
You know the score so just shut your mouth
One more run then I want out
Not like them I'd rather go without
Without needing

And I want it all
Thought I got it all
Then I finally saw
And I found out where it's all at

Well I knew it all
Forgot it all
Better find this all
And I found out where it's all at
