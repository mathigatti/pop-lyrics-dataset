Well it's midnight, damn right
We're wound up too tight
I got a fist full of whiskey
The bottle just bit me
That shit makes me
Bat shit crazy
We got no fear, no doubt
All in, balls out


We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We'll go until the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight

We're screaming like demons
And swinging from the ceiling
I got a fistful of fifities
Tequila just hit me
We got no class
No taste
No shirt
And shit faced
We got'em lined up shot down
Firing back straight crown

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We'll go until the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight

Ticking like a time bomb
Drinking til the night's gone
Get your hands off of this glass
Last call my ass
No chains no lock and this drain won't stop
We got no fear no doubt
All in, balls out

We're going off tonight
To kick out every light
Take anything we want
Drink everything in sight
We'll go until the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
