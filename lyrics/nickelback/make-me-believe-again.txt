Before this hits the ground
Before this fades away
I wanna let it out
And I don't wanna wait
So don't you let me down
And don't you hesitate
Before I turn around
And before I walk away


I want to you to make me
Make me, make me

Make me believe again (oh, oh)
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again (oh, oh)
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never that far away
Make me believe again (make me believe again)

I can't pretend
Make me believe again
I can't pretend, make me
Believe again, believe again

If you could take that dirt
I'll wash it all away
If you could say the words
And make me wanna stay
Just tell me there's a chance
To hell if I'm damn blame
If you could take my hand
If you could lead the way

I want to you to make me
Make me, make me

Make me believe again (oh, oh)
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again (oh, oh)
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never that far away
Make me believe again (make me believe again)

I can't
I can't pretend
Make me believe again
I can't pretend, make me
Believe again, believe again

Make me believe again (oh, oh)
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again (oh, oh)
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never that far away
Make me believe again (make me believe again)

Ooh, I can't pretend
Make me believe again
I can't pretend, make me
Believe again, believe again

I can't pretend
Make me believe again
I can't pretend, make me
Believe again, believe again
