I saw the river, just pulled him down 
I knew the man who hunted him down 
We watched the river, take him away 
Before he died, I could have sworn he said
I am the only one 
I am the only one left Tired and afraid lies a saddened man
Knelt beside him with head in hand
And escaped on a lonely breath 
But before he died I could have sworn he said I am the only one
I am the only one left 
Who ever gave a damn about you
I am sorry
I am sorry
I was wrong 
I was wrong 
I've been wrong for way too long 
I am sorry that you're gone
