I asked you to stay
But you said there's no way
I begged-- you call
And you leave me after all
I know I'm not to blame
I know you don't feel the same
Didn't even tell me why
You just left me here to dieI stand, I fall, I bounce off these 4 walls
You laugh, you leave
And you leave me here alone,
Is this how its gonna be
It's fine for you and not for me
Did you even care at all
You stand, I fallI'm guilty too
forsiring all to you
Well, that's my one sin
Sorry for giving in
Didn't mean to waste your time
Thanks for wasting mine
Could have to tried to let me be
Would you just set me free?Could I pay you not to...
