I went out on the town with a friend last weekend
His ex girlfriend's friend was there alone
She bought a couple rounds and i got the feeling, she could really handle alcohol


Another one down and headed off the deep end
The more we drank, the less that we had them

And it turns out she's got everything i want, but all rolled into one
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar
Looking like a rockstar, she'll be the talk of the town

You know, she's got everything i want, but all rolled into one
Gotta get me some

God all mighty look at that body
Flickers like a sticker on a new Ferrari
She's a scene from a Baywatch rerun
Hotter than a barrel from a squeezed machine gun

Well, she can get it lower than a Maserati
Never seen somebody move that way
Everywhere she goes there's an instant party
Everybody wants to know her name

And it turns out she's got everything i want, but all rolled into one
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar
Looking like a rockstar, and she likes to go out and

She likes to get her hands up
Anything to stand on
Anything to dance on
She'd be swinging around
Under the hot lights, underneath the spot light
Even going all night
She'll be the talk of the town

You know, she's got everything i want, but all rolled into one
Gotta get me some
