And some say 
Why you follow somethings so long 
So I asked him 
And he convinced me before long 
Now its over 
And I've seen him, don't come back anymore 
And he said... 
I need 
I don't ask much anymore 
I found 
I found something 


Throw a stone into the water 
The ripple is broke 
Burn the baby 
Just for holding the cradle too close 
Take it all back 
Search for justice, don't live there anymore 
And he said 

I need 
I don't ask much anymore 
I found 
I found something 

And why do you see me in this way? 
The way that I did 
I gave him the means to the ends 
Yes I did 
I bothered not to believe in this way 
The way that I did 
I made him just to see in this way 
The way that I did 

I need 
I don't ask much anymore 
I found 
I found something
