They usually come around about 10 o'clock
You can hear them
You can tell them by the way they knock
Somebody said the other one had a badge
Who told ya, who told ya


How bout if I stay and you run away
Well come on back and try to get some today
Well somebody's gonna do it again
Gonna make me turn against all of my friends
So you better have something damn worthy to say

They're growin dope everywhere around the block
You can smell it
You can tell by the way they talk
Somebody stole five for gasoline
Who told ya, who told ya

How bout if I stay and you run away
Well come on back and try to get some today
Well somebody's gonna do it again
Gonna make me turn against all of my friends
So you better have something damn worthy to say

I'll never do it again (no I wont)
Lets settle it (we dont)
I can't afford my life cause I'm spending it
Since you got just what you wanted

We never do anything anymore
One on the telephone, one on the door
Somebody said revenge was served sweeter cold
I told ya, I told ya
They're growing dope everywhere around the block
You can smell it you can tell it by the way they talk
Somebody stole five for gasoline
Who told ya, who told ya

How bout if I stay and you run away
Well come on back and try to get some today
Well somebody's gonna do it again
Gonna make me turn against all of my friends
So you better have something damn worthy to say

I'll never do it again (no I won't)
Let's settle it (we don't)
I can't afford my life cause I'm spending it
Since you got just what you wanted

I'll never do it again (no I won't)
Praise myself (I don't)
I can't afford my life cause I'm spending it
Since you got just what you wanted
What you wanted
