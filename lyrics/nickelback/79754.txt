All men
with stars upon the chest
Save yourselves, your family,
don't worry 'bout the rest


Small child receives light through the crack
The human mile, they're never coming back

Hold out your hand and ask for some

Now and again she sits beneath the tree
The sign above reads
Hard Work will Set you Free

Hold out your hand and ask for some [2x]

Too late for another direction
Always what we've got in store
Hurry back we've all been waiting
We can't take much anymore
Where are the days where brothers are brothers
A childless mother
Leave it except for
Leave it except for one

Hold out your hand and ask for some [2x]

Too late for another direction
Always what we've got in store
Hurry back we've all been waiting
We can't take much anymore

Hold out your hand and ask for
Hold out your hand and ask for
Hold out your hand and ask for some
