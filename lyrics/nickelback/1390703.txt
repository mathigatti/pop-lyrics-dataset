Never mind the face that you put on
In front of me
Never mind the pain
you've put me ..through


'Cause every little thing you say
And every little thing you do
Makes me doubt all of this
What are you waiting for?

Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
well it's not me

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted it to be?
And this life you gave away
Was meant for me

Forget about this trip you've been on
Or so it seems
And never mind the lies you told my tears

'Cause every little thing you said
And every little thing you did
Made me doubt all of this
Is that what you're waiting for?

Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me, nooooooooo

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted it to be?
And this life you gave away
Was meant for me, yeah, yeah

was meant for me...was meant for me...yeah...yeeeeah

Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me
noooooo

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted it to be?
And this life you gave away
Was meant for me

I don't know how I can face this pain
I keep it inside so you can't see
I don't think I can go on this way
Cause it's not me
