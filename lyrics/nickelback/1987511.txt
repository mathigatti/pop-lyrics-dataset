You call to me, and I fall at your feet
How could anyone ask for more?
And our time apart's like knives in my heart
How could anyone ask for more?


But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to

Trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more

And this kind of pain, only time takes away
That's why it's harder to let you go
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you
That's why it's harder to let you go

But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to

Trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying,but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more

So I sit here divided, just talking to myself
Was it something that I did?
Was there somebody else?
When a voice from behind me,that was fighting back tears
Sat right down beside me, whispered in my ear
Tonight I'm dying to tell you

Trying not to love you, only went so far
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart
Now I see the silver lining,what we're fighting for
And if we just keep on trying, we could be much more
'Cause trying not to love you
Ohhh! Trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more
