Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine
Lookin for a scapegoat, long past due
Walking down the aisle, staring straight at you


I still hear him screaming "where do I hide?"
And he asks, and I say "hurry inside"

He said, she said, no, she don't
Be back before morning, you know she won't
I remember that summer, like yesterday
And I remember his mother, As he was dragged away

I still hear him screaming "where do I hide?"
And he asks and I say "hurry inside"
A whole lot of memories
Yours and not mine
And he asks, and I say "hurry inside"

Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine
Lookin for a scapegoat, long past due
Walking down the aisle, staring straight at you

I still hear him screaming "where do I hide?"
And he asks and I say "hurry inside"
A whole lot of memories
Yours and not mine
And he asks and I say "hurry inside"
