There's clothes all over the floor
Don't remember them being here before
Smell of perfume isn't here
Why's lipstick on the mirror
And still I don't understand


No pictures left in the hall
There's three new holes in my wall
Where the hell's my credit cards
Why's my wallet in the yard
And still I don't understand

Well now I guess I should've listened
When you said you'd had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other
Why's love gotta be so tough

Should see the look on my face
My shit's all over the place
Why's this happening to me
Why'd you take both sets of keys
And still I don't understand

Well now I guess I should've listened
When you said you'd had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other
Why's love gotta be so tough

And now I guess I should've listened

There's clothes all over my floor
I don't remember them being there before
There are no candles in here
Lipstick's still on my mirror
And still I don't understand

Now I guess I should've listened
When you said you'd had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other
Why must love be so tough

Well Now I guess I should've listened
When you said you'd had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other
Why's love gotta be so tough
