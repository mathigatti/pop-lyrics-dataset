oh looking like another bob marley day
hittin from the bong like a diesel train
and i'm down for hangin out this afternoon


we got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
cheech and chong probably woulda smoked them all
so im out on the couch this afternoon

beer bottles layin on the kitchen floor
we take em all back we can buy some more
so i doubt we'll go without this afternoon

(chorus)
Oh, better hang on if your taggin along
cause we'll be doin this till six in the morning
nothing wrong with goin all night long
tough to put the brakes on
doesnt matter when your gotta

get up, go out, me and all my friends
drink up, fall down, then we do it all again
just sittin around, hangin out this afternoon

landlord says i should buy a tent
but he can kiss my ass cause i payed the rent
so i doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon

down on the corner in a seedy bar
juke box cranking out the CCR
havin a few to Suzy Q this afternoon

(chorus)
Oh, better hang on if your taggin along
cause we'll be doin this till six in the mornin
nothing wrong with goin all night long
tough to put the brakes on
doesnt matter when your gotta

get up, go out, me and all my friends
drink up, fall down, then we do it all again
yeah we get up, we go out, me and all my friends
drink up, fall down, then we do it all again
yeah, just sitting around hanging out this afternoon

dont want a wrist watch, or an alarm clock to see what time it is
from the moment i wake up i just love bein with my friends
we barely get by, but have the best times
and hope it never ends
we drink all day until we fall down
so we can do it all again

its not the human walk its the human race
you feel your livin on the edge takin too much space
so i doubt i'll figure out just what to do
bout to kick it around hangin out this afternoon

(chorus)
Oh, better hang on if your taggin along
cause we'll be doin this till six in the mornin
nothing wrong with goin all night long
tough to put the brakes on
doesnt matter when your gotta

get up, go out, me and all my friends
drink up, fall down, then we do it all again
yeah, we get up, go out, me and all my friends
we drink up, fall down and do it all again
just kickin around hanging out this afternoon
just sittin around hangin out this afternoon
