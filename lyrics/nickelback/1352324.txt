I like your pants around your feet
I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please while your lookin' up at me
your like my favorite damn disease
And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say no to many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose


[CHORUS]
Ohh I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
(Now and then, you wonder why)
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
just to figure you out
(Now and then, you wonder why)

I like the freckles on your chest
And I like the way you like me best
And I like the way your not impressed while you put em to the test
I like the white stains on your dress
And I love the way you pass the check
And I love the good times that you wreck
(the good times that you wreck)
I love your lack of self-respect
While your passed out on the deck
I love my hands around your neck

[CHORUS]

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While your looking up at me
your like my favorite damn disease
And I hate the places that we go
And I hate the people that you know
And I hate the way you can' say no to many long lines in a row
I hate the powder on your nose

[CHORUS]
