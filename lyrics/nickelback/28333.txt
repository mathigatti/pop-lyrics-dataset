Cherry Stem in her mouth she could tie in a knot 
Favorite trick she does, One in ten that she's got 
Making friends, setting trends, hardly having to try 
All the looks, by the book, best that money can buy 


Look what your money bought 
It's all that she's got 
It keeps her company 
Straight from Mom and Daddy 

Last chance to dance, our in back of the bar 
Shakin' hands, nice to meet you, I don't know who you are 
She has a toke and makes a joke about the alley man 
Never pleasured from the treasure in a garbage can 

Look what your money bought 
It's all that she's got 
It keeps her company 
Straight from Mom and Daddy 

Cherry Stem in her mouth she could tie in a knot 
Favorite trick she does, One in ten that she's got 
Making friends, setting trends, hardly having to try 
All the looks, by the book, best that money can buy
