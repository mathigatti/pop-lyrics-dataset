What are you waiting for?
Are you waiting on a lightening strike?
Are you waiting for the perfect night?
Are you waiting till the time is right?
What are you waiting for?


Don't you wanna learn to deal with fear?
Don't you wanna take the wheel and steer?
Don't you wait another minute here
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you got
You only living once, so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

You know you gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You only living once, so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

Are you waiting for the right excuse?
Are you waiting for a sign to choose?
While your waiting it's the time you lose
What are you waiting for?

Don't you wanna spread your wings and fly?
Don't you wanna really live your life?
Don't you wanna love before you die?
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting for?

You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you got
You only living once, so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

You know you gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You only living once, so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

Tell me what your waiting for
Show me what your aiming for
What you gonna save it for?
So what you really waiting for?

Tell me what your waiting for
Show me what your aiming for
What you gonna save it for?
So what you really waiting for?

Everybody's gonna make mistakes
But everybody's got a choice to make
Everybody needs a leap of faith
When are you taking yours?
What are you waiting for?

You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you got
You only living once, so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

You know you gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You only living once, so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you got
You know you gotta give it your all
You only living once, so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

What are you, what are you
What are you, what are you waiting for?
What are you, what are you
What are you, what are you waiting for?
