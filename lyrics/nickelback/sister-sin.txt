Yeah, the lady and me both agree
Some days we just don't get along
But the whiskey and me both agree
Maybe we're both just better off
Well the preacher believes that I'll meet
All of these demons hanging on
But we both know if they don't, I'll get lonely,
Need a few to tag along


Hanging here by a thread
Hear a voice inside my head
I'll lay beside you every night
And dread the day you might be gone
She said "in case you hadn't noticed that
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)
And I ain't about to anymore"

Now the wagon I'm in's paper thin
I think one wheel's coming off
Hey sister sin with that grin, where you been?
So kind of you to help me out

Hanging here by a thread
Hear a voice inside my head
I'll lay beside you every night
And dread the day you might be gone
She said "in case you hadn't noticed that
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)
And I'm not about to anymore"

Fall from grace, kingdom come
Lying face down in the mud
Please don't hate, look don't judge
For I know not just what I've done
Fall from grace, kingdom come
Lying face down in the mud
Please don't hate, look don't judge
For I know not just what I've done
Lying face down in the mud
For I know not just what I've done
For I know not just what I've done
