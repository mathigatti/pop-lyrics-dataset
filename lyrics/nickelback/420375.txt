Mah baby
Hey
HmShattered dreams
Cut through my mind
Tragically our love has died
Memories confine my head
Bitterly I face the endTrustingly
I gave myself to you
I let you inside
Believing your liesAnd you don't remember
Every time you told me
You were mine for ever
For eternity
Uhhuh
And you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
How you needed me
How we used to be
In loveStranded here
In notingness
With only tears
And lonlinessFoolishly
I gave my soul to you
I let you inside
Believing your liesAnd you don't remember
Every time you told me
You were mine for ever
