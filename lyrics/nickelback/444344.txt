Love, Love will keep us together 
Think of me babe whenever 
Some sweet talking girl comes along singing her song 
Don't mess around, 
You got to be strong 
Just Stop, 'cause I really love You 
Stop, I'll be thinking of you 
Look in my heart and let love keep us together 


You, You belong to me now 
Ain't gonna set you free now 
When those girls start hanging around talking me down 
Hear with your heart and you won't hear a sound 
Just Stop, 'cause I really love you 
Stop, I'll be thinking of you 
Look in my heart and let love keep us together 

Whatever
young and beautiful, 
Someday your looks will be gone 
When the others turn you off, 
Who'll be turning you on? 

I will, I will, I will, I will- 
Be there to share forever 
Love will keep us together 
Said it before and I'll say it again while others pretend 
I'll need you now and I'll need you then 
Just Stop, 'cause I really love you
Stop I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together 

Whatever
I will, I will, I will, I will!
