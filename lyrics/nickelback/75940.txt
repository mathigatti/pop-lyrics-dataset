I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me
You must've broke down 'cause you finally said that you would
But now that you're here I just feel like I'm constantly dreaming
Well something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feeling' way too damn good


For 48 hours I don'w think that we left my hotel room
Should show you the sights 'cause I'm sure that I said that I would
We gotta make love just one last time in the shower
Well somethings gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good

And it's like
Every time I turn around
I fall in love and find my heart face down and
Where it lands is where it should
This time it's like
The two of us should probably start to fight
"Cause something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feeling way too damn good
Feelin' way too damn good

Sometimes I think best if left in the memory
It's better kept inside than left for good
Looking back each time they tried to tell me
Well somethings gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good

And it's like
Every time I turn around
I fall in love and find my heart face down and
Where it lands is where it should
This time it's like
The two of us should probably start to fight
"Cause something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feeling way too damn good
Feelin' way too damn good

I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me
You must've broke down 'cause you finally said that you would
But now that you're here I just feel like I'm constantly dreaming
Well something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feeling' way too damn good

And it's like
Every time I turn around
I fall in love and find my heart face down and
Where it lands is where it should
This time it's like
The two of us should probably start to fight
"Cause something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feeling way too damn good
Feelin' way too damn good

I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me
Feelin' way too damn good
I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me
