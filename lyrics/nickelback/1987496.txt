Well I know the feeling
Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there aint no healing
From cutting yourself with a jagged edge
I'm telling you that
It's never that bad
Take it from someone who's been where you're at
Laid out on the floor
And you're not sure
You can take this anymore


So just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell
I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you
That you're going to make it through another night
Stop thinking about
The easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done
You're far too young
And the best is yet to come

So just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell
I'm scared as hell
Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Well everybody's hit the bottom
Everybody's been forgotten
When everybody's tired of being alone
And everybody's been abandoned
I left a little empty handed
So if you're out there barely hanging on

Just give it one more try
With a Lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell
I'm scared as hell
Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
