She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door
You grow up quick when you grow up poor
Its the only way to la that she knows
The hollywood pose teeth tits and toes
It didnt take her long to leave the boulevard
So many five star friends with black credit cards
Shed try anyone once cause anything goes
It never comes easy when your diggin for gold


Well she aint no cinderella whens she's getting undressed
Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far to pretty to be givin it cheep
Thats why shes makin six figures workin three days a week
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didnt make this far by just shakin hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didnt make this far by just shakin hands

I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book
City hall would probably fall if anyone got a look
Every a list player is a favorite friend
Since they all taste the same in the back (on the beds) not sure bout that bit
A congresman would call her every once in a while
Got the school skirt on the top of the pile
Shes done everyone once and everyone knows
You gotta get a little dirty when your diggin for gold

Well she aint no cinderella whens she's getting undressed
Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far to pretty to be givin it cheep
Thats why shes makin six figures workin three days a week
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didnt make this far by just shakin hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didnt make this far by just shakin hands

Well someone spilled the beans and now her names in the press
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best
The judge is goin easy cause he paid for her chest
Yeah, he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west

Far to pretty to be givin it cheep
Thats why shes makin six figures workin three days a week
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didnt make this far by just shakin hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didnt make this far by just shakin hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didnt make it this far by just shakin hands
