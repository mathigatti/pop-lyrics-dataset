I want to
Take his eyes out
Just for looking at you
Yes I do
I want to
Take his hands off
Just for touching you
Yes I do


And I want to
Rip his heart out
Just for hurting you
And I want to
Break his mind down
Yes I do

And I want
To make him
Regret life
Since the day
He met you
Yes I do
And I want
To make him
Take back all
That he took from you
Yes I do

And I want to
Rip his heart out
Just for hurting you
And I want to
Break his mind down
Yes I do
