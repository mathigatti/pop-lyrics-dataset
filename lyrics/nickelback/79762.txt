Feelin' fine
Let's rip out yours instead of mine
And all you need
Are several ways to watch me bleed
Well thanks for stoppin' this beatin' in my chest
Well it's easier now and I'm happy like this
Just like this

For yankin out my...
Honestly, you fucked your friends for all your needs
and still, of course,
No, the universe ain't yours
Well thanks for stoppin' this beating in my chest
It's easier now and i'm happy like this
Just like this
Even though I ain't comin' back now
I didn't mean to seem as though
I was so ungrateful for all you've done here
Even though i ain't comin back now
I didn't mean to seem as though
I was so ungrateful for all you've done here
For yankin' out my...
If I could only see this

All the feeling's I'da seized an'
An' I could thank-ya for yankin' out my...
Yankin' out my...
Feelin' fine
Let's rip out yours instead of mine
And all you need
Are several ways to watch me bleed
Well thanks for stoppin' this beatin' in my chest
It's easier now and I'm happy like this
Just like this
Even though, I ain't comin' back now
I didn't mean to seem as though
I was so ungrateful for all you've done here
Even though, I ain't comin' back now
I didn't mean to seem as though
I was so ungrateful for all you've done here
For yankin' out my...
For yankin out my...
