Tell your friends not to think out loud
Until they swallow
Whisper things into my brain
Your voice sounds so hollow
I am not a leader of men
Since I prefer to follow
Do you think I could have a drink
Since it's so hard to swallow
Yeah, so hard to swallow


Turn your television off
And I will sing a song
If you suddenly have the urge
You can sing along
I touch your hand, I touch your face
I think the fruit is rotten
Give me lessons on how to breathe
Cause I think I've forgotten
Yeah, I've forgotten

One day, up to a cliff
That overlooks the water
I jumped in to save a girl
It was somebody's daughter
And now the ring that's on my hand
Was given to me by her
And to this day we all sit around
And dream of ways to get higher
Yeeeah, to get much higher

Tell your friends not to think out loud
Until they swallow
Whisper things into my brain
Your voice sounds so hollow, yeah
I am not a leader of men
Since I prefer to follow
Do you think I could have a drink
Since it's so hard to swallow
Yeah, so hard to swallow
