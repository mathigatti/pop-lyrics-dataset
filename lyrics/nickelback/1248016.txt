Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I'm goin' to
Silk suit, black tie
I don't need a reason why
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
Coz every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man
Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
And cufflinks, stick pin
When I step out I'm gonna do you in
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
Coz every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man
Top coat, top hat
I don't worry coz my wallet's fat
Black shades, white gloves
Lookin' sharp and lookin' for love
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
Coz every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man
