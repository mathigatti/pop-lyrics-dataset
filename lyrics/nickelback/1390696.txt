It's down to this 
I've got to make this life make sense 
Can anyone tell what I've done 
I miss the life 
I miss the colours of the world 
Can anyone tell where I am 


'Cause now again I've found myself 
So far down, away from the sun 
That shines into the darkest place 
I'm so far down, away from the sun again 
Away from the sun again 

I'm over this 
I'm tired of living in the dark 
Can anyone see me down here 
The feeling's gone 
There's nothing left to lift me up 
Back into the world I know

And now again I've found myself 
So far down, away from the sun 
That shines into the darkest place 
I'm so far down, away from the sun 
That shines to light the way for me 
To find my way back into the arms 
That care about the ones like me 
I'm so far down, away from the sun again 

It's down to this 
I've got to make this life make sense 
And now I can't tell what I've done 

And now again I've found myself 
So far down, away from the sun 
That shines to light the way for me

'Cause now again I've found myself 
So far down, away from the sun 
That shines into the darkest place 
I'm so far down, away from the sun 
That shines to light the way for me
To find my way back into the arms 
That care about the ones like me 
I'm so far down, away from the sun again

Oh no...
Yeah...
I'm gone...
