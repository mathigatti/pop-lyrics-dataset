I'm in a bar full of bikers and a handful of junkies
It's a 50/50 chance that their planning to jump me
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive
Well, my favorite little waitress has ahold of my eye
But there's a shotgun loaded hidden under the bar
Her fingers on the trigger if anybody gets out of line


There's other places that are better to go
But i'm addicted to the red light show
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole
And i can't get enough of the things that she does

She's gonna be my midnight queen
Lock and load and i'm ready to go
She's gonna lick my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't letting go
And i can't get enough of the things that she does, alright

Well, she walks like a model and she talks like a trucker
Doesn't want a lollipop, but she showed us a sucker
They're closing in around her, i'm cutting to the front of the line
She grabbed a bottle of tequila and a light for her lips
Laid her body on the bar and put the salt on her hips
Was lying when i told her that i'm only gonna lick her tonight

Theres other places that are better to go
But i'm addicted to the red light show
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole
And i can't get enough of the things that she does

She's gonna be my midnight queen
Lock and load and i'm ready to go
She's gonna lick my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't letting go
She's gonna be my sex machine
And i can never get her under control
She's gonna climb all over me
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo
And i can't get enough of the things that she does

And i can't get enough of the things that she does

She's gonna be my midnight queen
Lock and load and i'm ready to go
She's gonna lick my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't letting go
She's gonna be my sex machine
And i can never get her under control
She's gonna climb all over me
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo
And i can't get enough of the things that she does, alright
