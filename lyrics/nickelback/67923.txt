Hey there little darling, where'd the old man go?
Why don't we get out of town and do it all night long?
We can lie out in the field til the morning light
Then me and your old man are gonna have to fight
Start the loving in the truck and wind up in the ditch
The old man will come a-runnin' with a hickory switch
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day
Why, I, gotta learn the hard way
Buddy showed me just how fast a car can go
I'll race you for your pink slip right before this show
Put your girlfriend in the bet to make things good
Cause she's been staring at me like no girlfriend should
Bastards sitting right there on the starting line
Stuck the sugar in your gas tank by myself last night
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day
Why, I, gotta learn the hard way
Hey there little darling, where'd the old man go?
Why don't we get out of town and do it all night long?
We can lie out in the field til the morning light
Then me and your old man are gonna have to fight
Start the loving in the truck and wind up in the ditch
The old man will come a-runnin' with a hickory switch
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day
Why, I, gotta learn the hard way
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day
Why, I, gotta learn the hard way
