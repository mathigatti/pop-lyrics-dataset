Bribing me, We come, We watched how 
We're last to throw our pennies 
A passive tramps lifts her skirt 
And asks us then we throw them down to her And I know why I will always follow you 
Anywhere my brother leads me to We don't want to live in the sun 
Just to keep them happy for awhile 
Midnight, and Frank freaks out and reaches God and 
Fairly tied up too But I know why I will always follow you 
Anywhere my brother leads me to 
And I remember wanting to be you 
And pray to God that we would all pull through 
Cause I know why I will always follow you 
If you're my brother, then I will follow you Lifelong friends threw bottle ends 
And yell in the air like lifelong enemies 
Who's stronger, who's lived longer? 
World quarrels and grandkids on your knee Cause I know I will always follow 
Anywhere my brother leads me to 
And I remember wanting to be you 
And pray to God that we would all pull through 
Cause I know why I will always follow you 
If you're my brother, then I will follow you Cause I know why I will always follow 
I will follow you and I will 
I know why I will always follow 
I will follow you and I will
