One step, two step, electric slide
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Mama’s gonna let you set the moon on fire
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack wound up with a broken neck
Humpty dumpty, do your thing
Daddy’s gonna buy you a diamond ring


Oh, it must be nice, to spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you’ve never failed
Your life’s a goddamn fairy tale
Your life’s a goddamn fairy tale

Suzie steamboat you’re so fine
Grant the wish I wish tonight
Tinker tailor whatcha got?
Wheels on the bus are falling off
Pretty maids all in a row, yes sir, yes sir three bags full
Silver spoon at supper time
Four and twenty blackbirds, oh, so high

Oh, it must be nice, to spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you’ve never failed
Your life’s a goddamn fairy tale
Your life’s a goddamn fairy tale

One step, two step, electric slide
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Stick your diamond ring
Where the sun don’t shine

Oh, it must be nice, to spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you’ve never failed
Your life’s a goddamn fairy tale

Oh, it must be nice, to spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you’ve never failed
Your life’s a fucking fairy tale
