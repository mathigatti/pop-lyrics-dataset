Not like I need to depend upon anyone
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all
One more the anthem for the know it all
I won't be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl
Learn how to crawl
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor


Like I need to defend my own innocence
So what I did it, I admit it, and I'm pleading the fifth 
One more anthem for the know it all
I won't be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl
Learn how to crawl
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor

Eight minutes I'm losing it a little bit
Five minutes your description might be startin' to fit
3 to go and I'm forgetting all that I've ever known
I won't be standing up alone I better learn how to crawl

Not like I need to depend upon anyone
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all
One more anthem for the know it all
I won't be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl
Learn how to crawl
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor

Can't stand up at all
Can't see nothin' at all
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor
