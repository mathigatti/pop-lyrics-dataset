I pull out of the driveway 
and head out on the highway 
and I can see them in my rearview mirror 
hanging out the window 
snappin a shot of me 
so I pull into the fast lane 
nobody's gettin past me 
and I can hear the helicopters coming 
drivin down the street is such a pain in 
the ass for me 


Chorus: 

And God I wanna know why 
whoever said it was painless 
should try and be famous 
you know Im just livin life 
but nothings for free 
lets see what they say first 
front page of the papers 
some days I find that even I 
dont wanna be me 
Just tryin to be me 
why dont they leave me the hell alone 

So Im hanging out on Melrose 
watchin all the girls go by 
then a hottie spots me 
sippin on tequilla 
so happy to be alone 
no need to call the paparatzi 
cause tehy already got me 
everybody's got a cell phone camera 
walking down the street is such a 
pain in the ass for me 

CHORUS 

and Im just tryin to be me 
and Im just tryin to be me 

Chorus 

Repeat chorus to end of song
