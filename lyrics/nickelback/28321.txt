I paid my last respects this morning on an early grave
Already said goodbye nothing left to say
A tiny church, a tiny town and not a tear was spent
Not how I wanted it I'm hating all of this


Well I'm hating, All of this, I'm hating,
All of this, All of this, All of this

Now I know why I hide my love from you some days
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me
You came along and tore this wall down around me
Looks like you found me, now I know why
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning

I've been a loser all my life I'm not about to change
If you don't like it, there's the door nobody made you stay
There ain't a woman on the planet who can deal with it
Just how I wanted it I'm hating all of this

Well I'm hating, All of this, I'm hating,
All of this, All of this, All of this

Now I know why I hide my love from you some days
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me
You came along and tore this wall down around me
Looks like you found me, now I know why
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning

Well I'm hating, All of this, I'm hating,
All of this, All of this, All of this

Now I know why I hide my love from you some days
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me
You came along and tore this wall down around me
Looks like you found me, now I know why
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning
