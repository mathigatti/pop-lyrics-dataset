And you see much better than I see
And you know all that I'm thinking
To define or redefine too slow
And it seems all that I'm sinking


Running through the deep
Gonna find the backwoods
I found out (Yeah, Yeah)
All day long who will be the big men giving some (Yeaaah)

And you bleed much better than I bleed
And you've shown all that is so good
And your word, much better than my word
And you stand right where a hole should

Running through the deep
Gonna find the backwoods
I found out (Yeah, Yeah)
All day long who will be the big men giving some (Ooooh)

(Ooooh Yeah)
Solo

To feel devine
To hold onto ones self
To give and to give and
To never receive by myself

Running through the deep (I want it)
Gonna find the backwoods (I need it)
I found out (much more than he did)
All day long who will be the big men giving some
(give it back somehow)
Giving some (I'm ready to forgive now)

Running through the deep
Gonna find the backwoods
I found out (Yeah Yeah)
All day long who will be the big men giving some (Yeah)

Running through the deep gonna find the back backwoods
I found out gonna get it gonna get it
All day long who will be the big men
are you really really gonna get it
