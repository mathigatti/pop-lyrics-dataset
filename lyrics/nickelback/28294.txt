Come lie next to me Jesus Christ
Holes in hand where a cross used to fit just right
The meeting called...the topic: a ladies fate
You don't have to remind me
I won't be late


Please excuse me, I'm sorry, I just can't wait
And don't use grandfather as the bait

Down the hall the baby boy just born
Rosary around a crown of thorns

Please excuse me, I'm sorry, I just can't wait
And don't use grandfather as the bait

No...
Can't you see the lady's not ready
Hands and feet are bound and unsteady
In the hall the family's grieving
I'm the one who stays
I'm not leavin' yet
