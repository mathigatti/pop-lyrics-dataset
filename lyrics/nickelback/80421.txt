I'm through thinking of things to say to you
It's true, I've said enough and so have you
Just drive, you slam the door and so do I
Tongue tied from all the little things
And they're the reason that I scream


I needed you
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head
Cause I needed you
Car keys in your hand I believe that you would leave me for dead

Your turn, you'd rather leave than live and learn
That's why, you want an end and so do I 
This time, I believe I'll leave it all behind 
Tongue tied from all the little things
And they're the reason that I scream

I needed you
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head
Cause I needed you
Car keys in your hand I believe that you would leave me for dead
Cause I needed you
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head
Cause I needed you
Car keys in your hand I believe that you would leave me for dead

I believe that you would leave me for 
I believe you would leave 
Me for dead, me for dead
I believe you would leave
Me for dead, me for dead

I'm through thinking of things to say to you
It's true, I've said enough and so have you
Just drive, you slam the door and so do I
Tongue tied from all the little things
And they're the reason that I scream

I needed you
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head
Cause I needed you
Car keys in your hand I believe that you would leave me for dead
Cause I needed you
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head
Cause I needed you
Car keys in your hand I believe that you would leave me for
I believe you would leave
Me for dead , me for dead
I believe that you would leave
I believe that you would leave me for
