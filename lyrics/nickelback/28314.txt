I don't live anymore
I don't love me this way
I don't have wings to fly
I don't have, gone away
I don't have anything
I don't need a space to breathe
I don't hide in sanctity
I don't need what you need
I don't have, have a space to...


I don't claim to know just why
I don't try to pacify
I don't love me just yet
I don't care, gone away

This ones mine
This ones mine
This ones mine
All mine
Not this time I won't deny
This one's mine
All this time
Not this time I won't deny
All this time, Yes it's mine

I don't have anything
I don't need the space to breathe
I don't hide in sanctity
I don't need what you need
I don't have... I don't have...
I don't have... I don't have...
I don't have anything
I don't need the space to breathe
I don't hide in sanctity
I don't need what you need

I don't have... I don't have...
I don't have... I don't have...
