There I was, laid out on a table 
Screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor 
In my life, I'd not soften 
Things that cut, and burn so often 
But I sit, think of somethin' 
Scared to face, the dyin' nothin' 


See the cycle I've waited for 
It ain't like that anymore 

Where I go is when I feel I'm able 
How I fight is why I'm feelin' sore 
In my sight, not forgotten 
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten 
Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin' 
Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin' 

See the cycle I've waited for 
It ain't like that anymore 

Here I sit writing on the paper 
Trying to make the words you can't ignore 
In my mind, what I'm lacking 
Score at face, a ten for slacking 
Sign the deal, set in motion 
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean 

See the cycle I've waited for 
It ain't like that anymore
