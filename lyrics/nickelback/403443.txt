Believe it or not
Everyone have things that they hide
Believe it or not
Everyone keeps most things inside
Believe it or not
Everyone, believe in something above
Believe it or not
Everyone, need to feel loved


Feel loved
But we don't
And we won't
Until we figure out

Could someone deliver us
And send us some kind of sign?
So close to giving up
Coz faith is so hard to find
But you don't, and you won't
Until we figure out

I've seen it a lot
Every time to the world turns upside down
Believe it or not
Most of us feel like we're losing ground
Believe it or not
Everyone, hate admitting fear
Believe it or not
Most of us wanna know why we're here

Why we're here
But we don't
And we won't
Until we figure out

Could someone deliver us
And send us some kind of sign?
So close to giving up
Coz faith is so hard to find
Someone deliver us?
Just send us some kind of sign
So close to giving up
Coz faith is so hard to find
But you don't, and you won't
Until we figure out

Most of us have nothing to complain about
Most of us have things we can live without
Everyone need advice on how to get along

Get along; we don't
Until we figure out

Believe it or not everyone (everyone, everyone)â€¦

Believe it or not
Everyone have things that they hide
Believe it or not
Everyone keeps most things inside
Believe it or not
Everyone, believe in something above
Believe it or not
Everyone, need to feel loved

Feel loved
But we don't
And we won't
Until we figure out

Could someone deliver us
And send us some kind of sign?
So close to giving up
Coz faith is so hard to find
Someone deliver us?
And send us some kind of sign
So close to giving up
Coz faith is so hard to find
But you don't, and you won't
Until we figure out
You don't, and you won't
Until we figure out
