Left on an eastbound train
Gone first thing this morning
Why's what's best for you
Always the worst thing for me
When am I gonna learn
Why? 'Cause I'm tired of hating
When will it be your turn?
Why 'Cause I'm tired of waiting


No I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Well no I don't find faith in your forced feelings
Not fooled by your misleadings
Won't buy this line you're selling
Tired of this lie you're telling
I won't, I don't
No I won't do this anymore (2x)

She says I'm only telling half of it
That's probably 'cause,
There's only half worth telling
And every time I try to laugh it off
That's when you turn around
And wind up yelling
When am I gonna learn
Why 'Cause I'm tired of hating
When will it be your turn?
Why? 'Cause I'm tired of waiting

No I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No I don't find faith in your forced feelings
Not fooled by your misleadings
Won't buy this line you're selling
Tired of this lie you're telling
I won't, I don't
No I won't do this anymore (2x)

She says I'm only telling half of it
That's probably 'cause,
There's only half worth telling
And every time I try to laugh it off
That's when you turn around
And wind up yelling
When am I gonna learn
Why 'Cause I'm tired of hating
When will it be your turn
Why 'Cause I'm tired of waiting

No I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No I don't find faith in your forced feelings
Not fooled by your misleadings
Won't buy this line you're selling
Tired of this lie you're telling
I won't, I don't
No I won't do this anymore (2x)
