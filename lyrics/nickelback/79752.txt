You say you don't want it
Just watch and you'll flaunt it
You stare at the ceiling
And ignore what I'm feeling


Well thats fine hey no I don't mind
I can't find nothing wrong with it
And you stand in your polite way
Oh... by the way... could you get on with it?

Now that I've seen... not really diggin this!

Did I ask for your input?
Hows the taste of your own foot?
To speak and not be right
You'd like to just rewrite

My life and take what you like
And decide with all of it
And to know that if it goes right
You'll never find out if i wanted it

Now that I've seen... not really diggin this!
Now that I know... not really diggin this!

Called him twice today
They said he went away
I never wondered why
They tried to hold him
Ain't never comin' back
Pull out the welcome mat
I never wondered why
They tried to hold him

The way that it's going
To laugh without knowing
The way that I'm feeling
Inside is unappealing

That's fine, hey no I dont mind
I can't find nothin wrong with it
And to say in your polite way
Oh... by the way... could you get on with it?

Now that I've seen... not really diggin this!
Now that I know... not really diggin this!
Not really diggin this!!
