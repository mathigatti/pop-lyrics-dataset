Stuck in a cage, luck of the draw
Always a way, gotta get out
Road, I gotta find one
Get me a key, pick me a lock
Gotta be free, ready or not
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run


Nowhere to hide, 'cause someone's always gonna find you
Trying to breathe with everybody right behind you
Scattering leaves to try and cover up the footprints
Water ahead 'cause I can hear it in the distance

I'm running for the river
'Cause the river's running high
And there ain't no going back
They'll never catch me
I'm running for the river
You can ride, you can fly
You can tell 'em that you tried
But there ain't no going back
They'll never catch me
Tell 'em that you tried
But you're never gonna catch me

Let off the hounds, stand off the guards
Never be found, better than bars
Damn it, he's a fast one
Not up the trees into the swamp
Gotta be free, so don't ever stop
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run
God damn it, he's a fast one

Nowhere to hide, 'cause someone's always gonna find you
Trying to breathe with everybody right behind you
Scattering leaves to try and cover up my footprints
Water ahead 'cause I can hear it in the distance

I'm running for the river
'Cause the river's running high
And there ain't no going back
They'll never catch me
I'm running for the river
You can ride, you can fly
You can tell 'em that you tried
But there ain't no going back
They'll never catch me
Tell 'em that you tried
But you're never gonna catch me

Water ahead 'cause I can hear it in the distance
Water ahead 'cause I can hear it in the distance
(Gotta run, gotta run)
Water ahead 'cause I can hear it in the distance
Water ahead 'cause I can hear it in the distance
(Gotta run, gotta run)

I'm running for the river
'Cause the river's running high
And there ain't no going back
They'll never catch me
I'm running for the river
You can ride, you can fly
You can tell 'em that you tried
But there ain't no going back
They'll never catch me

They'll never catch me
Never gonna catch me
Never gonna catch me
They'll never catch me
