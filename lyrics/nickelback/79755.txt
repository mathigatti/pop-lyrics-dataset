It's hard to breathe, from underneath
Smothering in all your heat
It's hard to take, it's tough to break
So i don't make the same mistakes
The same mistake (4x)


Out in the yard is where i play,
Don't come in cause i'm afraid
You saw my face, i faced my friends
Do i tell or just pretend?
I found a friend, a friend who knows
Who says he'll help but then he goes
And then he goes (4x)

In front of me, in front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah
I'm in the way, the way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah
In front of me, in front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah

Fingernails, filled with dirt
If you don't tell, you don't get hurt
I cry for help, i pray to god
Another tear he tries to rob
To rob me of, my dignity
Cause sanctuary's far from me
Far from me (4x)

In front of me, in front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah
I'm in the way, the way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah
It's hard to take, a piece of me, so peacefully, yeah, yeah
In front of me, in front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah
So broke inside, don't run away
And find another place to stay
And make our inhibition go away
Because i'm so afraid, yeah, yeah

It's hard to breathe, from underneath
Smothering in all your heat
It's hard to take, it's tough to break
So i don't make the same mistakes
In front of me, in front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah
I'm in the way, the way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah
It's hard to take, a piece of me, so peacefully, yeah, yeah
In front of me, in front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah
