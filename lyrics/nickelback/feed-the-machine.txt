Addressing those beneath from high above
Convincing his belief for what you love
Baiting every hook with filthy lies
Another charlatan to idolize


Is this suppression just in my mind?
(Just in my mind, just in my mind)
No more questions, get back in line!
(Just get back in line!)

Pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (the longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn and wither away
Leaving your bones out on the stones
Picking them clean (picking them clean)
Carving the truth while harvesting you
To feed the machine (to feed the machine)

The gears forever turn to grind the mice
Will you become the fuel for sacrifice?
Power absolutely all for show
The piper blows his flute and off you go

Is this obsession behind your eyes?
(Behind your eyes, behind your eyes)
No more questions get back in line!
(Just get back in line!)

Pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (the longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn and wither away
Leaving your bones out on the stones
Picking them clean (picking them clean)
Carving the truth while harvesting you
To feed the machine (to feed the machine)

Why must the blind always lead the blind?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
Why do I feel like the fault is mine?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)

Why must the weakest be sacrificed?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
No more questions, get back in line!
(Just get back in line!)

Pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (the longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn and wither away (wither away)
Leaving your bones out on the stones
Picking them clean (picking them clean)
Carving the truth while harvesting you
To feed the machine (to feed the machine)
To feed the machine
