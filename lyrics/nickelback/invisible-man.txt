Haven't seen me lately
Staying hard to find
Well I know it ain't easy
But you know I don't mind


I always know where you are, you never know where I am
You got me sneaking around like the invisible man
You'll never know where I've gone, you've gone and done it again
you've got me sneaking around like the invisible man
Going once, going twice, three times, fuck this I'm gone
[Edited version: "Going once, going twice, three times I'm gone"]

You've been looking for days now
Oh but I'm not around
I've been finding new ways how
To see that I'm never found

I always know where you are, you never know where I am
You got me sneaking around like the invisible man
You'll never know where I've gone, you've gone and done it again
you've got me sneaking around like the invisible man
Going once, going twice, three times, fuck this I'm gone
[Edited version: "Going once, going twice, three times I'm gone"]

You can see right through me, outta sight, outta mind
Can you see why it's easy to be the hardest to find

I always know where you are, you never know where I am
You got me sneaking around like the invisible man
You'll never know where I've gone, you've gone and done it again
you've got me sneaking around like the invisible
Like the invisible man
Like the invisible man
Like the invisible man
Like the invisible man
Like I'm invisible
Going once, going twice, three times, fuck this I'm gone
