Wake up,
My baby still looks amazing with no makeup
Dammit, I knew the second that you came up
From undernearth the covers, said
I wanna meet your mother, your daddy, your sister and your brother
One week, the time it took you to tell me you loved me
Packed all my shit and moved across the country
And now we buying diamonds saying,
It's only 20 karots, can't be that hard to find it, baby


Your touch has made me a believer
Your love, is all I ever needed
And she is the only one I thought of for eternity
She's got me running round and round

She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
She says honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me running round and round.
She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
She says honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me running round and round

Long sunsets,
Can't imagine that you ain't having fun yet
Baby just wait because I ain't drunk yet
As soon as I looked over
There ain't no way to sugar coat it,
You were busy motorboating on that blonde girl
Keep up with what you're doing,
Ain't nothing wrong girl
Looks like we got another, come along girl.
If you ain't afraid to try it
You know we'll be flying private
As long as I can be the pilot, baby

Your touch has made me a believer
Your love, is all I ever needed
And she is the only one I thought of for eternity
She's got me running round and round

She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
She says honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me running round and round.
She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
She says honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me running round and round

(Flo Rida)
Flo Rida girl, you got me runnin' round
What a perfect misses, momma she still eat McDonald's
Taste delicious scream Madonna knock this swiss so I guess she did it
What my kisses, what my pictures
Hoping she pops back pays a visit
To my baby yeah, my baby girl
Run around town on a treadmill
I ain't going nowhere, no wonder where
That's what she wear
Gotta playmate when I join the party
She was supposed to be in a queue here
Birthday cake, wanna grant my wishes
Every day I'm losing my breath
Can't replace that face, that waist
I'd chase this girl to Belvidere

She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
She says honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me running round and round.
She tastes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
She says honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me running round and round

Oh oh, oh oh...
She's got me running round and round
Oh oh, oh oh...
She's got me running round and round
