I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so


I just woke up from a dream today
Time gone by but you still look the same
Felt so real to have you back with me
It's just too bad it's just another dream
Give me just one wish

If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you
That I

I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do...
God knows I do
I miss you so, so, I do...
I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do

After dark, laughin' in the rain
Silver heart locket on a chain
Well pictures fade and silver turns to grey
But the best of thieves couldn't take my love away
Give me just one wish...

If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
Trade it in for one more moment
Tell you what I never told ya
All the things I left unsaid
I meant to say before you left
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you

I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do...
God knows I do
I miss you so, so, I do...
I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do

If there was some way, you know I would
I'd do it today, I wish I could
I call out your name, it does no good
I wish I knew what would

I... I miss you so much
God knows I do
I wish my wish was enough
Give me just one wish
