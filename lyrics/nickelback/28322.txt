My hopes just fell, and I can't see
The reason why, why there is blood on my sleeve
And all this time, I thought it mine
But it's not, it's yours and


It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you
This life you lead, like swimming in a shiny ballroom
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow

And I don't see too well, don't sing too well
And I settle to scream
Just grab your shit, and leave with it
They won't make no statues of you

It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you
This life you lead, like swimming in a shiny ballroom
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow
This label "theif", find a better title suited for you
This tidal wave, is coming down upon you

This time I've forgotten
I swear this shit was rotten
This time, I believe it
Cause I've seen the shit you're needin

It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you
This life you lead, like swimming in a shiny ballroom
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow
This label "theif", find a better title suited for you
This tidal wave, is coming down upon you
