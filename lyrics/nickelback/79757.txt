Manhunt to find your daughter
Buried underneath the water
Now they consult a psychic
Find how much I like it
And now I've found a little friendAnd now it's just you and me
Borrow one and we will make three
I say we steal one more
Just like we did once beforeAnd now I've found a little friend
It's too fast
This won't last
And to touch
Hurts too much
And now I've found a little friendAnd now I thought I told her
That she won't get much older
And now I've found a little friendAnd now it makes no difference
Cause I am not quite in yet
And now its on the table
Cause she's perfectly able
And now I've found a little friend
