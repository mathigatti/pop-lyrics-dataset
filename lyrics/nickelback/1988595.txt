She's got a dirty mouth, it tasted so clean with every taste of me
You know that every single thing she does
She does for me, because it's what I'm dreaming of


And she likes to take her time
More then fortunate, form of torture
And she likes to touch and tease
It's always fun for me, it's always unbelievable

You and me, sitting in a tree
F-U-C-K-I-N-G

She'll do any naughty thing I want
My baby, she's up for anything I wanna do
She's a giver and it gets her off
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do

If it was on tv, or ever in a magazine
She could take the fantasy and make it a reality
She delivers every dirty thought
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do

And she knows every spot
Exactly where it's at, and she could draw a map
But tell you her song is like a weapon
And she's always threatening to be the death to me

You and me, sitting in a tree
F-U-C-K-I-N-G

She'll do any naughty thing I want
My baby, she's up for anything I wanna do
She's a giver and it gets her off
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do

If it was on tv, or ever in a magazine
She could take the fantasy and make it a reality
She delivers every dirty thought
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do

So, what you wanna do?
So, what you wanna do?
And me, I'll repay the favor with your favorite thing you love to do
So, what you wanna do?
So, what you wanna do?
I'm about to take it up a notch, so what what I'm about to do

You and me, sitting in a tree
F-U-C-K-I-N-G

She'll do any naughty thing I want
My baby, she's up for anything I wanna do
She's a giver and it gets her off
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do

If it was on tv, or ever in a magazine
She could take the fantasy and make it a reality
She delivers every dirty thought
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do

Everything you want, anything at all, everything you want
Everything I wanna do
Everything you want, anything at all, everything you want
Everything I wanna do
