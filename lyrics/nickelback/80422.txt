Crowds of screaming superstars
When bouncers show their battle scars
I've been the first to sign on everyone
Down the road and round the bend
We pray to god it never ends
I've been to see you scream to everyone


We'll see you at the show
If you don't come, we'll never know
You stand off in the back
You still stand out while you're wearing black
Jump onto the bus
And ride around along us
We'll go out on the town
And light it up 'til we burn it down
Burn it down

After hours of alcohol
Every club, we've seen 'em all
As long as we don't need to stand in line
Proudest scenes and bimbo dreams
The ladies love those limousines
We know we're gonna off every time

We'll see you at the show
If you don't come, we'll never know
You stand off in the back
You still stand out while you're wearing black
Jump onto the bus
And ride around along us
We'll go out on the town
And light it up 'til we burn it down
Burn it down

Jump onto the bus
And ride around along us
We'll go out on the town
And light it up, 'til we burn it down
Burn it down
And light it up, 'til we burn it down
Burn it down
And light it up, 'til we burn it down
Burn it down
And light it up, 'til we burn it down
Burn it down
