Lost it on the Chesterfield
Or maybe on a gambling wheel
Lost it in a diamond mind
It's dark as hell and hard to find


Well, you can climb to the top of the highest tree
You can look around but you still won't see
What I'm looking for

Where the good times gone?
Where the good times gone?
All that stupid fun
And all that shit we've done
Where the good times gone?
Well, I still don't know

Out in the back in the old corn field
Underneath the tractor wheel
Thought I'd dig till I found it first
Broke my back and died of thirst

Well, you can bribe the devil
You can pray to God
You can sell off everything you've got
And you still won't know

Where the good times gone?
Where the good times gone?
All that stupid fun
And all that shit we've done
Where the good times gone?
Well, I still don't know

Saw it on the silver screen
Preacher says: Don't know what it means
Last page ad in a comic book
Bought me a map, told me where to look

It ain't carved of stone or made of wood
And if you pay for it then it ain't no good
And you still won't know
What I'm looking for

Where the good times gone?
Where the good times gone?
All that stupid fun
And all that shit we've done
Where the good times gone?
Well, I still don't know
