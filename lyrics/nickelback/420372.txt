Guardian angel I
sail away on an ocean
with you by my side.
Orange clouds roll by
they burn into your image
and your still alive


 look at you looking at me
Feels like a feeling meant to be
And as your body moves with mine
It's like I'm lifted out of time

And time again
Patiently I've waited
For this moment to arrive
