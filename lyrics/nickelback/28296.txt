Two men started walking
Started talking bout better days
One says to the other
He'd do it all again
Seems I knew I would


And now I found it
Found I adored it
I didn't want this
Can somebody help me see?
And now I feel it
Feel that I've been there
I didn't need this
Can somebody help me breathe?

Here we are again
Just face to (face)ing
Each other another day
Who wins
Well who cares
It always ends up the same
Seems I knew I would

And now I found it
Found I adored it
I didn't want this
Can somebody help me see?
And now I feel it
Feel that I've been there
I didn't need this
Would somebody help me stand?
And now I've told him
Already warned them
I didn't want this
Can somebody help me breathe?

If I was them
Then I wanna be
What I see
If I could pack my life in a moment
I wanna know do you want me to go?
Gonna give my life never ending
Never stop myself from pretending
That you always knew that I never could

All I ever really wanted was to be the same
Equal treatment never ever comes and here we go again
All I ever really wanted was to be like you
So perfect
So worthless
If i could take it all back think again
I would

And now I found it
Found I adored it
I didn't want this
Can somebody help me see?
And now I feel it
Feel that I've been there
I didn't need this
Would somebody help me stand?
And now I've told him
I didn't want this
I didn't need this
Can somebody help me breathe?
