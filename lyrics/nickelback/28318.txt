He's drunk again, it's time to fight
She must have done something wrong tonight
The living room becomes a boxing ring
It's time to run when you see him clenching his hands,
She's just a woman... Never again


I hear her scream from down the hall
Amazing she can even talk at all,
She cries to me: "go back to bed"
I'm terrified that she'll wind up dead in his hands,
She's just a woman... Never again

Been there before but not like this
Seen it before but not like this
Never before have I seen it this bad
She's just a woman... Never again

Just tell the nurse you slipped and fell
It starts to sting as it starts to swell
She looks at you... she wants the truth
It's right out there in the waiting room with those hands
Lookin' just as sweet as he can... Never again

Seen it before but not like this
Been there before but not like this
Never before have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman... Never again

Father's a name you haven't earned yet
You're just a child with a temper
Haven't you heard: "don't hit a lady"
Kickin' your ass would be a pleasure

He's drunk again, it's time to fight
Same old shit just, just on a different night
She grabs the gun, she's had enough
Tonight she'll find out how fuckin tough is this man
Pulls the trigger fast as she can... Never again

Seen it before but not like this
Been there before but not like this
Never before have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman... Never again
