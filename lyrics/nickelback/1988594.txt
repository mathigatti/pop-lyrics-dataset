And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I'll hold on and hold on


I keep listening to my chest
For a beat but there's nothing left
It's been a week since I've seen you
And I still can't believe it
Cause I'm dying inside alone
And everyday we gotta be apart
I'm like a baby with a broken heart
But the second that I'll see you
You will know how much I need you
Because I'll never be letting you go
(Now you know that)

I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You don't wanna keep going without
If I ain't holding onto you
Then I'll be holding out forever
I've got you now and
I'm not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
Cause every moment I'm with you
Is like I'm holding on to heaven

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I'll hold on and hold on

And if I can write a symphony
Baby you would be my melody
And you would flow like a river
Slowly going on forever
Like a feather that's blowing away
Like every woman needs a fairytale
Like every mother's love that never fails
Like every game that needs a player
And a sinner needs a savior
I'm appealing you willing to said
(Now you know that)

I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You don't wanna keep going without
If I ain't holding onto you
Then I'll be holding out forever
I've got you now and
I'm not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
Cause every moment I'm with you
Is like I'm holding on to heaven

And I'm willing to wait
Just to see another day
What I'm waiting for
Will wash this pain away
And it's never too late

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I'll hold on and hold on
Now you know that

I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You don't wanna keep going without
If I ain't holding onto you
Then I'll be holding out forever
I've got you now and
I'm not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
Cause every moment I'm with you
Is like I'm holding on to heaven

And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
Cause every moment I'm with you
It's like I'm holding on to heaven
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
Cause every moment I'm with you
It's like I'm holding on to heaven
