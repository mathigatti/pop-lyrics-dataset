Well i start just broke
Of a line in your tasteless joke
What's up with that hutch you've stolen
Don't worry 'cause it's not broken, it's just swollen
Could anticipate
How you're feeling from day to day
Well about you now, that's your needing
Don't worry 'cause they're laughing, and you're bleeding


Well i'm drowning your ocean
It's much cooler in slow motion

Don't care where you've went
When it's obvious that you bore
I'm not worried 'cause it's five minutes to your glory

Well i'm drowning your ocean
It's much cooler in slow motion

Leave it up to me and i will
Be the one here to see that you stand still
Everyone sees your eyes getting wider
Everyone here believes you're a liar

Well i start just broke
Of a line in your tasteless joke
Right after you've a punched a hole in
Don't worry 'cause it's not broken, it's just swollen
Could anticipate
How you're feeling from day to day
Since it's obvious that you bore me
I i'm not worried 'cause it's five minutes to your glory

Leave it up to me and i will
Be the one here to see that you stand still
Everyone sees your eyes getting wider
Everyone here believes you're a liar, you're a liar
