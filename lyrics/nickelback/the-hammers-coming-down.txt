Where will you be when the sky comes down?
And what would you do if the strength was found?
Stand right beside me when the ground starts shaking
The only sound you'll hear is the breath we're taking
If there is one thing I can promise you
We'll see the light again


This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the ripped-sky-morning
Without warning now
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming

Once it's started, there's no turning back
And I'll be with you when the sun turns black
'Cause finding faith will always be the hardest
While you're standing in the heart of darkness
If there is one thing I can promise you
We'll see the light again

This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the ripped-sky-morning
Without warning now
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming

Hold it on
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold it on
If we can find the light
We can make our way back home
Hold it on,
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold it on
If we can find the light
We'll find the light, come on

Hold on
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold on
If we can find the light
We can make our way back home
Hold on
We'll make it 'til the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold it on
If we can find the light
We'll find the light, come on

(If we can find the light)
This is the calm before the coming storm
(If we can find the light)
This is the fight that we've been waiting for
Hold on
We'll make it till the dawn
It'll be here before long
Hold it on
If we can find the light
We'll find the light, come on
