Climb into the ring
For a battle that you can't win
Swing as hard as you can swing
It will still mean nothing
Should've seen it coming
It had to happen sometime
But you went and brought a knife
To an all out gun fight


And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

You've gone too far
(Get up, get up)
Who you think you are
(Get up so we can finish this)
Is this what you came for
(Get up, get up)
Well this means war

Say anything you want
But talk will get you nowhere
The only thing you brought was psychological warfare
There's no getting out
And now you gotta wonder
Who will dig you out when you're six feet under

And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

You've gone too far
(Get up, get up)
Who you think you are
(Get up so we can finish this)
Is this what you came for
(Get up, get up)
Well, this means war

And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave

You've gone too far
(Get up, get up)
Who you think you are
(Get up so we can finish this)
Is this what you came for
(Get up, get up)
Well, this means war

Well, this means war
