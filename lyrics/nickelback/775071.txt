I was wrong to think that I could ever trust in you, 
I was wrong to think that you might want to trust me, too. 
Here I am, here I am, 
Here I stand, 
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I stand. 


I was wrong to think that I could ever love in you, 
I was wrong to think that you might want to love me, too. 

Here I am, here I am, 
Here I stand, 
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I stand. 

So where the hell are you? 
So where the hell are you? 
So where are you when I need someone, too?
