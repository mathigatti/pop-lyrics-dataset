One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day


There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off

Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no give in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win

They tell us everything's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night
When something's clearly wrong

When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same

Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no give in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win

The right thing to guide us
Is right here, inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is leading on
But just like a heartbeat
The drumbeat carries on

And the drumbeat carries on
(Just like a heartbeat)

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
There's no give in
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win
