I'm through with standing in line
To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never going to win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be


(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom
I can play baseball in
And a king size tub
Big enough for ten plus me

(So tell me what you need)

I'll need a credit card
That's got no limit
And a big black jet
With a bedroom in it
Going to join the Mile High Club
At thirty-seven thousand feet

(Been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus
Full of old guitars
My own star
On Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean
Is fine for me

(So how you going to do it?)

I'm going to trade this life
For fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair
And change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be
Big rock-stars
And live in hilltop houses
Driving fifteen cars

The girls come easy
And the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny
'Cause we just won't eat

And we'll, hang out
In the coolest bars
In the V.I.P.
With the movie stars

Every good gold digger's
Going to wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair

And well
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis
Without the tassels
Hire eight body guards
That love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free

(I'll have the quesadilla, ah ha)

I'm going to dress my ass
With the latest fashion
Get a front door key
To the Playboy mansion
Going to date a centerfold
That loves to blow my money for me

(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm going to trade this life
For fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair
And change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be
Big rock-stars
And live in hilltop houses
Driving fifteen cars

And the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny
'Cause we just won't eat

And we'll, hang out
In the coolest bars
In the V.I.P.
With the movie stars

Every good gold digger's
Going to wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair

And we'll, hide out
In the private rooms
With the latest dictionary
And today's Who's Who

They'll get you anything
With that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer
On speed dial

Well
Hey hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I'm going to sing those songs
That offend the censors
Going to pop my pills
From a Pez dispenser

I'll get washed-up singers
Writing all my songs
Lip sync them every night
So I don't get them wrong

Well we all just wanna be
Big rock-stars
And live in hilltop houses
Driving fifteen cars

The girls come easy
And the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny
'Cause we just won't eat

And we'll, hang out
In the coolest bars
In the V.I.P.

Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
