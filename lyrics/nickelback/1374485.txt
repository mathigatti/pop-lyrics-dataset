Time is going by
So much faster than I
And I'm starting to regret
Not spending all of it with you


Now I'm wondering why
I've kept this bottled inside
So I'm starting to regret
Not telling all of this to you
So if I haven't yet
I've gotta let you know

You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall
You're never gonna be alone
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone

And now as long as I can
I'm holding on with both hands
'Cause forever I believe
That there's nothing I could need but you
So if I haven't yet
I've gotta let you know

You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall
When all hope is gone
I know that you can carry on
We're gonna see the world out
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone

Oh!
You've gotta live every single day
Like it's the only one
What if tomorrow never comes?
Don't let it slip away
Could be our only one
You know it's only just begun
Every single day
Maybe our only one
What if tomorrow never comes?
Tomorrow never comes

Time is going by
So much faster than I
And I'm starting to regret
Not telling all of this to you

You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall
When all hope is gone
I know that you can carry on
We're gonna see the world out
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone

I'm gonna be there all of the way
I won't be missing one more day
I'm gonna be there all of the way
I won't be missing one more day
