His driver's licence said James
He went by Jim
A gangster wanna be and baby that was him
He stole his uncles 44 last friday night
Said if I wanted in
We'd have to plan this thing just right


We'll need the gloves, we'll need the bags, a couple masks
We'll need to steal a car with windows tinted black
We picked the nearest bank on main and 17th
We wrote down every line from every movie that we'd seen
Screamin'
This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We're here for all the shit that you don't need no more yeah
We want your cash open the safe get off your phone
Don't be a hero and you might just make it home

Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground

Get 'em up
Get 'em, get 'em up
The fresh restored Mustang small block 302
Drove past the bank a dozen times this afternoon
The only parking spot was half a block away
It gave us time to practice just exactly what to say

Screamin'
This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We're here for all the shit that you don't need no more yeah
We want your cash open the safe get off your phone
Don't be a hero and you might just make it home
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground

Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
Get 'em, get 'em up
Get 'em, get em up

The only thing I wish that one of us had known
That it was sunday and the God damn bank was closed
Too bad we didn't see the cops accross the street
We dropped our guns and tried to run
And there went all our dreams

Screamin'
This is a robbery now get down on the floor
We're here for all the shit that you don't need no more yeah
We wanted easy street and now we'll never know
Somebody call my mom and tell her I ain't comin home
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground

Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
