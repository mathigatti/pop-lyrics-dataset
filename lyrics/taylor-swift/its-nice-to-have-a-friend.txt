School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
Wanna hang out? Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents


It's nice to have a friend
It's nice to have a friend

Light pink sky up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
Twenty questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

It's nice to have a friend
It's nice to have a friend

Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you babe
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

It's nice to have a friend
It's nice to have a friend
It's nice to have a friend
It's nice to have a friend
