I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look, oh so easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me


I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly him all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it coming what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says: Don't throw away a good thing
But if he drops my name then I owe him nothing
And if he spends my change then he had it coming

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof
Their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
So light me up, light me up, light me up
Go ahead and light me up
Light me up, light me up, light me up, light me up

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good? (so good)
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, (good) good

Oh, you say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good?
It just felt so good, good
