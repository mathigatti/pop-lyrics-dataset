I wake up, I stretch out
I wonder what you're doing right now
Yeah, I slept in my make up again
Tell myself I must be crazy thinking about him


I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel outta my hair
About that time you called me
And I'm reminded without you I'd be

A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

I go to work, work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Walk to the car, dig out my keys
Start thinking about if you're with anyone but me

I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Just a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

There you are, on the street
Just standing there, all waiting on me
I, I show you my new shoes
You say you love 'em
Baby, without you I'd be

A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Just a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

I wake up, I stretch out
Wonder what you're doing right now
