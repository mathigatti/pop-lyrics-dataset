Guess mine is not 
The first heart broken 
My eyes are not 
The first to cry 
I'm not 
The first to know 
There's just 
No gettin' over you 
Hello 
I'm just a fool 
Who's willing 
To sit around 
And wait for you 
But baby can't you see 
There's nothin' else 
For me to do 
I'm hopelessly 
Devoted to you 


But now 
There's nowhere to hide 
Since you
Pushed my love aside 
I'm not in my head 
Hopelessly devoted to you 
Hopelessly devoted to you 
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying 
"Fool, forget him" 
My heart is saying 
"Don't let go" 
Hold on to the end 
That's what 
I intend to do 
I'm hopelessly 
Devoted to you 
But now 
There's nowhere to hide 
Since you 
Pushed my love aside 
I'm not in my head 
Hopelessly devoted to you 
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
