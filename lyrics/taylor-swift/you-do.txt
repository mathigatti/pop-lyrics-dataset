Here I am once again
In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving
I should go, but it's so
Entertaining watching you breathing


Well, you went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio
That you try to forget
But it sticks in your head

So goodbye, it's not goodnight
'Cause I'll be seeing you in my dreaming

Boy, you got me like a shock to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends and tell them all about you
Oh, it's looking like one of those times
When you're thinkin' 'bout a kiss 'till the morning light
You've got me, you do

In a daze, pull the shades
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
I relax, I go back
To all the things you said that only I know

Boy, you got me like a shock to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call all my friends and tell them all about you
Oh, it's looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout a kiss 'til the morning light
You've got me, you do

I run in out to my car
And I pull out the drive
It's only been ten minutes
But I have to see you one more time

'Cause you got me like a shock to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call all my friends and tell them all about you
And it's looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout a kiss 'till the morning light
You've got me, you do
You've got me, you do
