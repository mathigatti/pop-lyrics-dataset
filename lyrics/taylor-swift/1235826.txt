Bet you lie awake at night, trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find just what you want
A home-town number one or a cowboy and loaded gun
But you know you'll make it one, well that's what you thought
Here's what you got:


Chorus

I could be your favorite blue jeans with the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer.
I could be your little beauty queen, just a little out of reach,
Or the girl living next door.
I'll be your angel giving up her wings.
If that's what you need, I'd give everything to be your anything.
Be your anything

If you want hard to get, if you want ... (giggles)
All you have to do is let me know.
If you want a bumpy ride, or someone with a softer side
Either one'll be alright, just let me know.
Is this where we go?

I could be your favorite blue jeans with the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer.
I could be your little beauty queen, just a little out of reach,
Or the girl living next door.
I'll be your angel giving up her wings.
If that's what you need, I'd give everything to be your anything.

It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
But with someone like you, it's just so easy to do.

I could be your favorite blue jeans with the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer.
I could be your little beauty queen, just a little out of reach,
Or the girl living next door.
I'll be your angel giving up her wings.
If that's what you need, I'd give everything to be your anything. (2x)
