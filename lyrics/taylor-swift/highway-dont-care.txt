Bet your window's roll down and your hair's pulled back
And i bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
And you're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you're get where you're goin'
Trying to stat awake so i bet you turn on the radio
The song goes


I can't live without, i can't live without you, baby
I can't live without, i can't live without you, baby, baby

The highway won't hold you tonight,
The highway don't know you're alive,
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But i do, i do
The highway won't dry your tears,
The highway don't need you here,
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But i do, i do.

I bet you got a dead cell phone in the shot gun seat
Yeah, i bet you're bleeding god's ear
Talking about me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
You're trying not to think about turning around
Trying not to be lost in the sound
But that song is always on
So you sing along

I can't live without, i can't live without you, baby
I can't live without, i can't live without you, baby, baby

The highway won't hold you tonight,
The highway don't know you're alive,
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But i do, i do.
The highway won't dry your tears,
The highway don't need you here,
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But i do, i do.

I can't live without, i can't live without you, baby
I can't live without, i can't live without you, baby, baby

The highway don't care, the highway don't care, the highway don't care
But i do, i do

I can't live without, i can't live without you, baby
(highway don't care, highway don't care)
I can't live without, i can't live without you, baby, baby
(highway don't care, but i do, i do)
I can't live without, i can't live without you, baby
(highway don't care, highway don't care)
I can't live without, i can't live without you, baby, baby
(highway don't care, but i do, i do)

I can't live without, i can't live without you, baby
