Beneath the chandelier
Of star and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The window's open
The wind is blowing
And we're both not making a sound


It's like I'm melting all into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move

And tell me
You'll never leave me
That I'm not crazy
And that this is really happening
That this is really happening

Could this be better?
You write me letters
Though you see me everyday
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can't take my eyes off you

Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy
And that this is really happening
That this is really happening

All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes we thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh, baby, here we are

Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy
Oh, and that this is really happening
Oh, oh, baby

Tell me
You'll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And that this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening

Oh, love me
Need me
Tell me
Baby
Tell me
Oh, oh, oh
