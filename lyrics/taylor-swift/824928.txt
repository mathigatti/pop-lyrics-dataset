I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes


He'll never fall in love, he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him
I'd lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had it memorized for so long?

He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me
Wishing he was mine

I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him
I'd lie

He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
"I'm holding every breath for you"

He'd never tell you
But he can play guitar
I think he can see through
Everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is "my God, he's beautiful"
So I put on my make up
And pray for a miracle

Yes, I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him
If you ask me if I love him
I'd lie
