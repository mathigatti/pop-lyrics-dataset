Any day now 
They're talking war 
I can see the light 
That's in your eyes 
They're not talkin 
A week or two 
Oh, daddy 
Can I go with you? 
Oh, daddy 
Can I go with you? 


You pack a suitcase 
And take a picture 
From the wall 
I always knew 
This time would come 
When I ask how long 
You think 
You're gonna be 
You say 
"Eh, this crazy world's 
come undone" 

Summer's over 
And leaves begin 
To fall 
And another winter's 
On the way 
I knew 
I wasn't gonna take 
This very well 
But I'd give everything 
To have you here today 

Everyday now 
They're talking war 
I know 
This time has been 
Like it's never 
Been before 
We're not talking 
About a week or two 
Oh, daddy 
Can I go with you? 
Oh, daddy 
can I go with you? 
Oh, daddy 
Can I go with you?
