She's looking in the mirror
The moments getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Makeup fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk
School dance, first chance, always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy, sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her, 
She thinks about it


Blue dress angel face, looking in the mirror, 
Shoes, purse, hair tied back and you should see her, 
She's got her magic, floating through the air, 

Peace, Love, One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear

She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pullin' up soon
She thinks about it as she sees headlights
Looking out the window she's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date, can't wait
Lookin' in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's lookin' right at her
She thinks about it

Sixteen blue jeans Abercrombie t-shirt
Shoes purse hair tied back and you should see her
She's got her magic floating through the air

Peace, Love, One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by the small town lights
She got up again

Move out
Find out where the world can take her
Bright lights late nights livin' for the greater
Move to Paris livin' on a prayer

Peace, Love, One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear
Ooo Ooo
Wonderin' what to wear
