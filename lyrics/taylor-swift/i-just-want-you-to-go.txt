"Many feelings were saved for me
And all the time I've been asking you to stay
It was just bad luck
That separated us from living
While you were gay
I was sad


Our souls become mates
While we were away from each other
I wasted my time looking for you
I was here the whole time
I lost my life chasing you
No you want me

Now time is running out
And I'm stuck in a cage
And you do not come to my rescue
Now, I hope you're crying
For not coming up to me "

When I was here
You told me you were leaving
Stayed here crying alone
And you did not answer your phone

When I said I did not want to see you
You came running after me
And I did not want to see you
I threw myself against the wall

The sun is setting
And nothing from you in my way
Promises have been made
And now, I gather that you never loved me
All this time I was just pretending

The cold hours I spent
Until this moment with you
Now, I just want you to go
Burned my sky
And now she was alone

When I was here
You told me you were leaving
Stayed here crying alone
And you did not answer your phone

When I said I did not want to see you
You came running after me
And I did not want to see you
I threw myself against the wall

The sun is setting
And nothing from you in my way
Promises have been made
And now, I gather that you never loved me
All this time I was just pretending

The cold hours I spent
Until this moment with you
Now, I just want you to go
Burned my sky
And now she was alone

Now, I just want you to go
Now, I just want you to go
Now, I just want you to go
Now, I just want you to go

All the moments you made me believe
Nothing more than a simple lie
And made me lose my mind
And I was dead

Now, I just want you to go
Now, I just want you to go
Now, I just want you to go
Now, I just want you to go

I try to keep all my smile
Seeing her leaving
I was the authority
And we were in a war
When he saw me looking at my future

I learned a lot about life
Not everything we want, we can have
I played pretty hard
And now, I fell on the right path

Just do not let me cry
All those who heard voices in
There were only several lines
In our theater, ateamos fire

Now, I just want you to go
Now, I just want you to go
Now, I just want you to go
Now, I just want you to go
