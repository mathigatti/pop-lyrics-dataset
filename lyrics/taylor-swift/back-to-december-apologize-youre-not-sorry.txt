I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good; busier than ever
Small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Still burns in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die


So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying
I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time,
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
And I go back to December, turn around
And make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleepin?,
Stayin' up playing back myself leavin?,
When your birthday passed
And I didn't call, then I think about summer,
All the beautiful times,
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came,
With the dark days when the fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying
I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time,
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
And I go back to December, turn around
And change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile,
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms
That September night;
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
If we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door I understand

And you said it's too late to apologize (it's too late)
You said it's too late to apologize (it's too late)

Swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying
I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
And I go back to December, turn around
And change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

You say you're not sorry, no, no woah
You're not sorry, no, no woah
You're not sorry, no, no woah
You're not sorry, no, no woah
