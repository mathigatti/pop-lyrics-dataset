Ohh wooaah (3x)
Everybody's looking for love. Oh. Oh.
Ain't that the reason you're at this club. Oh. Oh.
You ain't gonna find a dance with him. No. Oh.
Got a better solution for you girl. Oh. Oh.
That you were Romeo
You were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said
Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go


And I said
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine mine
In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
In my head, you'll be screaming no.
In my head, its going down.
In my head, its going down.
In my head.
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Cause you were Romeo
I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said
Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go

And I Said
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine mine

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
In my head, you'll be screaming no.
In my head, its going down.
In my head, its going down.
In my head.
(Ludacris)
Luda!
When I was thirteen
I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came to between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh I starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks
She make my heart pound
I skip a beat when
I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna
See her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing
Cuz she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking
But I just keep on saying
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine, oh oh
In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
In my head, you'll be screaming no.
In my head, its going down.
In my head, its going down.
In my head.
Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you
And that's all I really know

I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress
It's a love story
Baby, just say yes

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Cause we were both young
When I first saw you
