Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye


It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you
Can I teach you all I know?
Can you show me what you do?
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner?
Or were you someone's best friend?
This here guitar

It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, I hear the beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and when we'll say goodbye

The cracks down the middle can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you
Can I teach you all I know?
Can you show me what you do?
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner?
Or were you someone's best friend?
This here guitar

Were you a present from a father to a son?
Did he forget you?
Or just play you 'till you came undone?
Hey, did some primadonna love you
'Till she got her fame and fortune?
I won't do that to you now

Nice to meet you
I can teach you all I know
You can show me what you do
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?
And I played you for endless hours
Never left you in the corner
You're my one and only friend

Now I know where life lessons are
This here guitar
You're my guitar
This here guitar
