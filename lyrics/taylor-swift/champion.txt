I never saw you as the same person
Always when you're closing the door
I can feel everything you felt
Was everything I should know


I held the door thinking in you
You were passing with your busy hands
Always when I wanted to see
It's what I can see now

Wasn't easy see you going away
He's everything I have now
Then you went and put me down
I saw your string lights shining in your eyes

It's okay, just stay free
Times won't be the same than before
You can dreaming every day with me
Just have your heart well open

And everybody is believing in you
You was the champion in lies
I couldn't have seen you then
I will be well afraid without you

I held the door thinking in you
You were passing with your busy hands
Always when I wanted to see
It's what I can see now

Wasn't easy see you going away
He's everything I have now
Then you went and put me down
I saw your string lights shining in your eyes

It's okay, just stay free
Times won't be the same than before
You can dreaming every day with me
Just have your heart well open

And everybody is believing in you
You was the champion in lies
I couldn't have seen you then
I will be well afraid without you

I held the door thinking in you
You were passing with your busy hands
Always when I wanted to see
It's what I can see now

Wasn't easy see you going away
He's everything I have now
Then you went and put me down
I saw your string lights shining in your eyes

It's okay, just stay free
Times won't be the same than before
You can dreaming every day with me
Just have your heart well open

And everybody is believing in you
You was the champion in lies
I couldn't have seen you then
I will be well afraid without you

Champion, oh, champion
