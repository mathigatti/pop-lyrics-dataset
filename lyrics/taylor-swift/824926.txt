You have a way
Of coming easily to me
And when you take
You take the very best of me


So I start a fight
'Cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want
'Cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls
And paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you
And washed them all away

And you come away
With a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer
With the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
If I died, died for you
Died for you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake
Is so condescending counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
