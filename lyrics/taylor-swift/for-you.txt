It would’ve been nice to see you coming
But that would’ve ruined the surprise
It would’ve been nice to have a picture-perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
It’s hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It’s nice to know you’re here and you’re helping me down
You were always there when I needed
You could always see me clearly and
You were never looking for a thing
You...I’m singing one for you
It would’ve been cool to never fall down
But then I never would’ve seen
That power isn’t with the picture-perfect person
You taught me better things comefrom in between
It’s hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It’s nice to know you’re here and you’re helping me down
You were always there when I needed
You could always see me clearly and
You were never looking for a thing
You...I’m singing one for you
It would’ve been nice to see you coming
But that would’ve ruined the surprise
It would’ve been nice to have a picture-perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
You were always there when I needed
You could always see me clearly and
You were never looking for a thing
You...I’m singing one for you
