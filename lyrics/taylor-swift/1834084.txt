One, two, three, four,
Before i know it, I'm out the door
Five, six, seven, eight,
Oh, why, did it?? wait?
Nine and ten,
I sure do regret, then
Chorus:
Oh wait!
For another chance
You need,
To take a risk
So hey,
Just wait! before it is too late,
Just take, a chance
So tell, me why,
It takes me time,
To wonder how,
How i got this far
But why, didn't??wait?
There was a chance, i needed to take!
Chorus:
Oh wait!
For another chance,
You need,


To take a little risk
So hey!
Just wait! before it? too late
Just take, a chance
Bridge:
So imagine, what it would be like,
If we never took risks,
Or we never had a chance
To
Live
La la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la, la la la la ohh oh
Chorus:
Oh wait!
For another chance
You need,
To take a risk
So hey,
Just wait! before it is too late,
Just take, a chance
Ohh oh
