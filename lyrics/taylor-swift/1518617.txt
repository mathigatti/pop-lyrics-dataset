I'm outta luck, outta love
Got a photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch


I see your face everytime I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild, so free, so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy
Oh, look what you've done to this rock and roll clown
Oh, look what you've done

[CHORUS]
I don't want your [photograph]
I don't need your [photograph]
All I've got is a [photograph]
But it's not enough

I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child

You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in a mystery
So wild, so free, so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy
Oh, look what you've done to this rock and roll clown
Oh, look what you've done

[CHORUS]
I don't want your [photograph]
I don't need your [photograph]
All I've got is a [photograph]
I don't want your..

[Ohh Ohh Oh Uh]
I'll be come back to you
I'm not alone
You're only one
