I’m waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and sweat my rust
I’m breathing in the chemicals
I’m breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse


Oh, oh
I’m waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age
To the new age
Welcome to the new age
To the new age

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I´m radioactive
I´m radioactive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive
I´m radioactive

I raise my flag, and dye my clothes
It’s a revolution, I suppose
We’re painted red to fit right in
Oh, oh
I’m breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Oh, oh

I’m waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age
To the new age
Welcome to the new age
To the new age

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive
I´m radioactive

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive
I´m radioactive
All systems go
The sun hasn’t died
Deep in my bones
Straight from inside

I’m waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age
To the new age
Welcome to the new age
To the new age

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive
Radioactive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive
Radioactive
