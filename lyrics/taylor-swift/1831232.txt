Tire swings, summer dreams
Honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle county creek
Laying in the green grass
I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn, struck bed
Everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet


You can get high on a first kiss
And you can get by on sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner, lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn
And come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Autumn rain, window pane
Looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter
My heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
'Cause I remember those times
I remember

You can get high on a first kiss
And you can get by on sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner, lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn
And come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

I saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say
Was: Hey, how have you been?
You caught me with that old smile
And said: It's really been a while
I still think about back when

We used to get high on the first kiss
And we could get by on sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner, lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn
And now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh, you
Oh, that's what I learned from you
