I need you more than I know how to mention
And I'd give forever to get your attention
Be your summer midnight, with starry blue eyes
That only see you and are yours every night


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love's like this

And that small town daydream lasted all night
Cussing out all those bright city lights
Just look at you, look at me
Heaven look down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

All of the days that I couldn't get it right
It all disappeared lying here by your side
With your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile
You make it look easy changing my life

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love's like this

Small town daydream lasted all night
Cussing out all those bright city lights
Just look at you, look at me
Heaven look down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

Haven't had quite the time
To figure this life out
But, baby, I've got mine
To give you everything you dream about

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love's like this
And it's something I don't miss anymore
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love's like this

And that small town daydream lasted all night
Cussing out all those bright city lights
Just look at you, look at me
Heaven look down to see
We're falling now, yeah

That small town daydream lasted all night
Cussing out all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven look down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

Just two kids making up for lost love
