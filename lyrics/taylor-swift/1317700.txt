Sometimes I wonder
How its gonna feel
Will my first love
Be true and real
Will I be ready when
My heart starts to fall
What will I do
When my love comes to call


And my daddy tells me
That I light up his world
Everyday he says
"Darlin
You're my best girl"
He tried to teach me
From the very start
The meaning of love
So nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come
In a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled
With hope and desire?
Will my love come
In the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy?
Am I ready for love?
For love

I know I'm not a little
Girl anymore
Cuz I'm feeling things
I've never felt before
Sweet sensations
And anticipations
Calling commotion
To my emotions

And I hear the words
My daddy says to me
He said
"Be true to yourself
And keep your spirit free
And love will find you
One way or another
Be good to yourself
And be good to each other"

Will my love come
In a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled
With hope and desire?
Will my love come
In the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy?
Am I ready for love?

Its a run around the world
And its moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love thats gonna last
A love so strong
That it can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

Will my love come
In a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled
With hope and desire?
Will my love come
In the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy?
Am I ready for this game?
Am I ready for the kiss?
Am i ready for the stars?
Am I ready for the bliss?
Am I ready for love?
