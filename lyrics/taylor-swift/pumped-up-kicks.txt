All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet


Ellen works the long day
Giving weird interviews
And a slick cool sweater
And it gets kind of weird
Calling us like a boyfriend and girlfriend
But it's not we're just sitting here
And we got cat videos
And dance on Betty White and stuff
And it's always gonna get weird
And this song is all about Ellen

And every single time
I come on this show
Is really weird, really weird
All because of Ellen
Every single time
I come on this show
Is really weird, really weird
Always end up dancing

I've been on this show
Eight times now
And I still remember
Ellen hiding on a bathroom
With a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad
And I fel and I could die
She always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show
And I don't even know why
But it gets 5 million hits on YouTube
Cause

Every single time
I come on this show
Is really weird, really weird
All because of Ellen
Every single time
I come on this show
Is really weird, really weird
Always end up dancing
