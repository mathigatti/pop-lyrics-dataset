There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I want to ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah


We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So baby, drive slow
'Till we run out of road
In this one-horse town
I want to stay right here
In this passenger seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way, but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's a first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
