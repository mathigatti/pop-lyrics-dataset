You make me want to take you out and let it rain (Let it rain [3x])
I know you got a girl but this is what you should say


Why don't you tell her that I'm leavin' never to come back again
You found somebody who does it better than she can
No more making you cry, no more gray skies
Boy we're drivin on the G5 G5

And we're leavin' never to come back again
So call your shawty and tell her that you're my man
The one that's so so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, night, night

Oh oh oh (repeat)
Oh oh oh oh (repeat)

Now if I talk it boy, you know that I'm'ma walk it out (Walk it out [3x])
Man I'll put my money (Money) where my mouth is (Mouth is [3x])
Cause you the baddest little thing that I've ever seen (Ever seen [3x])
So I'm ask you one time if you got a girl

Why don't you tell her that I'm leavin' never to come back again
You found somebody who does it better than she can
No more making you cry, no more gray skies
Girl we're flyin on the G5 G5

And we're leavin' never to come back again
So call your shawty and tell her that you're my man
The one that's so so fly
