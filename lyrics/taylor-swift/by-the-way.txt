I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holdin her hand
I’d have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We’ll pick up where we left off


And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I’ll say the chances of that
Are getting slim
And by the way
My heart's still breaking
It’s going take it a while
To love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

I should’ve let you know
All the way’s you made me feel alive
I guess it’s too late
So I’ll just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you’ll drop what you’re doing
And come over here and say
I’m looking good

And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I’ll say the chances of that
Are getting slim
And by the way
My heart's still breaking
It’s going take it a while
To love again
So many things that I forgot to say

By the way
You still look amazing
And I must have been crazy
To let you get away
By the way
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number
Just in case
I still miss you
And I still love you
By the way
By the way oh
