If there's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it


'Cause I swear out there ain't where
You ought to be
So catch a ride or catch a cab
Don't you know I miss you bad?
But don't you walk to me

Baby, run
Cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So, baby, run
So, baby, run

Oh, if you ain't got a suitcase, get a box
Or an old brown paper sack
And pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby, just come back

There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it?
Don't let that speed limit slow ya down
Go on and break it
Baby, break it

And run
Cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So, baby, run

Run to me
Baby, run
Run to me
So, baby, run
Oh, run
Oh, baby, run
