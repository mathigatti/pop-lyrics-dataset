Well, she was an American girl,
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more life
Somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die
Tryin', she
Had one little promise she was gonna keep


Oh yeah,oh alright,
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night
She was... an American girl.

Well, it was kind of cold that night,
She stood alone on the balcony
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by,
Out on four forty one like
Waves crashing on the beach,
And for one des'rate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful when something that's so close
Is still so far out of reach 

Oh yeah,oh alright,
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl.

Oholl...oholl...OoOoo....

Oh yeah,oh alright,
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night

Oh yeah,oh alright,
Take it easy, baby
Oh,Take it easy,now,now...

Oh yeah,oh alright,there worlds...
American Girl
