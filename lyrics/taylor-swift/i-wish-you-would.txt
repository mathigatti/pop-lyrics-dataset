It's 2 AM, in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

It's 2 am, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love, in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I-I-I-I-I, I wish, I wish, I
I-I-I-I-I, I wish, I wish, I
I-I-I-I-I, I wish, I wish, I

You always knew how to push my buttons
You gave me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

2 am, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love, in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You gave me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I-I-I-I-I, I wish, I wish, I
I-I-I-I-I, I wish, I wish, I
I wish you would
