There's a little girl 
in this little town
with a little too much heart 
to go around
Live forever, 
never say never
You can do better, 
that's what she says


Mama named her Lucky 
on a starlight night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, 
she dances in spite of
The fact that she's different 
and yet she's the same
And she says do do do do do do 
do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do
Lucky you, lucky you
Do do do do do do do do

She sings her little songs
She walks a long a little
Halfway headed for the skies
Left to travel, 
lives they unravel
Mind over matter, 
that's what she says

Mama named her Lucky 
on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, 
she dances in spite of
The fact that she's different 
and yet she's the same
And she says do do do do 
do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do do do do
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you
do do do do do do do do do 
do do do do do do do do do do do

Maybe she'll sing you do do do
Maybe she'll bring you 
into the skies
Honey, she'll love you
Funny how some view
 angels above you, 
aint so far away.

Mama named her Lucky 
on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, 
she dances in spite of
The fact that she's different 
and yet she's the same
And she says do do do do 
do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do do do
Lucky you, lucky you
