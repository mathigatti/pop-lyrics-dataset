Let me know how's it feel
To be under my skin
Wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you


So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me
Like I need you?
Why are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy
That's what you destroyed
Stupid boy

I have been, looking in
Trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt
Every single time
But didn't you waltz right by
I'm screamin' out inside

Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me
Like I need you?
Why are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy
That's what you destroyed
Stupid boy

What happens when you wake up
And see what you've lost
Take one look at me cause
That's what it cost
I was gonna be everything you need
Cause you are everything to me

So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me
Like I need you?
Why are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy
That's what you destroyed
Stupid boy

Let me know how's it feel
To be under my skin
