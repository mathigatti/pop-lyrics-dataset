I want it all
To appear before my eyes when he smiles
Maybe I'm wrong
But I don''t think Romeo would be my kind of guy


I want a love that's sweeter than roses
And for me this is how it's gonna be like

There's a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere as we dance
In the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

Here on the couch
With a box of chocolates that I bought myself
I'll wait it out
But sometimes my patience just needs a little help

It's what you get when your heart strings are so tied
I don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect like

There's a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere as we dance
In the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

I want my own little storybook ending
We'll make it up as we go

There's a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere as we dance
In the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet
I want love they haven't thought of yet
