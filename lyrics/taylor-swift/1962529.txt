I like my music loud, I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little bigger than the rest
So I can see


Don't try me
Don't fight me
You'll be you and I'll be me

They say I've always known what I wanted
My friends and enemies will tell you it's true
You will find out I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

Your mom and daddy's walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into

Don't sorry
Don't worry
I'm sure there are so many girls
Who'll love you like you do

And they say I've always known what I wanted
My friends and enemies will tell you it's true
You will find out I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you
And it ain't you oh

Oh, baby
Don't persuade me
I know that you ain't used to no
So let me say it real slow

They say I've always known what I wanted
It's true
My friends and enemies will tell you it's true
And you'll find out I always get it
I get what I want and

They say I've always known what I wanted
My friends and enemies will tell you it's true
And you'll will find out I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you
