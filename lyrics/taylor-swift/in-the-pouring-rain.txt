I loved you for a little, a little while
I think you know that
It woulda worked for a little
Except for that thing you did


It's not like you to be here
When you said you won't

But in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules
It's not like me to forgive someone quickly
Except in the pouring rain

It kills me to say this, it really does
It kills my heart
But I might still love you
Or is it me just falling apart?

But it's not like me to end something
Then change my mind

But in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the rules
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules
And it's not like me to forgive someone quickly
Except in the pouring rain

Oh, am I winning by losing?
All I told myself, I would be losing

But in the pouring rain
Can you feel my pain?
My teardrops falling down from the sky
In the pouring rain
I can feel myself
By wondering who you love tonight

In the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
Oh, in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed my mind
