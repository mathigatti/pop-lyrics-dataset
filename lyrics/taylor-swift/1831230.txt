What do you say
When you just know
That he's the one
And you wanna go fast but he's taking it slow?
And what do you do
When he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy?
Well, here's something you can try


Hey, hey, what do you say?
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm and beautiful day
And I feel like I could talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright, it feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it'll be a sweet memory for you and me someday-ay-ay
Hey, what do you say?

What do you see
When you look in his eyes
There's something there
That he can't disguise, no matter how he tries?
And what do you feel
When you know it's real
And you can't sit still?
If you don't then I will, yeah

Hey, hey, what do you say?
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm and beautiful day
And I feel like I could talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright, it feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it'll be a sweet memory for you and me someday-ay-ay
Hey, what do you say?

My imagination's
Running away, just
Dreaming about what
I want you to say

Hey, hey, what do you say?
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm and beautiful day
And I feel like I could talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright, it feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it'll be a sweet memory for you and me someday-ay-ay
Hey, what do you say?

What do you say?
