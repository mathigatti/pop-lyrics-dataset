7 years and 50 days, the time is passing by
Nothing in this world can be as nice as you and I
And how could we break up like this?
And how could we be wrong?
So many years, so many days and I still sing my song


Now I run to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream

I return to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream '€¦ Of you

7 years and 50 days, now just look at me
Am I the girl I use to be
So damn what do you see?
And how could we break up like this?
And how could we be wrong?
So many years, so many days and I still sing my song

Now I run to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream

I return to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream '€¦ Of you
