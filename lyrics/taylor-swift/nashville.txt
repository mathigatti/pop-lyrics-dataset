On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's not quite London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian island
Or a second chance


Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you've got to run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Rolling through a valley
Watching all my life go by

You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the driver's side
And I know I hurt you
But i can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress?

Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you've got to run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing through a mountain
Watching all my life go by

Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use in wondering why?
Maybe i'm a storm front
Going through a valley
Tearing up a good July

And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard?
To realign a star for you
Change a southern night for you

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you've got to run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Rolling though a valley
Tearing up a good July

I'm going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use in wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Rolling through the valley
Tearing up a good July

Going back to Nashville

I'm going back to Nashville

Going back to Naaaaahh....

Going back to Nashville
What's the use in wondering why?
