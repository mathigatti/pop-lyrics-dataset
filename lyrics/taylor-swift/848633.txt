It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong


You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word 'bout what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby
And you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And, baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word 'bout what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby
And you might still have me

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No, no, no, no, no, no

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word 'bout what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby
And you might still have me
