You say you've turned it off
Hid your heart up on a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it off for someone else
'Cause lovin him you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby can't you see 
that he's not me and...


I need you to know 
you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, 
staying strong
Come and fall into me

I'll follow any road 
anywhere to get to you
I'll open up my soul
If that's what you 
need me to do
But now baby 
it's your move
All you've got to do

Is believe in love, 
just believe in us now.

I need you to know 
you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, 
staying strong
Come and fall into me

Just believe in love
Just believe in us
Baby....

I need you to know 
you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, 
staying strong
Come and fall into me

Come and fall into me
Baby fall into me
