He said "i got me a nice new apartment in the city"
Wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with the broken heart you left me with
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back


"missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here today and here tomorrow
In dark blue tennessee"

He was lying when he said he'd moved to la
He's just hiding now on the other side of town
With his head in his hand, and she's just seven miles away
She's staring at the window and puts her picture down
Saying

"missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here today and here tomorrow
In dark blue tennessee"

She almost called him on the night that he rode
Three simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
And i'll be here today and here tomorrow
In dark blue tennessee
In dark blue tennessee
