This is wrong, but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right, baby
Misty morning comes again and I can't help
But wish I could see your face


And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
And you smile, that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight
Tell me things like
"I can't take my eyes off of you"
I am no one special
Just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

Morning loneliness comes around
When I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town

And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
And you smile, that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight
Tell me things like
"I can't take my eyes off of you"
I am no one special
Just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight
Tell me things like
"I can't take my eyes off of you"
I am no one special
Just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar
