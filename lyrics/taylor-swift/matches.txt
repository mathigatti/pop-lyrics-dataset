I shined your shoes, I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time
I patched your fake smile against your friends
Which apparently is a crime


I gave you space, you took my place
And gave it to her
But life's too long to waste it all
Loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

I keyed her car, got my guitar
And wrote this damn song
Look what you've found, she's been around
I hear the lines long

And don't you tell me to be nice
I'm not a nice girl
She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

Ain't it funny? You said, "Honey"
You meant, "Sitting duck" "
Well I say, "Cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver"
Just a few I've thought of

And when love hands me matches now
Gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
Oh, yeah, gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down
Matches, now
