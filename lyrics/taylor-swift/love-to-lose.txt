Come on, gather 'round
I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience
I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever
But it's too bad you didn't see
That to me
You were the perfect view of misery


I never talk about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights
Or the endless fight
I never told you about the days he called
There was something wrong
It was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame
What a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Let's talk about that golden boy
That I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know
That he was just as cold inside
He smiled and I smiled
For the cameras in your mind
And I lied
I swore that everything was fine

I never talk about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights
Or the endless fight
I never told you about the days he called
There was something wrong
It was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame
What a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

I never talk about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights
Or the endless fight
I never told you about the days he called
There was something wrong
It was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame
What a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Come on, gather 'round
I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
