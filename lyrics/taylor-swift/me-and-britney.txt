Me and britney used to sip on the front porch
Drinking lemonade
Talk about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In a summer shade
She said she was gonna be a moviestar
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and britney


Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
Me and britney

She never made it to hollywood
But she made it to Memphis
This little old town just hasn’t been the same since
That boy she went out with, well I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous it would come between me and britney

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
She was always so much braver than me
When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said I’m sorry for waking you up but I didn’t know who else to call
Or where else to go

Me and britney sat down on the front porch
Talking ‘bout love and how it changes things
Changes people and changes names everything but me and britney
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
We’re not as young, but we’re still beautiful and free

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Even when we’re old, we’re still gonna be me and britney
Sittin’ on the front porch
Drinking lemonade
Talking ‘bout things no one else was ever gonna hear
In a summer shade
