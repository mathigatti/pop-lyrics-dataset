This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing 'round all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


He said: "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city
Away from the crowds"
I thought: "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sun set, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah
Wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah

I said: "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair
His clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is…

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sun set, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah
Wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah

Ooh, this night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sun set, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sun set, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just prentend, just pretend
Wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah
Wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah

Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah
Even if it's just pretend
Wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah

Ooh, this night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go

In your wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah
Wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah
In your wildest dreams - ah, ah, ah, ah
