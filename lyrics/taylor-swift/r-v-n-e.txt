I could've keyed your car
I could've rolled your yard
I know the passwords to your e-mails
Everything you do
I could've put them to good use


But I'm dressed to kill
And tonight I'm going out on a date
With your best friend
He always liked me anyway

R-E-V-E-N-G-E
My list of things to do this week
Jealously and misery
Gonna give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you sorry
I hope you cry, I'm getting my
R-E-V-E-N-G-E

So I'm gonna paint the town with him
Replace your memory
Everywhere we've ever been
I don't hang out at smoky bars
But I know we'll see you there
And I'll make you hear me laughing
Like I just don't care

I know you hate my friends
So tonight I called them all
And later on you can expect
Some prank phone calls, baby

R-E-V-E-N-G-E
My list of things to do this week
Jealously and misery
And I'll give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you sorry
I hope you cry, I'm getting my
R-E-V-E-N-G-E

S-A-N-I-T-Y
I hope you lose yours tonight
You made me crazy too long
And so I'm working on

R-E-V-E-N-G-E
My list of things to do this week
Jealously and misery
And I'll give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you sorry
I hope you cry, I'm getting my
R-E-V-E-N-G-E

Baby, baby
R-E-V-E-N-G-E
And I'll give you what you gave to me
