[Taylor Swift:]
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me


And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] I told you I was, I was) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

[Sammy Adams:]
Double platinum wherever she go
South of France to Reno
Met her out in Vegas
Went in on casino
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad, bad things
If you into it
Don't need to get intimate...just yet
Slow down, I know that
You thinking you and me...just met
But girl, I got the remedy most important in chemistry
Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy

Some say, some say, they sell they souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick
Cause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping
And ya feel the same way, same way
Sparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smile...oh man
I haven't crushed this hard in quite a while...oh damn
And I can care less that your famous
We can make the perfect couple
Cause my first name big, last name trouble
Yeah

[Taylor Swift:]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
