Daddy,
I want you to know
How my heart aches with your loss
First your Father
Now your Mother
Life's most precious treasure
"Parents"
Though they are no longer
With you on this earth
They will forever
Live in the hearts
Of all who loved them


I may not be right next to you
To tell you how much "I love you"
I may not be right next to you
To give you a "Hug" of comfort Distance is a factor in our relationship
But you are in my thoughts
Everyday, from the moment I wake up
You are in my thoughts
You are in my heart
And you are in my prayers

I can never replace
The loss of my beloved grandparents
But as your Daughter
I will always be here for you
I am but a phone call away
And if you close your eyes and think of me
"Daddy I'm right beside you"
