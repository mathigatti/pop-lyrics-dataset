You could have a change of heart
If you would only change your mind
Instead of slamming down the phone baby
For the hundredth time
I got your number on my wall
But I ain't gonna make that call
When divided we stand baby
United we fall


Got the time got a chance gonna make it
Got my hands on your heart gonna take it
All I know I can't fight this flame
Oh you could have a change of heart
If you would only change your mind
Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby
Time after time

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
I Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

I don't wanna fight no more
I don't know what we're fighting for
When we treat each other baby
Like an act of war
And I could tell a million lies
And it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger
Hits you right between the eyes

There's a time and a place and a reason
And I know I got a love to believe in
All I know got to win this time

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
I Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

You could have a change of heart
If you would only change your mind
Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby
Crazy, Crazy

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
If you have a heart at all
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide
