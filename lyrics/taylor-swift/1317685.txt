Let's watch 
The tide chase 
The waves 
Onto the sand
I wonder 
If a broken heart 
Feel the warmth 
On my hand 
And I wonder 
What a piece 
Of driftwood 
Has seen all through 
His lifetime
Let's walk away 
The past through 
The smokey black nights


I've seen 
A million things 
Spoke a million words 
Now i only want 
To speak to you 

Waiting for the words 
Counting every bird 
There's nothing 
I'd rather do 
On the 
Smokey black nights

Still throught 
The haze 
I can make out 
Constellations 
I'll make one 
Of you and me 
As we sit 
In the sand 
And I saw 
That sunset gleamin 
As my eyes went wild 
Let's walk away 
The past through 
The smokey black nights

I've played 
A thousand songs 
Sang a thousand words 
Now i only want 
To sing to you 

Waited on a wire 
Starin' at the fire 
There's nothing 
I'd rather do 
On the 
Smokey black nights

I've walked 
A thousand miles
Smiled 
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile 
When I'm with you

Waiting for the words 
Counting every bird 
There's nothing 
I'd rather do 
On the 
Smokey black nights

So walk with me
As the sweet 
Wind dances
I'll write a song 
For you and me
On the 
Smokey black nights
