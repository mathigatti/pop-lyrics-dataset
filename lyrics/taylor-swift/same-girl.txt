I'm still wearing my blue jeans
No I don't know what you mean
I'm still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
I've always been the same girl
Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be funI've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break ofdawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
I've always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
I've always been the same girl
Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun
I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break ofdawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking...
I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break ofdawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
