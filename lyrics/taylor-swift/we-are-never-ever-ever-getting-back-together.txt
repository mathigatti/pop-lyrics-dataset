I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying: This is it, I’ve had enough! ‘Cause, like
We hadn’t seen each other in a month
When you said you needed ‘space (what?)


Then you come around again and say: Baby
I miss you and I swear I’m gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, I’m telling you, I’m telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever!

I’m really gonna miss you picking fights, and me
Falling for it, screaming that I’m right, and you
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some
Indie record that’s much cooler than mine

Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, I’m telling you, I’m telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say: Never say never

Ugh, so he calls me up and he’s like: I still love you
And I'm like, I'm just
Yeah, I mean this is exhausting, you know
Like we are never getting back together
Like, ever! No!

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, getting back together
We, getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
