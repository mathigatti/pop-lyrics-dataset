Been sitting, eyes wide open
Behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like there's no point hoping at all


Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me something
Oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I'm sitting, eyes wide open
And I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet
Or just lost the love of my life, ooh

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something
But you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
(Baby, baby, I feel crazy)
I see you around in all these empty faces
(Up all night, all night and every day)

I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
(Give me something, oh, but you say nothing)
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
(What is happening to me?)

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
Until you come back home
