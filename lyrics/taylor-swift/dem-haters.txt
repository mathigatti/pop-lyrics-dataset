You already know who the fuck it is man
Taylor, Taylor
Uh, smoke kush so I aint got no stress


Stunnin, it aint no contest
Diamonds all in my Rolex
Cuz I go hard like P90x
See you dudes copying our moves
now you followin our steps
Little kids just in the mirror all insecure, just tryna flex
Speakin of flex, shout out to flex
And everyone else that said do this next
Tell these lame niggas cut the check
Try to rest now try the best
Gangsters, trippy niggas, all here with me nigga
My weeds so strong, my brain so gone oh
Outer space, solar oh
My chain, polar oh
My bank, so long oh
Like I was playing poker, oh, poker oh
My face all on the tele, so fuck what they tell me
I always keep it real, cause people love the real me
They ran up on my bus, cause police said they smell me
So me and L.O.L.A blow and smoke in LA
Flossin, straight bossin
Take strands, we cross em
My chains, ay,
They cost em
They haitin, we awesome

Throw back on drinking
Lately Ive been thinking
Ive been partying too much and living like the weekend
And then I think bout what my life could be
Thats when I pour another drink, and light this weed
You really sure you wanna grow up and be just like me?

They say, say Im livin it
Im all about it, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
Dem, dem haters, them, ha-haters
They sick of this
Im all about it, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
Dat, dat paer, dat pa-paper Im gettin it
I'm all about it, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
Dem, dem haters, them, ha-haters
They sick of this
Im all about it, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
