Look at you, look at me
Look at who we could be
I wanna know who you are
What you want from the stars


And every time I look at you
I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin
And it hits me then I love you
And every time you look at me
I could go crazy, but I don’t
Say it, but I won’t
‘Cause I’d rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I’m too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But, baby, never mind

All the time, every day
There’s nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you and look at me
Now think of who we could be

And every time I look at you
I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin
And it hits me then I love you
And every time you look at me
I could go crazy, but I don’t
Say it, but I won’t
‘Cause I’d rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I’m to tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But, baby, never mind

All I really wanna say is, “I need you, babe”
But how could you understand
What happens if you turned away
And everything turns blue and gray?
And I just wish I told you “never mind”
And I could tell you now
But, baby, never mind

Yeah, I could tell you now
But never mind
And I could tell you now
But never mind
