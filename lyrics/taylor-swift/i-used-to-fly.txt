I, I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight


You, you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight
Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

I, I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
