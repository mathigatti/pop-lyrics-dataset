Those green eyes and
That contagious smile
And those lips
And the way they verbalize
New york city what a beauty to our eyes
Then you held my hand the first time
You looked at me and smile


Everything was perfect
Everything was great
I was in a fairytale
It's a dream while i'm awake
But days passed and we weren't there
And it felt like we didn't care anymore,
Anymore

But why'd we say goodbye
We said we didn't have enough time for both of us
We said we'll try to work things out
But all a sudden we're all tired and said goodbye

It's sad not to hear you
Calling me up at 3am
No one's ever gonna sing to me
Stevie wonder songs again

I'll miss your kiss and your curly hair
But now that we said goodbye
I'll pretend that i'm alright
Yeah, i'm alright
I'm alright

You said you didn't wanna see me cry
I'll pretend that i'm alright
I'm alright

I'll miss you holding hotel keys
I'll miss you holding hotel keys
And watch you sing to girls with happy tears
When you're on stage
You point at me
You sing to me
As i chant your name

And as the spotlights disappear
It's a different person that i'm with
So much simpler
So much better
And just so beautiful

The way we laugh with four more guys
You walk around naked and cover my eyes
You're just so funny
I can't believe we're letting this go

But why'd we say goodbye
We said we didn't have enough time for both of us
We said we'll try to work things out
But all a sudden we're all tired and said goodbye

It's sad not to hear you
Calling me up at 3am
No one's ever gonna sing to me
Stevie wonder songs again

I'll mis your kiss and your curly hair
But now that we said goodbye
I'll pretend that i'm alright
Yeah, i'm alright
I'm alright

You said you didn't wanna see me cry
I'll pretend that i'm alright

Maybe it's time to let go
Maybe it's better off alone
Maybe today's the wrong time
Someday we'll learn to be strong
Maybe you're right about this
We're busy people with busy lives
We can't keep up on this
So goodbye

Call me up at 3am
Sing me stevie wonder songs again
Your kiss and your curly hair
Never gonna say goodbye
'cause we're alright
