Time is passing slowly for the eight year old next door
But mama's watch is ticking off the wall
Jillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair
The girls could say he's just a bit too tall


You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away but
I'd say that old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say: Love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

He hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know
But they all do and wish that she could see

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away but
I'd say that old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say: Love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

In the least still Masterpiece
Depends on one's opinion
Worst of all, they never called
But don't think that they weren't wishing

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away but
I'd say that old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say: Love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

It's all in your point of view
Point of view
It's all in your point of view
