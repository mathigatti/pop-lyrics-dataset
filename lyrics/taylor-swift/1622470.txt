Here you are now, fresh from your wounds
And back from the edge of time
And all that you were stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know


When you feel the world is crashing all around your feet
Come, running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you, I can only love you
Come now, running headlong into my arms
Breathless

Lay down your guns, too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart, broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing all around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you, I can only love you
Come now running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

I'm so glad to see you smiling
It's so good to hear you laugh
I think that you've found you even missed yourself
I'm only asking this
'Cause I think that truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again, no, no
Again, again

When you feel the world is crashing all around your feet
Come, running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you, I can only love you
Come now, running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

So when you feel the world is crashing down
Won't you come and run into my arms?
