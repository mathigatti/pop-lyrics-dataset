I walked into a chair today
'Cause I was thinking 'bout you
Your face jumped right in my way
Like lately things do
Oh, baby, can't you see?
The thought of you makes a mess of me
I walked into a chair today
'Cause I was thinking 'bout you
And now I


I can't walk straight, I can't talk straight
I can't think about anything but the way
It should be and it could be
And 'till you come 'round again I will be
Doing what I usually do
Thinking 'bout you

I get lost when I drive around town
Thinking 'bout your smile
I always end up on your side of town
And I don't know why
There must be something under this hood
Thatâ€™s got a mighty strong liking to you
I walked into a chair today
'Cause I was thinking 'bout you
Lately

I can't walk straight, I can't talk straight
I can't think about anything but the way
It should be and it could be
And until you come 'round again I will be
Doing what I usually do
Thinking 'bout you

Your eyes are the color of
The deep blue sea
The one that I go swimming in
Every time you look at me

I can't walk straight, I can't talk straight
I can't think about anything but the way
It should be and it could be
And 'till you come 'round again I will be
Doing what I usually do
Thinking about you

I walked into a chair today
'Cause I was thinking 'bout you
