You said it in a simple way
4 am, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
We stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself "Don't get attached"
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't want to miss you like this
Come back... be here
Come back... be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't want to need you this way
Come back... be here
Come back... be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalance

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't want to miss you like this
Come back... be here
Come back... be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't want to need you this way
Come back... be here
Come back... be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you and you are worlds away

In New York... be here
But you're in London and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't want to miss you like this
Come back... be here
Come back... be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't want to need you this way
Come back... be here
Come back... be here

I don't want to miss you like this
Come back... be here
Come back... be here
