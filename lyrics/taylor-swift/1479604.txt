We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days were over
You were calling my name when your face faded from view


And wasn't it you who told me?
The sun would always chase the day
And wasn't it you who told me?

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying, wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew
But you were gonna be a doctor, a movie star
A poet at a Nobel seminar
I hope the world never tore that out of you

And wasn't it you who told me?
The sun would always chase the day
And wasn't it you who told me?

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying, wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

And what ever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played, and the indian days?
What ever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and Maude singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
Or wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
Stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?
On our last night
