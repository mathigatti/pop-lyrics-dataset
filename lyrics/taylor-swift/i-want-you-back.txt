Oh baby give me one more chance
(show you that i love you)
Won't you please let me
(back to your heart)
Oh darlin' i was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
But now since i see you in her arms
(i want you back)
(i want you back)
(i want you back)
(i want you back)
(i want you back)
Ooh ooh baby
(i want you back)
(i want you back)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh


Oh baby give me one more chance
(show you that i love you)
Won't you please let me
(back to your heart)
Oh darlin' i was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
But now since i see you in her arms
(i want you back)
(i want you back)
Ooh ooh baby
