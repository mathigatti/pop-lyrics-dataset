There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from L.A., did you know that?
Like, Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artist that I'm such a fan of
And I'd love to play y'all some that I'm a fan of that's come from L.A., is that okay?
This one came out in 1981, eight years before I was born
And I love this song, it's called 'Bette Davis Eyes'


Her hair is harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn her music on you
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as new york snow
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it
Takes to make a pro blush
She's got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you
And just knows you
Are that the crumbs she throws you?
She's ferocious
And she knows just what it
Takes to make a pro blush, ay, ay
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes
