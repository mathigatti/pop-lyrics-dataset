I can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why'd you have to look so good?
Don't you know I'm trying to hate you?


Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one that lit it?

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
And 'till I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

I got a sack of paper so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy

Something I can get out of my head
I write your name, I write your name
And I tear it out to shreds

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
And 'till I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope this song will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really okay 'cause I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
And 'till I do

I'll just wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
And 'till I do
I'll keep writing songs about you
