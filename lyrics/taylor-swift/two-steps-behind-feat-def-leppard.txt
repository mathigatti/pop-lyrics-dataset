Walk away, if you want to
Its ok, if you need to
You can run
But you can never hide


From the shadow that's creepin' up inside you

There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind
That it only takes a minute
Of your precious time

To turn around
I'll be two steps behind

Take your time, to think about it
Just walk the line
You know you just can't fight it
Take a look around
You'll see what you can't find
Like the fire that's burning up inside me

There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind
That it only takes a minute
Of your precious time

To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
