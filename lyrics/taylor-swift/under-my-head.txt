Are you trying to make me fall?
'Cause with a face like that babyi won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be here, no doubts, sittin' here saying


Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you, I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Ohh, ohh, I love you, I love you
Yeah I'm down to my last thread
Tryina get my heels back under my head

Da da da da da

Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you with your hair all stickin' up
I was so caught up, 'cause baby you're so damn cute
I need you to need me
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you, I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Ohh, ohh, I love you, I love you
Yeah I'm down to my last thread
Tryina get my heels back under my head

Na na na na na na na na na na na

You seem to be just what I tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine, next to mine, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you, I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I really, really want you
Ohh, ohh, I love you, I love you
Ohh, ohh, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you, I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Ohh, ohh, I love you, I love you
Yeah I'm down to my last thread
Tryina get my heels back under my head
