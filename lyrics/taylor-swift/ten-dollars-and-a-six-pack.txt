You were what I wanted
When I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin'
Really somethin' for three months and a half


Everybody said that you were bad news
But, baby, I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six-pack
I got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so's"
Well, you ain't worth all of that
Ten dollars and a six-pack

I said "let them say we're crazy"
You said "let's go fishing tonight"
Midnight moon was blazin', baby
I was looking into your eyes

Everything changed when you took me to town
Caughtcha starin' every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six-pack
I got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so's"
Well, you ain't worth all of that
Ten dollars and a six-pack

Can't believe the time you lost me
I can't believe what it cost me

I owe my friends ten dollars and a six-pack
I got myself a big country serving of payback
Have to go and listen to my mama's "I told you so's"
Well, you were never been through that
Well, you ain't worth all of that
Ten dollars and a six-pack

You ain't worth all that
Ten dollars and a six-pack

Da da da da
Ten dollars and a six-pack
