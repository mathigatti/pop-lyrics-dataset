Stumbled off the porch steps
And sat down in the car
Only 13 blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that don't offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go


These headlights, they just want to fade
Off into the night
But if they're half as stubborn as me
Theyâ€™ll just keep on shining bright
I ain't ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
And since the feeling ain't strong, I'll just move on
And leave this in my past

Once you're gone, I know your memory
Will somehow get the best of me
So why question everything I do?
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering 'bout how I'll act today
If you have found somebody new
So I've been holding on way too long
But not another minute
I'll might miss you bad, but can't call it love
If you ain't in it

Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my traveling
But even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still don't know
Oh, and it troubles me so

Once you're gone, I know your memory
Will somehow get the best of me
So why question everything I do?
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering 'bout how I'll feel today
I see you've found somebody new
And I've been holding on way too long
But not another minute
I'll might miss you bad, but can't call it love
If you ain't in it

Once you're gone, I know your memory
Will somehow get the best of me
So why question everything I do?
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering 'bout how I'll feel today
I see you've found somebody new
Sure, I've been holding on way too long
But not another minute
I'll might miss you bad, but can't call it love
If you ain't in it

Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you, you smile
