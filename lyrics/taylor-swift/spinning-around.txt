Days go by, I wonder if you hear me
Can't you read between the lines
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, I'll make you mine


And don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of a wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
And when you see these eyes you see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides

And don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of a wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning and turning and living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it, move it or shake it
Do it or fake it, girl you've got to make it

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of a wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you
