If you love me then I love you
I swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you 'till I'm old
But if I can't, at least I'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved


Do you remember
The stupid things we used to do?
Before September
Stole me away from you

The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
'Cause, baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me
Saying

If you love me then I love you
I swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't, at least I'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

Pleased to see you
Down by the bridge we used to cross
I found you waiting
Trying to get miles

You would smile that smile and I'd tried so hard to forget
Starting little fires that I still haven't put out yet

And if you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you 'till I'm old
But if I can't, at least I'll know
That, baby,perfect have I loved

Love was all we knew
And faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had
And for one Summer you were mine
Saying

If you love me then I love you
I swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you 'till I'm old
But if I can't, at least I'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved
