I liked the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I liked the way you needed me
Everytime the things got rocky, yeah


I was believing in you
Was I mistaken? Do you mean, do you mean what you say
When you say our love could last forever?

Well, I'd rather you be mean,
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth,
And have to say goodbye,
I'd rather take a blow,
At least then I would know
But, baby, don't you break my heart slow

I liked the way you'd hold me
Every night, for so long baby, yeah
I liked the way you'd sing to me
Everytime the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken? Do you say, do you say what you mean
When you say our love could last forever?

You'd run around and lead me on forever
While I stay at home still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

But, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
And have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow,
At least then I would know
But, baby, don't you break my heart slow
Now, baby, don't you break my heart slow
