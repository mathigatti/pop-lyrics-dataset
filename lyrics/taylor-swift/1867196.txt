Angelina's got a pretty face
And pretty long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I've never been there.
I guess some people come around
In perfect shape
But I don't, 'cause


I've always been a bit reckless.
And I am not your typical princess.
I'm fine, just a bit of a mess.
And I'm not perfect, you could say.
I wasn't brought up that way.

Just watch David run across the field
Watch him catch the ball
He's got everything you'd wanna be
Funny, dark, and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I won't, 'cause

I've always been a bit reckless.
And I am not your typical princess.
I'm fine, just a bit of a mess.
And I'm not perfect, you could say.
I wasn't brought up that way.

I've been pushed across the line,
Tripped over my two feet.
But ain't it funny how it all comes out
Isn't life sweet?

I've always been a bit reckless.
And I am not your typical princess.
I'm fine, just a bit of a mess.
And I'm not perfect, you could say.

I've always been a bit reckless.
And I am not your typical princess.
I'm fine, just a bit of a mess.
And I'm not perfect, you could say.
I wasn't brought up that way.
