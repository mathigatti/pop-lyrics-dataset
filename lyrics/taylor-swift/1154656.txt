Why would you want to break
A perfectly good heart?
And why would you want to take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you want to make
The very first scar?
Why would you want to break
A perfectly good heart?


Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall

No matter what you say
I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

Why would you want to break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you want to take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you want to make
The very first scar?
Why would you want to break
A perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you want to break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you want to take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you want to make
The very first scar?
Why would you want to break
Why would you want to break it?

Why would you want to break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you want to take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you want to make
The very first scar?
Why would you want to break
A perfectly good heart?

Huuum
