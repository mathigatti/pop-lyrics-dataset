I'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Till you open the door
Now there's so much more
I'd never seen it before


I was trying to fly, but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you
You made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know
How that would feel
And you made it so real

You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Oh, baby, you showed me what living is for
I don't want to hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling
And I, I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Crazier
Crazier
