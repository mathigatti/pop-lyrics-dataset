I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know


You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
'Cause I ain't trying to show maturity

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker?

I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess

He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find 'em all
Tried to tape them back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker?

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart?

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh yeah
Just like that mark that you knew that you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker?

In permanent marker
In permanent marker
Oh, permanent marker, yeah
