Monologue song (La La La)

I like glitter and sparkly dresses,
But I'm not gonna talk about that,
In my monologue


I like baking and things that smell like winter,
But I'm not gonna talk about that,
In my monologue

La La La
La La La

I like writing songs about douchebags who cheat on me,
But I'm not gonna say that,
In my monologue

I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public,
But i'm not gonna say that,
In my monologue

La La La La La La La
This is my musical monologue

You might think i'd bring up Joe
That guy who broke up with me on the phone,
But I'm not gonna mention him,
In my monologue

Hey joe, i'm doin' real well,
Tonight i'm hosting SNL,
But I'm not gonna brag about that,
In my monologue

La La La
Ha Ha Ha
Ha Ha Ha
Ha Ha Ha
La La La

And if you're wondering I might be dating the werewolf from Twilight,
[she whispers and send kisses] Hi Taylor!
I'm not gonna comment on that in my monologue

La La La La La La La
This is my musical monologue!

You might expect me to say, something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage and ruined my VMA monologue...

But there's nothing more to say,
'Cuz everything's okay
I've got security lining the stage!
It's my SNL monologue

La La La La La La La
This is, my SNL monologue

La La La La La La La
That was my SNL monologue!
