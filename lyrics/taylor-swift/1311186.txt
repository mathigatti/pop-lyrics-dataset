Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you
I'm caught up in you


Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh

In the middle of the night, waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven

I'm caught up in you

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Come on

In the middle of the night, waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven

And in the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Oh, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh
