Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you were so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks and I'm trying to get
back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my
bestest
Nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it`s again my turn to win some or learn some


I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment maybe sing with me
I like peaceful melody
It's your godforsaken right to be loved loved loved
loved
loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in
the mirror
And bendin' over backwards just to try to see it
clearer
My breath fogged up the glass
So I drew a new face and laughed
I guess what I'm sayin is there ain't no better
reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the
seasons
It`s what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

I won't hesitate no more, no more
it cannot wait i'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
It cannot wait, I'm yours
I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love
Listen to the music of the moment come 'n dance with
me
I love one big family
It's your godforsaken right to be loved loved loved
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love
Listen to the music of the moment come 'n dance with
me
I like happy melody
It's our godforsaken right to be loved love loved love
