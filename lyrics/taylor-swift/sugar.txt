What a thing to see, what a thing to be
What a perfect love, what a perfect home
'Cause every time she walks and
Every time she talks
Is every time he knows what a perfect world he's living on
But whenever he's gone
And when she is all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone
And he says sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time
He calls her sugar
'Cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find
With her midnight hair and
With his favorite stare
She's a southern belle, he's a rock out king
When she looks around
Oh she knows she's found
Such a perfect life, such a perfect thing
And whenever he's gone
And when she is all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone
And he says sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time
He calls her sugar
'Cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find
Oh there's a reason for every season
There's a change within the range of every heart
But the reason and the season
Seem to be right so far
And he says sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time
He calls her sugar
'Cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find
He calls her sugar
