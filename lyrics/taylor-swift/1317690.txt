To the left 
To the left 
Everything you own 
In the box to the left 
In the closet 
Thats my stuff 
Yes, if I bought it 
Please don't touch 


Keep talking 
And yes that's fine 
Could you walk and talk 
At the same time and 
It's my name 
That's on the tag 
Come in with your bags 
Let me call you a cab 
Standin' 
In the front yard 
Tellin' me how 
I'm such a fool 
How I'm never 
Gonna find a man 
Like you 
Got me twisted 

You must know 'bout me 
You must not 
Know 'bout me 
I can have another you 
In a minute 
Matter fact 
He'll be here 
In a minute 
Baby 
You must not 
Know 'bout me 
You must not 
Know 'bout me 
I can have another you 
By tomorrow 
So don't you 
Ever for a second 
Get to thinking 
You're irreplaceable 

So 
Go ahead and get gone 
Call up that chick 
And see if she's home 
Oops I bet you thought 
That I didn't know 
What'd ya think 
I was putting you out for 
Cuz you were untrue 
Haulin' her around 
In the truck 
That I bought you 
Baby drop them keys 
Hurry up 
Before your taxi leaves 

Standin' 
In the front yard 
Tellin me 
How I'm such a fool 
Talkin bout 
How I'll never find 
A man like you 
Got me twisted 

You must not 
Know 'bout me 
You must not 
Know 'bout me 
I can have another you 
In a minute 
Matter fact 
He'll be here 
In a minute 
Baby 
You must not 
Know 'bout me 
You must not 
Know 'bout me 
I can have another you 
By tomorrow 
So don't you ever 
For a second 
Get to thinking 
You're irreplacable 
Yeah
