I’m every woman
It’s all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally


I’m every woman
It’s all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z

I can cast a spell
See, but you can’t tell
Mix a special groove
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly
I will appear

I’m every woman
It’s all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

I’m every woman
It’s all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z

I can set your knees
Like playing unto the seas
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
I got it, I got it
I got it, got it, yeah yeah

I’m every woman
It’s all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

I’m every woman
It’s all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z

I’m every woman (every woman)
It’s all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

Anything you want
I’m every woman
It’s all in me (yeah, oh yeah)
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Yeah, oh
I’m every woman
It’s all in me
