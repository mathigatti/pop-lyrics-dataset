I’ve been counting days and
I’ve been being patient about
A little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
And I don’t wanna jinx my luck
I’ve left it all behind me
And I’ve been hoping everyday
That someday you will find me


So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on the wood and broke the moon
I pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I’m wearing out that ole wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight, tonight

Dreaming of you lately
I’ve been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
Cause I’ve been on the verge of
Running round in circles
Baby all I want is you
And I don’t wanna jinx my luck
I’ve left it all behind me
And I’ve been hoping everyday
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on the wood and broke the moon
I pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I’m wearing out that ole wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Do you believe in miracles?
Please tell me if you’ve seen one
I’d like to know
Just where to go
Because I think I need one

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on the wood and broke the moon
I pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I’m wearing out that ole wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight, tonight

I’ll cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on the wood and broke the moon
I pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I’m wearing out that ole wishing well
You never know if time is gonna tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight.
