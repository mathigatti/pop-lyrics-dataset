Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on
And I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you are just gone and gone, gone and gone


In silent screams
In wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, ooh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, ooh, ooh, ooh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind for only you
But you're still gone, gone, gone

In losing grip
On sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, ooh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, ooh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, ooh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, ooh

(This love, this love, this love, this love) ooh
(This love, this love, this love, this love) ooh
(This love, this love, this love, this love) ooh
(This love, this love, this love, this love)

Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young
You just run
But you come back
To what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, ooh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, ooh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, ooh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, ooh

(This love, this love, this love, this love) ooh
(This love, this love, this love, this love) ooh
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
(This love, this love) this love came back to me, ooh
