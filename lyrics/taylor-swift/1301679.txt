And it's a sad picture
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same
Another time and place
Repeating history and youâ€™re getting sick of it


But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back
Will fall down
This revolution
The time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing Hallelujah!
We'll sing Hallelujah!

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger, but we're faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes, says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back
Will fall down
This revolution
The time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing Hallelujah!
We'll sing Hallelujah!, oh

Tonight we'll stand
Get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long
It's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back
Fell down
This revolution
Throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing Hallelujah!
We sang Hallelujah!, oh
Hallelujah
