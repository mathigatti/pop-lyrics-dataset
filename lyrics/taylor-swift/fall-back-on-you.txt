Isn't it funny how many times we can say,
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,
And moved on
That's what we thought


But here I am in the same old car,
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh,

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you
You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friend
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things, like I love you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people who you come back to
So fall back on me,
Fall back on you

Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and *?* like girls
But just, baby, get along with me

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people that you come back too
Fall back on me
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me baby,
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you

Fall back on you
