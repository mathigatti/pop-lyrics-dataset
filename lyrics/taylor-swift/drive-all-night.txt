She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay either way
She didn't tell anyone by the first reason
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run


And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But i understand it somehow

If i could drive all night
Would i find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lights
And unfamiliar exit signs
I'd just drive on by
Just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well but i could tell
That her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch 'cause she just felt too much
And you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where i'm headed right now

If i could drive all night
Would i find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lights
And unfamiliar exit signs
I'd just drive on by
Just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan
I don't have a map
I don't even know if
I'm ever coming back
I don't have a when and i don't have a where
I don't even know if i'll know when i'm there

But if i could drive all night
Would i find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lights
And unfamiliar exit signs
I'd just drive on by... i'd just drive on by
Drive on... drive on... drive all night

If i'd just drive on... drive on... drive all night
Just south of knowing why
