You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way


It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around before

'Cause when you're fifteen and
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like
There's nothing to figure out
But count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

You sit in a class next to a redhead named Abgail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls
Who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date
And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
And your mom is waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends!

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
We both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them (gonna believe them!)
Fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
