[T Pain] T-Swizzle and T-Pizzle

[Taylor Swift]
I'm like 8 foot 4, blond hair to the floor
you shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore


no I ain't got a gun
no I never really been in a club
still live with my parents
but I'm still a thug

i'm so gangsta you can find me baking cookies at night
you out clubbing, but I just caramel delight
t swift and t pain rappin on the same track
it's a thug story tell me can you handle that

I had a dream last night I had high-top NIkes
I had diamonds in my mouth, and diamonds on my mic
by the time I woke up I was singing "I'M ON A BOOOOAAT"

cuz I'm a singer turned rapper
shorty I'm a make ya
straight to the top, yo
shorty I'ma take ya

you can call me T Sweezy now I'm a rap star
it's a thug story now tell them who you are

singer turned gangsta
you don't wanna fight me
straight to the top
in my extra small white tee

t swift and t pain all up on the same track
it's a thug story tell me now can you get with that

what! what! I knit sweaters yo!
what! what! don't test me [bleep]

Hey hold on, hold on I didn't even say anything
I said "yo"
you guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't even swear
SHE DIDN"T EVEN SWEAR
Hello?
