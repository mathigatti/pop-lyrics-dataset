I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night.
I try to think; try to walk away with you... me in
And I say:


Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!

Flying high, I can see his smiling,
As we walk down by the drives.
Take my hand, take my breath away,
Cause you make me feel like flying!

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine! Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!

Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby,
All I really wanna say is:

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,
Oh, except you, honey baby!
