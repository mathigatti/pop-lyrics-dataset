Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh, oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is 'no'
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and
I, I, I, I


Seen you fall, seen you crawl on you knees, aye, aye
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won’t remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say: I knew it all along
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh, oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And know you're on to something
I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say: I knew it all along
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, and now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud

I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, and now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud

And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when
When ya

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh, oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was no
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say: I knew it all along
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter
It's sweeter
It's sweeter than fiction
