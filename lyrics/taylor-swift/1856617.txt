There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah


Hey, hey, hey

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why when with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Hey, hey, hey

So baby drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

Cuz I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Hey, hey, hey

Cuz I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
