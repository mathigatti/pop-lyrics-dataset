I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better


And right before your eyes
I’m breaking
No past, no reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
I’m aching
No past, nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong
This is the last time I say: It’s been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won’t hurt you anymore

This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I’m asking you
Last time I’m asking you this

This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I’m asking you
Last time I’m asking you this

This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I’m asking you
Last time I’m asking you this

This is the last time I’m asking you
Last time I’m asking you
Last time I’m asking you this
