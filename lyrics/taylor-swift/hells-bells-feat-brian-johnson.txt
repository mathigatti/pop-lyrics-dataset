I'm a rolling thunder, a pouring rain
I'm comin' on like a hurricane
My lightning's flashing across the sky
You're only young but you're gonna die


I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's putting up a fight
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
I'm gonna get you, Satan get you

Hell's bells
Yeah, hell's bells
You got me ringing hell's bells
My temperature's high, hell's bells

I'll give you black sensations up and down your spine
If you're into evil you're a friend of mine
See the white light flashing as I split the night
'Cause if good's on the left
Then I'm stickin' to the right

I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's puttin' up a fight
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
I'm gonna get you, Satan get you

Hell's bells
Yeah, hell's bells
You got me ringing hell's bells
My temperature's high, hell's bells
Yeow

Hell's bells, Satan's comin' to you
Hell's bells, he's ringing them now
Hell's bells, the temperature's high
Hell's bells, across the sky
Hell's bells, they're takin' you down
Hell's bells, they're draggin' you around
Hell's bells, gonna split the night
Hell's bells, there's no way to fight, yeah
Ow, ow, ow, ow
Hell's bells
