My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic


In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkles and lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me: I love you
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me: I love you
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

And when I'm feeling alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I'll pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas to you

Under the mistletoe (to you)
Watching the fire glow
And telling me: I love you

Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you

Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (make every wish come true)
I love you
