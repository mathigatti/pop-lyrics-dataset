I said I know, when he said
I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
I watched him go, and he watched me
Crash to the floor, on my knees
Just like that


And he said, babe, can I come back?

I said that’s when, when I wake up in the morning
That’s when, when it’s sunny, you’re a storm
You're laughing when I’m crying
And that’s when I’ll be waiting at the front gate
That’s when I see your face and let you in
Baby, that’s when

I said I know, when he said
I Did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this
'Cause I let you go and you let me
Think I’d be fine without you
Imagine that
So baby when can I come back?

I said that’s when, when I wake up in the morning
That’s when, when it’s sunny, you’re a storm
You're laughing when I’m crying
And that’s when I’ll be waiting at the front gate
That’s when I see your face and let you in
Baby, that’s when

And I said, honestly
Did you ever think of me?
And he said

That’s when, when I woke up in the morning
That’s when, when it’s sunny, you’re a storm
And laughing when I was crying
And that’s when you were waiting at the front gate
That’s when I saw your face, you let me in
And baby, that’s when

Oh, I said I know, when he said 
I need some time, need some space
