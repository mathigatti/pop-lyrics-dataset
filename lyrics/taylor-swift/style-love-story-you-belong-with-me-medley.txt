You got that James Dean, daydream look in your eyes
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down
We come back every time


'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair slicked back
White T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith
And a tight little skirt

And when we go crashing down
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

Midnight, you come and pick me up
No headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames
Or paradise

Fade into view
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)

And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean, daydream look in your eyes
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down
We come back every time

'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair slicked back
White T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith
And a tight little skirt

And when we go crashing down
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

We were both young
When I first saw you
I closed my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

I see the lights
See the party the ball gowns
I see you make your way
Through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo
You were throwing pebbles
'Till my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Beggin' you Please don't go

And I said

Romeo take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
All that's left to do is run
You'll be the Prince
And I'll be the Princess
It's a Love Story
Baby just say Yes

I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said

Romeo save me
I've been feelin' so alone
I keep waiting for you
But you never come
Is this in my head?
I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground
And pulled out a ring

And says

Marry me Juliet
You never have to be alone
I love you
And that's all I really know
I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress
It's a Love Story
Baby just say Yes

Oh, I remember you
Driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time
How could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought
Just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
