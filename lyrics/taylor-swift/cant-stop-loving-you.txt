So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
And I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying


'Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time I don't know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway tracks
And when I hear that whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know
That I was crying

'Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

And I'll always be by your side
'Cause I never wanted to say goodbye
And I'll always be here, be here if you change, change your mind

And I'll always be by your side
And I never wanted to say goodbye
And I'll always be here, be here if you change, change your mind

So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
And I could say everything's alright
I could pretend and say goodbye
That would be lying

'Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

And I'll always be by your side
And I never wanted to say goodbye
And I'll always be here, be here if you change, change your mind

'Cause I can't stop
I'll always be here by your side
I never wanted to say goodbye
I'll always be here if you change, change your mind

Why should I?
Why should I even try?
I'll always be here by your side
I didn't wanna say goodbye
So why should I even try?
