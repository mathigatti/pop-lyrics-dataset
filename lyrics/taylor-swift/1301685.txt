I heard a song
Tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
She sees his face
In every space, every room
And I know that
If I turn around you
Won't be there
If I close my eyes
Will you be there?


I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

I've got a picture of you
In my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
I hope I never lose that feelin
I used to get when you called
And then I wonder to myself
Who are you, where are you
Where you ever here at all?

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

That girl in the song
Had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes
And see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face
Oh, no, no
I don't wanna lose your face
I don't wanna turn around
Oh, oh, oh
