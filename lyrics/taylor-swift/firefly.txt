Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I
I was captivated
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in and erased it
For a while I thought that I could hold you
But you were just a temporary high


Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don’t know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand
I tried to catch you but I can’t chase the wind
And every time I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don’t know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

I’d like to think I’d be all that you wanted
But not even that is enough

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don’t know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you
Firefly
Firefly
