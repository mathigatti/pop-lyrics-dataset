State the obvious
I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realized you love yourself
More than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends
That I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way


I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here, planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me
You better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard

I really, really hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn
Baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn
