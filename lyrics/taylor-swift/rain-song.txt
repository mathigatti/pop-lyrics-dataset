Just had a conversation with the mirror
It ended up not having much to say
It said "today was for the lovers and believers
I hate to tell you, it just ain't your day"


So this is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down, it comes down to
This lonely rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you

I had some complications with the voices
'Round and going 'round inside my mind
I used to think this heart had lots of choices
But they all lead to your doorstep every time

This is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down, it comes down to
This lonely rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you

So this is my apology
My words, my tears, are all me
Laid out in front of you
Like the thoughts were true on a sunny afternoon
This is a song for you

This is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down, it comes down to
This lonely rain song
Youâ€™re on my mind and I still love you
I still love you

I had a conversation with the mirror
It ended up not having much to say
