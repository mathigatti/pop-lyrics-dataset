It wasn’t just like a movie
The rain didn’t soak through my clothes
Down to my skin
Driving away and I
I guess you could say
"This is the last time I'll drive this way again"


And there's nothing to say and I
Try to grab at the fray 'cause I
I still love you but I can’t

Bye, bye
To everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it’s coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah

Picture frame is empty
It’s black and white, you’re smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
We’re so sure of everything
Everything we thought we’d always have

Lost in the sound of there
The here and the now comes in
Seems like I’m becoming part of your past

Bye, bye
To everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it’s coming down to nothing
All you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

And there’s so much that I can’t touch
You’re all I want but it’s not enough this time
And I can feel you like you’re slipping through my hands
And I’m so scared of how this ends

Bye, bye
To everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it’s coming down to nothing
All you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

Bye, bye
To everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it’s coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me

It wasn’t just like a movie
The rain didn’t soak through my clothes
Down to my skin
