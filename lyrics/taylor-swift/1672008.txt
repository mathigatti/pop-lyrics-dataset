All this time I was wasting,
Hoping you would come around
I've been givin' out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long baby
But I figured you out
And you think it would be fine again
But not this time around


You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby,
Like I did before
You're not sorry.
Oh no, no, no.

Looking so innocent,
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waitin' in the cold
And you got to share your secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby,
Like I did before
You're not sorry.
No, no, Oh.
You're not sorry.
No, no, Oh.

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright,
But watched all of it fade

(All Goes Around - Justin Timberlake Cover)
Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
I can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair

Is the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Shoulda known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's ok, baby, cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around
Yeah

What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around, comes all the way back around
Yeah

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby,
Like I did before
You're not sorry.
No, no, Oh.
No, no...

You spend your nights alone
And she never comes home
And everytime you call her, all you get is a busy tone
What she's doing to you
What you did to me
Tale as old as time
Boy, you got what you deserved
