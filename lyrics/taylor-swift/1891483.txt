All is quiet in the world tonight
Counting stars and fireflies
This summer sings a lullaby
Of just me and my baby


On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
Just me and my baby

The world is spinning 'round
'Cause of just what I found

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the riverside
Wishing I could slow down time
Faking pictures in my mind
Of me and my baby

The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
The back road was a better way
For me and my baby

The closer that we get
Ooh, I can't leave yet

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Both know what we found
So we turned that car around

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, and be with my baby
Ooh, yeah and be with my baby
