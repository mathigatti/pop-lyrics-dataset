Can you lie next to her and give her your heart, your heart?
As well as your body, and can you lie next to her and confess your love, your love?
As well as your folly and can you kneel before the king and say I'm clean, I'm clean


But tell me now where was my fault, in loving you with my whole heart?
Oh tell me now where was my fault, in loving you with my whole heart?

Her white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, to the brink
You desired my attention but denied my affections, my affections

So tell me now where was my fault, in loving you with my whole heart?
Oh tell me now where was my fault, in loving you with my whole heart?
Heart, heart...

Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
Oh lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
Heart, heart...
