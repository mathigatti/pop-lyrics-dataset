He lived down the street
In a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet
There was never a doubt
That we won't forget this someday


It starts with a smile
And we walk a few miles
Then it all leads to this
Our first kiss

All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off
You're better off
They can talk forever
They just don't know better

We drive around town
In a rusty old truck
But somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough
'Cause everyone we know is trying

To push us apart
Putting doubt in our hearts
And they get what they want
'Cause you're gone

All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off
You're better off
They can talk forever
They just don't know better

You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose
And a note that says
We don't have to do things their way

All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off
You're better off
Well, they can talk forever
They just don't know better
