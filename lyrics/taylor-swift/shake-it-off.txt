I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm, mmm
That's what people say, mmm, mmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm, mmm
That's what people say, mmm, mmm


But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don’t see, mmm, mmm
That's what they don’t see, mmm, mmm
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm, mmm
That’s what they don’t know, mmm, mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)

Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)

Hey, hey, hey!
Just think while you've been gettin' down and out about the liars
And dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been gettin' down to this! Sick! Beat!

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like: Oh my God
But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake, yeah, oh!

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)

Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)

Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off 
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you got to)
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
