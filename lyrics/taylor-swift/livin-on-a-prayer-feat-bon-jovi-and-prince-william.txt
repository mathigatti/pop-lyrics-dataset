Once upon a time
Not so long ago


Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love, for love

She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer

Tommy got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in
When he used to make it talk, so tough
It's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night Tommy whispers
Baby it's okay, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer

We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer
