I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And I dare this to get better


Somewhere throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

And if you ever leave, I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love, I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if, baby, you would be my cure

Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know that we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be rightwhere you are, baby

Sometime along the way
You take my breath away
Distracted by the view
I fall right into you

And if you ever leave, I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love, I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if, baby, you would be my cure

They say I need to see
All the people out there waitin'
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'll be makin'

'Cause if you ever leave, I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need my love, I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if, baby, you would be my cure

I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
