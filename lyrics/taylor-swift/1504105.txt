It was painted red
The stripe was white
It was 18 feet from val to stern light
It was 2nd hand, from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, it made for water
We ran her for years, til' the transister got rotten
A piece of my child hood will never be forgotten


It was just an old plywood boat
A 75 Johnson, an electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
I would turn her sharp, I would make it wide
He said you can't be the way a old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he got it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Off a dirt strip where we'd dump trash
Off of thickpin road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet to the pedals
Smiling like a hero
Who just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
I would press that clutch, and I would keep it right
He would say just a little slower son
Your doing just fine
Just a little dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

Im grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pastior at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl, your doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

She's just old plywood boat
With a 75 johnson
And electric choke
