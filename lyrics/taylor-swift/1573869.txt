In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said: This time, I've had enough
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up


'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said: Leave, but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming: I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know all I need
Is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs
Staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

So babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see?
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me, yeah

I said Leave, but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming: I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know all I need
Is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you, but I do
I do, I do
I'll say: There's nothing you can say
To make this right again
I mean it, I mean it
But what I mean is

I said Leave, but baby, all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming: I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know all I need
Is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess:
I need you
