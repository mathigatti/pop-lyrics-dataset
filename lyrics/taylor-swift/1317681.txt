You have my heart
We'll never be 
World's apart
May be in magazine
But you'll still 
Be my star


Baby 
Cause in the dark
You can't see 
Shiny cars
That's when you 
Need me there
With you 
I'll always share

Because 
When the sun shine
We'll shine together
Told you 
I'll be here forever
Said that I'll always 
Be a friend
Took an oath 
I'ma stick it out 
To the end

Now it's raining more 
Than ever
Know that we'll still 
Have each other

You can stand 
Under my umbrella
You can stand 
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, yea, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella 
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
