Kiss and tell, kiss and tell

What you waitin' for
An oppurtunity tonight
Come on it's at your door
You're crazy if you leave it locked
You know you gotta let it in and finally I know it too
The questions what it's always been, so what are you gonna do?
(Low) Another chance
(Low) I'll understand
(Low) If you're coming hello


Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
I'm a different girl
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
From a different world
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
That's what I said
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell

You procrastinate the world
It's gonna pass you by
Already runnin' late
It's either runnin' bad or fly

You crash into the ground and have you pick yourself and laugh
You keep on shootin' for the stars
What ather choice do you have?
(Low) Another chance
(Low) I'll understand
(Low) If you're coming hello

Kiss and tell, Kiss and tell
I'm a different girl
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
From a different world
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
That's what I said
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell

If I ain't holdin' you back
You have your little panic attack
I, I, I did it and it's O.M.G
I don't know what just happened to me

Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
I'm a different girl
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
From a different world
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
That's what I said
Kiss and

Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
I'm a different girl
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
From a different world
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
That's what I said
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell, kiss and tell
