He said: Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city
Away from the crowds
I thought: Heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down


He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ah, ah, ah
Wildest dreams, ah, ah, ah, ah

I said: No one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair
His clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ah, ah, ah
Wildest dreams, ah, ah, ah, ah

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ah, ah, ah
Wildest dreams, ah, ah, ah, ah

In your wildest dreams, ah, ah, ah, ah
In your wildest dreams, ah, ah, ah, ah
