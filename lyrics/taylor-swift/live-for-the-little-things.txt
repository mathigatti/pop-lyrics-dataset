One day break, one heart ache, every once upon a time
That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines
They mean so much to everyone,
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little things


Oil paintings and make it, every details turned out bad
One night stands, new romance, living for that love and person
It means so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little things, oho, yeah,

No fighting, black riding, wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending, take a risk and go a thought for the right
Strawberries and fairies with wings
They're for the little things,
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, uh yeah
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, oh yeah.
