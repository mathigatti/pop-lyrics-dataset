You wanna dance you really wanna let it go
You want it bad but this time they told you to go
You want it


You try it fast when you really should do it slow
You got it bad and it's time I told you no
You're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did
So just let it go

Oh no!

You wanna laugh and you really wanna let them know
You're so relaxed and you really gonna let it show
You want it

Do you recall when we were two of a kind
But you chose your way, and I chose mine
You're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did
So just let it go

Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all
Oh no!
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all
Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all and you got it all
But you got it all wrong!

We had a laugh, but it turned into a cough
We got along but now I wanna get off
You're on it

I was a kid when I did what you do
I put a lid on and thought that's it, I'm through
You're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did
So just let it go

Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all
Oh no!
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all
Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all
Oh no!
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all

Oh no!

And when I say you lose it, you don't believe it at all
Oh no!
It's such a long way to fall, the writings on the wall
Oh no!
But when I said you'd lose it, I can't even recall
Oh no!
If it was the best of all your brain a bit too small
Because you got it all, you got it all, you got it all
But you got it all wrong!
