Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster 
as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon 
and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, 
traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again


And buy a one-way ticket 
on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out 
dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough 
to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings 
and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, d
own at the station
All I had to do 
was make up my mind

And buy a one-way ticket 
on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out 
dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough 
to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well, 
I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees 
through the valley 
of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining 
like a light on me 
and now I can see my way out

Buy a one-way ticket 
on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out 
dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know

Buy a one-way ticket 
on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast 
with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, 
gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, 
gonna do everything
