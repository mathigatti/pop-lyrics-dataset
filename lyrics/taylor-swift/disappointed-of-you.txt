I've waited all along
Thought that you'd stay
But you didn't really care
You just walk away
And I saw myself in the mirror
It's so hard to recognize
Everything you ever wanted was right here
But you never realized


And I'm really disappointed
So disappointed of you
I'm really disappointed of you
And I'm too frustrated of you
Disappointed of you
Baby, I'm disappointed of you

The roses I left you last night
And the calls unanswered
Sometimes I think we're getting nowhere
But you don't care 'cause you're a bastard
I can do nothing but think of you time and again
I can't watch you go leaving me alone
The more I try, the more gets the pain
Baby, this love is undone

And I'm really disappointed
So disappointed of you
I'm really disappointed of you
And I'm too frustrated of you
Disappointed of you
Baby, I'm disappointed of you

So you tell me where to go
Tell me something I already don't know
So hold my hands in yours like never before
Tell me that I won't be lonely anymore

And I'm really disappointed
So disappointed of you
I'm really disappointed of you
And I'm too frustrated of you
Disappointed of you
Baby, I'm disappointed of you
