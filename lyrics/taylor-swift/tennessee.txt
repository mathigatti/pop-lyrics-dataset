Standing on a street
Somewhere I don't want to be
In a town that's made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'Cause this sure ain't what I call home
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here and


Let my hair hang down
And I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I want to tell the world
How good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
I'm in Tennessee

Standing on a road
Leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on we'll all go fishing in the pond
But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here and

Let my hair hang down
And I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I want to tell the world
How good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
I'm in Tennessee

When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old things
I need to go back, back where I feel so free
Well it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee

Let my hair hang down
And I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I want to tell the world
How good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise
I'm in Tennessee
