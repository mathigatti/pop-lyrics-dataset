I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watched you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words, but all I can think is: We should be together


Everytime you smile, I smile
And everytime you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face
Oh, I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I have time to think it all over
And all I can say is: Come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

'Cause everytime you smile, I smile
And everytime you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid
Please, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Everytime you smile, I smile
And everytime you shine, I'll shine
And everytime you're here, baby
I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah
