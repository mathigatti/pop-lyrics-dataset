Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh


If I could be sweet
I would, but first of all let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

If I could escape
And recreate a place as my own world
And I could be your favourite girl forever
Perfectly together
Now tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?

If I could be sweet
I'm sorry but I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt, whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
Sweet escape
Sweet escape

Ooh, ooh
Ooh

You let me drown
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Let's look for some common ground

Oh, baby
Time's been getting a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way the you treat me
Hopefully, you don't leave me
Wanna take you with me

If I could escape
And recreate a place as my own world
And I could be your favourite girl forever
Perfectly together
Now tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?

If I could be sweet
I'm sorry but I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt, whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
Sweet escape

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
