You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn


You know you love me,I know you care
You shout whenever, and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

And I was like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
My baby, baby, baby noo
My baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine mine

She's so high
High above me
She's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you
See, you belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time
How could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about Something that you said
She doesn't get your humor like I do

I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music
She doesn't like
She'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one Who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see me
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walking the streets
With you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down
You say you're fine
I know you better than that
Hey what are you doing with a girl like that

But she wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
When you wake up and find
That what you're looking for
Has been here the whole time

If you could see That I'm the one Who understands you
Been here all along So why can't you see
you belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time, How could you not know, baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you Driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

You can see that I'm the one Who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time, how could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

You can see that I'm the one Who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time, how could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought, just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
