'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know, it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey


Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shining? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe then
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad
To think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know, it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds, they last, and they last now
Did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad
To think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know, it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know, it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know, it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey
