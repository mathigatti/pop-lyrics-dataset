It was so nice throwing big parties
Jumping into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year


So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head, I'm locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, dar-ling
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, ho-ney
Oh, did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

It was so nice being friends again
There I was giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately
Uh-uh, if only you weren't so shady

This is why we can't have nice things, dar-ling (yeah)
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (nice things) things (baby), ho-ney
Oh, did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about that he said, she said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
â€˜Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Hahaha, I can't even say it with a straight face!

This is why we can't have nice things, dar-ling (darling)
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (uh-uh) things (oh no), ho-ney (baby)
Oh, did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?

This is why we can't have nice things, dar-ling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them, I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, ho-ney
(They didn't care about that he said, she said)
Oh, did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things
