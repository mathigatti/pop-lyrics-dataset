Your little hand's wrapped
Around my finger and it's
So quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter
'Cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your
Favorite night light


To you everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
And never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified,
Your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday
And call your own shots

But don't make her drop you
Off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance
Around in your pj's
Getting ready for school

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left your scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of
Your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like
When your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps,
Remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday
Gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh, I don't want to grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh, I don't want to grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please, try to never grow up

Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up
Just never grow up
