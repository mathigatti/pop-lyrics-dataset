I said: Oh my, what a marvellous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window
We were 17 and crazy, runnin' wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said: Oh my, what a marvellous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said: Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?

Like, oh my, what a marvellous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo

Oh my, what a marvellous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?
