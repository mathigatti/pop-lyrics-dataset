Turn your dial to 93.7
Broadway acts like he's 11
Self-proclaimed, self
Worse mistake ever to land in Michigan
I'm just a singer of country songs
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
But if you listen to just one thing I say


You should turn 93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothin like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard

From a trailer park in St. Louis
Growin' up not wearin' any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl you see all day
Growin' up the other trailer park girls
Couldn't hide their jealousy
Cuz she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJ

So you should turn? 93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothin like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard
