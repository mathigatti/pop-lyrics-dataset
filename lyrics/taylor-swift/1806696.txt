Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says, "Please, don't make me go back there again"


She said, "I wish there was some way to make 'em stop it"
So he drives down to that principles office and says

"I didn't bring her up
So they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here
So they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girl's smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way"

Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say

She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do"
And through the tears she said "I couldn't do that to you"
And he said

"I didn't bring you up
So he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life
To see my little girl's smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way"

The phone rings on a rainy night
Says, "It's officer Tate"
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an over pass
And, Emily, she's fading fast"
He says

"God, I didn't bring her up
To watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day
They put her momma in the ground
Only thing kept me alive
Was that little girl's smile
So, please, don't take that away
It won't be easy taking her today
She wasn't brought up that way"

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes
