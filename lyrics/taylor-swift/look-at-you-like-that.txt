There you are
Standing there lookin like you don’t know what to say,
But i know that face.


And here i am,
Bracing myself for what i know is coming my way
What a waste.

All of that time
I thought you were mine
Was i just kidding myself?
Letting it go
And loving you so
Don’t you dare tell me not to look at you like that

I’m gonna look at you like that
I’m gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that i do
I’m gonna make this hard on you while i
Look at you like that

Don’t you say
That we can still be friends,
It doesn’t work that way,
The end is the end.

And don’t you dare think
That i'll pack up all my tears and take them home,
And cry them out when i’m alone

I'll do it right here
I'm crying right now
Baby you can watch me crumble down
That’s for breaking my heart
So baby don’t start
Thinking you can ask me not to look at you like that

I’m gonna look at you like that
I’m gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that i do
I’m gonna make this hard on you while i
Look at you like that

Don’t you tell me to be strong
Or make it harder than it has to be
After you are gone
You'll remember what you've done to me,

Cause i’m gonna look at you like that
I’m gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that i do
After what you put me through
I’m gonna have to let you know
How much it hurts to let you go

Oh yeah

Gonna look at you like that
Look at you
Look at you
Look at you
Like that
