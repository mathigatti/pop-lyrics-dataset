Everytime 
I think of you 
I always catch 
My breath 
I'm still 
Standing here 
And your miles away 
And I wonder why 
You left me 
And there's a storm 
That's raging through 
My frozen heart tonight 


Tyler: 
I hear your name 
In certain circles 
And it always 
Makes me smile 
I spent my time 
Just thinkin' 
About you 
And it's almost 
Driving me wild 

But it's my heart 
That's beggin down 
This long distance 
Line tonight 

Taylor/Tyler:
And I 
Ain't missin' you 
At all 
Since you've 
Been gone away 
I ain't missin' you 
No matter 
What I might say 

Tyler: 
There's a message 
In the wires 
And I am sendin' you 
A signal tonight 
You don't know 
How desperate 
I've become 
And It looks 
Like I'm loosein' 
This fight 

But it's my heart 
That's breakin' down 
This long dusty 
Road of mine 

But I ain't 
Missin' you 
At all 
Since you've 
Been gone away 
I aint missin' you at 
No matter 
What my friends say 

Taylor: 
And there's a message 
That I'm sendin' out 
Like a telograph 
To you or something 
I can't bridge 
This distance 
Honey 
Stop this heart 
Ache all alone 

Taylor/Tyler: 
I ain't missin' you 
At all 
Since you've 
Been gone away 
I ain't missin' you 
No matter 
What my friends say 
I ain't missin' you 
Since you've 
Been gone away 
I ain't missin' you 
Yeah, no matter 
What your friends say 

Hey, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

I ain't missin' you 
At all 
Since you've 
Been gone away 
I ain't missin' you 
Nooo
