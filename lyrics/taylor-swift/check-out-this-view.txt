I don’t need a love
But there is one thing love has taught me
It’s to never expect too much
Don’t need a believable touch
I just need you
I just need you


Don’t need mine
I found mine
Why should we be wasting time?

You don’t know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me seeing everything I see
Looking at you
Check out this view

Think of a quiet beach
Think of how the waves crash down
Think about a summer’s eve

No offense to them but I thank I’m not there with you
Walk in a room
In the light or in the dark
Well nothing shadows who you are and

You don’t know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me seeing everything I see
Looking at you
Check out this view

I look outside the window
Every day see something new
But all I ever wanted was a window looking at you
At you (a window just for you)

And you don’t know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me seeing everything I see

You don’t know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me seeing everything I see
Looking at you
Check out this view
