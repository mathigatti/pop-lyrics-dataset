Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
Sir, I think he's bleeding out
And some things you just can't speak about


With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
Doc, I think she's crashing out
And some things you just can't speak about

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
