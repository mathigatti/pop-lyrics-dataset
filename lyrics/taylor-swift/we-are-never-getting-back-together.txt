I’m the one to blame, I took you for
Granted, you were looking forward to us
Working out, in my mind there were no doubts
That that would happen eventually
But I made you wait and that was wrong
Especially ‘cause we had a problem that I just throw came out upon now
I’m more worse for wear than you
You’re over me, I know that you gon see through me, you have every right
To feel that way and take a leave of absence from me actually
I’m dazed in how I treated you
I know just how the saying goes, you reap what you fuckin’ sow


I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying this is it, I've had enough, 'cause like
We haven't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me, remember how that lasted for a day
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Oooh we called it off again last night
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk
To my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like ever...

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for a screaming that I'm right
And you, will hide away and find your peace of mind with some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Oooh you called me up again tonight
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk
To my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

If that’s your wish it’s cool with me
‘Cause now I know it’s virtually impossible to get you back
You’ve made it clear, once I look at
The shit I’ve put you through for months of screaming
All the fucking fuss it made you leave, it made me think
What a load of crap you might’ve think
You hold your breath? No
No, you’d let go of me sooner or later
No matter what I say you won’t come back to me right so
All that’s left for me to do
Is accept what I’ve done to you, I know it fully through ‘cause

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk
To my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, oooh, oooh, not back together, we
Oh, getting back together

You go talk to your friends talk
To my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
