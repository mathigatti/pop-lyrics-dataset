Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kinda hard to aim
Like the tree we carved our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain


I need reasons
Why you're leaving

Well, I guess I wished on a plane
I thought was a star
Guess that what you wrote on a paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
And I thought was a star

Driving off into the deep end
Honestly believe you'd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending

Nothing comes true
When it comes to you

Well, I guess I wished on a plane
I thought was a star
Guess that what you wrote on a paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
And I thought was a star

The night was so cloudy
It's not my fault, I just couldn't see

And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought was a star
Guess what you wrote on a paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
And I thought was a star

Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kinda hard to aim
