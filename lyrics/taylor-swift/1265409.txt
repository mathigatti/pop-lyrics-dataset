Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it’s something I just fell into
And it was overated
But just look what I’ve created
I came out alive but I’m black and blue


Before you ask me if I’m alright
Think about what I had to do, yeah

Wake up then smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn’t plan
And I’ll bet you thought you’d beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I, heart, question mark
Written on the back of my hand

I’d be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can’t believe you made me
Sit at home and cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

And now you ask about you and I
There’s no you and I
Remember what you put me through, I had to

Wake up then smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn’t plan
And I’ll bet you thought you’d beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I, heart, question mark
Written on the back of my hand

And when you’re home all alone at night
You’ll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh, baby
I haven’t thought about you and I
There’s no you and I
And I know, someday you will

Wake up then smell the break-up
Realize that we won’t make up
It didn’t go the way you planned
And you’ll know you didn’t beat me
When you look down and see
I got an I, heart, question mark
Written on the back of my hand

Written on the back of my hand
An I, heart, question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand
