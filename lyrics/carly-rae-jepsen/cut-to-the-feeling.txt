I had a dream, or was it real?
We crossed the line and it was on
We crossed the line
It was on this time


I've been denying how I feel
You've been denying what you want
You want from me
Talk to me baby

I want some satisfaction
Take me to the stars
Just like, ahhh
A-a-ahhh!

I wanna cut through the clouds
Break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof
You and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

I wanna play where you play
With the angels
I wanna wake up with you
All in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

Cancel your reservations
No more hesitations, this is on
Can't make it stop
Give me all you got

I want it all or nothing
No more in-between
Now give your everything to me
Let's get real baby

A chemical reaction
Take me in your arms
And make me, ahhh
A-a-ahhh!

I wanna cut through the clouds
Break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof
You and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

I wanna play where you play
With the angels
I wanna wake up with you
All in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

Take me to emotion
I want to go all the way
Show me devotion
And take me all the way

Take me to emotion
I want to go all the way
Show me devotion
And take me all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way
Take me all the way, oh oh oh!

I wanna cut through the clouds
Break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof
You and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

I wanna play where you play
With the angels
I wanna wake up with you
All in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

I wanna cut through the clouds
Mmm, cut to the feeling
I wanna dance on the roof
Oh oh oh, yeah

I wanna cut to the feeling
I wanna cut to the feeling
