[Verse 1]
I watch my heart trapezing to the water
I clap my hands, as you were taking a bow
I sat and watched you leaving for an hour
I still canâ€™t believe it now


[Chorus 1]
It could have gone the other way
I could have been the one to make you stay
(Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I thought it would be you and I
Could have had a life supply
Or could have hit the bullseye
(Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Could have hit the bullseye

[Verse 2]
I saw my brother standing at the altar
I thought at you as they were taking their vows
I sat and watched this picture for an hour
I still believe somehow

[Chorus 1]
It could have gone the other way
I could have been the one to make you stay
(Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I thought it would be you and I
Could have had a life supply
Or could have hit the bullseye
(Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Could have hit the bullseye
Bullseye
Bullseye

[Bridge]
I could give you what you wanted
You never told me what you needed
I could give you what you wanted
Tell me what you need, tell me what you

[Chorus 2]
Cause it could have gone the other way
I could have been the one to make you stay
(Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Could have hit the bullseye
And I wish I was the other guy
I wish I was the one to make you cry
(Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Or could have hit the bullseye
And could have had a life supply
Or could have hit the bullseye
(Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't you know
Could have hit the bullseye
And, and, could have hit the bullseye
