Oh baby don't you go
You know I didn't mean it, darling
Sweet like the morning light
Gone late into the evening
All I want is to hold you
Make you rock away this feeling for me
Oh, baby, don't you go
You know I didn't mean it


Until I saw you in my thunderstorm
I didn't see
I wanna be the one that's in your arms
I wanna feel you

I never get to hold you
As long I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you
As long I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need

Oh, sugar, sugar, spice and all things nice
I'll be there for you
Just say you'll stay the night
I need you till the morning light
Cause oh darling don't you know
My only heart is beating for you
Oh, baby, don't you go
You know I didn't mean it

Until I saw you in my thunderstorm
I didn't see
I wanna be the one that's in your arms
I wanna feel you

I never get to hold you
As long I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you
As long I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need

But I don't think anybody understands you
The way I do, the way I do
I know you'll let it go to head
If I say I'll stay
I don't think anybody understands you
The way I do, the way I do
I know you'll let it go to head
If I say I'll stay

I never get to hold you
As long I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you
As long I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
