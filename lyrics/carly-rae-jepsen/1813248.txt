Make my house of bricks
And I'll stick here when the world
Comes crashing down around me


Make your arms a willow tree
And you can bend with me
Anywhere I'm going

Sometimes it's hard to see
Anything lovely
All the people around me
Going for the money and the money
And the ego

How can you ask me why
I need to know before I try?
I've got to be sure there's more
Than the money and the money
And the ego

Keep your eyes on me
And I'll look to you so I can see
What I am here for

Pull the wool over my eyes
Please kiss this day goodbye
Only you can get me going

Sometimes it's hard to see
Anything lovely
All the people around me
Going for the money and the money
And the ego

How can you ask me why

I need to know before I try?
I've got to be sure there's more
Than the money and the money
And the ego

When giving up is all you got
And giving up is all you want
You hear yourself say you lost the will
The power

When giving up is all you got
And giving up is all you want
Don't be afraid to sit down
In your shower
You can stay in there for hours

Make my house of bricks
And I'll stick here when the world
Comes crashing down around me

Sometimes it's hard to see
Anything lovely
All the people around me
Going for the money and the money
And the ego

How can you ask me why
I need to know before I try?
I've got to be sure there's more
Than the money and the money
And the ego
