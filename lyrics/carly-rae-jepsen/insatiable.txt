There's more to me than meets the eye
So come and look inside
Go deep
Cause beauty's more than skin deep
Don't need to know the kind of guy
Who's quick to drop the fly
Wam bam
That ain't who I am


Don't let-a-let my booty beauty
Be-the-be-the only reason you wanna ride
Nu oh, nu oh, nu uh oh
Don't let-a-let my hotty body
Jack the fact that I got a lota more in mind
Nu oh, nu oh, nu uh oh

(Chorus)
If it's just the physical
It would be sensational
But if you really got into me
You know you'd be insatiable

There's more to me than eye candy
And the part that you can't see
It's so sweet
Cause beauty's more than skin deep
If you took the time to get to know the real me
You'd know
I'm on another level

Don't let-a-let my booty beauty
Be-the-be-the only reason you wanna ride
Nu oh, nu oh, nu uh oh
Don't let-a-let my hotty body
Jack the fact that I got a lota more in mind
Nu oh, nu oh, nu uh oh

(Chorus)
If it's just the physical
It would be sensational
But if you really got into me
You know you'd be insatiable

Insatiable
Insatiable
Insatiable
More and more and more and more

You ain't seen nothing yet
Don't know what you get till you get
You ain't seen nothing yet
Don't know what you get till you get

(Chorus)
If it's just the physical
It would be sensational
But if you really got into me
You know you'd be insatiable
