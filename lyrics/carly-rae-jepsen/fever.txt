Don't tell me this is how it ends
I burn with fever that I caught from you
My breath was lost when you said "friends"
Well that could work but I'm still hot for you


So I stole your bike
And I rode all night
But I'm so damn scared
You don't even care

You wanna break my heart, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever
You want a brand new start, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

I've still been sleeping at my friend's
Chopped off your helmet and lock for me
I wrote some things I didn't send
Three words to say that meant a lot to me

So I rode your bike
To your house last night
And I'm so damn scared
Cause your car's not there

You wanna break my heart, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever
You want a brand new start, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

And my lights stay up, but your city sleeps
It's a different world when you're not here with me
Go on and break my heart tonight
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight

You wanna break my heart, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever
You want a brand new start, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

And my lights stay up, but your city sleeps
It's a different world when you're not here with me
Go on and break my heart tonight
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever
