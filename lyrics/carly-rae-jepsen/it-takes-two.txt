Mike WiLL Made-It


I wanna rock right now
I'm Lil Yachty, now I'm down if you're down
I'm not the most lyrical kid known
But I'm known to keep the party goin'
'Cause my team's the livest, bright as a fly is
King of the teens, I speak to all ages
We in sync while goin' through all phases
Positivity is what made us famous, well
So much endurance I shoulda ran track
Sauce so good, parme' still get a plaque
'Cause it takes two to carry all the big things
It takes two to end up with a shiny ring
'Cause it takes two to end up with the finer things
If you rush through the film you might miss the better scenes

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
(Hit it!)

Now look what you made do
You and me, baby, it takes two
Bringin' new moves to the old school
Time for the whole world to enjoy the view
We can go left, they can go right
Save me a dance for the end of the night
When I'm with you, it's a party
Don't care where we're goin'
The crew's on the floor and
One, and two, and three, and four

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
(Hit it!)

Yeah, yeah, Lil Boat!
It takes two to make a thing go right
When you're way too fly, team about to take flight
I don't know what you've been told
It takes two just like hot and cold
We go hand in hand like the sand and toes
It takes two just like silver and gold
Yeah, it takes two like the dice been rolled
Team too clean, we the new dream team
We just wanna dance, we just wanna have fun
Slow down, let it rock until the sun come
Wasn't much to share but we all had some
'Cause it takes two comin' from where I came from

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

A'ight now
Y'all know Mike WiLL, you know
When I count to three, I want you to get busy now
One, two, three, get loose now

It takes two, it takes two, it takes
It takes, it takes two
It takes, it takes two
It takes two, it takes two
It takes two, it takes two

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
(One, and two, and three, and four)
It takes two
