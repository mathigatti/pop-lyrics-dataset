I tried your mouth and I can’t come back
So little time and I’m way off track
I can’t stay away (away, away, away, away)
I can’t stay away (away, away, away, away)
The city’s so hard when you sleep alone
I need your hands when you drive me home
I can’t stay away (away, away, away, away)
I can’t stay away (away, away, away, away)


But I can’t take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body, how can I stay away?
And if my love’s too strong for you walk away
But I can’t make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body, how can I stay away?

Oh, if there was only an attraction
How come nobody ever felt this way?
If it was only a distraction
How come I can’t stay away?
Oh, you were a party to the action
I think nobody ever felt this way
If there was only a distraction
How come I can’t stay away?

Wherever I go I still see your face
So little time there’s no time to waste
I can’t stay away (away, away, away, away)
I can’t stay away (away, away, away, away)
Reading your mind’s getting hard to do
Breaking my heart if you don’t come through
I can’t stay away (away, away, away, away)
I can’t stay away (away, away, away, away)

But I can’t take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body, how can I stay away?
And if my love’s too strong for you walk away
But I can’t make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body, how can I stay away?

Oh, if there was only an attraction
How come nobody ever felt this way?
If it was only a distraction
How come I can’t stay away?
Oh, you were a party to the action
I think nobody ever felt this way
If there was only a distraction
How come I can’t stay away?

Those sweet summer lies
Your night after night
Come closer, I’ll hold you
(I need you now, now)
It’s still on my mind
Yeah, time after time
Come closer, come closer

Oh, if there was only an attraction
How come nobody ever felt this way?
If it was only a distraction
How come I can’t stay away?
Oh, you were a party to the action
I think nobody ever felt this way
If there was only a distraction
How come I can’t stay away?
