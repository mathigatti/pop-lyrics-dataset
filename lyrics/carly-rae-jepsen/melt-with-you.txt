If I could melt with you, I would
And find our way back to good
Tell the world to wait outside, just you and I
If I could hold on to your edge, and fall to your deepest dent
We would come true, if I could melt with you
(If I could melt with you)


I've been thinking about it, I know something's wrong
Fading out in the distance, we've been lost in the songs
Best turn the clocks to somewhere
We won't ever stop, don't ever leave

If I could melt with you, I would
And find our way back to good
Tell the world to wait outside, just you and I
And if I could hold on to your edge, and fall to your deepest dent
We would come true, if I could melt with you
(If I could melt with you)

Hearing echoes and voices, all I couldn't see
We have all kinds of choices
If it was uá¹— to me, I'd turn the clocks to somewhere
We won't ever stop, don't ever leave

If I could melt with you, I would
And find our way back to good
Tell the world to wait outside, just you and I
If I could hold on to your edge, and fall to your deepest dent
We would come trough, if I could melt with you

And every time that passes by, I see you, I see you
Ever now and then, I like to pretend

If I could melt with you, I would
And find our way back to good
Tell the world to wait outside,
If I could hold on to your edge, and fall to your deepest dent
We would come true, if I could melt with you
If I melt with you
If we could come true
If I melt with you
If we could come true
If I melt with you.
