Call out your persuasions
I got the feeling that you don't know what to say, it's a
A black dress occasion
Nobody's dying, it's a dinner not a date, but I
Feel young and inspired
That this is over and I'm hoping you'll agree so I
Phase out and smile over
That little phrase, it isn't you, baby, it's me


So take the tarot card and tell a fortune gold
The past heartbreaks, the lies we told, we tell again

Let's be friends then never speak again
It's cool, we can just pretend
We're friends and never speak again
See you soon, hope we can remain good friends

You take it, the bottle down
Man, this is easier than how I thought it'd go
You're smiling like a devil
You tell me you were coming here to let me know that
It's over when it's over
And it's over, baby

So take the tarot card and tell a fortune gold
The past heartbreaks, the lies we told, we tell again

Let's be friends then never speak again
It's cool, we can just pretend
We're friends and never speak again
See you soon, hope we can remain good friends

(Catch you later)
Never gonna see you again
(See you never)
Let's be friends
(Catch you later)
Never gonna see you again
(See you never)

I had a really nice time with you
I mean, you're sort of a dick sometimes but
Someone out there is surely gonna love a dick
Uh, check please?

Let's be friends then never speak again
It's cool, we can just pretend
We're friends and never speak again
See you soon, hope we can remain good friends

(Catch you later)
Never gonna see you again
(I'll see you never)
Let's be friends
(Catch you later)
Never gonna see you again
(I'll see you never)
Let's be friends

Let's be friends
Let's be
Friends
Not really though
