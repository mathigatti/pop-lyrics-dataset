I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me


Say it in a whisper
That baby it don't get much better
Would i like to see you again?

You name the day
And i will pick the city
We'll fly away
Till then, call me when you miss me
If you're asking if i'd really like to see you again
I say oh... just say when

Tell me that you feel it
This you and me together
No one would believe me
Even i cannot believe it

You kiss me like you mean it
Oh baby, it don't get much better
Would i like to see you again?

Darling just say when

You name the day
And i will pick the city
We'll fly away
Till then, call me when you kiss me
If you're asking if i'd really like to see you again
I say oh... just say when

Two different worlds
I thought they'd keep us apart
I'm ignoring my head
Follow my heart

Oh you pick the day
And i will pick the city
We'll fly away
Till then, call me when you miss me
I am willing to wait
Cause i just gotta see you again
Don't ask no... just say when

Just say when...

I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me
