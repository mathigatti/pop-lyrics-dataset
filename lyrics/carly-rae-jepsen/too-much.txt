Am I bad for you?
'Cause I live for the fire, and the rain, and the drama too, boy
And it feels like you never say what you want
And it feels like I can't get through, babe
Ooh, babe


'Cause when I get so low, it takes me higher (feel the love)
I'm not afraid to know my heart's desire, ooh ah!

When I party, then I party too much
When I feel it, then I feel it too much
When I'm thinking, then I'm thinking too much
When I'm drinking, then I'm drinking too much

I'll do anything to get to the rush
Now I'm dancing, and I'm dancing too much
So be careful if you're wanting this touch
'Cause if I love you, then I love you too much

Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?

Am I too close?
'Cause you fold into me like a heart with a beat
I know now, I know now
And did you know that I'm wild for your skin
And the dance that we're in, so close now, so close now

'Cause when I get so low, it takes me higher (feel the love)
I'm not afraid to know my heart's desire, ooh ah!

When I party, then I party too much
When I feel it, then I feel it too much
When I'm thinking, then I'm thinking too much
When I'm drinking, then I'm drinking too much

I'll do anything to get to the rush
Now I'm dancing, and I'm dancing too much
So be careful if you're wanting this touch
'Cause if I love you, then I love you too much

Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?

It's a hot and rainy season
It's hard to get to know me
Are you down d-down?
Down d-down

Trust the, trust the feeling
It's hard to get to know you
But I'm down d-down
I'm down d-down

When I party, then I party too much
When I feel it, then I feel it too much
When I'm thinking, then I'm thinking too much
When I'm drinking, then I'm drinking too much

I'll do anything to get to the rush
Now I'm dancing, and I'm dancing too much
So be careful if you're wanting this touch
'Cause if I love you, then I love you too much

Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?
