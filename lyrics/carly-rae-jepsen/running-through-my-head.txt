I think I'm in trouble
I can't see the end
I call you my lover, you call me your friend (friend)
I'm keeping it secret, yeah, even from you
I call you my lover
Oh, what can I do?


Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger with missing it
I just think we're overthinking it, I think we're overthinking it

You keep running through my head
Through my head, through my head, through my head
You keep running through my head, oh
You keep running through my head
Through my head, through my head, through my head
You keep running through my head, oh

I think I'm in trouble
I can't see the end
I call you my lover, you call me your friend (friend)
I'm keeping it secret, yeah, even from you
I call you my lover
Oh, what can I do?

Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger with missing it
I just think we're overthinking it, I think we're overthinking it
Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger with missing it
I just think we're overthinking it, don't think it over

You keep running through my head
Through my head, through my head, through my head
You keep running through my head, oh
You keep running through my head
Through my head, through my head, through my head
You keep running through my head, oh
