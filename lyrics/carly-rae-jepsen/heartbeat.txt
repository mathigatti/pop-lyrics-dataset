Thinking that I need you to go now
'Cause this could really get out of hand (oh, wow)
I’m hiding things I don't wanna show now (oh, wow)
'Cause I don’t know if you're ready for that


I was busy sleeping, sleeping with you
I thought I'd never feel this way, but I do

And I don't wanna tell you
Anything about me
'Cause everything about you
Is speeding up my heartbeat
And I don't wanna tell you
You're better off without me
'Cause everything about you
Is speeding up my, speeding up my
Speeding up my, speeding up my
Heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, heart

Everything’s a little bit clearer
How my body feels in your hands
It makes me want to get a little bit nearer (nearer, nearer)
Yeah, but I don’t know if you're ready for that

I was busy sleeping, sleeping with you
I thought I’d never feel this way, but I do

And I don't wanna tell you
Anything about me
'Cause everything about you
Is speeding up my heartbeat
And I don't wanna tell you
You’re better off without me
'Cause everything about you
Is speeding up my, speeding up my
Speeding up my, speeding up my
Heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, heart

I don't know if you should hear this
'Cause it's a mess inside my head
Maybe you should go instead
I'm suddenly scared of my feelings
This might be all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted to happen to me, to me, to me
You've been like a light
Like a light

And I don't wanna tell you
Anything about me
'Cause everything about you
Is speeding up my heartbeat
And I don't wanna tell you
You're better off without me
'Cause everything about you
Is speeding up my, speeding up my
Speeding up my, speeding up my
Heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, heart
