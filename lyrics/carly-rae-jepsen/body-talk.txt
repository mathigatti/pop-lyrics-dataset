Let me make your body talk
Let me drink you heart drunk
Let me dream your eyes shut
Let me get your mind off
Let me make your body talk


I want to feel you
Let me make your body talk
I could never heal you
Let me make your body talk

I want to feel you
I could never heal you
Let me make your body talk
