Everybody's talking, nobody's listening
Everybody's talking
Put me in the corner
Wanna hold you in my hands
Hold you in my hand
Hold you in my hand
Fill me in the darkness
'cause no one understands
No one understands
No one understands you


Turn me around and i've lost your face again
Where did you go? i'd swear he was just a friend
(please don't leave me)
Turn me around and i see your face again
(i can't hear a sound when you say my name)
I'm lost and i'm found in a stranger's arms again

Everybody's talking, nobody's listening
Everybody's talking
Rushing to the mirror
And i don't know who i see
How could anybody hurt you, babe
What's wrong with me?
Wrong with me, oh
'cause you might be gone
But your heart's not gone
But your love's not gone

Don't get jealous, dear
I start to disappear
I disappear, i disappear, i disappear, i disappear
Say what you wanna say
Be what you wanna be
I disappear, i disappear, i disappear, i disappear

Put me in a corner
Wanna hold you in my hands
Hold you in my hand
Hold you in my hand
