Listen, just leave or stay, but I'm done listening to it

If you're gonna go then go
She said to me on the phone
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems
If you're gonna stay then stay
He's not gonna change anyway
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems

And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
That I know what it looks like
From the outside
And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
That I know what it looks like
From the outside, from the outside

Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got them too
Boy trouble, you've got trouble
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend

Finally gotta let it go
She said to me on the phone
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems
It could be the perfect day
You'll just make it rain anyway
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems

And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
That I know what it looks like
From the outside
And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
That I know what it looks like
From the outside, from the outside

Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got them too
Boy trouble, you've got trouble
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend

What's worse?
Losin' a lover or losin' your best friend
What's worse is when you discover
You're not good for each other
She's been giving, you've been taking, taking, taking

Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got them too
Boy trouble, you've got trouble
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend

Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got them too
Boy trouble, you've got trouble
Don't know what to do
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got them too
Boy trouble, you've got trouble
Don't know what to do
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got them too
Boy trouble
