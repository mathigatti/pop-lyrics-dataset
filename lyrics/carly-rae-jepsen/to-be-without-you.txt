If you never see my face
You won’t see a trace of what I’m going through
And I’m going through
A lot for you
I can see that you don’t care
And I’m scared to fall without you
It’s so hard to fall
Without you


To be without you
A sea with no shore
To live without you
Is like a room without a door
And I keep wishing I could break free
If you would come back here
And free me

I’ve been living for your eyes
For that second you might turn to see me
Can you see me
Really see me
Now I see it’s all a lie
That I’ve lived inside my own illusion
All this meaning
Means nothing

To be without you
A sea with no shore
To live without you
Is like a room without a door
Oh, and I keep wishing I could break free
If you would come back here
And free me

I, I get so lonely
Oh, and
I am so lost
Lost, lost

So I get myself upright
Try to dream of anything but you tonight
‘Cause waking up
Is a losing fight
Yeah, the dream just doesn’t last
And I wake to realize the truth too fast
And I’m wishing
For my past

To be without you
A sea with no shore
To live without you
Is like a room without a door
Oh, and I keep wishing I could break free
If you would come back here
And free me

If you never see my face
You won’t see a trace of what I’m going through
And I’m going through
A lot for you
