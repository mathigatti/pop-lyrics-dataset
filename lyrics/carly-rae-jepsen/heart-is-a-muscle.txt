You gave my shirt back
I don't really get the meaning
It's like you're giving up before it all goes wrong
I've been told but I don't really like the feeling
I've been away, I've been away too long


I, I, I wanna go wherever you are
I, I, I wanna be wherever you are
I, I, I wanna see whatever you are

You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass but I think
Your heart is a muscle, your heart is a muscle
You gotta work it out make it stronger
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle, your heart is a muscle

(It's times like this you must recall)
Your heart is a muscle,
(It's times like this you must recall)
Your heart is a muscle

If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes
(It'll light up your eyes)

Wake up moon we spend the night alone together
You're a real good listener, but you don't have much to say
Wake up you, you won't pick up the phone whatever
You're probably sleeping, I hope we're still OK

I, I, I wanna go wherever you are
I, I, I wanna be wherever you are
I, I, I wanna see whatever you are

You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass but I think
Your heart is a muscle, your heart is a muscle
You gotta work it out make it stronger
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle, your heart is a muscle (stronger)

(It's times like this you must recall)
Your heart is a muscle
(It's times like this you must recall)
Your heart is a muscle (wake and light it up)

If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes

If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes

You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass but I think
Your heart is a muscle, your heart is a muscle
You gotta work it out make it stronger
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle, your heart is a muscle (stronger)

(It's times like this you must recall)
Your heart is a muscle (make it stronger)
(It's times like this you must recall)
Your heart is a muscle

If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes
