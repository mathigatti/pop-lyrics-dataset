Hold on now
This is gettin' kinda serious
This is gettin' kinda out of control
Out of control
Slow down now
Breathin' heavy when it's just a kiss
This is gettin' kinda out of my hands
Out of my hands


Please don't go
Look real close
Eyes that show
Kaleidoscopes

When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into your favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other

Should I stay?
Making love until the morning light
Making out like it's the end of the world
And I really wanna get it right
But it's gettin' hard to slow down
Got me feelin' like it's real for sure
This is gettin' kinda out of my head
I'm out of my head

Cause when I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other

Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up

Please don't go
Look real close
Eyes that show
Kaleidoscopes

When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other

Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
