Sunshine 
On my shoulders 
Makes me happy
Sunshine 
In my eyes 
Can makes me cry


Sunshine 
On the water 
Looks so lovely
Sunshine 
Almost always 
Makes me high

If I had a day 
That I 
Could give you
I would give you 
A day 
Sure to make 
You smile

Sunshine 
On my shoulders 
Makes me happy
Sunshine 
Almost always 
Makes me high

If I had a day 
That I 
Could give you
I would give 
To you 
A day 
Just like today

And if i had a song
That i 
Could sing for you
I would sing a song
To make you 
Feel this way

Sunshine
Sunshine

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

Sunshine 
On my shoulders 
Makes me happy
(Sweet sunshine)
Sunshine 
Almost always 
Makes me cry

Sunshine 
On my shoulders 
Makes me happy
Sunshine 
Almost always 
Makes me high

Sunshine 
On my shoulders 
Makes me happy
Sunshine 
Almost always 
Makes me high
