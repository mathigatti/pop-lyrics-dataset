I don't care about your good intentions
I care more about your bad dreams
I want a love on a new dimension
You know I'm gonna be


Under the blossom tree
Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me?
You're my miracle

In your black heart, is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart, is where you'll find me
Waiting, oh

You think love is a destination
Like a show on your TV
You'll cry to your generation
But don't you cry to me

Under the blossom tree
Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me?
You're my miracle

In your black heart, is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart, is where you'll find me
Waiting, oh

In your black heart, is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart, is where you'll find me
Waiting, oh

Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, now it's happening (black heart)
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, under the blossom tree (black heart)

Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, now it's happening (black heart)
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, under the blossom tree (black heart)
