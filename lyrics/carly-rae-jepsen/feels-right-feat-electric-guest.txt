Feels good waking up in your way
My heart needed a holiday
I bet we can make things slide into Monday
I've been living with no regrets
Love was just a night at best
Two step, making the weekend slide into something


One more night with you always turns to two
I can't help it 'cause it feels right when it feels right

'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I'd do, boy, anything to step with you

True fact
Baby, I love you back, don't ask
Nothing I want to say
We know timing isn't right (maybe one day)
'Til then, steal me a free weekend
You're my complicated friend
I'm just keeping the dream alive
But I must say

One more night with you always turns to two
I can't help it 'cause it feels right, when it feels right

'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
And I do, boy, anything to step with you

Feels like I've been wasting time
Look at all the things I've left behind
You're the one to change my mind
'Cause it feels right when it feels right
I don't know a thing I've done
Livin' all my life with no damn one
You're the one to change my mind
'Cause it feels right, when it feels right

'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I do, boy, anything to step with you
