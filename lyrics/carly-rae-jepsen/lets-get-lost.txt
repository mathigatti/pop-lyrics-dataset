I was never one to want to
Put my trust in someone else completely
And I was always one to want to
Up and run when someone said they needed me


But you
You could be the one
You could be the one

Baby let's go get lost
I like the way you're drivin' slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home

Baby let's take the long way home

I was always shy and careful
I was sure that you would never look at me
Never wanted to discourage
Everything your eyes encouraged silently

But you
You could be the one
You could be the one

Baby let's go get lost
I like the way you're drivin' slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home

Baby let's take the long way home
Baby let's take the long way home

Let's get lost (let's get lost)
You wanna get lost? (you wanna get lost?)
Let's get lost (let's get lost)
I wanna get lost

Oh Baby let's go get lost
I like the way you're drivin' slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home

Baby let's take the long way home
Baby let's take the long way home
