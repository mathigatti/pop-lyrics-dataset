Home tonight,
Rest my head,
In my single childhood bed
Close my eyes,
Count to three,
Wish that you were here with me


Last year when my hand were cold,
You were always there to hold

So give me your warmest pair,
Your strongest pair of mittens, please

Something to get me through
The loneliness of Christmas Eve
I've fell for you like crazy
And I can't get thoughts of you

From me
So give me your warmest pair
your strongest pair
Of mitten please

By my table I survive
Fix the makeup from my eyes
Fake a smile so they will see
Wish that you were here with me

Last year when my hands were cold,
You were always there to hold

So give me your warmest pair,
Your strongest pair of mittens, please

Something to get me through,
The loneliness of Winter, see
I fell for you like crazy,
And I can't get thoughts of you,
From me

So give me your warmest pair,
Your strongest pair of mittens, please

Shine your name,
Through the snow storm, baby,
You can break me,
To the bone, oh

I was wrong,
You were wrong to make me,
Feel like I was all alone,

Walking through my old home town
No one else but me around
Make an angel in the snow
Pray that I can let you go

I fell for you like crazy,
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me

So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair
Your warmest pair

See, I fell for you like crazy
And and I can't get thoughts of you, from me

So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens
Please
