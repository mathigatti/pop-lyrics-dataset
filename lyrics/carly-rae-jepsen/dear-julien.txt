Dear julien, don't make it hard
I wonder, did you read the letter that I sent you? Oh oh
So why do we have to go?
Living in a cave of snow
Didn't have the heart
Didn't have the heart
Didn't have the heart at all

Smells like daffodils feels like winter
It feels like winter
You got through to me
Definitely yah
Just a splinter
But why do we have to go, why do we have to go? (oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Dear julien, don't make it hard
I wonder, did you read the letter that I sent you oh oh
So why do we have to go
Living in a cave of snow
Didn't have the heart
Didn't have the heart
Didn't have the heart at all

La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

Looks like love but it feels like lyin'
Feels like lyin!
You got through to me
Definitely yah
Oh no, denying
So why do we have to go, why do we have to go? (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Why do we have to go? Living in a cave of snow

Dear julien, don't make it hard
I wonder, did you read the letter that I sent you oh oh
So why do we have to go
Living in a cave of snow
Didn't have the heart
Didn't have the heart
Didn't have the heart at all

La la la la la la la la la la la

One more day, and I'll be sorry
Two more days then you'll be sorry
Three more days then we'll be sorry
Really really sorry

One more day, and I'll be sorry
Two more days then you'll be sorry
Three more days then we'll be sorry
Really really sorry

One more day, and I'll be sorry
Two more days then you'll be sorry
Three more days then we'll be sorry
Really really sorry

One more day, and I'll be sorry
Two more days then you'll be sorry
Three more days then we'll be sorry
Sorry
