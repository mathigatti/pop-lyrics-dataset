Slow down.. This night's a perfect shade of
Dark blue (dark blue)
Have you ever been alone
In a crowded room when I'm here with you
I said the world could be burning down
Dark blue (dark blue)


Have you ever been alone
In a crowded room well I'm here with you
I said the world could be burning
'Til there's nothing but dark blue
Just dark blue

This flood (this flood) is slowly
Rising up swallowing the ground
Beneath my feet, tell me how
Anybody thinks under this condition so
I'll swim (I'll swim) as the water rises up

The sun is sinking down
And now all I can see are the planets in a row
Suggesting it's best that I slow down
