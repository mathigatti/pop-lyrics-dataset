You were there and then you left
And now there's nobody, nobody
Now there are only second best
There's nobody, nobody


So if you want me
I'll be around
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
Just hold me closer
Oh won't you hold me down tonight

But if you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
Wrapped around my finger
You know what I mean
You make my heart sings
If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it
This is the real thing
Wrapped around my finger
You know what I mean
You make my heart

When you're near I feel the best
I'm somebody, somebody
It's in my pulse, It's in my chest
My whole body, my whole body

So if you want me
I'll be around
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
Just hold me closer
Oh won't you hold me down tonight

But if you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
Wrapped around my finger
You know what I mean
You make my heart sings
If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it
This is the real thing
Wrapped around my finger
You know what I mean
You make my heart sing

You're in the country
While I'm in the town
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
And I wanna be there
For you tonight
And I hope you hear me
But I hold on tight
Hold on tight
Yea

If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding string
Wrapped around my finger
You know what I mean
So if you want me
I'll be around
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
Just hold me closer
Oh won't you hold me down tonight

But if you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
Wrapped around my finger
You know what I mean
You make my heart sing
If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it
This is the real thing
Wrapped around my finger
You know what I mean
You make my heart sing
