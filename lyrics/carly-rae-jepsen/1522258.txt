Hot pink skies, twilight of the day
I think that i've been going bout this the wrong way
Kids on my street got it right man,
Barefoot hide and seek
My best friend she lives up the road
Haven't talked to her in weeks


Oh time don't blind me, i am so sorry
I've been swept up in my own concerns
And the worldly matters, they just don't matter at all
No, not at all

I keep on walking i stop
Ditching all my plans
I want to climb that cedar tree and leave me in good hands
What happened to me on the way to something higher
What will be left when i have all that i desire?

Oh time don't blind me, i am so sorry
I've been swept up in my own concerns
And the worldly matters, they just don't matter at all
No, not at all
No, not at all
