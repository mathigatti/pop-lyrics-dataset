Found myself in the crazy place
I wouldn't wanna see my worst enemy there
Everyone around was two-faced
And pretty soon, I wore my mask as well


Then you came around
Tell me, how could I keep my distance?
But finally, I found my way to love against all resistance

I can feel the sun on you
Warm me up the way you do
After all the clouds have dried
Here's a jar of tears I cried
Keep it in a sacred place
Hold me with your humble grace
'Cause I can feel the darkness sometimes too
But I can feel the sun on you
But I can feel the sun on you

Come through the highest high
I wouldn't wanna see my worst enemy there
Started thinking I could fly
An angel smiled and said, "hey, are you well?"

Then you came around
Tell me, how could I keep my distance?
But finally, I found my way to love against all resistance

I can feel the sun on you
Warm me up the way you do
After all the clouds have dried (after all the clouds)
Here's a jar of tears I cried
Keep it in a sacred place
Hold me with your humble grace
Cause I can feel the darkness sometimes too
But I can feel the sun on you
But I can feel the sun on you
Feel the sun on you

Whoa, whoa
I feel the sun on you
I feel the sun on you (I feel the sun on you)
Whoa, whoa
I feel the sun
I feel the sun on you

Look at all the things we know
Water it and let it grow
After all the clouds have dried
Look at how the world survives
Lucky in the kindest way
'Cause I can feel everything you say
And you can feel the darkness sometimes soon
But I can feel the sun on you
