I used to be in love with you
You used to be the first thing on my mind
I know I’m just a friend to you
That I will never get to call you mine


But I still love you, I’m sorry
I’m sorry, I love you
I didn’t mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it
I tried not to feel it
But I can’t get you out of my head

And I want you to miss me
When I’m not around you
I know that you’re in town
Oh, won't you come around
To the spot that we met?

I’m not the type of girl for you
And I’m not going to pretend
That I’m the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I’d break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I’m not the type of girl you call more than a friend

I bet she acts so perfectly
You probably eat up every word she says
And if you ever think of me
I bet I’m just a flicker in your head

But I still love you, I’m sorry
I’m sorry, I love you
I didn’t mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it
I tried not to feel it
But I can’t get you out of my head

And I want you to miss me
When I’m not around you
I know that you’re in town
Oh, won't you come around
To the spot that we met?

I’m not the type of girl for you
And I’m not going to pretend
That I’m the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I’d break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I’m not the type of girl you call more than a friend

I’ll make time for you
I’ll make time for you

I love you, I’m sorry
I’m sorry, I love you
I didn’t mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it
I tried not to feel it
But I can’t get you out of my head

I’m not the type of girl for you
And I’m not going to pretend
That I’m the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I’d break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I’m not the type of girl you call more than a friend

I’ll make time for you
I’ll make time for you
I’ll make time for you
I’ll make time for you
