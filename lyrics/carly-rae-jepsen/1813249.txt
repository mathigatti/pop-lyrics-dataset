New York, tell me how you feel about it
We just met yeah, we just met
L.A. ask me for the truth about it
We just met and I wish we could be holding hands
I wish we could be holding hands


How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are there's a place I wanna go
Dancing really high, dancing really slow
How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are there's a place I wanna go
Dancing really high, dancing really slow

Heavy, do you ever think about us watching TV in your bed?
Hey London, call me if you think about it
And don't forget, I wish we could be holding hands
I wish we could be holding hands

How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are there's a place I wanna go
Dancing really high, dancing really slow
How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are there's a place I wanna go
Dancing really high, dancing really slow

You better draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to your lover's heart for me, for me

How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are there's a place I wanna go
Dancing really high
How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are there's a place I wanna go
Dancing really high, dancing really slow
I wish we could be holding hands
Dancing really high, dancing really slow

Dancing really slow
