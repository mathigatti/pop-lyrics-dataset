I think I'm in trouble, I can't see the end
I call you my lover, you call me your friend
I keep it a secret, yeah even from you
I call you my lover, oh what can I do?


I've been lonely baby, I
I've been hangin' on the line
Been hangin' on the line
And if you love me baby
Don't, don't, don't hang up this time
Cause you know

Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger, you're missing it
I just think we're overthinking it
I think we're overthinking it

Used to be perfect, that we could be free
To do what we wanted, you do it to me
We only just started, don't say it's the end
So call me your lover, don't call me your friend

I've been lonely baby, I
I've been hangin' on the line
Been hangin' on the line
And if you love me baby
Don't, don't, don't hang up this time
Cause you know

Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger, you're missing it
I just think we're overthinking it
I think we're overthinking it
Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger, you're missing it
I just think we're overthinking it
Don't think it over

I just think we're overthinking it
Don't think it over
I just think we're overthinking it
Don't think it over
I just think we're overthinking it
Don't think it over
I just think we're overthinking it
Don't think it over

Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger, you're missing it
I just think we're overthinking it
I think we're overthinking it
