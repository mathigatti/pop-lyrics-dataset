For some time
I’ve been waiting for your star to shine so bright
I should say that it’s your right to hurt me, baby
If you wanted to, oh, but love isn’t cruel
And for some time
I’ve been singing you a lullaby
Each night whispering that it’s your right to hurt me baby
If you wanted to, oh, but love isn’t cruel


That’s why we got to hold on, baby
We could believe that this love isn’t crazy
This loving could save me
This love isn’t crazy (this love, it isn’t crazy)
You gotta stand where (stand where) I stand
Who could believe that you’re holding my hand now?
This loving could save me
This love isn’t crazy (this love, it isn’t crazy)

For some time
I’ve been pillow talking in my head
My heart’s vulnerable, but in my bed, I want you, baby
And all you put me through, oh, but love isn’t cruel

The other night I swear I saw you in my dream, dream
We didn’t say too much, but I understood everything
That you could hurt me baby, and I could hurt you too
Oh, but love isn’t cruel (hold on, hold on)

That’s why we got to hold on, baby
We could believe that this love isn’t crazy
This loving could save me
This love isn’t crazy (this love, it isn’t crazy)
You gotta stand where (stand where) I stand
Gimme the seasons, I'm holding your hand now
This loving could save me
This love isn’t crazy (this love, it isn’t crazy)

And I want, babe (and I want you back)
And I feel it (and I feel it bad)
(I know it and I feel it, and this love it isn’t crazy)
Every day, want you more, we were so insecure
Every day, learning more, we were so immature
Want, babe (and I want you back)
And I feel it (and I feel it bad)
(I know it and I feel it, and this love it isn’t crazy)
Every day, want you more, we were so insecure
Every day, learning more, we were so immature

That’s why we got to hold on, baby
We could believe that this love isn’t crazy
This loving could save me
This love isn’t crazy (this love, it isn’t crazy)
You gotta stand where (stand where) I stand
Gimme the seasons, I'm holding your hand now
This loving could save me
This love isn’t crazy (this love, it isn’t crazy)
