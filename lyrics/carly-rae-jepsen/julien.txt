Woke up this mornin'
It feels like every day
I got the blues, babe
Not going away
Another bad dream
Where you were running away
I'm forever haunted by our time


We had our moment
We had our summertime
Asked me to leave with you
But I could never decide
I've been so torn up
I've been so out of it
I'm forever haunted by our time

I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night I pray
When you coming home? Coming home?
'Cause I've been livin' for that day

Julien, in your heart, yeah, you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering: Julien
I'll be whispering: Julien
To the last breath that I breathe

I tried another
To keep me satisfied
But all your colors are
Still dancing in my mind
More than just lovers, ah
I'm forever haunted by our time

I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night I pray
When you coming home? Coming home?
'Cause I've been livin' for that day

Julien, in your heart, yeah, you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering: Julien
I'll be whispering: Julien
To the last breath that I breathe

(Julien, in your heart yeah you must believe)
(Julien, it was more than a fantasy)
(To the end, to the last breath that I breathe)

Julien, in your heart, yeah, you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering: Julien
I'll be whispering: Julien
To the last breath that I breathe
