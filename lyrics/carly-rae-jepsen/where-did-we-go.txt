If I could read your mind
I would've thought we’re doing fine
With no one better beside me
No no
So baby baby where did you go?


If you could read my mind
I’ve been talking to my pillow every night
Cuz I’ve been waiting for something more than
The way that we’ve been going
So baby now I’m going

Chorus:

Baby baby where’d you go?
I-I’ve been waiting for you
Maybe maybe you should know
That I look back, but you never look back
And maybe we can talk it through
Cuz’ I’m still living my life for you
Baby baby
Where did we go?
Ooo
Oh oh

Well I don’t see what’s wrong (you were so so right)
I never did and now it’s gone
But if it’s not me, it’s not you
Tell me how we got to
The way that we’ve been going
So baby now I’m going

Chorus:

Baby baby where’d you go?
I-I’ve been waiting for you
Maybe maybe you should know
That I look back, but you never look back
And maybe we can talk it through
Cuz’ I’m still living my life for you
Baby baby
Where did we go?
Ooo
Oh oh

I never saw the sign
Open up your eyes and recognize me
Would you recognize me?
It’s harder to define
What it is inside
That’s what that guides me
What is it that guides me from you?

Where did you go?
If I could read your mind

Chorus:

Baby baby where’d you go?
I-I’ve been waiting for you
Maybe maybe you should know
That I look back, but you never look back
And maybe we can talk it through
Cuz’ I’m still living my life for you

Baby baby where’d you go? (where did go)
I-I’ve been waiting for you

Where did we go?
I-I’ve been waiting for you

Where did we go?
I-I’ve been waiting for you

Baby baby
Where did we go?
Ooo
Oh oh
