In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
It's the way i feel inside


Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step i take i seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

I'll never let you down
And i'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'm just a step away

I'll never let you down
And i'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'm just a step, just a step, just a step away

It's the beating of your heart
It's the tear i have to hide
It's the sound of your guitar
It's the way i feel inside

Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step i take i seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

I'll never let you down
And i'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'm just a step away

I'll never let you down
And i'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'm just a step, just a step, just a step away

If you need a shoulder
Or someone to hold you
I'll keep my arms open wide
I'll be the one who loves you
I'll be right there by your side

Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step i take i seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

I'll never let you down (i'll never let you down)
And i'll never go away (and i'll never go away)
And if your ever feeling down (and if your ever feeling down)
I'm just a step away

I'll never let you down
And i'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'm just a step away

I'll never let you down
And i'll never go away
And if your ever feeling down
I'm just a step, just a step, just a step away

In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
It's the way i feel inside
