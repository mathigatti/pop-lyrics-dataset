Lover of mine
I thought I'll come 'round
I'm high as a kite when I'm with him
All of the time


He's real hot, I need it all the time (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Maybe this time isn't right, I don't even mind (ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I don't hate California after all
And I don't hate California after all

Love on the beach and the tide is high
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Moon and the water and the open sky
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

And now that he noticed
I thought of him 'round
He's all kind of heartless and heartless
I know he's down

He's real hot, I need it all the time (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Maybe this time isn't right, I don't even mind (ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I don't hate California after all
And I don't hate California after all

Love on the beach and the tide is high
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Moon and the water and the open sky
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I just wanna say
Another night, another day
We could watch to make
We could play like children play

Love on the beach and the tide is high
(Love on the beach and the tide is high)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Moon and the water and the open sky
(Moon and the water and the open sky)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Love on the beach and the tide is high
(Love on the beach and the tide is high)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Moon and the water and the open sky
(Moon and the water and the open sky)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
