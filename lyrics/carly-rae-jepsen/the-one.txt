Two fears I never thought of us together
He's just a friend of mine
We should know better
This can't last forever
Kiss me one more time


Romance is fine, pour me some wine
Tell me it's just for the fun of it
Far from your eyes, hard to deny when
I don't want love, don't want none of it

If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one

We're cookin' dinner, I wear your socks and slippers
It's been a long, long day
It's just so easy, love the way you read me
I never have to say

Romance is fine, pour me some wine
Tell me it's just for the fun of it
Far from your eyes, hard to deny when
I don't want love, don't want none of it

If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one

Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love

If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one
