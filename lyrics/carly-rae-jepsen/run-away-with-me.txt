You're stuck in my head, stuck in my heart
Stuck in my body, body
I wanna go, get out of here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you, ooh


This is the part you gotta say
All that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag, leaving tonight
While everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'd run away with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me

Up in the clouds, high as a kite
Over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try
When you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
And I wanna be there with you, ooh

Oh, baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Oh, baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me

Hold on to me
I never wanna let you go
Run away with me, oh
Run away with me
Over the weekend
We could turn the world to gold
Run away with me, oh
Run away with me

(We could turn the world to gold, oh)
Over the weekend
We could turn the world to gold, oh

Oh, my baby, take me to the feeling (take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner in secret
Oh, when the lights go out
Run away with me (just run away)
Run away with me (with me)
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me

Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
