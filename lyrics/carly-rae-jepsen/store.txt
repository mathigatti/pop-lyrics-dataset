Sunlight, moves upon my skin
Wake up and I'm next to you
But I wish that I was next to him
Looks like this could be the end
Know that you'll be alright
Maybe one day we'll be friends
But you know me, I'm


I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly
Ask where we're going, oh, I
Can't talk about it, can't talk about it cause

I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store

Don't cry
I can't play pretend
Wish it hadn't come to this
But you know there's some things you can't mend
But you know me, I

I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly
Ask where we're going, oh, I
Can't talk about it, can't talk about it cause

I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store

Alright, I'm so alright this time
I just wanna say: I'm sorry
I just wanna say: I'm sorry
Alright, I'm so alright this time
I just wanna say: I'm sorry
I just wanna say: I'm sorry

I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly

I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
