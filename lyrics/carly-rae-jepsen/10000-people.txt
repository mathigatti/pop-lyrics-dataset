Still obsessed with vanity
The young girl I'm meant to be
The surface is no place for me
I've tiptoed around the truth until my anger took a stand and said
Freedom, would you please define, is your dream to seize mine?
Just a pretty girl, with pretty things
What will you do when I was crashing into all the joy and hurt?
It rains, oh


Go outside
Look to the sky
Ten billion stars, yeah, I'm blinded by city lights
Here I was dreaming that this was my life
When 10,000 people are falling in love tonight
And I feel it (I feel it)
And I feel it (I feel it)
And I feel it (I feel it)

The taxi home, your giant bed
The books you flipped through you never read
The big wide world you map and framed
That song where you know all the words
You never stop, you never heard
That person's reaching out to you
Stop crossing off your list of things to do
There's so much to see through, this life's [?]

Go outside (go outside)
Look to the sky
Ten billion stars, yeah, I'm blinded by city lights
Here I was dreaming that this was my life
When 10,000 people are falling in love tonight
And I feel it (I feel it)
Ooh, and I feel it (I feel it)
And I feel it (I feel it)
Can you feel it? (I can feel it)

I'm by myself tonight
But I don't feel alone
I'm by myself tonight (I'm by myself tonight)
I'm feeling right at home

Go outside (go outside)
Look to the sky (look to the sky)
Ten billion stars, yeah, I'm blinded by city lights
Here I was dreaming that this was my life
When 10,000 people are falling in love tonight
And I feel it (I feel it)
Ooh, and I feel it (I feel it)
And I feel it (I feel it)
Can you feel it? (I can feel it)

Your money reaches past the mark
Just spoke of all those romeos you thought you want
Leave you standing in the mirror
Something must be wrong with me, why do I [?]
I never knew love would be what you've shown me
(Romeo)
Shown me
