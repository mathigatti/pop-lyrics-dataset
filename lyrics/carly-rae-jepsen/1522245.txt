Sour candy endings
Coffee stains but where?
Oh I'm so tangled up in my
Big sunglasses and bed hungry second day fare


No we went under, the weight was too much to carry on
I felt the thunder
Mister don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew
That I could be so sad we went under

I've been very cautious
Trying numbness instead of pain
All your humour makes me, makes me nauseous
What a twisted twisted twisted game

No we went under, the weight was too much to carry on
I felt the thunder
Mister don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew
That I could be so sad we went under

Oh get yourself home
You leave him alone
On second thought I regret the pink stiletto
Ohh oohh ooo

Sour candy endings...and I was barely even there

No we went under, the weight was to much to carry on
I felt the thunder
Mister don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew
That I could be so sad (we went under)
So sad (we went under)
So sad (we went under)
So sad (we went under)
So sad we went under
