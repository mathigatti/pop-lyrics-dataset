Now you're in love, I can see you sold out
Where was I picked, but you cut my eyes out
He's so hypnotizingâ€”said every girl you ever met
When I lose, when I lose, I hold out


You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but you're living for her
I go crazy, see red when she's touching you now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

Tell me all, I'm jealous of that night watch
I'm the voyeur searching through my laptop
It's so truth defying, everything you ever said
Right or wrong, right or wrong, I won't stop

You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but you're living for her
I go crazy, see red when she's touching you now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

(Ah) I'll be your girl
(Ah) I'll be your girl
(Ah) I'll be your girl
(Ah) Come to bed, I'll be your girl

Standing at your door, calling out your name
Find me in the dark, find me here again
I got nothing left, like a little protest
Banging on your door, calling out your name
Find me in your heart, find me here again
I got nothing left, like a little protest

You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but you're living for her
I go crazy, see red when she's touching you, now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

(Ah) All I mean is I'm going out of breath
(Ah) For the way that I feel when you hold me like that
(Ah) All I pray is I'm getting over it
(Ah) I'll trade places today if you love me like that
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
