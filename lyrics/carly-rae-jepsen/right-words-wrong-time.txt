We put everything away
California wasn't made for you
Hate the traffic in LA
I drove through it all to get to you


Took a million miles to feel the final separation
Don't you tell me now you know what you need
I need to find a love to love me with no hesitation
Don't you tell me now you're ready for me

My baby, my baby
You always got the right words at the wrong time
This time, it's heartbreaking
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong

I don't wanna see your face
I'm afraid I couldn't wait for you
I'm afraid that I would break
Only want me when I'm leaving you

Took a million miles to feel the final separation
Don't you tell me now you know what you need
I need to find a love to love me with no hesitation
Don't you tell me now you're ready for me

My baby, my baby
You always got the right words at the wrong time
This time, it's heartbreaking
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong time

Baby boy, you've always got the right words
But you always say them at the wrong time
(It's getting late, I gotta say now)
Baby boy, you've always got the right words
(That you should go, yeah, you should go home)
But you always say them at the wrong time
(It's getting late)

My baby (it's getting late)
My baby (and you should go, and you should go)
You always got the right words at the wrong time
(It's getting late)
This time, it's heartbreaking (it's getting late now)
(And you should go, and you should go)
You always got the right words at the wrong time
(And you should go, you should go)
For me, for me
(And you should go, you should go)
You always got the right words at the wrong time
(And you should go, you should go)
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong time
