This is the remix
Carly!


I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crash it in my hands
Make you plead and cry
As you give up all the lies

We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Over you, over you

Stuck in a real bad dream
And man it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms
But I'm begging at your feet
It's been a real hard night
And I just hold my pillow tight
It won't love me back, no
It's not you and I

We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you

[NIcki Minaj]
Tonight I'm getting over
Meditate and do my yo-gerr
Then I pull up to the club in a roverr
A celine bag on my shoulderr
I said rr
Cock that; Revolver
RR-RR that's that nostal-gerr
I said I'm number one, I'm a son of a gun
And runner up is what they called ya
Ain't trying to be mean but, I am the queen, yuh
Ain't fuckin' with no fuck boys!
Get me get me, should've got me then
Cause I would wear 4 real and you would rock pretend
Yo, can I get another dose of my oxygen
Cause I been breathin' all this motherfuckin' toxin in!

Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Over you, over you
We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
Pretty gang
To get me through
Rich Gang, Young Money
I'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new
Nicki Minaj
I see you Carly

Tonight I'm getting over you
