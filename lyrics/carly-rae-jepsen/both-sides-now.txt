Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
Feather cannons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way


Now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things i would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds illusions i recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy, dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes true
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's loves illusions i recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say i love you right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads
They say i've changed
Well somethings lost and somethings gained in living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and loose and still somehow
It's lifes illusions i recall
I really don't know life

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds illusions i recall
I really don't know clouds at all

I really don't know life at all
