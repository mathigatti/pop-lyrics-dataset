When you smile like a tease baby you don't even know
You don't even know
And my heart skips a beat darlin' every time you go
Every time you go
When you walk into the room
I can't speak and I can't move
You don't see me
But you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?


I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Everyday is just a "wish I could"
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

All the girls on the block they come knocking at your door
Knocking at your door
You just stare out the window, what you waiting for?
But Is it too late or too soon?
Right outside there wanting you
You don't see me
But you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Everyday is just a "wish I could"
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

Imagine you,
Imagine me
Together so happily
Imagine me,
Imagine you
Inside a dream I built for two

When you walk into the room
I can't speak and I can't move
You don't see me
But you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Everyday is just a wish I could
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

Why you gotta make it hurt so good?
