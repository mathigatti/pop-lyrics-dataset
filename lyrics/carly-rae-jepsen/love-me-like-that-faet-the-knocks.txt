I hear thunder in the distance
And it hits me in an instant
Crashing through my heart and I'm blown apart
You don't love me like that, you don't love me like that


I feel the cool winter coming in before the summer rain
I see the sky staring into the blue like it's not gonna end
Remember we needed all our days and nights
To get enough of us, to satisfy?
We played that out a thousand times

Now I hear thunder in the distance
And it hits me in an instant
Crashing through my heart and I'm blown apart
You don't love me like that (you don't love me like that)
Yeah, I hear thunder in the distance
And the storm is in our system
I've been shaken out I can see it now
You don't love me like that (you don't love me like that)

I feel the cool winter coming in before the summer rain
I see the sky staring into the blue like it's not gonna end
Remember we had a force like oh, my God?
Too fast, too strong, too hard to stop
Remember when we couldn't get enough?

Now I hear thunder in the distance
And it hits me in an instant
Crashing through my heart and I'm blown apart
You don't love me like that (you don't love me like that)
Yeah, I hear thunder in the distance
And the storm is in our system
I've been shaken out; I can see it now
You don't love me like that (you don't love me like that)

No, you don't love me (no, you don't love me like that, that, that)
You don't love (you don't love me like that, that)
No, you don't love me like that (no, you don't love me like that, that, that)
(You don't love me like that, that) you don't love me, you don't love me, baby
(No, you don't love me like that, that, that) no, no, no
(You don't love me like that, that) no, no, no
(No, you don't love me like that, that, that) no, no, oh
(You don't love me like that, that)

(No, you don't love me like that, that, that)
(You don't love me like that, that)
(No, you don't love me like that, that, that)
(You don't love me like that, that)

I hear thunder in the distance
And it hits me in an instant
Crashing through my heart and I'm blown apart
You don't love me like that (you don't love me like that)
Yeah, I hear thunder in the distance
And the storm is in our system
I've been shaken out; I can see it now
You don't love me like that, oh (you don't love me)

No, you don't love me like that, that
No, you don't love, no, you don't love
No, you don't love me like that
No, you don't love, no, you don't love
