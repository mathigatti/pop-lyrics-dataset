When all the lights out (hey), where you going?
I keep a window, for ya, it's always open
I'm like a lighthouse, I'm a reminder of where you going
I'm in your head now, I'm every second now
Is your love growing?


Oh, with you (hey), a girl could get bolder
I just wanna get a little bit closer
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no (hey), the night's not over
I just wanna get a little bit closer (a little bit closer)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (hey)

(I want you in my room)
On the bed, on the floor
(I want you in my room)
I don't care anymore
I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window
(I want you in my room)
Baby, don't you want me, too?

When no one loves you like they really mean it
I got you covered, under covers
Can you feel it?

Oh, with you (hey), a girl could get bolder
I just wanna get a little bit closer
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no (hey), the night's not over
I just wanna get a little bit closer (a little bit closer)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (hey)

(I want you in my room)
On the bed, on the floor
(I want you in my room)
I don't care anymore
I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window
(I want you in my room)
Baby, don't you want me, too?

Baby, don't you want me, too?
On the bed, on the floor
Slide on through my window
Baby, don't you want me, too?
