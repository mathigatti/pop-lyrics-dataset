Speak to me
You're walking closer and it's hard to breathe
I should be running but the heart's naive
And not expect too much
You were good to me
I left a scar that no one else can see
And now you're back here and reminding me
That I lost way too much


And you know that night I almost said I loved you
And you almost said it back

Are we gonna be more than a memory?
No matter how lame my apology
I let go of you,
You let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand in front of me
Pretending i'm not your destiny
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

Say my name
Cause no one else can say it quite the same
It takes me back to your September days
I've missed you way too much
If I was good to you
But just to hear it breaks my heart in two
If there's a way to make it up to you
I'd wanna change so much you know I do

And you know that night I almost said I loved you
And you almost said it back

Are we gonna be more than a memory?
No matter how lame my apology
I let go of you,
You let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand in front of me
Pretending i'm not your destiny
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

Stay with me
I really need to hear you breathe
If words can't speak
Lay your body next to me

Are we gonna be more than a memory?
No matter how lame my apology
I let go of you,
You let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand in front of me
Pretending i'm not your destiny
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

More than a memory
Lame my apology

I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
