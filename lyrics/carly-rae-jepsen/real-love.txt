The world is going crazy
And it feels like I just don't know who to trust sometimes
Something's coming over me, I need to get a hold of you now
We're getting good at lying
No one's saying what's keeping us all awake at night
Something's coming over me, I need to get a hold of you now


Standing here with you tonight, how do we turn on the light?
I've got the feeling that the writing's on the wall
And I'm so used to the lie, and you're so down to deny
I've got the feeling you're the right thing after all

I go everyday without it
All I want is real, real love
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love
I'm not even scared about it
All I want is real, real love
But I don't know a thing about it
All I want is real, real love

Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love

All the chaos falling 'round
I watch it like a movie that has come to life
Something kind of normal 'bout the way I keep on drowning it out
Danger, I feel danger
And I cannot find the breath to scream the words out right
Every thought is paralyzing, need to find a way to you now

Standing here with you tonight, how do we turn on the light?
I've got the feeling that the writing's on the wall
And I'm so used to the lie, you're so down to deny
I've got the feeling you're the right thing after all

I go everyday without it
All I want is real, real love
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love
I'm not even scared about it
All I want is real, real love
But I don't know a thing about it
All I want is real, real love

Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love

I go everyday without it
All I want is real, real love
(Real, real, real love)
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love
(Real, real, real love)
I'm not even scared about it
All I want is real, real love
But I don't know a thing about it
All I want is real, real love
