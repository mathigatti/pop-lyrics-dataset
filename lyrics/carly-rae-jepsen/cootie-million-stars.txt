When the moon lights
I'm outta my mind
And your kisses
Are sweeter then wine
When the skyline


Stretches till dawn
I can hold you
Endless in time, in time

(Lets) get away
In the middle of nowhere
I just need for you to be there
Million people and I dont care
Cause all of the light I share

It is just for you
In the middle of nowhere
I just need for you
To be there
Million people and I dont care
Million stars just for you
