You got your way with me now didn't ya
And i'll never know why
Things you do are things we've done before
Don't you be looking at me darling with the sneaky eyes
Now what can you be looking at me for?


Sometimes when I'm lonely i'll close my eyes
Some nights when I can't sleep I fantasize
Hard to believe that you're right here tonight
I'm going out of my mind
Oh

I think this could be the one night
I give into this fight
Boy I just might,
Cause you're on my head
I can't stop the motion
Hold me, be the way you told me
This was something so sweet
This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

It's begging, my heart, to see you love
And I don't know why
Things you say are things we've said before
Instead of the truth I swear you'd stick a needle in your eye
Now what can you be looking at me for?

Sometimes when I'm lonely I close my eyes
Some nights when I can't sleep I fantasize
Hard to believe that you're right here tonight
I'm going out of my mind

Oh

I think this could be the one night
I give into this fight
Boy I just might,
Cause you're on my head
I can't stop the motion
Hold me, be the way you told me
This was something so sweet
This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

Tell me what was I supposed to do
With that type of attention
I'll give all that I am to you
You forgot to mention
When you say that your heart is true
It's just an invention
But not your intention no, no

Tell me what was I supposed to do
With that type of attention
I'll give all that I am to you
You forgot to mention
When you say that your heart is true
It's just an invention
But not your intention no, no

I think this could be the one night
I give into this fight
Boy I just might,
Cause you're on my head
I can't stop the motion

Wrong feels so right

This could be the night

Wrong feels so right

This could be the night

Wrong feels so right
