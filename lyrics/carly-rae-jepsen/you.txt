You don’t want me, no
You don’t need me
Like I want you, oh
Like I need you


And I want you in my life
And I need you in my life

You can’t see me, no
Like I see you
I can’t have you, no
Like you have me

And I want you in my life
And I need you in my life

Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

You can’t feel me, no
Like I feel you
I can’t steal you, no
Like you stole me

And I want you in my life
