What it feels like when I'm next to you
It's a soft touch that I read in to
Was it just me, did you linger for too long?
But it's alright if it's on your mind
'Cause it's all I'm thinkin' all the time
There was one thing that I wanted all my life
For real


Somebody wants you, somebody cares (for real)
Somebody wants you, somebody cares (then he said)

I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out (then he said)
I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out
Let's sort the whole thing out

I was broken in a million ways
Then I met you and I saw your force
I was certain I could not want something more
Goin' crazy 'cause you're hard to read
But I know you want this bad as me
It's a good thing and I want you to be sure
For real

Somebody wants you, somebody cares (for real)
Somebody wants you, somebody cares (then he said)

I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out (then he said)
I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out
Let's sort the whole thing out

I love you
I love you

Never thought I'd hear you say
I've been hopin' every day
Never thought I'd hear you say
I've been hopin' every day (then he said)

I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out (then he said)
I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out
Let's sort the whole thing out

I love you
