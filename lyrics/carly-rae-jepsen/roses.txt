Knock on the door, leaving it open
It wasn't you, why was I hoping?
Said it before and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here when you need a friend


I sat with you on my bedroom floor
And I couldn't move, all that we were losing
I saw you like I never did before
I never did before

And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take it back

Cat got your tongue, it's been forever
Have you been good? Have you been better?
I've said it before, I'll say it again
That I'll always be here if you need a friend

I sat with you on my bedroom floor
And I couldn't move, all that we were losing
I saw you like I never did before
I never did before

And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take it back

Drunk on cigarettes
Last chance, say the words
Dancing in the dark
Love made in the park
Big black blossom tree
Baby cover me
Hold me, left to blow
Please don't let me go
Please don't let me go

And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh, ooh
I won't take it back

Drunk on cigarettes
Last chance, say the words
I won't take it back
Dancing in the dark
I won't take it back
Love made in the park
Big black blossom tree
I won't take it back
Baby cover me
Hold me, left to blow
Please don't let me go
