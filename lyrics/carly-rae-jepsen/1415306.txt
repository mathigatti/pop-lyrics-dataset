(There's a hole 
in your bucket)


Sun's out! 
We got 
A beach day
Forget 
Yourself say
Why don't 
We people watch?
Kids all playing 
'Round in the sand

(Little boy crying)

Oh, no!
He's got 
Some troubles
Got us laughing 
As he throws 
His shovel
Nothing's 
Really going
As planned

I don't know
How we're 
Gonna build
A castle now
Do you want 
To start 
Again somehow?
I'll stay 
Until the sun 
Comes down
Down, down

Are you smiling?
Look over 
My shoulder
See 
Your laughter
Bubble over
Lately 
You've 
Been working
Too hard

And i've 
Been waiting
To recognize
That sparkle
That's 
In your eyes
Those 
Two dimples
On your cheeks
The joy 
That lights
The fire

I don't know
How we're 
Gonna build
A castle now
Do you want 
To start 
Again somehow?
I'll stay 
Until the sun 
Comes down
Down, down

There's a hole
In my bucket
Dear Liza 
Dear Liza
There's a hole
In my bucket
Dear Liza
A hole

And i don't know
How 
We're s'posed
To build 
A castle now
Do you want 
To start
Again somehow?
I'll stay 
Until the sun
Comes down 
Down

I'll stay 
Until the sun 
Comes

I don't know
How we're 
Gonna build
A castle now
Do you want 
To start 
Again somehow?
I'll stay 
Until the sun 
Comes down
Down, down
'Til the sun
Comes down

I'll stay
Sun's coming down
I'll stay
Sun's coming down
I'll stay
Sun's coming down
I'll stay
