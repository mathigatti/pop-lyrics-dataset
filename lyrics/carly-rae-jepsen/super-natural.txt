You can show me
Your favorite streets late at night
Or lay in bed, fall asleep, side by side


'Cause when I'm with you
Anywhere, baby it doesn't matter
I, I just don't care what we do
Baby it's all that matters

How I feel
So unreal

You gotta believe in me
This ins't normal, not at all
It's just love, we gon' try, we're just fit
You and I, we're supernatural

This is easy love
Everyday you're for real
It's just love, we gon' try
We're supernatural

You, you got me all figured out in every way
You, you read my thoughts
Of what I want before I say

And it's crazy how this little things
Baby, they stop me breathing
We could carry on, if you want
Baby just keep breathing

You gotta believe in me
This isn't normal, not at all
It's just love, we gon' try, we're just fit
You and I, we're supernatural

This is easy love
Everyday you're for real
It's just love, we gon' try, we're just fit
You and I, we're supernatural

How I feel (how I feel)
So unreal (so unreal)
No, it's true (no, it's true)
Me and you

You gotta believe in me
This isn't normal, not at all
It's just love, we gon' try, we're just fit
You and I, we're supernatural

Supernatural
You gotta believe in me
This isn't normal, not at all
It's just love, we gon' try, we're just fit
You and I, we're supernatural

This is easy love
Everyday you're for real
It's just love, we gon' try, we're just fit
You and I, we're supernatural
