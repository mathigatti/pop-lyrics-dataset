Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again


Stars, won't you shine on me
Won't you dance with me
Me and my baby
Life, is enough to cry
It's a lot to give and it's driving me crazy

I never meant to fight with you
I wanted us to stay together
And even now my love is true
I know that we can't be together

Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

Moon, where's the man in you
Show the way to us
The sky is turning black now
Moon, what you trying to do
It's too late for us and there's no turning back now

I never meant to fight with you
I wanted us to stay together
And even now our love is true
I know that we can't be together

Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
