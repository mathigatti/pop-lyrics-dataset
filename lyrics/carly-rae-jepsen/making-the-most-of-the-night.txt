You and me, we've been hanging around for the longest time
I know when you're down, know what you need to get you high
Top down, like the wind through your hair on a summer's night
Outside, all of your fears, leave them behind


Baby I'm speeding and red lights are run
What I got you need it, and I'll run to your side
When your heart is bleeding, I'm coming to get you

I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you
I'm making the most of the night

Eyes wide, like you've never seen the ocean never seen the tides
No hope, now you're seeing things that you'd lost sight of
Taking off, got your hands in the air and you're feeling alright
Gold vines, glistening on my skin for you

Baby I'm speeding and red lights are run
What I got you need it, and I'll run to your side
When your heart is bleeding, I'm coming to get you

I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you
I'm making the most of the night

Baby take my hand now, don't you cry
I won't let you sleep, I won't let you hide
No more tears, don't waste another day
Go on and fight, don't lay down to die
Come on get up, you'll make it through okay
Come on get up, don't waste another day

I know you've had a rough time
But here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you
I'm making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you
I'm making the most of the night
