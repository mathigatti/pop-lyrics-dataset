I don't wanna get no trouble when I go down
I wanna get in trouble on your street
Got a real feeling like it's gonna be a showdown
I don't wanna quit no show for free


And everybody warned me
Everybody warned me about you

Yeah, I'm tempted by just make-believing
That I can make you come around different start again
I like the way you got me scheming for you, dreaming, oh
Won't change your ways, no, can't change your ways

I don't wanna hurt nobody, even me
But I want a little loving with some danger on the side
When it's gonna kill me, there's no better way to go
Yeah, you're never gonna live if you're never gonna try

And everybody warned me
Everybody warned me about you

Yeah, I'm tempted by just make-believing
That I can make you come around different start again
I like the way you got me scheming for you, dreaming, oh
Won't change your ways, no, can't change your ways

Yeah, I'm tempted by just make-believing
That I can make you come around different start again
I like the way you got me scheming for you, dreaming, oh
Won't change your ways, no, can't change your ways

When this thing is over, then it's time to say goodbye
See, it's been really nice to know you and to love you in my way
If it was that easy for a poet and a clown
We can have a conversation and believe it for the day
