And I know what it feels like
To be alone on a cold night
No one you can hold tight (hold tight)
And I'm not trying to play it down
But it's all gonna turn around
And I swear it'll be alright (alright)


You let go, she moved on
A thousand stories before
You felt it, then lost it
You're lonely, your heart aches
But get yourself off the floor
I can't stand to see you crying

So what? You're not in love
Don't go wasting your nights getting so low
So what? You're not in love
You shine bright by yourself dancing solo

It looks nice from the outside
When they all got the perfect guy
Hold on for the long ride (long ride)
But your fears got it all wrong
That he's right and there's something wrong
'Cause I swear, you'll be alright (alright)

You let go, she moved on
A thousand stories before
You felt it, then lost it
You're lonely, your heart aches
But get yourself off the floor
I can't stand to see you crying

So what? You're not in love
Don't go wasting your nights getting so low
So what? You're not in love
You shine bright by yourself dancing solo

You let go, she moved on
A thousand stories before
You felt it, then lost it
You're lonely, your heart aches
But get yourself off the floor
I can't stand to see you crying

So what? You're not in love
Don't go wasting your nights getting so low
So what? You're not in love
You shine bright by yourself dancing solo
