I've got a cavern of secrets
None of them are for you
Even if you wanted to keep them
Where would you find the moon?
Let down my guard tonight
I just don't care anymore
I've told a hundred lies
But I don't wanna tell you any at all


And I can not control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles 'round your warm blood

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

I saw myself tonight
Saw my reflection in the mirror
My hands and heart were tied
But I was scared of almost nothing at all

And I can not control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles 'round your warm blood

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one you should stop me there but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling
Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping
