Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow


It doesn't show signs of stopping
And the temperature's really dropping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
You'll have to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home you'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, baby, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Now when we finally kiss goodnight
You'll have to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home you'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, darling, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
