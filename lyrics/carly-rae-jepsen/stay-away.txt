(Away) How can I stay away? (Away)

I tried your mouth and I can’t come back
So little time and I’m way off track
I can’t stay away, away, away, away, away
For one night
(Hey) Wherever I go I still see your face
So little time, there’s no time to waste
I can’t stay away, away, away, away, away
For one night


(Hey) I don’t know where your head is now
I’ve been only thinking 'bout us (thinking bout us)
Don’t know what your hands are doing
I’ve been only thinking 'bout touch
(Touch, touch, touch me)

I can’t take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body, how can I stay away? (Away)
If my love’s too strong for you, walk away
But I can’t make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body, how can I stay away? (Away)

The city’s so hard when you sleep alone
I need your hands when you drive me home
I can’t stay away, away, away, away, away
For one night

(Hey) I don’t know where your head is now
I’ve been only thinking 'bout us (thinking bout us)
Don’t know what your hands are doing
I’ve been only thinking 'bout touch
(Touch, touch, touch me)

Can’t take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body, how can I stay away? (Away)
If my love’s too strong for you, walk away
But I can’t make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body, how can I stay away? (Away)

How can I stay away? (Ooh)
How can I stay away?

(Hey) I don’t know where your head is now
I’ve been only thinking 'bout us (oh)
Don’t know what your hands are doing
I’ve been only thinking 'bout touch
(Touch, touch, touch me)

Can’t take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body, how can I stay away? (Away, away, away, away)
If my love’s too strong for you, walk away
But I can’t make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body, how can I stay away? (Away, away, away, away)

How can I stay away?
