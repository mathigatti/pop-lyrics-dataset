Whatever happened to predictability?
The milkman, the paperboy, the evening tv?
How did I get delivered here? Somebody tell me please
Cause this old world is just really confusing me


Clouds as mean as you've ever seen
Ain't a bird that knows your tune
Then a little voice inside of you whispers
"Kid, don't sell your dreams so soon!"

Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold on to
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you

Whatever happened to the good old days?
Talking to friends for hours, swore it'd never go away
Now I'm feeling a little crazy, trying to fit in with a scene
Cause how do you know where you're going, if you really don't know who you've been?

Everybody eventually
Says that they're as lost as you
So everybody shout it together
"Hey, don't sell your dreams so soon!"

Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold on to
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold on to
Everywhere you look

When you're lost out there and you're all alone
A light is waiting to carry you home
Everywhere you look
