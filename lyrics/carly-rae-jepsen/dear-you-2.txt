Dear you, I'm still
Thinking ‘bout you and I
Can’t seem to get you from my mind, no
It's true, I
Imagine us together and I
Won't pretend it doesn’t feel just fine, oh
My dear, dear, dear you
I'm craving to be near you


Dear you, I want to
Share your flannel shirt
I want to share my joy and hurt
With you alone
If you taught me to
Knot your tie just right, could I maybe
Keep it for the night
With you attached, ha
My dear, dear, dear you
I'm aching to be near you

Could I slip into
Your arms just like
A puzzle piece
We fit so perfectly
Would I melt under
Your hidden charms and
Close my eyes and fall so desperately
For my dear, dear, dear you (dear you)
I'm waiting to be near you

Dear you, you are the
Only one for me
No one else
Could win each game, you see
And still have my heart, oh
You see, I'm so
Distracted by your smile, I'm so
Attracted all the while
It's hard to speak
My dear, dear, dear you
I'm dying to be near you

Could I slip into
Your arms just like
A puzzle piece
We fit so perfectly
Would I melt under
Your hidden charms and
Close my eyes and fall so desperately
For my dear, dear, dear you (dear you)
One day I will be near you

Yours most sincerely, completely
So loving and dearly
Dearly from me
