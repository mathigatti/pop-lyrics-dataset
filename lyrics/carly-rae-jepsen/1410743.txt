You seem too good
Too good to be true
You're holding me stronger
Stronger than I'm used to


Don't go out
With the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering
What you're doing
Don't go out
With the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering
What you're proving

You seem too good
Too good to be true
I'm loving you longer
Longer that I'm used to

Don't go out
With the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering
What you're doing
Don't go out
With the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering
What you're proving

Tug of war
Sweet as sin
I let go
I fell in
Feel the pull
Call your name
I'm alone
Once again

Tug of war
Sweet as sin
I let go
I fell in
Feel the pull
Call your name
I'm alone
Once again

Don't go out
With the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering
What you're doing
Don't go out
With the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering
What you're proving

Tug of war
Sweet as sin (You seen too good)
I let go
I fell in(Too good to be true)
Feel the pull
Call your name(I'm loving you longer)
I'm alone
Once again(Longer that I'm used to)

Tug of war
Sweet as sin (You seen too good)
I let go
I fell in (Too good to be true)
Feel the pull
Call your name (You seen too good)
I'm alone
Once again (Too good to be true)

Tug of war
Feel the pull
Tug of war
Feel the pull
