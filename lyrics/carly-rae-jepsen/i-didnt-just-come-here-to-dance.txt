I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see


It's your fault, baby boy cause you're the one that sparked this
Shine a light, with your eyes into me in the darkness

Hey joe's calling me over
Tino's calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see

Baby I, I'm not going anywhere without you
Drive me home, cause I like every single thing about you

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see
