I remember being naked
We were young freaks just fresh to L.A
Never cared about the fake kids
We would write and sing and wear whatever


But money makes your whole world spin
Til everything is dizzy and suddenly

Planes I'm hopping
Cards I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup so
You pour and I'll say stop
Planes I'm hopping
Cards I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup
So you pour and I'll say stop

Take me into your arms again
Shake me from L.A. hallucinations

Haven't seen the boy in ages
Used to stay up all night he and I
Filling up each of these pages
But the teeth come out when the camera flashes

We said we'd always be the same
But we lost each other in the game cause suddenly

Planes I'm hopping
Cards I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup so
You pour and I'll say stop
Planes I'm hopping
Cards I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup
So you pour and I'll say stop

Take me into your arms again
And shake me from L.A. hallucinations

Buzzfeed buzzards and TMZ crows
What can I say that you don't already know?
Buzzfeed buzzards and TMZ crows
If I just lie here then will you let me go?

Planes I'm hopping
Cards I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup so
You pour and I'll say stop
Planes I'm hopping
Cards I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup
So you pour and I'll say stop

Take me into your arms again
And shake me from L.A. hallucinations

Take me into your arms again
(Buzzfeed buzzards and TMZ crows
What can I say that you don't already know?)
And shake me from L.A. hallucinations
(Buzzfeed buzzards and TMZ crows
If I just lie here, will you let me go?)
Take me into your arms again
(Buzzfeed buzzards and TMZ crows
What can I say that you don't already know?)
And shake me from L.A. hallucinations
