I've been testing out the waters
I don't think I can swim, love
With the way you rock me 'round
And a feeling, more than just desire
I don't think I can breathe
With the way you let me down


God, you make me so tired
Isn't this the vision that you wanted?
(Isn't this the vision that you wanted?)
Guess I'll never understand you now
Love is more than telling me you want it
(Love is more than telling me you)

I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words, I want the

Fool's gold landed on my shoulder
In the weight of your hand
But you know the answer's no (Know the answer's no)
And you know I'm a liar
Oh, the night's my weakness
I believe every word
'Cause your lips are waterfalls

God, you make me so tired
Isn't this the vision that you wanted?
(Isn't this the vision that you wanted?)
Guess I'll never understand you now
Love is more than telling me you want it
(Love is more than telling me you)

I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)

I'm for you now, I feel my fortune tell me
I'm the only one, the only one
I'm for you now (is it desire?), it's sweet until it's over
I'm the only one (is it desire?), the only one

God, you make me so tired
Isn't this the vision that you wanted?
(Isn't this the vision that you wanted?)
Guess I'll never understand you now
Love is more than telling me you want it
(Love is more than telling me you)

I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
(I give up, I give up)
I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
(I give up, I give up)
I don't need the words, I want the
