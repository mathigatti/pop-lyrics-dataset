We were both heading different ways
Both in a rush
Trying to get away
I ran into you-ou-ou
Like a crash of thunder
Out in the rain waiting for the bus
We started talking about different stuff
And it's true-ue-ue
There's an eight world wonder
And from now on


You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you

Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I can be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I can be your sweetie, sweetie
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I can be your sweetie, sweetie

I'm down to take any glass of wine
I stay up late and I struck your time
When i'm with you-ou-ou
I feel a different hunger
You held my head and you didn't let go
I'm gonna kiss you now
I though you should know
And it's true-ue-ue
There's an eighth world wonder
And from now on

You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you

Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I can be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I can be your sweetie, sweetie
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I can be your sweetie, sweetie

Anything you want boy
Anything you need
Anything you want boy
Anything you need

Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I can be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I can be your sweetie, sweetie
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I can be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I can be your sweetie, sweetie
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
I'm trying to tell you
That all I wanna do, is be true to you
And give you satisfaction
Sweetie, sweetie
Yea
