We're on the right track, I can feel it
I came alive, first day to remain
I know what everyody’s talking 'bout
Wanna say it loud and proud
Got me feeling confident, yeah
You make my heart beat, walk all the time
I want your body all over mine
So won't you cover me like full eclipse
Can’t remember lonliness
Got me feeling delicate, yeah

I like it to give it as good as I can
Don't be surprised if this is the best
I'm always falling for you open mind
Love the way you open mine
Swear your love is summertime, yeah
You like to keep me calling your name
It’s always different, never the same
And every morning when I wake you up
Sugar, you want me to [?]
You got me feeling confident, yeah

Can't look back at broken pieces of a heart we broke
We broke for reasons
