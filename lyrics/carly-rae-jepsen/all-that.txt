I wanna play this for you all the time
I wanna play this for you when you're feeling used and tired
I wanna make the best so you want more
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms


I'll be the magic you'll ever see (ever see)
You can always rely on me to help you do what you want to do
I wanna be the best you've ever known (ever known)
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms

Show me if you want me, if I'm all that
I will be there, I will be your friend
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that
I will be there, I will be your friend

I'll be your lighthouse when you're lost at sea (lost at sea)
I'll keep my light on, baby, you can always come to me
I wanna be the place you call your home (call your home)
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms

Show me if you want me, if I'm all that
I will be there, I will be your friend
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that
I will be there, I will be your friend

When you need me I will never let you come apart
When you need me I will be your candle in the dark
When you need someone, oh, let me be the one
The only one, and the only one, and the only one

Show me if you want me, if I'm all that
I will be there, I will be your friend
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that
I will be there, I will be your friend

(Show me if you want me)
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that (and I will be your friend)
I will be there, I will be your friend (show me if you want me)
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that (and I will be your friend)
I will be there, I will be your friend

(Show me if you want me)
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that (show me if you care)
I will be there, I will be your friend (show me if you want me)
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that (hey, show me if you care)
I will be there, I will be your friend (show me if you care)
I will be there, I will be your friend (oh, show me if you care)
I will be there, I will be your friend (just show me if you care)
