Maybe he’s right
Maybe there is something the matter with me
I just, I don’t see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad


Look at this stuff
Isn’t it neat?
Wouldn’t you think my collection’s complete?
Wouldn’t you think I’m the girl
The girl who has everything

Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one ever hold?
Looking around here you think
Sure, she’s got everything

I’ve got gadgets and gismos a plenty
I’ve got who’s town what’s its galore
I walked in a world of sin, I’ve got 20
But who cares? No big deal
I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, I wanna see them dancing
Walking around on those
What you do call it? Oh, feet

Flippin your fingers you don’t get too far
Legs are required for jumping dances
Strolling along down a what’s that word again?
Street

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wondering free, wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give? If I could live out of these corners
What would I pay to spend a day doing all these things?
Venture on land, they understand that they don’t recommend their daughters
Bright young women, sea could swim in
Ready to stand

I’m ready to know what the people know
Asking my questions, I’ll get some answers
What’s a fire and what is it?
If it would burn

When’s it my turn?
More than alive
Love to explore and show up above

Out of the scene
Wish I could be
Part of that world
