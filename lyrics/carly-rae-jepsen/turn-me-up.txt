All alone
Here I am
I don't know what I'm after
Now that you're
Just a friend
I can't call you and ask you


From the very first time i saw your face
I knew I was satisfied
You were talking so sweet
I had to taste
I wish I never tried

I'm breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
Just what am I to do
And how's it gonna be
Cause breaking us in two
Is breaking me in pieces
I'm breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
Just what am I to do
And how's it gonna be
I'm giving up and going out tonight
Turn me up
Turn me on
Turn me up
Turn me on

Tonight here you are
And I know what you're after
But you're reading me wrong
Cause I'm closin' this chapter

From the very first time I saw your face
I knew I was satisfied
You were talking so sweet
I had to taste
I wish I never tried

I'm breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think you mean
Just what am I to do
And how's it gonna be
Cause breaking us in two
Is breaking me in pieces
I'm breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the floor
And I don't think you mean
Just what am I to do
And hows it gonna be
I'm giving up and going out tonight
Turn me up
Turn me on
Turn me up
Turn me on

Turn me up
Turn me on
Turn me up
Turn me on
And on

Breaking me in pieces
I'm breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the floor
And I don't think you mean
Just what am I to do
And hows it gonna be
I'm giving up and going out tonight
Turn me up
Turn me on
Turn me up
Turn me on
