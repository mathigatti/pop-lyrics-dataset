So yeah he loves me
And I miss him too
'Cause he felt so constant
Which is something new


Live flowers, hazelnut oils, and him
Vanilla scents massage into your skin

We danced in my bedroom
Thought we could see the moon

And for the weekend baby you stay by my side
When Monday comes I know a spot where you can hide
My room is small but it holds all the world inside
I'll keep your secrets if you'll just confide

Let's dance in my bedroom
Where we can see the moon
Some things are meant to be
I bet you were made for me

And if he asks me I'd do anything he'd say
Anything to help him drive the fear away
And just to keep him here for one more perfect day
I'll tell you there's no price I wouldn't pay

Let's dance in my bedroom
Where we can see the moon
Close every curtain
So it's just me and you
Some things are meant to be
I think you were made for me

A candle flickers and the shadows catch my eye
I'm praying that we never have to say good by
His breathing hums to me this gentle lullaby
I watch the ceiling but I see the sky

We dance in my bedroom
Where we can see the moon
Close every curtain
So it's just me and you
Some things are meant to be
I thin you were made for me
