I never thought about you
You never thought about us
Yeah, it came out of the blue
And I was just dreaming
It took a night of insane
To feel the need for your touch
And I could never explain
How I was just dreaming


Ooh, ooh-ooh
Never guess what came after
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I fell

Automatically in love
Right away, baby, it's a real rollercoaster
When the wind goes the other way
But you and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (in love)
Right away, right away, baby
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (in love)

It's not the fear that you trust
It's not the voice in your head
We got the chemical rush
And now we're just dreaming
And we could wait for the proof
A little time to adjust
But every moment with you
I wake up just dreaming

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Never guess what came after
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I fell

Automatically in love
Right away, baby, it's a real rollercoaster
When the wind goes the other way
But you and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (in love)
Right away, right away, baby
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (in love)

In love, in love
Mmm, la-da-da-da-da, da-da

Love's so fast, I can't go slow
Hold me back, baby boy, hold me close
Love's so real, I can't go slow
Can't imagine, by the way I feel it so

Automatically in love
Right away, baby, it's a real rollercoaster
When the wind goes the other way
But you and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (in love)
Right away, right away, baby
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (in love)

Mmm, mmm
Hmm, hmm
Automatically
