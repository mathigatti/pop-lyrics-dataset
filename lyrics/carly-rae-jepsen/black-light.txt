Me and my sister burning up in the room
We turn the black light on, turn the black light on
Nobody knows, nobody shows
Or really gives a damn
Me and my sister turn the black light on


Warm day, sun is shining
Ice trays, fake ids
Stumbling towards the end of the
20Th century
And it's hot enough to melt the ice caps

But you wanna make the summer stay
Sister, boyfriend calling,
Won't give me the time of day
Sometimes the guard goes down
Me and my sister burning up in the room
We turn the black light on, turn the black light on
