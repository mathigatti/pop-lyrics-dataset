Woah

Hello, I know it's been a while
I wonder where you are
And if you think of me
Sometimes cause you're always on my mind
You know I had it rough
Tryin' to forget you, but


The more that I look around
The more I realize
You're all I'm lookin for

What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are
To me
You're not tryin' to be perfect
Nobody's perfect
But you are
To me
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words I won't say
I wish somehow
I could say them now
Oh, I could say them now
Yeah

Just friends
The beginning or the end
How do we make sense
When we're on our own
It's like you're the other half of me
I feel incomplete
Should have know
Nothing in the world compares
To the feelings that we share
It's so not fair

What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are
To me
You're not tryin' to be perfect
Nobody's perfect
But you are
To me
You try to take my breath away
Feel the words I won't say
I wish somehow
I could say them now
Oh

Both:
It's not true
Blame it all on me
I was running from myself
Cause I couldn't tell
How deep that we
We were gonna be
I was scared it was destiny
But it hurts like hell
Hope it's not too late
Just a twist of fate

What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are
To me
You're not tryin' to be perfect
Nobody's perfect
But you are
To me
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words I won't say
I wish somehow
I could say them now
Oh, I could say them now
