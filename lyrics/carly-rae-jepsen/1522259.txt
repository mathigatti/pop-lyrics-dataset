Sweet talker, i'm not gunna stop you
You talk so sweet and it's dribbling like honey
It's just one taste
I see what your tryin' to do, oh oh, yeah yeah,
Its hot, steaks are getting higher


No love for free man
It costs if you're the buyer
My life's for me
I see what cha tryin' to do oh oh

(come on)
Lazy lover, oh, you slide me through you
Slide me though your
Lazy lover i will slide me through your window 
And i give you oh the sweetest dreams you ever had
Make your early morning not so bad
I can see just what you're tryin' to do

That's a nice a house
I like what you've done with the place
Your ginger bread and that greedy smile upon your face
I can see just what you're tryin' to do oh oh

(come on)
Lazy lover, oh, you slide me through your
Slide me though your
Lazy lover i will slide me through your window 
And i'll give you, oh, the sweetest dreams you ever had
Make your early morning not so bad
I can see just what you're tryin' to do

But, don't worry, i say get it over with
'cuz what you want to know,
You've got it on your finger tips 
Don't you ask for more that wave 
Just tumbles me round till i'm lost somewhere
With baby, i just can't make a sound

It's so unfortunate
But i've already been through this
And i can see just what your tryin; to do
I can see just what you need to do
I can see
