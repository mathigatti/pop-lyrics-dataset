I was at our old school sitting in the Sun
Waiting for the passing trains
Wishing you were here
Wishing we could run
Wishing we could run away


Right across the river in a town so small
The leaves are gonna change us when they start to fall
Take us to the city, where we'll have it all
We'll have it all

Oh, yeah, I would run away with you now
We could do the things we promised we would always do
Take a train to Timbuktu, we could join the circus
Oh, yeah, would you just escape with me now?
We could do the things we promised, dreaming wide awake
Take me back to yesterday
We could be the runaways

Remember how that one time things were getting hard
I met you in your old backyard
We packed a couple bags and we stole your father's car
But we only ever got so far

We drove across the river, left the town so small
The leaves are gonna change you when they start to fall
If we make it to the city, then we'll have it all
We'll have it all

Oh, yeah, I would run away with you now
We could do the things we promised we would always do
Take a train to Timbuktu, we could join the circus
Oh, yeah, would you just escape with me now?
We could do the things we promised, dreaming wide awake
Take me back to yesterday
We could be the runaways

Oh, oh
We could be the runaways
Oh, oh

Oh, yeah, I would run away with you now
We could do the things we promised we would always do
Take a train to Timbuktu, we could join the circus
Oh, yeah, would you just escape with me now?
We could do the things we promised, dreaming wide awake
Take me back to yesterday
We could be the runaways

Oh, we could be the runaways
Away, away
Yeah, we could be the runaways
