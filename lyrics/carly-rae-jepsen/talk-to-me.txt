Every morning
As i go walking by
I feel you looking
That's why i take my time
Oh oh yeah


I can see what 'cha wanna do to me
You can feel it something's gonna break
Well i'm in if you're in
Let's make a big mistake

Talk to me, why won't you talk to me
Can't you see i'm burning up
When you look like that
And i'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me
Walk with me baby

When he's singing his song
Well all the young girls sigh
And we'll be wearing those things
That make a grown man cry
Oh oh yeah yeah

I can see what 'cha wanna do to me
You can feel it something's gonna break
Well, i'm in if you're in
Let's make a big mistake

Talk to me, why won't you talk to me
Can't you see i'm burning up
When you look like that
And i'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me
Walk with me baby

Come on take me away
I've been yours from the start
Summer nights, summer days
I'll be your summer heart

Come on take me away
I've been yours from the startâ€¦

When it's love like that
And you look like that

Talk to me, why won't 'cha talk to me
Can't you see i'm burning up
When you look like that
And i'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me, walk with me baby

Come on take me away
I've been yours from the start
Summer nights, summer days
I'll be your summer heart

Come on take me away
I've been yours from the start

Talk to me, why won't you talk to me
Can't you see i'm burning up
When you look like that
And i'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me talk to me
Why won't 'cha talk to me
