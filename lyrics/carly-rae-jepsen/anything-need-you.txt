Please donâ t be alarmed by my hesitation
To notice your charm
I wasnâ t too optimistic about it at first
But now Iâ m so, so very glad


People say that love can be unkind
It can tear your heart to pieces
And shake you up inside
But I donâ€™t worry about tomorrow
Cuz I believe in the power of love
Break it down

Thinking about you
Canâ€™t live without you
Anything that you need
Baby, you can count on me
