I had a bad dream you're in them, like you always are
I had a bad day, I don't care when I'm in your car


So drive so fast, baby do that right
Drive so fast, and they'll never gonna find you
Drive so fast, saying no goodbyes
Drive so fast, they are leaving all behind you

Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

You're laughing at me in your head
With my teasing games
Let's talk about you
You're in love, wanna change my name

So drive so fast, baby do that right
Drive so fast, and they'll never gonna find you
Drive so fast, saying no goodbyes
Drive so fast, they are leaving all behind you

Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

Boy, I get a kick out of you
You know I'm yours
The things you're making me do
I'm never gone, give me to recoil
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love

I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love
