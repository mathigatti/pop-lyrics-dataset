Summer love, wild and free
And I'd like to get to know ya
Summertime, wild and free
And I'd like to get to know ya


'Cause I live for the feeling
Dance to the feeling
Wait for the feeling of you
I just live for the feeling
Dance to the feeling
Wait for the feeling of you

I was down for the first night
And I'm down for a second try
When you touch me, I wanna fly
I'm so down for you all the time
All the time, all the time
All the time, all the time

It's my turn, it's our time
And I'd like to talk it over
Summer love, sweet as wine
And I'd like to have you over

'Cause I live for the feeling
Dance to the feeling
Wait for the feeling of you
I just live for the feeling
Dance to the feeling
Wait for the feeling of you

I was down for the first night
And I'm down for a second try
When you touch me, I wanna fly
I'm so down for you all the time
All the time, all the time
All the time, all the time

I was down for the first night
And I'm down for a second try
When you touch me, I wanna fly
I'm so down for you all the time, all the time
I was down for the first night (down for the first night)
And I'm down for a second try
When you touch me, I wanna fly
I'm so down for you all the time, all the time, all the time
All the time, all the time
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
Down for you all the time, all the time, all the time
(All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time)
