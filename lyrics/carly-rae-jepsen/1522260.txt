I survive on hotel shampoos
I'll be runnin' out soon
You've gone away again
Gone to collect some more
Your hands pressed hard into me
I thought this summer you'd be gone away again
Oooo he's gone away again


We were poor, yeah, we were dream chasers baby
Sky scrapers are not too tall
He's gunna to prove me right 'til i'm wrong

Craving all the gold and the riches
I don't want to wash my own dishes
He's gone away again, hmm he's gone away again
Driving in a sweet brand new car
Living the life of a superstar
I got my way again, hmm i got my way again

We were poor, yeah, we were dream chasers baby
Sky scrapers are not too tall
He's gunna to prove me right 'til i'm wrong

He says that he don't recognize us
In all our pretty disguises
In all out pretty disguises

Work hard, oh we work until we're sleepin'
And we sleep but we're not dreaming
Oh we sleep but we're not dreaming

Where's his love
Where's his kisses
He says 'sorry babe, this has got away from me'
He's gone away from me

We were poor, yeah, we were dream chasers baby
Sky scrapers are not too tall
He's gunna to prove me right 'til i'm wrong
I know he'll prove me right
He's gunna prove me right 'til i'm wrong
