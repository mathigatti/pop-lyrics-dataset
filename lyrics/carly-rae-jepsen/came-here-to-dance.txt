Oh I just came here to dance
I didn't want a lover
I just came here to dance
And look what I discovered
I was caught up in the music


And I was captured
By the magic in your eyes
I wasn't lookin' for romance
I just came here to dance

I may be actin' crazy
And maybe I'm insane
To lose my heart so easily
But when we started dancin'
And you held me in your arms
I don't know what came over me
Oh I just came here to dance
