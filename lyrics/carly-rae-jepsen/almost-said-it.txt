I always want more
I'm never gonna get it
You're gonna be the one I never got that got away
And I'll regret it
Just a moment in time
But I can't forget it
Yeah, we almost said it


If this is love, ooh
I should be dying
But I'm going downtown like I still care
Like I'm still trying
I said I was over you but I'm lying
There, I almost said it

Every time you look at me
I say it silently
Oh, when will you wake up and get it
This close, we almost said it

I know you're not evil
So why do you tease me
Yeah, staying around here late at night
You don't make it easy
It's in my body language, read me
We were this close

This close, yeah
And it's like every time you look at me
I say it silently
Oh, wake up, baby, come and get it
This close, we almost said it

You say that you're still not free
Well, I hear selectively
That still means someday you might be
Oh, this close, yeah, yeah

You wrote me a song
I often play it
Depending on where I am with you
I either love it or I hate it
We were just this close but we couldn't say it
We were this close
