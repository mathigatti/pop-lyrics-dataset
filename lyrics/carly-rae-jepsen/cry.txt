You're king of the castle
Whenever you're here, you know it feels right
Don't need to worry
Don't need to move, I've got the spotlight


I want you to
Do you want to?
I want you to stay tonight
I want you to say
I want you to

He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y

Wake up without you
Flood in my room, I see your headlights
And you got your reasons
You've got a way that makes it alright

I want you to
Do you want to?
I want you to stay tonight
I want you to stay
I want you to

He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y

Wake up without you
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
I wake up without you, boy
Cry-y-y, cry-y-y
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
I wake up without you, boy
Cry-y-y, cry-y-y
You're king of the castle
Whenever you're here, you know it feels right
Don't need to worry

He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y
Cry-y-y
