I wear your shirt like I was running away from you
'Cause I like to keep the good things
I know you're hurt, and I'd like to sit right next to you
But you'd only say the worse things


And every city was our city
Like every road was our own
And you loved me like you knew you'd miss me
It's like every breath I see you talk

Wildflowers you brought me
A crown built in my hands
I killed them, you caught me
The stain is on my hands

I took a trip to the furthest place that I could find
'Cause I like to do the wrong things
I walked the street that I have never walked down once before
'Cause I like to try the new things

And every city was our city
Like every road was our own

Wildflowers you brought me
A crown built in my hands
I killed them, you caught me
The stain is on my hands
Ooh oh oh

I don't think that I could stay this time
But you know that you're the love of my life
Hold your hand, I'd like to know you're mine
But I don't think that I could stay this time
Don't you think it's easy for me
Oh, all the things I've tried to be
Don't you think it's easy for me
It's killing me to leave!

Wildflowers you brought me
A crown built in my hands
I killed them, you caught me
The stain is on my hands
Ooh oh oh ooh

I don't think that I could stay this time
But you know that you're the love of my life
Hold your hand, I'd like to know you're mine
But I don't think that I could stay this time
Don't you think it's easy for me
Oh, all the things I've tried to be
Don't you think it's easy for me
It's killing me to leave!
