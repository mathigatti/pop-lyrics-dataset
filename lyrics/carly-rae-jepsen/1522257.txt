Tell me
Baby is it yes or no
You've got a face that just don't show
What's going on inside


Tell me
I swear i'll take it on the chin
Don't sugar-coat where i fit in 
Whats going on
Inside you theres a room,
A room with a door
I finally come knocking
And i've been here before
Oh i've got this love for you
But what is if for
If you can't hear me then

Tell me
Last chance
Hold me in your arms and say
If you want this love to walk away
Tell me and i'll say goodbye

Inside you theres a room,
A room with a door
I finally come knocking
And i've been here before
Oh i've got this love for you
But what is if for
If you can hear me then

I'll make it easy
I'm counting to 3
Am i something you want or someone you need?

Tell me that you want me, tell me that you love me, baby
Tell me that you want me tell me that you love me
Just tell me that you want me, tell me that you love me

Tell me, darling won't you tell me
I'm begging you to tell me,
Tell me and i'll say goodbye
