I'd rather be in hate with you
Than in love with somebody else
I'd rather be off-key with you
Than in tune with somebody else
Oh lovers, they come, but lover you know
I never wanna let you go
I'd rather be a dream with you
Than real life with somebody else


You're my sweet impossible love
We're trying to fly on the wings of a dove
And there's a storm cloud, baby
And there's a storm cloud, baby
You're my sweet impossible love
We're flying too high on the wings of a dove
And there's a storm cloud, baby
And there's a storm cloud, baby

I'd rather speed this car and crash
Than slow down with somebody else
I'd rather run us off the track
Than be safe with somebody else
Oh lovers, they come, but lover you know
I never wanna let you go
I'd rather turn our world to black
Than be light with somebody else

You're my sweet impossible love
We're trying to fly on the wings of a dove
And there's a storm cloud, baby
And there's a storm cloud, baby
You're my sweet impossible love
We're flying too high on the wings of a dove
And there's a storm cloud, baby
And there's a storm cloud, baby

And you keep your love like a fireplace
I am with your embrace
I never knew that I would
I never knew that I would
Run to you, run to you
Run to you, sanctuary
Boy you keep your love like a fireplace
I am with your embrace
I never knew that I would
I never knew that I would
Cross that line, every time
Every time, sanctuary

I'd rather be a dream with you
Than real life with somebody else

You're my sweet impossible love
We're trying to fly on the wings of a dove
And there's a storm cloud, baby
And there's a storm cloud, baby
You're my sweet impossible love
We're flying too high on the wings of a dove
And there's a storm cloud, baby
And there's a storm cloud, baby

And I never knew that I would run to you
And I never knew that I would run to you
And I never knew that I would run to you, run to you
My sweet impossible love
