Baby I don't need to look far
Everywhere I turn there, there you are
Somebody should sound the alarm
Cause when you try to get me alone
You talk to me in riddles
You treat me like a crime


I know you have a girlfriend
So don't kiss me on the lips
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh don't you tell me what I did
I know you have a girlfriend
And everytime you speak you're lying through your t-t-teeth
I know you have a girlfriend
And I hear she's kinda nice
I know you have a girlfriend
So don't give me those eyes
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh won't you let me be
I'm beggin you, stop beggin me

You're turning around all the facts
Tease me till I laugh and I relax
I know there's a reason for that
Cause you've been tryin to get me alone
And talk to me in riddles
You cover me in rhymes

I know you have a girlfriend
So don't kiss me on the lips
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh don't you tell me what I did
I know you have a girlfriend
And everytime you speak you're lying through your t-t-teeth
I know you have a girlfriend
And I hear she's kinda nice
I know you have a girlfriend
So don't give me those eyes
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh won't you let me be
I'm beggin you, stop beggin me

You're sick with dreams about it
Didn't I, didn't I
Blush
I think, i think, I think
I want it way too much

I know you have a girlfriend
And it cuts me like a knife
I know you have a girlfriend
And she's gonna be your wife
I know you have a girlfriend
Another time you speak, you're lyin through your t-t-teeth
I know you have a girlfriend
Tell me where is she tonight
I know you have a girlfriend
Cause I heard you had a fight
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh won't you let me be
I'm beggin you, stop beggin me
I know you have
I'm beggin you, stop beggin me
I know you have, I know you have a girlfriend
