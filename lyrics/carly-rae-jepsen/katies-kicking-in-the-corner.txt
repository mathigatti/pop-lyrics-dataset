We could go driving
Through the valley
You bring your guitar
I play the tamborine
Hey, a car so cute
I think of curtains
You're trying to show me
All the dead road kill that you see


Come on drive with me
I'm a good luck charm, see.
We got a green light telling us to go.
And I've been picking through your pockets
Oh, you are my rock
And I like skipping stones
The bars at night with the rah rah rah
And katie's kicking in the corner
She swings her hips to the oh na na
Like I think we're getting warmer

Oh, we're getting warmer now
Uh, yeah, yeh
You and me we think differently
We're still deciding
Baby, I don't know
Come on tell me nothing can destroy this
I am living for your happiness alone

The bars at night with the rah rah rah
And katie's kicking in the corner
She swings her hips to the oh na na
Like I think we're getting warmer
Oh, we're getting warmer now
Uh, yeah, yeh
Uh, yeah, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Uh, yeah, yeh

The bars at night with the rah rah rah
And katie's kicking in the corner
She swings her hips to the oh na na
Like I think we're getting warmer
The bars at night with the rah rah rah
And katie's kicking in the corner
