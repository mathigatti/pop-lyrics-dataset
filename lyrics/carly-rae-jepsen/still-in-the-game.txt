I'm one foot in and one foot out
So if I asked you, would you tell me what it's all about?
It rained until my eyes dried out
But I don't fear the teardrops, baby, I just fear the drought
I just fear the drought
Yeah I just fear the drought


I think we're still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the ohh
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the ohh
I should never get too hot for you
Don't know why you turned that car on
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the ohh

They're on my left and on my right
The girls are wonderin' who's the lucky one, just stay the night
I hope I play my cards just right
And then I'll see the way he smiles beneath the moonlight
Beneath the moonlight
Beneath the moonlight

I think we're still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the ohh
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the ohh
I should never get too hot for you
Don't know why you turned that car on
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the ohh

Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the ohh

But for now is not forever
Say that we can be together
Right out loud
But for now is not forever
Say that we can be together
Right out loud

I think we're still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the ohh
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the ohh
I should never get too hot for you
Don't know why you turned that car on
Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the ohh

Still in the game
Still in the game
Still in the ohh
