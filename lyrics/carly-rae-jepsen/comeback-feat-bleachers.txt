I'm at a war with myself
We go back to my place
Take my makeup off
Show you my best disguise
You believe in my heart
You believe in my kind
It's a tragedy, boy
Every time you ask me


I don't know what I'm feeling
But I believe
I was thinking about making a comeback
Back to me
And I won't say you're the reason
I was on my knees
But I'm thinking about making a comeback
Back to me

I'm at peace in the dark
When I know that you're near
Hear the breath of your heart
Singing me a lullaby
All those traveling years
'Til we said our goodbye
And I show up to your place
You don't even ask me why

I don't know what I'm feeling
But I believe
I was thinking about making a comeback
Back to me
And I won't say you're the reason
I was on my knees
But I'm thinking about making a comeback
Back to me

And if you wanna know why I have no regrets
Sometimes, you gotta ignore it to get it around your head
And there is nothing else I'm sure of, nothing else I'm sure of
If you wanna know why I have no regrets

Well, then you'll come with me
I’m the keeper of that beat
And the fire under your feet
I’m the keeper, man, I am the keeper
Come, baby
Dance the night down on your knees
Dance your heart down onto your sleeve
I’m the keeper, man, I am the keeper
And I am the keeper

I don't know what I'm feeling
But I believe
I was thinking about making a comeback
Back to me

I don't know what I'm feeling
But I believe
I was thinking about making a comeback
Back to me
And I won't say you're the reason
I was on my knees
But I'm thinking about making a comeback
Comeback to me

Come with me
I’m the keeper of that beat
And the fire under your feet
I’m the keeper, man, I am the keeper
Come, baby
Dance the night down on your knees
Dance your heart down onto your sleeve
I’m the keeper, man, I am the keeper
And I am the keeper
