Floating I´m floating on down through the sky
Never had no ambition to learn how to fly
I´ll be glad when it´s over and ready to land
with this bag full of money I´ve got in my hand


Oh I grew up believing in Jesse and Frank
cause I never had nothin´ or noone to thank
and I came pretty close to unloadin´ a bank
but I was saved by my draft board who made me a yank

Floating I´m floating...

And in the 101st they busted your hump
but they taught me a man isn´t always a chump
In the course of Korea I learned how to jump
In the card game of life I was holding a trump

Floating I´m floating...

If you can´t get a job and they think you´re insane
If the years of your youth have been washed down the drain
And you wake up some mornin´ with nothin´ but pain
It was then I decided to grab me a plane

Floating I´m floating...

With all of my training it wasn´t too tough
Now I´m through taking orders and all of their guff
Gonna buy a Rolls Royce and some luxury stuff
Cause a veteran´s pension ain´t nearly enough

Floating I´m floating...
