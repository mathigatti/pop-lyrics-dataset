Starlight crossed my eyes, she took me by surprise
Said you´d come to town, last summer brought me down
I said I´d never seen the likes of you before
She pulled a gun and not in fun I´m dyin´ on the floor


You all look alike, I´m sorry I don´t know
You all look alike, we never met before
Now matter how I try to say I´ve never been down this way
Said I couldn´t be fair cause you all look alike

Lyin´ here and dyin´ here I´m trying to get my strength
It´s so hard to get on back when you´re lyin´ at full length
All the crowds and all the dogs from miles around just stare
They looked at me and shed a tear, I´m glad those people care

You all look alike, I´m sorry I don´t know
You all look alike, we never met before
Now matter how I try to say I´ve never been down this way
Said I couldn´t be fair cause you all look alike
