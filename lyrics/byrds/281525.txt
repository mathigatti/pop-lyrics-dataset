At a dance, I'm standing there
Suddenly approached by a lady fair
Said to me 't'ain't no lie'
If I can't have you I'd surely die
Psychodrama City, don't need none today


My good friends say to me
The world will end soon, wait you'll see
Said I don't care, won't be here
Going to Florida for a half a year 
Psychodrama City, don't need none today

Me and my friends got on a plane
One of my friends got off again
To this day don't know why
He got on at all, if he did't really want to fly
Psychodrama City, don't need none today

Me and my friend went over my friends house to see
Me and my friends on his T.V.
Before the night is over I saw six murders, two riots and a war 
Not going to watch my friends TV no more
Psychodrama City, don't need none today
