Pushed me off the street today
The lamp light gets in the way
On the darkness you pushed me in
You say that it´s a sin we´re hangin´ around


You told me not to sing today
You say my music gets in the way
Cause he walks on in just as you begin
Bringin´ my soul brothers down

And although you´re smiling
your hate will not cease
So just face yourself babe
and leave my soul in peace

Well I´ll stay out of your way
if you keep out of mine
Find the good lookin´ people go
Oh you know we´ll both go down in time
