In times of dispair, I think about the good things that you've done
And though you're not there, I sometimes ask myself, is anyone? 
It's hard being human, when the whole world's uptight


But somehow I know
That everything's gonna work out all right

I might lose my patience, but won't you please try to understand
I've got obligations, and I intend to face 'em and take my stand
Oh, it's so hard being human, with all the troubles in sight

But somehow I know
That everything's gonna work out all right

Stick by me baby, in spite of my thoughts
That's all I want you to do, and try to help me when I'm down
And I'll take good care of you

Now I want to thank you for all the gentle loving that you give
It brightens my feelings and gives me the strength I need to live
Oh it's so hard being human, with all of the troubles in sight

But somehow I know
That everything's gonna work out all right
