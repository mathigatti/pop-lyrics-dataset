How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I'd do things my way
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
For money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a heart that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
Once I was living in fortune and fame
I had all that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game
Then suddenly it happened and I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
