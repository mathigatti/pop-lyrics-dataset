You moving           
Oh you moving    
Oh you moving    
Oh yeah


Now I've been watching you dance for a while little girl
And I'd like to have a chance to learn your style little girl
'cause you have a way of moving that I hope to be able to do
I am girl so fascinated watching

You moving               
Oh you moving           
Oh you moving    
Oh yeah

Now the way you toss your hair when you step and swing to the right
Has a feeling I get there that is way way out of sight
'Cause I want to be with you and I want to be doing it to
I am falling so in love watching

You moving
Oh you moving           
Oh you moving    
Oh yeah

You moving Oh yeah

Now if I could be with you and if we could look pretty a pair
And you showed me how you step, step with your dance, dance anywhere
'Cause you have a way of moving that I hope to be able to do
I am falling so in love watching

You moving
Oh you moving           
Oh you moving    
Oh you moving    
Oh yeah
