We're driving down the highway seven days a week
Looking for a number one looking rather bleak
Well i'm a roadie what a job being a roadie
I'm a roadie b.b. class road
I get them to the gig on time it's not so hard to do


They only way to break a crime speeding is the thing to do
Well i'm a roadie what a job being a roadie
I'm a roadie b.b. class road

Well i'm really really really really tired today
I've been checking my gear all night
You know what they're all gonna say
Someday you're gonna miss a flight
Well i'm a roadie here today and truckin all the same
I'm a roadie b.b. class road  b.b. class road b.b. class road
