I´ve been warped by the rain, driven by the snow
Drunk and dirty, don´t you know,
And i´m still' willin'.
And i was out on the road late at night
Seen my pretty alice in ev´ry headlight
Alice dallas alice.
And i´ve been from tucson to tucumcari, tahachapi to tournapaw.
I´ve driven ev´ry kind of righ that´s ever been made,
Driven the backroads so i wouldn´t get weighed.
And if you give me weed, whites, and wine,
And you show me a sign, i´ll be willin' to be movin´.
Kicked by the wind, dropped by the sleet
Had my mead stoved in, but i´m still on my feet,
And i'm still (in a whole lot of trouble).
Smuggled some smokes, some folks from mexico.
Baked by the sun  ev'ry time i go to mexico.
And i'm still ...
And i've been ...
