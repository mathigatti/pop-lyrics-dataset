In the beginning you really loved me
But I was blind and I could not see
But when you left me oh how I cried
You don´t miss your water till your well runs dry


I was a playboy, I could not be true
I couldn´t believe I really loved you
But when you left me oh how I cried
You don´t miss your water till your well runs dry
