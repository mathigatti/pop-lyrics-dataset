Here it comes again, it's going to happen to me
Here it comes, i should have learned to duck
She's going to say,     she's going away
And i will have to live without her and survive


Here it comes, it looks just like the last wave i drowned in
Here it comes, and i'm so far from shore
She's going to go, and take her trinkets
And i will have to live without her and survive

Here it comes again, the night is going to fall
Here it comes, she's going to say good-bye
She's going to go, and leave only me
And i will have to live without her and survive.
