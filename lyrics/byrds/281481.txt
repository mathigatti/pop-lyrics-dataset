Stand before your maker, it will make or break you
While living for today
I know you, you are a faker, don't try me I will take you
While living for today


Don't stand in the light for the truth it will blind you
Secure in your offices of self-gratification
Deaf to the cries of the innocent strangers you buried
Don't look over your shoulder for the past is still burning
Or wriggle and squirm for your soul has forgotten
Controlling the man that through greed has brought misery to the world

Guilty until you're proven innocent
I'm sorry, but you've sealed your own fate
Guilty until you're proven innocent
Guilty because you looked/turned away

Power manipulators, conspirators, dictators
Drive the people underground
But we'll rise up through the ashes,
To stand where light can find us
In every nation, every land

You buy and you sell with no thought for the future
Controlling the masses in true business like fashion
TV, the media, lies and deception blinding us
