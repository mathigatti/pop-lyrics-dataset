If you're looking to get a good thing going for yourself
House and pool  a new  rolls royce and  some  degree of wealth
Don't make waves don't make waves  don't make waves
Take a ride out west to find that freedom that you crave
Kick that nine to five   dont  let them make you a slave
Don't make waves don't make waves  don't makes waves
And when the toys  that you dreamed  of have finally come
They all will break and you're back where you started  from
Malibou is calling you
With days and nights so warm
You can find excitement any size shape or form
Don't make waves don't make  waves waves don't make waves
