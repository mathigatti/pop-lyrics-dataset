You make me smile 
And all the while 
You're so cool I can feel 
You care if it's real
Our love


I found you here 
The sun in your hair 
Caught my eye passing by
I knew I should try
Our love
 
I watched the planes coming in
Felt my heart beat begin    
And I knew that
I would stay

A cab for two 
A whole city new
But this time we'll share
The love we'll find there
Our love
