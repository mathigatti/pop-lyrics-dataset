I got a letter this morning with some serious news that's gone and ruined my day,
The borough surveyor's used compulsory purchase to acquire my domain,
They're gonna pull up the floors, they're gonna knock down the walls,
They're gonna dig up the drains.


Here come the people in grey, they're gonna take me away to Lord knows only where,
But I'm so unprepared, I got no time to pack and I got nothing to wear,
Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Me and my baby gonna get on a train that's gonna take us away,
We're gonna live in a tent, we're gonna pay no more rent, we're gonna pay no more rates,
We're gonna live in a field, we're gonna buy me gun to keep the policemen away.

I'm gonna pass me a brand new resolution,
I'm gonna fight me a one man revolution, someway,
Gonna beat those people in grey,
But here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

People in grey have gone and taken away my right to voice my complaint,
Her Majesty's Government have sent me a form, I must complete it today.
But it's making me blue, don't wanna tell all my secrets to
The people in grey.

Gonna pass me a brand new resolution,
Gonna fight me a one man revolution, someway,
Gonna start my rebellion today.
But here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Oh, Lord, those people in grey,
I gotta get back at those people in grey,
Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.
