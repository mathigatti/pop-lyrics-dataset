Back when cattle creek used to sing
It's waters were sweet and it's banks were green
And sunny days, went on forever
Me and old bugler, we'd run wild
Bluetick hound and the redneck child
We thought we were, birds of a feather


Ah the fish would bite, my how they'd bite
We'd catch them possoms in the pail moonlight
For ma, just to please her
Bugler's voice like gabriel's horn
Up in the cypress, all down through the corn
Golden sounds, yes to treasure

Chorus
Bugler, bugler, bless your hide
Jesus gonna take you for a chariot ride
Say goodbye, say goodbye

One day ma she brought the news
She said, honey young bugler's done paid his dues
He's been hit down, yes on that highway
Dry your eyes and stand up straight
Bugler's got a place at the pearly gates
Say goodbye sugar, oh say goodbye

Repeat chorus
