Well I had an old dog and his name was Blue
Yes I had an old dog and his name was Blue
Well I had an old dog and his name was Blue
I bet you five dollars he´s a good dog too


Old Blue chased a possum up a holler limb
Blue chased a possum up a holler limb
Blue chased a possum up a holler limb
The possum growled, Blue whined at him

Bye Bye Blue, you good dog you
Bye Bye Blue, you good dog you

When old Blue died he died so hard
He shook the ground in my back yard
We lowered him down with a golden chain
and every link we called his name

My old Blue was a good old hound
You´d hear him holler miles around
When I get to heaven first thing I´ll do
is grab my horn and call for Blue
