Love for anyone who needs her
Innocence is all that feeds her
Rollin´ through the mist
Floating in a sea of madness
Reaching for the heights of gladness
or did she exist
Swirling ions from the stars streaming down on to the earth
from a galaxy like ours manifested in her birth
Child of the universe giving freely of herself
Purity of truth rehearse leaving men her cosmic well


Love for anyone.......exist.
Vision of an untouched grace walkin´ gaily through the sun
No one else could take her place nor the work that she´d begun

Love for anyone who needs her
Innocence is all that feeds her
Rollin´ through the myth
Knowing what is understanding
Patience that is undemanding
or did she exist
or did she exist
