Scene: Mr. Black's army is closing in on Flash &amp; The Spivs.
After a long day's campaigning Flash, having overindulged
the alcohol, has fallen asleep in his den.


Voice: Cooee. Cooee. Flash. Flash

Flash: Who is this?

Voice: Wake up Flash. Can you hear me Flash?

Flash: Who is this? Who dares to wake me from my slumber?

Voice: Need I announce myself? Am I such a stranger to you?

Flash: Say your name. Speak!

Voice: I am your soul.

Flash: My soul?

Voice: I have come to show you who you are.

Flash: Show me who I am? I know who I am you upstart! How
dare you intrude.

Voice: You lied and schemed and took over a simple village and
turned it into a vulgar playground for your own money-
making ends. Before you came people lived simple lives.
This was a happy place. Then you ploughed up the fields,
sold off the land and lined your own pockets with the profits.

Flash: Lies! Lies! I did it to help the nation

Voice: You did it for your own preservation!

Flash: No! No!

Voice: Prepare yourself Flash, there are many who suffered at your
hands. They are craving for vengeance. Time is running out.

Flash: Can this be the end? Can this be the swan song? The final
elbow? I will not go. The people need me.

Voice: Men like you will always come and go, but the people will go
on forever. Take one final look at the past Flash. Enjoy it,
because you have no future.

Flash: No! No! No! I can't stand this.

Trumpets herald the final confrontation between Flash and himself.
