It's no use saying you're gonna stay
If you don't want to be all mine
I haven't got room for somebody who
Is gonna hurt me all the time
Somebody who couldn't see
All the love I was trying to give
It's no use saying you're gonna stay
If you don't want our love to live.
It's no use keeping you around
If you don't want me all the way
There's somebody new who can be found
And I'll find her someday
And she will be everything
All the love she has she'll want to give
It's no use saying you're gonna stay
If you don't want our love to live.
If you don't, oh I'd love to leave
If you don't, oh I'd love to leave
Oh I should be good to you but I can't cause before
I was really true to you but you only hurt me more
(repeat first verse)
