Oh you know it makes me sad to see you feel so bad
But it's happened to you many times before
But if you will come with me then girl you will see
That you won't have to cry anymore


There's no reason to feel blue because of what he says to you
And I wouldn't want to see you hurt no more
I could never do you wrong 'cause my love for you's too strong
And you won't have to cry anymore

Oh I saw you there with tears in your eyes
Because he told you so many many lies
Oh you know it isn't right to put yourself up tight
By thinking 'bout the things he's done before

Just trust the love in me
And girl you will see
That you won't have to cry
No you won't have to cry
No you won't have to cry anymore
