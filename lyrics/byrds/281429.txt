Change is now, change is now
Things that seemed to be solid are not
All is now, all is now
The time that we have to live


Gather all that we can
Keep in harmony with love´s sweet plan

Truth is real, truth is real
That which is not real does not exist
In and out roundabout
Dance to the day when fear it is gone

Gather all that we can
Keep in harmony with love´s sweet plan

Change is now, change is now
Things that seemed to be solid are not
In and out roundabout
Dance to the day when fear it is gone
Fear it is gone
Fear it is gone
