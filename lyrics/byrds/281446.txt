Into a lifetime of the time
See flowers bloom then fade to dust
I watch each moment sadly die


Time the stranger called me here
Fields before me I walk alone
Each tear that falls is lost forever

And this illusion where time has its way
Stripping away the future
People standing still, waiting for a tomorrow that never comes

Eternity, deserting me
While time just passes by
Eternity, deserting me
Time...
Time...

My soul has touched 
isolation
The ticking clock of passing time who never stops to see today

Time the stranger called me here
Fields before me I walk alone
Each tear that falls is lost forever

Eternity, deserting me
While time just passes by
Eternity, deserting me

Eternity, it calls me
While time just passes by
Eternity, deserting me
Time...
Time...
