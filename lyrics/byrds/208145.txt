Have you seen her face? 
With her eyes reflect
The colors in the sky
On one familiar place
To be swept into
Whenever she's close by
Makes me wonder why


Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from the look in her eye

Must be the way she walks
A style made up to capture all ahe needs
No time to spend on this talk
If your luck runs dry
She might see you tonight
Everything inside (in sight? ? ? )

Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from the look in her eye

Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from the look in her eye

You'll find you're locked in her spell
All the sights and sounds
Your senses will be found
And only time will tell
How much love can be
To wait so patiently
Wait and see
Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from the look in her eye
