I'm going back baby way behind the sun
I'm going back baby way behind the sun
I'm gonna find me some honey and I just might bring you some
Well I'm going back baby don't you want to go
I'm going back baby don't you want to go
Goodbye to trouble never come back no more


You're gonna go out and find one of those fancy men
You better go out and find one of those fancy men
He'll roll you over in the clover and never come back again
Well I'm going back baby way behind the sun
Yes I'm going back baby way behind the sun
I'm gonna find me some honey and I just might bring you some
