Well you think you've got it bad
And you think that you've been had
Well you never were so wrong
If you just listen to this song
Your debts will all be doubled
Iffin' you all be so troubled
You never gonna help your brother
If you can't help yourself


* Get down your line
Get down your line
Get down your line
Get down your line
And you'll be just fine
Get down your line
And don't waste no time
Then you can give everyday that you live

Well, get yourself together
Don't ever mind the weather
Then you can help your neighbour
And help him with his labor
If you get yourself together 
Then giving is so much pleasure
It makes your life a treasure
If you can do someone some good 

Get down your line
Get down your line
Get down your line
Get down your line
And you'll be just fine
Get down your line
And don't waste no time
Then you can give everyday that you live
