See your face everywhere,
Giving you all my life,
All I own is for you.


There's a fire, a fire burning in my heart,
Can't deny it, a fire burning in my heart for you.
A fire burning in my heart.

It only goes to show,
The world is full of miracles,
I thought I'd never know.

Touch my soul with your light,
Freeing me of all doubt,
Of all fear, here in me.

There's a fire, a fire burning in my heart,
Can't deny it, a fire burning in my heart for you.

Fire, a fire burning in my heart,
A fire burning in my heart for you.

There's a fire, a fire burning in my heart.
