Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright oh yeah
Jesus is just alright with me
Jesus is just alright

I don´t care where they may go
I don´t care what they may know
Jesus is just alright

I don´t care what they may say
I don´t care what they may do
I don´t care what they may say
Jesus is just alright oh yeah
Jesus is just alright
