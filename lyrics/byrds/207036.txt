Daytime just makes me feel lonely
At night I can only dream about you
Girl you're on my mind
Nearly all of the time
It's so hard being here without you.
Words in my head keep repeating
Things that you said when I was with you.
And I wonder is it true
Do you feel the same way too
It's so hard being here without you
Being here without you
Oh I know this won't last
I'll see you someday
It seems as though that day will come never
But there's one thing I'll swear
Though you're far away
I'll be thinking about you forever
Streets that I walk on depress me
Ones that were happy when I was with you
Still with all the friends I know
And with all the things I do
It's so hard being here without you
Being here without you.
