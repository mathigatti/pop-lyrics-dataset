One day she came along, I didn´t know her name
My friends said to me watch out for the game
I didn´t want to believe all the things they said
It seemed to be the right time a love afffair instead


Walkin´ down the beach, kickin´ up the sand
Not so far away wonderin´ where they´ll land
We talked of things to do and places that we´d tame
A one with a love to share with a girl who had no name
who had no name

Then it came the time they said when all the good went bad
She walked into the night, it didn´t make me sad
I felt my friends´ advice echo through my soul
A one with a love to share with a girl who had no name
who had no name
