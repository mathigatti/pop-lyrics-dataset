You're walking 'round in my memory
That only gets stronger and stronger
Smudged mascara and pill-shaped eyes
Everything you want was bought with lies.


But what can I do about it
The say you won't last any longer
All the gates of love you won't walk through
The only gates you see are colored blue.

I see you peering through frosted windows
Eyes don't smile, all they do is cry
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right

Oh how can I live without her
The doctors won't let me see her
But I can catch a glimpse through the doorway
Of the girl that I love and care for

I see you peering through frosted windows
Eyes don't smile, all they do is cry
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right
