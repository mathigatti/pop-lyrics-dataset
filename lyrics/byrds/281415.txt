Dressed in country cloth and sitting on the floor
Warmed by antique sun amid the green timber 
Held together by uncertainty, climb the Babel tower
Looking up instead of down, we need room to gamble


Sunday morning exercises started stand alone
Filling in the vacant spaces with the dreams of truth
Intimitations slowly sinking in, see the dreams we dreamed
Looking up instead of down still a-hiding

Absolute happiness unties the ropes that bind
Greatness and unity shines within the mind
Shines within the mind

So long ago I promised to conscience and easily wrote a code
So the Lord and I'll soon be back together again
Men'll always be equal times a bad connection
Looking up instead of down only good prevails

Absolute happiness unties the ropes that bind
Greatness and unity shines within the mind
Shines within the mind
