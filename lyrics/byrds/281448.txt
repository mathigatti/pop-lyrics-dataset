I am a creator,
Inventor and innovator.
I observe the people,
The ordinary people
No matter what your occupation is
Everybody's in showbiz.
'Cos I'm a Star (gonna make you a star),
And I can make you a Star (gonna make you a star),
I believe that everybody's a celebrity,
And we've all got personality
And individuality.
We all read lines,
And we all act a part,
We all need a script
And an audience to play to.
No matter what you do,
Or who you are,
Everybody's a star.


I'm the magic maker,
I'm the image maker,
I'm the interior decorator.

I can take any man
I see standing in the road
And put rouge on his cheeks
And put some powder on his nose.
I'll teach him how to act,
I'll remould and reshape him.
I'll put him in a stage suit
And I'll teach him how to pose.
I can turn the most ordinary man in the world into a star.
I'm a starmaker (gonna make you a star),
Yes, I'm gonna make you a star (gonna make you a star)
No matter how dull or simple you are
Everybody's a star.

I'm the magic maker,
I'm the image maker,
I can make or break you.
l'm a star maker (gonna make you a star)
Yes, I'm gonna make you a star (gonna make you a star),
Gonna make you a star,
'Cos everybody's a star.
