I was really good to her but how she broke my heart 
She looked so young and she seemed so sweet but I was wrong from the start
She has a way about her that makes her run around
Now I wonder if she'll ever wanna settle down  


Oh oh, oh oh

I waited so impatiently it didn't do my mind any good
I never thought she would set me free I did all the things that I should
Then all at once I looked for her but she could not be found
Now I wonder if she'll ever wanna settle down  

Oh oh, oh oh

I didn't think that I
Could wait for her very long
But I didn't realize
My love for her was so strong

She might be going from heart to heart she might be putting them down
The way she took it all apart made me the laugh of the town  
She has a way about her that makes her run around
Now I wonder if she'll ever wanna settle down 

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
