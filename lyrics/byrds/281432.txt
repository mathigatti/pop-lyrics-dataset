My buddies tell me that i should have waited
They say i'm missing a whole world of fun
But i still love them and i say with pride
I like the christian life
I won't lose a friend while heeding  god's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasures in things i despise
I like the christian life


My buddies shun me since i turned to jesus
They say i'm missing a whole world of fun
I live without them walking the line
I like the christian life
I won't lose a friend while heeding  god's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasures in things i despise
I like the christian life
I like the christian life
