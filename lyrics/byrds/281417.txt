Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was blind but now am found
Was blind but now I see


It was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath bro't me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear
It soothes his sorrows, heals the wounds
And drives away his fear

Must Jesus bear the cross alone
And all the world go free
No, there's a cross for ev'ry one
And there's a cross for me
