F I need you, it's to me you're everything
If I have you, if I love you just the same
If you're here, the night is rightly gone before
If you're gone, I'll see the daylight and that's all


If I stand on understanding what is now
If I ever need someone to show me how
If the daylight can be hidden by the sun
If you're gone, then I know I will need someone

If I love you, if I know how much I care
If I find the things you are then anywhere
If I know you, I may never know your name
If you're gone, then there is nothing that remains
