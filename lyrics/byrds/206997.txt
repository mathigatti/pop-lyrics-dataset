Glory, glory hallelujah
Since I laid my burden down
Glory, glory hallelujah
Since I laid my burden down
I feel so much better
So much better
Since I laid my burden down
I feel so much better
So much better
Since I laid my burden down
Glory, glory hallelujah
Since I laid my burden down
Glory, glory hallelujah
Since I laid my burden down
Thank you jesus, thank you jesus
Help me lay my burden down
I wanna thank you jesus, thank you jesus
Help me lay my burden down
Since I laid my burden down
Glory, glory hallelujah
Since I laid my burden down
Glory, glory hallelujah
