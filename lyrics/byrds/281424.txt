Some people born in old kentucky
They think they're living in a tunnel mine of coal
Other people  born not quite so lucky
Giving everything by selling out their soul


I know that everybody's born for something
Just to feed them and keep them from the cold
Sometimes you get to do the things your meant to
And i know that i was born to rock n roll

Born to rock n roll satify your soul gonna rock n roll satisfy your soul
Gonna rock n roll satisfy your soul gonna rock n roll satisy your soul
Gonna rock n roll satisfy your soul


Always wanted to be a fireman just to steer the hook and ladder from behind
Then i thought i'd be a great inventor
But i found it might be too hard on my mind
I know that everybody's born for something
Just to feed them and to keep them it's all in the cards you hold
Yes i said i believe in magic and i believe that i was born to rock n roll

Born to rock n roll satify your soul  gonna rock n roll satisfy your soul
Gonna rock n roll satisfy your soul gonna rock n roll satisy your soul
Gonna rock n roll satisfy your soul (repeat to end)
