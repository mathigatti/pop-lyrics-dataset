The first thing that I heard you say
When you were standing there sad in your way
Was that you were not blind
You were sure to make a fool of me
'cause there was nothing there that you could see
That could go beyond your mind.
Now who's standing at the door
Remembering the days before
And asking please be kind
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I set you free this time
I have never been so far out in front
That I could ever ask for what I want
And have it any time


Knowing this you found the thought for me
That told you just what I should be
And there I stood behind.
With all the ones that were before
And memories that always seem to tear me from my mind
In front of what it is you see me to be
And I've set you free this time.

I could never find a chance to choose
Between a way to wear or a thing to loose
Because there was your stand
On top of all of the love you took
That was always something you could look at
Lying in your hand
Now who's wondering what has changed
And why it cannot be arranged to have each thing work fine
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I've set you free this time
