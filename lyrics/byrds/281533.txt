In nineteen and ninety-six we ventured to the moon
 Onto the the Sea Of Crisis like children from the womb
 We journeyed cross the great wall plain beneath the mountain range
 and there we saw the pyramid, it looked so very strange
 
This beacon had a field of force, that circled all around
 And not a man could get inside, no way could be found
 It was here for thousands of years before our life began
 Waiting very patiently for evolving man
 
 When the galaxy was young they looked upon the earth
 and saw that its position was promising for birth
 They searched for life but finding none they left a beacon bright
 Its signal had not been disturbed in the eternal light
 
 How wise they were to choose this place, they knew when we arrived
 That our atomic energy, we'd harnessed and survived
 I look out on the milky way for people of the dawn
 I know that they will come some day but will our wait be long?


In nineteen and ninety-six we ventured to the moon
Onto the the Sea Of Crisis like children from the womb
We journeyed cross the great wall plain beneath the mountain range
and there we saw the pyramid, it looked so very strange
