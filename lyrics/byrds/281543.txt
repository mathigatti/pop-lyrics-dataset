If I was strong then I wouldn´t care
If she was here or she was there
But I guess I didn´t go by the rules
`cause she really made me look like a fool


I shouldn´t have let it hurt me at all
`cause I know the price you pay when you fall
But I couldn´t believe it was true
When she told me we were through

And the reason why I cry
I wish I knew

My friends told me about her
When they saw me hold her hand
But I didn´t think they knew her
So how could they understand

I couldn´t hear a word they were saying
`cause inside my head the music was playing
But I found out it was all true
When she told me we were through

And the reason why I cry
I wish I knew

I couldn´t hear a word they were saying
`cause inside my head the music was playing
But I found out it was all true
When she told me we were through

And the reason why I cry
I wish I knew.

Oh yeah I wish I knew 
Oh yeah I wish I knew
