Cursed with sorrow, pain and remorse

Full of feelings i can't show
Hopeless love what else for me
Is this    my destiny
God in heaven surely meant
For every man somewhere a mate
Someone stole my love from me is this my destiny
At night i toss and wonder why
I must live while others die
The grave would be an escape for me this is my destiny


At night i toss and wonder why
I must live while others die
The grave would be an escape for me this is my destiny
Is this my destiny
