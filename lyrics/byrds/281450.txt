Now all the lies are beginning to show,
And you're not the country that I used to know.
I loved you once from my head to my toe,
But now my belief is shaken.


And all your ways are so untrue,
No one breaks promises the way that you do.
You guided me, I trusted you,
But now my illusion's shaken.

Thought this empire would be here
At least a thousand years.
But all the expectations and aspirations,
Slowly disappear.

Now all the lies have gone on too long,
And a million apologies can't right the wrong.
Soldiers die but the lies go on,
But soon we will awaken.

In our expectations for the future,
We were not to know.
We had expectations, now we've reached
As far as we can go.

And all your manners are too, too polite,
Just to prove that your conscious is white and bright.
You had your day so get ready for the night,
For another dawn is breaking.

We had expectations, now we've reached
As far as we can go.
