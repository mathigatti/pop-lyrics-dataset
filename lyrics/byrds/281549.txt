Happiness hit me on the first day that we met
She was sitting in my kitchen with a face I can't  forget
She was looking in my direction and calling with her eyes
I was trying to do and interview and telling them all lies
Last year in the summer  with a tiffany lamp over her head
They asked me what I thought about the 50's rock n roll
Then they got into a limousine and fell into a hole
I moved into the kitchen and I quickly fell in love
The warden came along and asked me what I was thinking of
Last year in the summer  with a tiffany lamp over her head
Well I grabbed her by the hand and  with a few things I could
The warden said  your leaving you better leave for good
I made it to Tasmania to buy a devil dog
We met a handsome prince who turned into a frog
Last year in the summer with a tiffany lamp over her head
Now we're living out in Malibu the ocean by our side
Laying in the sunshine drifting with the tide
Happiness hit me on the first day that we met
She was sitting in my kitchen with a face I can't forget
Last year in the summer with a tiffany lamp over her head
Over her head
