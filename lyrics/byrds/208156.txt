Fair young maid all in her garden
Strange young man came riding by
Saying: fair young maid, will you marry me? 
This then, sir, was her reply


Oh no, kind sir, I cannot marry thee
For I've a love who sails the deep salt sea
Though he's been gone these seven years
Still no man shall marry me

What if he's died all in some battle slain
Or if he's drowned in, in the deep salt sea? 
What if he's found some other love
He and his new love both married be? 

If he's found some other love
He and his new love both married be
I wish them health and happiness
Where they have love far across the sea

He picked her up all in his arms
And kisses gave her one, two and three
Then weep no more, my own true love
I am your long lost john riley
Saying: weep no more, my own true love
For I'm your long lost john riley
