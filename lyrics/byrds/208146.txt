He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
His killing had no purpose
No reason, or rhyme
He was a friend of mine


He was in dallas town
He was in dallas town
Form a sixth floor window
A gunner shot him down
He died in dallas town

He never knew my name
He never knew my name
Though I never met him
I knew him just the same
Oh, he was a friend of mine
