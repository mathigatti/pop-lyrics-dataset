Watch out what you say, don´t get in my way
I´m gonna get that girl, wait and see
I saw her today, she came by my way
I´m gonna win her love just for me


And together we´ll go walkin´
Through the evening still be talkin´
She´s the kind of girl you never hardly see

Have you seen her eyes, do you realize
How much love likt that can mean to me?
I know she knows me, today after tea
The way she held her head when she walked by

And before the night is over
I think I´m gonna love her
And if it last forever I don´t care

Say now she is mine, I told you all the time
How could I let a girl like that go by

And before the night is over
I think I´m gonna love her
And if it last forever I don´t care
