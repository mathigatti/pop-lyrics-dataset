My nights have been lonely since I`ve been in Tulsa country
and I really don`t know what I'm gonna do.
I just might take a trip somewhere along the southern border
'cause I know I've gotta get away from you.


I don't know - just where I'll go
I believe I'll ride it down to Mexico
down to Mexico.

Got your note in Charlston, said you needed my assistance
but when I got there you didn't need me then.
I may not be a wise man but I know this life you're leading
you learned your tricks from lots of other men.
