You showed me how to do exactly what to do
How I fell in love with you
Oh oh oh it's true
Oh oh I love you


You showed how to say exactly what to say
In that very special way 
Oh oh oh it's true
You fell for me too

And when I tried it
I could see you fall
And I've decided
It's not a trick at all

You taught it to me too exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Oh oh oh it's true
We're in love we two

And when I tried it
I could see you fall
And I've decided 
It's not a trick at all

You taught it to me too exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Oh oh it's true
We're in love we too
