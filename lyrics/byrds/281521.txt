Please let me love you a while
Let me live in the warmth of your smile
Let them see you with me
Let them wish they could be
as lucky as me
To have you here, to hold you oh so near
Oh yeah, oh yeah


Please let me love you today
Let me give you my heart right away
And we´ll walk in the sun
And we´ll tell everyone
A new love has begun
Just you and me
always
Oh yeah oh yeah

And when I hold you I feel so high
And when I kiss you I could fly
