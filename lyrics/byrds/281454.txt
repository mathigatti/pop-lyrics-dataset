Fido stayed all night, he would not go home
I asked him to leave, I said I do not have that bone
I was feelin´ lonesome sittin´ by the phone
Wide awake stayin´ up late wishin´ I was home


You were on the outside talking to some chick
I was on the inside feelin´ mighty sick
Sleep is what I wanted, you know what I got
Wide awake...

Dogs have it made, lyin´ round in the shade
Never have to worry about get there on time
I can´t help but wonder what was on your mind
Ridin´ round in the pouring rain, havin  a heck of time
Livin´ may be easy, dyin´ may be hard
But I´m wide awake stayin´ up late, sendin´ my regards
