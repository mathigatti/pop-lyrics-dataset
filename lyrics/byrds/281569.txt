The jukebox is playin'
A honky-tonk song
"One more," I keep sayin'
"And then I'll go home"
What good will it do me
I know what I'll find


An empty bottle, a broken heart
And you're still on my mind

The people are dancin'
And havin' their fun
And I sit here thinkin'
About what you have done
To try and forget you
I've turned to the wine

An empty bottle, a broken heart
And you're still on my mind

Alone and foresaken
So blue I could cry
I just sit here drinkin'
'Til the bottle runs dry
What good will it do me
I know what I'll find
An empty bottle, a broken heart
And you're still on my mind
