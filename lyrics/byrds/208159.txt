Crimson flames tied through my years
Rollin high and mighty trapped
Countless violent flaming roads
Using ideas as my map
We'll meet on edges soon said i
Proud 'neath heated brow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now


Half wracked prejudice leaped forth
Rip down all hate I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic flanks of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
Sisters fled by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

My guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
