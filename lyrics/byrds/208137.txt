Oh, you know it makes me sad to see you feel so bad
For it happened to you many times before
But if you will come with me
Then girl you will see
That you won't have to cry any more
There's no reason to feel blue, because nobody says to you
And I will..........to see you hurt no more
I could never do you wrong cause my love for you is too strong
And you won't have to cry any more
Oh I saw you very............in your eyes
Because he told so many, many lies
Oh you know.......
To put yourself on time
Try thinking now the things we said before (we've done ? )
Just trust in loving me and girl you will see
That you won't have to cry any more
