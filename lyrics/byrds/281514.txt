Well I come from Alabama with the banjo on my kneee
and I´m going to Lousiana Susannah for to see
Oh Susannah oh don´t you cry for me
Cause I come from Alabama with the banjo on my knee


Well it rained so hard the night I left, the weather it was dry
And it was so hot I froze to death, Susannah don´t you cry
Oh Susannah oh don´t you cry for me
Cause I come from Alabama with the banjo on my knee
