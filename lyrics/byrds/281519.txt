Oh I love you in the morning
when the sun comes shining through
And I love you in the daylight
when the sheets turn pale blue


Oh I want to be your lover
and to have you all alone
But my woman´s got another
and I haven´t got a home

Someday I´ll stop my traveling
Settle down with you
And I see you in the daylight
when the sheets turn pale blue
