Haven't you noticed a kind of madness in my eyes?
It's only me, dear, in my midnight disguise.
Pay no attention if I crawl across the room.
It's just another full moon.


Don't be afraid of me when I'm walking in my sleep.
Don't get alarmed, dear, when I start to crawl and creep.
Try not to listen when I mumble like a loon.
It's just another full moon.
It's just another full moon.

You see before you a truly broken man.
'Cause when it gets to midnight, I don't know who I am.
Full moon's a-callin', and it's put a curse on me,
And it will never set me free.

The full moon's still up there,
Like a great white balloon.
The owls are a-callin',
And they're singin' my tune.
The night keeps a-callin'.
I wish the day would come soon,
To get away from another full moon.
Here comes another full moon.

If your hands start shakin'
When night starts to fall,
If you're scared of the moonlight
And the shadows on the wall,
If the face in the mirror
Isn't you at all,
It's just another full moon.
It's just another full moon.

La la la la la la.
La la la la la la.
La la la la la la.
La la la la la la.
It's just another full moon.
