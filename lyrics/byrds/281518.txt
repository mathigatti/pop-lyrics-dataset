One hundred years from this day
Will the people still feel this way 
Still say things that they're saying right now
Everyone said I'd hurt you 
They said that I'd desert you
If I go away you know I'm gonna get back some how


Nobody knows what kind of trouble we're in
Nobody seems to think it all might happen again

One hundred years from this time
Would anybody change their mind
And find out one thing or two about life
People are always talking
You know they're always talking
Everybody's so wrong that I know it's gonna work out fine

Nobody knows what kind of trouble we're in
Nobody seems to think it all might happen again
