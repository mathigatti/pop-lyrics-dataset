Out at sea for a year
Floating free from all fear
Every day blowin' spray,
In a dolphin´s smile


Wind-taut line split the sky,
Curlin´crest rollin´ by
Floating free aimlessly,
In a dolphin´s smile

Rainbow´s end everywhere,
Full of light, free as air
Childhood´s dream,
Have you ever seen a dolphin´s smile
