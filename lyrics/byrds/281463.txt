Funny how the circle turns around first your up and then your down again
Though the circle takes what it may give
Each time around it makes you live again
Funny how the circle is a wheel
And it can steal someone who is a friend
Funny how the circle takes your flight
And if it's it right it brings you back again
Funny how the circle turns around
You think your lost and then you're found again
Though you always look for what you know
Each time around it's something new again
