Upon my face i feel the sun
I see the children play and run
I hope they'll always stay that way
As tomorrow turns to yesterday
The trees are bending with the wind
The evening sky begins to dim
I see a man who walks alone
The warmth of love he has not known


So come my friend  and let's be one
Forget your fears let them be done
It's all one world in which we live
So understand and try to give

So come my friend  and let's be one
Forget your fears let them be done
It's all one world in which we live
So understand and try to give
It's all one world in which we live
So understand and try to give
