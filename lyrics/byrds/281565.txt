You got a reputation for running around
Ain´t gonna take your fooling, baby, you know you better settle down
Cause you ain´t doin´ nothin´,you´re just tearing your own reputation down
You keep on running around, you know that you
ain´t doin´ nothin´ but tearing your own reputation down


Now you got a disposition, you´re putting me uptight
I know you´re always fishing, baby, but I won´t bite
Cause you ain´t doin´.......
