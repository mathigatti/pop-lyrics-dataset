Grease collecting stained-glass rubies
Pillowed gently on a strand
Bearing looks of frenzied blankness
Slowing down their freebie king


Middleclass suburban children
wearing costumes that reveal
Blindly follow recent pipers
with their mystical appeal
go now

So I´m leavin´ for the country to try and rest my head
Cause if I hang around this scene too long you know babe I´ll be dead

Color changes superficial
Apathy still a king
Liberal reactonaries
never feeling anything
go now
