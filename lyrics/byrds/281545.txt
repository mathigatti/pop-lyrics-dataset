There must be someone I can turn to
Someone like me, lonely too
All my life I´ve been alone, got no friends, got no home
and there must be someone I can turn to


Well all my so called friends have turned their backs on me
They were lookin´ for someone I just couldn´t be
Let them go and have their fun, unaware of the harm they´ve done
and there must be someone I can turn to

Now if all the tears that I should have cried are still inside me
Why can´t a man be accepted for what he has to be
Must I live my whole life through not knowin´ what to do
Oh there must be someone I can turn to
Turn to, turn to, turn to
Oh there must be someone I can turn to
Turn to, turn to, turn to
