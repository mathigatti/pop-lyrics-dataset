C.T.A.102 year over year receiving you
Signals tell us that you´re there
We can hear them loud and clear


We just want to let you know
that we´re ready for to go
Out into the universe, we don´t care who´s been there first

On a radio telescope
science tells us that there´s hope
Life on other planets might exist
