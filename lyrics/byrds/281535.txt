Sweet mary i've got to be leaving
Oh i can't let you into my life
Cause i know it would end in grieving and the last thing i need is a
Wife
When i met i met you for pleasure
And the good times of running around
Then you seemed to be so understanding
From the weight that's  been draggin me down
The good times are coming between us
Though you  helped me i'm carrying   my load
And i've never felt more like a lover  but i'm running  right off the
Road
Sweet mary i've got to be leaving
Oh i can't let you into my life
I need is a
Wife
Oh it's nothing you said  or invited
And it's nothing  you did that was wrong
Our love together was heaven but i promised myself to be strong
Sweet mary i've got to be leaving
Oh i can't let you into my life
Cause i know it would end in grieving and the last thing i need is a
Wife
