Take awhiff, take a whiff, take a whiff on me
Oh birdie take a whiff on me
Hey baby take a whiff on me


Went down to the corner  4th street and Main
Trying to get some good cocaine
Oh baby take a whiff on me

Cocaine for horses and not for men
Doctors say it kills you but he donÂ´t know when
Hey baby take a whiff on me
