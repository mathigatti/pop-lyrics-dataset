When first i came to liverpool i went upon the  spree
Me  money  at  last  i spent it fast got drunk as  drunk could be
And  when my money was all gone  it was then that i wanted more
But a man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more
I spent the night with angeline to drunk to roll in bed


Me watch it was new and my money was too
And the morning with them she fled
And as i roamed the streets of  bath the whores they all would roar
There goes jarr tarr the poor sailor
He must go to sea once more
As i walking down the steet i ran into rapper brown
I  asked him for to take me in and he looked at me with a frown
He said last time  you was on board     with me you job no  score
But i'll take your advance and i'll give you the chance
And i'll send you to sea once more
They shipped me aboard of  a whaling ship bound for the artic sea

Where the cold winds  blow thru the frost and the snow
Jamaica  rum would freeze
A'las i had no luck with my gear for i left my money ashore
It was then that i wished that  i was  there safe with the girl's
Ashore

Come all ye boat seafaring lads who listen to my song
And when you come off them long trip pray that you don't go wrong
Take my advice  drink no strong drink don't go sleeping with no whores
But get married lads and have all night  in and go to to sea no more
