How well I remember my very first love affair.
Those juvenile fantasies and innocent dreams we shared.
But we're too blind to realize that we are totally unprepared
For the first time we fall in love.
We think it's forever, the first time we fall in love.
We always treasure the first time we fall in love.
Those other romances come and go,
But we cherish the memory of
The first time we fall in love.


First love can be such a strain.
It can rule your head, it can bring you pain,
And when it ends it seems such a shame.
The first time we fall in love,
Can make you sad, it can keep you awake,
It can drive you mad.
People say you're too young and it's only a fad
The first time we fall in love.
The first time we fall in love.

The first time I fell out of love, it knocked me through the floor.
My world came crashing down, it shook me to the core.
I was unprepared 'cos I was only a kid
And I was much too young and I wasn't equipped
For the emotional pressures and stresses of it.
But oh, I'll never forget
The way that she looked the first time we met.
Time goes by but we never forget
The first time we fall in love.

Love can be exciting, it can be a bloody bore.
Love can be a pleasure or nothing but a chore.
Love can be like a dull routine,
It can run you around until you're out of steam.
It can treat you well, it can treat you mean,
Love can mess you around,
Love can pick you up, it can bring you down.
But they'll never know
The feelings we show
The first time we fall in love.
The first time we fall in love.
