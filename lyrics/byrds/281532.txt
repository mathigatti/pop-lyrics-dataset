So you you want to be a rock´n roll star
then listen now to what I say
Just get an electric guitar
and take some time and learn how to play
And when your hair's combed right and your pants fit tight
it´s gonna be all right


Then it´s time to go down town
where the agent men won´t let you down
Sell your soul to the company
who are waiting there to sell plastic ware
And in a week or two if you make the charts
the girls'll tear you apart

The price you  pay for your riches and fame
Was it all a strange game
You´re a little insane
The money that came and the public acclaim
Don´t forget what you are
You´re a rock´n roll star
