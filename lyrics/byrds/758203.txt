Baby, oh, baby 
Tell the man at the ticket stand 
That you've changed your mind 
Let me run on out and tell the cab 
To keep his meter flying 
'Cause if you say goodbye to me, babe 
You're gonna break my mind 


Break my mind, break my mind 
No, I just can't stand to hear them big jet engines whine 
Break my mind, break my mind 
If you leave you're gonna leave a babalin' fool behind 

Baby, oh, baby 
Let me take your suitcase 
Off the scales in time 
Tell the man that you've suddenly developed 
A thing about flyin' 
'Cause if you say goodbye to me, babe 
You know you're gonna break my mind
