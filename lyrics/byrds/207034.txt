Don't doubt yourself, babe
Let your feet stand up for your
I know what's running through your mind
It take you to capture your time
Make love straight and narrow, oh oh
Don't doubt yourself, girl
Let you know well
For all the been done to you
so don't be blue
been through you're lucky oh oh
Don't doubt yourself when
Daylight fades and darkness begin
It only comes to show you that
You don't know where it is at
Rest no nothing oh oh
Don't doubt yourself cause
At the end of your words no were applause
The truth's proved to be found
Hard to take first time around
So don't you worry it's gonna be alright oh oh
