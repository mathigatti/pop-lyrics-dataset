Catfish pie in gris gris bag
I´m the lover of the bayou
Mark your doorstep with a half wet rag
I´m the lover of the bayou
Raised and swam with the crocodile
Snake-eye taught me the Mojo style
Sucking weed on chicken bile
I´m the lover of the bayou


I learned the key to the master look
I learned to float in the water clock
I learned to capture the lightning shock
I´m the lover of the bayou
And I got cat´s an' teeth and hair for sale
I´m the lover of the bayou
Look out, look out, Baron Zombies on your tail
I´m the lover of the bayou

I cooked the bat in the gumbo pan
I drank the blood, drank the blood from a rusty can
Turned me into the Honga man
I´m the lover of the bayou
