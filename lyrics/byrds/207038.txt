The reason why, oh I can say
I have to let you go babe, and right away
After what you did, I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone


Baby for a long time, you had me believe
That your love was all mine, and that's the way it would be
But I didn't know, that you were putting me on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone

Now I've got to say, that it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play, your games anymore
After what you did, I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Oh when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
