Fallin´ free, me and you
Happenin´ so graciously
You can´t hurry natural harmony


Feel so free, wider than me
Seems just like the day of birth
Our first awakening to this earth

Dancing through the streets side by side
Head thrown back, arms open wide

Going home , almost gone
Merging with a grain of sand
Try hard to catch us if you can

Dancing through the streets side by side
Head thrown back, arms open wide
