Like a silent ray of sunlight catching in my eye
Like a bird sea-goin' coasting on my sky
It happens each day you're away from here


A bunch of friends are missing from this tapestry
I remember kissing do you remember me
It happens each day you're away from here

Like a disembodied spirit watching over me
Like a sister sailing ship dead against the sea
It happens each day you're away from here
