There´s not too many words that I can say
`cause I can´t describe my love for you this way
So I´ll just hold you tight, everything will be all right
Cause tomorrow is a long ways away
Tomorrow is a long ways away


And here in my arms you can stay
Don´t be afraid of what the people say
The only thing I see is the love you have for me
And tomorrow is a long ways away
Tomorrow is a long ways away

If you will stay here with me forever
I want you to know that my love for you will never die

And here in my arms...
