Headmaster, this is my confession.
This time you won't be overjoyed,
I have destroyed what little faith you had in me,
I've been such a naughty boy.
Headmaster I am at your mercy,
I've been such a little fool.
I've dishonored one who trusted me,
I have broken all the rules.
I've been with those naughty little girls again,
Now those naughty little girls are going to put me to shame.


I wish that I'd been born with a little more sense,
This time it's a serious offense.
I feel like an innocent victim,
I feel that I just can't win.
Headmaster please give me one chance,
Please help me to act like a man.
I've let down the school,
I've broken all the rules,
I've let down the side,
I've committed a crime.

Headmaster, this is my confession,
I've been such a little fool.
I've dishonored one who trusted me,
I have broken all the rules.
I've been such a little fool.
Don't tell all my friends I bent over,
Don't tell them you made me cry.
Don't tell them I've been sacrificed,
Don't tell all my friends or I'll die.
Headmaster don't beat me I beg you,
I know that I've let you down.
Headmaster please spare me I beg you,
Don't make me take my trousers down.
