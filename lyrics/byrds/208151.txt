Well, I know my rider's gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well, I know my rider's gonna miss me when I'm gone
She's gonna miss her loving daddy from rollin' in her arms
When you see me coming, better hoist your window high (your window high)
When you see me coming, better hoist your window high (your window high)
When you see, you see me leaving, better hang down your head and cry
Well, I know my rider, she's bound to love me some (to love me some)
Well, I know my rider, she's bound to love me some (to love me some)
She use to throw her arms around me like a circle around the sun


Well, I know my rider's gonna miss me when I'm gone (when I'm gone)
Well, I know my rider's gonna miss me when I'm gone (when I'm gone)
She's gonna miss her loving daddy from rollin' in her arms
Well, I know my rider's gonna miss me when I'm gone (when I'm gone)
Well, I know my rider's gonna miss me when I'm gone (when I'm gone)
She's gonna miss her loving daddy from rollin' in her arms
