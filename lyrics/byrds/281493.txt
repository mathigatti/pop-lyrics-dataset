I wanna grow up to be a politician
and take over this beautiful land
I wanna grow up to be a politician
and be the old USofA´s number one man


I´ll always be tough, I´ll never be scary
I want to shoot guns or butter my bread
I´ll work on the towns or conservate the prairies
And you can believe the future´s ahead

I´ll give the young the right to vote
as soon as they mature
But spare the rod and spoil the child
to help them feel secure

And if I win election day
I´ll sign the bill to help the poor
to show I´m not snob

I´ll open my door, I´m chargin´ no admission
And you can be sure I´ll give you my hand
I´ll be glad you got me in everything I do
and I´ll defend until the end
the old red, white and blue

I want to grow up...
