The jury found the verdict first degree
They swore I planned her death to be
I prayed they'd sentence me to die
But they wanted me to live and I know why


So I'd do life in prison for the wrongs I've done
And I pray every night for death to come
My life will be a burden every day
If I could die, my pain might go away

With trembling hands I killed my darling wife
Because I loved her more than life
My love for her will last a long, long time
But I'd rather die than live to lose my mind

And I'll do life in prison for the wrongs I've done
And I pray every night for death to come
My life will be a burden every day
If I could die, my pain might go away
If I could die, my pain might go away
