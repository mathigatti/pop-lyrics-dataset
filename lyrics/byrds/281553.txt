His tail lights flickering as he pulled up to the truck stop
The same old crowd was hanging out again tonight
He said fill up my tank while I go check my load
It feels like it´s shifting all around


He was the kind of man, do all he could
Above all he had integrity
But he was so young and on a ten city run
In love with a truck stop girl

As he went inside he was memorily greeted
By the girl with whom he was in love
She held out a glass and said have  another
This is the last time we can meet

With her hair piled up high and a look in her eye
That would turn any good man´s blood to wine
All his eyes could see, all his eyes could see
Was the stares from all these around him

He ran out to the lot and climbed into his rig
And drove off without tightening down
It was a terrible thing to see what remained
Of the rig that poor Danny was in

He was young and on a ten city run
In  love with a truck stop girl
