Hello cowgirl in the sand
Is this place at your command
Can I stay here for awhile
Can I see your sweet sweet smile
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same
It´s the woman in you that makes you want to play this game


Hello ruby in the dust
Has your band bgun to rust
After all the sin we´ve had
I was hoping that we´d turn bad
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same
It´s the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

Hello woman of my dreams
Is it not the way it seems
Purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same
It´s the woman in you that makes you want to play this game
