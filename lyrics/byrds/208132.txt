Sitting all alone now
I took my ticket to ride
Just a matter of time now
Til I'll be up in the sky.
Coming up on me now
I'm king for a night
What's it gonna be now? 
How willful things are building insight
Do you think it's really the trip that you seek? 
I've got my doubts it's happened to me.
Artificial energy
Is racing in my mind
I've got a strange feeling
I'm going to die before my time
Cause I'm coming down off amphetamines
And I'm in jail 'cause I killed the queen.
