I got goin', Jenny come along
Here come John, big boots on
I got goin', Jenny come along
Here come Johnny with his big boots on


I got goin', Jenny come along
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
She put it on, I put it on
Here come Johnny with his big boots on

Come on people give the fiddler a dram
Come on people give the fiddler a dram
Come on people give the fiddler a dram
Come on and give the fiddler a dram

I got a dog
Sitting on a fence
And I haven't seen the damn thing since
Worked all day with a bottle in my hand
Come on and give the fiddler a dram

Come on people give the fiddler a dram
Come on give the fiddler a dram
Come on people give the fiddler a dram
Come on and give the fiddler a dram

I got goin', Jenny come along
Twenty long years since I've been gone
I got goin', Jenny come along
Here come Johnny with his big boots on

Fiddler a dram, Fiddler a dram
Come on give the fiddler a dram
Fiddler a dram, Fiddler a dram
Come on give the fiddler a dram
