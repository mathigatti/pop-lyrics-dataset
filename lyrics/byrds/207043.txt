When I awake you will be gone
Shady tomorrow
I want to go where will you be
So I'll stay home letting my hair grow long
And I will be waiting for you
While fire burns summer is gone
Winter is sorrow
And time don't mean nothing to me
When only the owls (hours? ? ) listen to hear my songs
And I will be walking in dew
And I will be waiting for you
Some people say love goes away
Not mine
A rose is left for your cheeks
I will borrow
And find a place for you to see
A sash of blue tells me your love is strong
Each spring my life, starting anew
And I will be waiting for you
