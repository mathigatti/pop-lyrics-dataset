I think i'm gonna feel better when tomorrow comes
When i see the sun through my window
I think that everything is going to be all right
Though i know that you have found another
I hope you understand that i
Still love you so bad
But when tomorrow morning comes
I hope that you will see the sun shine too
Come shining through
I think i'm gonna feel better when tomorrow comes
When i see the sun
When i see the sun
