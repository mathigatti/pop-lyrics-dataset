Get up sing your praises from the bottom of my heart
I see your smiling face every time I turn around
You´re a changing lady with so many mystic moods
No wonder that I love you the way I seem to do


Precious Kate, it´s our fate
to meet inside the center of a Californian earthquake

It is my desire to capture all your love
Giving you the happiness you can only get from above
I love beeing near you and how I love to hear you
and I´d be the man you´d have to send away

Precious Kate...

Perhaps I want you too much, at times I tried too hard
But I´ve been lonely so long, my soul is near to starve
You do what you want to do, don´t want it end up here
Just wanna say I love you, that´s what you want to hear
