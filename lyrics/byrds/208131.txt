One of america's great national pastimes
Is drinking a coke
Taking a smoke
Telling a joke
One of america's great national pastimes
Is playing ball
Taking it all
And thinking so small


But the great taste of coke has refreshed players
The hot and tired
The weary and the sore
But the great taste of coke has refreshed players
The hot and tired
The weary and the sore

One of america's great national pastimes
Is chocolate fudge
Carrying a grudge
Bribing a judge
One of america's great national pastimes
Is poisoning rain

Inflicting pain

But the great taste of coke has refreshed players
The hot and tired
The weary and the sore
The great taste of coke has refreshed players the hot and tired
The weary and the..

One of america's great national pastimes
Is the worship of speed
Planting her seeds
Taking more than she needs
One of america's great national pastime
Is cutting the grass
Grabbing some ass
Living too fast

But the great taste of coke has refreshed players the hot and tired
The weary and the sore
The great taste of coke has refreshed players
The hot and tired
The weary and the sore
