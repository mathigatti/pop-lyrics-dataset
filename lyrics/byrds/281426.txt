Spoke to my girl on the phone t'other day
She said she wish I'd come there right away 
In Boston Massachusetts where she lives
Got to get there for the love she gives


Catch a plane and soon I will be gone
And I'll be in her arms before too long
In Boston Massachusetts she'll be there
And we'll be together everywhere

You see I'm leaving cause I'm sad
Got a girl and I want to see her bad
You see I'm not leaving 'cause of you
I just can't stand to sit here feeling blue

Can't go on when I don't like this town
I feel so bad not having her around
In Boston Massachusetts where she lives
Got to get there for the love she gives
