Oh, how is it that I could come out to here,
And be still floatin',
And never hit bottom but keep fallin' through,
Just relaxed and paying attention? 


All my two-dimensional boundaries are gone,
I have lost to them badly,
I saw that through. crumbling, I thought it was dead,
But I found my senses still working.
And as I continued to drop through the hole,
I found all surrounding,
To show me that joy innocently is,
Just be quiet and feel it around you.

(bridge)
And I opened my heart to the whole universe,
And I found it was loving,
And I saw the great blunder my teachers had made,
Scientific delirium madness.

I will keep falling as long as I live,
Ah, without ending,
And I will remember the place that is now,
That has ended before the beginning ...

(repeat first verse)
