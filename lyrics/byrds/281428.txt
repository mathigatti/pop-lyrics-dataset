Driftin´ in school daddy´s a fool
We know someone´s on your mind
Women in space lovin´ in lace
turnin´ couplets into time and space
Meet the man who needs you now
Can you give your love away like candy?


Down on your knees trimmin´ the trees
Can you imagine what it´s like
Love is lament, general decent
Doctor´s orders are unkind and bad
Meet the man...

The river found merry-go-round
spinning innocence and dreams
Can you believe what you perceive
Love is never what it seems to be
Meet the man....
