Everybody has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
Anyone in this place can tell you to your face
why you shouldnÂ´t try to love someone


Everybody knows it never works
Everybody knows and me
I know that door that shuts just before
you get to the dream you see

I know it all too well how to turn, how to run
how to hide behind a bitter wall of blue
But you die inside if you chose to hide
So I guess instead I'll love you
