Good-bye I won't be long
 I am on my way back home
 So much I've got to say
 I hope you'll understand my way


 Borrowing time
 You know it just ain't right
 It's so hard to believe
 All that's passed behind

 I've been gone so long
 At times I can't tell right from wrong
 Stay away from sleepless nights
 Waiting for the morning light
 Why do you worry
 Why do you cry
 Come tomorrow morning
 All your fears will die

 Good-bye I won't be long
 I'm on my way back home
 So much I've got to say
 I hope you'll understand my way
