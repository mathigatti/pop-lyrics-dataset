Hey joe, where you goin' with that money in your hand? 
Hey joe, where you goin' with that money in your hand? 
I'm gonna find my woman, she's runnin' around with some other man


I'm gonna go down town buy me a blue steel 44
I'm gonna go down town, gonna buy me a blue steel 44
When I find my woman she's not gonna run any more

Mmm, hey joe, I hear you shot your woman dead
Hey joe, I hear you've shot your woman dead
Yes, I did, you know, I found them both in the same damned bed

Hey joe, where you gonna go? 
Ah, hey joe, where you gonna go? 
I guess I go to my favourite mexico

I guess I go down where a man can be free
Yes, I guess I go down where a man can be free
Ain't no damned old hangman gonna put a noose around me, babe

Hey joe, where are you goin' with that gun in your hand? 
Hey joe, where are you goin' with all of that cash? 

Mmm
Mmm
