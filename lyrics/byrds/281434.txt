Come back baby
Baby please don't go
Way that I love you
You are never gonna know
Come back baby
Lets talk it over
One more time


Come back baby
Baby please don't leave
All I ever do now
Ooh, sit here and grieve
Come back baby
Lets talk it over
One more time

Long old train
Ooh, meaning too near
Ain't got my baby
So far away from here
Come back baby
Lets talk it over
One more time

Come back baby
Ooh, baby please don't go
Way that I love you
Mama you are never gonna know
Come back baby
Lets talk it over
One more time
