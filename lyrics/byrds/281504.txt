I thought I met a man who said he knew a man
who knew what was going on
I was mistaken, only another stranger that I knew


And I thought that I found a light to guide me through the night
and all this darkness
I was mistaken, only reflections of a shadow that I saw

And I thought IÂ´d seen someone who seemed
"at last" to know the truth
I was mistaken, only a child laughing in the sun, in the sun
