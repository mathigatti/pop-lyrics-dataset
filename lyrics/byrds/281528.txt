See the sky about to rain       broken clouds and rain
Locomotive pull the train whistle blowing through my brain


Signals curling on an open plain rolling down the track again       
See the sky about to rain

Some are bound for happiness some are bound to glory  
Some are bound to live with less  who can tell your story

See the sky about to rain broken clouds and rain
Locomotive pull the train whistle blowin   through my brain  
Signals curlin' on an open plain rollin down the track again  
See the sky about to rain

I was down in Dixie Land played a silver fiddle
Played it loud and then the man broke it down the middle
See the sky about to rain
