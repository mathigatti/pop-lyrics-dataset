Don't say you love me , don't say you care
You're so far away
Telephone communication, only a three minute elation
When I hear your voice
Through love and trust it's gonna work out fine
The only pain I feel is all this time between
You and me, you and me


All the days have turned to years, only emphasize my fears
Since you said goodbye
I can hear your voice at night, I can read the words you write
It's only love
Through love and trust it's gonna work out fine
The only pain I feel is all this time between
You and me, you and me

Now don't say you love me , don't say you care
You're so far away
I can hear your voice at night, I can read the words you write
It's only love
Through love and trust it's gonna work out fine
The only pain I feel is all this time between
You and me, you and me

Through love and trust it's gonna work out fine
The only pain I feel is all this time between
You and me, you and me
You and me
