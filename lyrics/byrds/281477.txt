I wanna lot out of life, but I know my limitations
Guess I want a lot of things and got my inclinations
Got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one


I've learned a lot out of life, watchin' other folks mistakes
Funny things that they can get for finding out too late
I got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one

Well I don't need nobody else
All I need's a single ticket
When I travel on my own
Not afraid to be alone
I got my feet upon the ground, and I'm standing on my own
When I travel far and wide
And looking for a four leaf clover
Don't mind if I can't find it, got no chip upon my shoulder
Got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one

Well I don't need nobody else
All I need's a single ticket
When I travel on my own
Not afraid to be alone
I got my feet upon the ground, and I'm standing on my own
When I travel far and wide
And looking for a four leaf clover
Don't mind if I can't find it, got no chip upon my shoulder
Got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
(repeat)
