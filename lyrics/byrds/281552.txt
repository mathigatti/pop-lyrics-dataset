You want to know how it will be
Me and her or you and me
You both stand there,  your long hair flowing
Your eyes alive, your minds are still growing
Saying to me what can we do now that we
Both love you, I love you too
I don´t really see why can´t we go on as three


You are afraid, embarrased too
No one has ever said such a thing to you
Your mother´s ghost stands at your shoulder
A face like ice, a little bit colder
Saying to you
You can not do that it breaks all the rules
You learned in school
But I don´t really see, why can´t we go on as three

We love each other it´s plain to see
There´s just one answer that comes to me
Sister lovers, water brothers
and in time maybe others
So you see what we can do
If we try something new, if you´re crazy too
I don´t really see why can´t we go on as three
