Something happens to me every time that we touch
Sometimes I´m worried cause I think I might love you too much
Yeah I know what your Mama says and maybe she´s right
But can´t you feel what my meart is saying tonight


For a woman like you life´s an opening door
You´re the beautiful girl that we´re all looking for
Yeah you can have anything, anything that you want
But baby what we´ve already got can never be bought

If your love is a timeless flight
Well you know that´s alright
Cause we´re gonna take our time loving tonight

I´m gonna hold you right here in my arms
as the limousine takes us away
And we´ll dream about the music of some brighter day
Throw a dime to the tambourine man
and kiss all the horses goodbye
And believe in the spirit of a love that never dies
