The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye, like all the rest
I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
Let my guitar playin' friend do my request


Won't you sing me back home with the songs I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Won't you sing me back home before I die

I recall last sunday mornin', a choir came off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
I heard him tell the singers, there's a song my mamma sang
Could I hear it once before you move along

Won't you sing me back home with the songs I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Won't you sing me back home before I die
