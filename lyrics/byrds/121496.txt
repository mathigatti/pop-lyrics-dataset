Hey, Mister Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey, Mister Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle, jangle morning, I'll come followin' you


Take me for a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
All my senses have been stripped
And my hands can't feel to grip
And my toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'

I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
On to my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
I promise to go under it

Hey, Mister Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey, Mister Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle, jangle morning, I'll come followin' you
