When i was young i'd go down by the river
Just about a mile from my home a million miles from everyone
My eyes could see older as my ears could hear your song
Oh to be wild again get back to your lazy waters
Never needed anyone but you
Oh little boys are strange  no one knows they have magic
I kept it in my pocket  concealed from everyone
But i climbed the highest tree to sing a bird my song
Oh to be wise again get back to your lazy waters
Never needed anyone but you
We moved to the city i said i wouldn't mind thought you'd stay inside
Me
It's easy when your young
But as we rode away  i knew you were gone
Oh to be wise again get back to your lazy waters
Never needed anyone but you
