She's in some honky tonk tonight I know
Running where the music's loud and the lights are low
In a crowded bar she likes to hang around
And as long as there's a honky tonk, she'll never settle down


So close up the honky tonks lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there any more
Close up the honky tonks throw away the key
Then maybe the one I love will come back to me

I wish I had the power to turn back the time
And live again the hours when she was all mine
Cause it hurts to see her running with that crowd downtown
And as long as there's a honky tonk she'll never settle down
So close up the honky tonks lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there any more
Close up the honky tonks throw away the key
Then maybe the one I love will come back to me
Then maybe the one I love will come back to me
