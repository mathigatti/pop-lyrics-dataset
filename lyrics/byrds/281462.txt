From a distance the world looks blue and green
and the snow capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
and the eagle takes to flight


From a distance there is harmony
and it echoes through the land
It´s the voice of hope, it´s the voice of peace
It´s the voice of every man

From a distance we all have enough
and noone is in need
There are no guns, no bombs, no diseases
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance we are instruments
marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They´re the songs of every man

God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance

From a distance you look like my friend
even though we are at war
From a distance I can´t comprehend
what all this war is for

From a distance there is harmony
and it echoes through the land
It´s the hope of hopes; it´s the love of loves
It´s the heart of every man

It´s the hope of hopes, it´s the love of loves
It´s the song of every man
