It´s the humming of the engines of the greyhound bus and trains
that keeps your memory on my mind and here with me
Many miles have come between us, cold nights on some roadside
Bringin´ back your gentle ways of loving me


It´s the thought of how you loved me, how you treat me, how you thrill me
that clears my fogged mind to where I see
Some little girl as I walk by just looking at me sadly
bringin´ back your gentle ways of loving me

It´s just your gentle way of loving me
It´s just your gentle way of loving me

It´s your hapiness I´ve never found with other loves that bothers
and a mother saying how her child loves me
And times you never talked about those late evening hours
Bringin´ back your gentle ways of loving me
