I see you
Under there behind your hair
Everywhere, I see you


I see you
Turned on eyes can't tell lies
Empathise, I see you
Warm sliding sun through the cave of your hair
Wind washing fields kind of space living there
I see you

I know you
Met before, seventh floor
First world war, I know you

Who lives there? 
Tell old fair I'm aware
That she cares, who lives there? 

Green specks bright spiralling out in the sky
Catch my mind, turn my head, have to look, don't know why
Who lives there? 

We thought how
For a while they just smile
Just a silent thought

I see you
Sun is there behind your hair
Everywhere, I see you
I see you
