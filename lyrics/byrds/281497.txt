I've known you of old
You've robbed my poor pockets
of silver and gold



Beafsteak when I'm hungry
Rye whiskey when I'm dry
Greenbacks when I'm hard up
And heaven when I die


Rye whiskey, rye whiskey
Rye whiskey I cry
If I don't get rye whiskey
I surely will die


Jack of diamonds, jack of diamonds
I've known you of old
You've robbed my poor pockets
of silver and gold
