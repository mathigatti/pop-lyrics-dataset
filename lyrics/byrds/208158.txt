It's a lazy day, I'm down with nothing else to do
It's a crazy day, I've got a thing that I wanna try with you
Now baby, don't you go away
Please don't spoil my lazy day


Now isn't it better? didn't you know? 
Just sittin' down here by the radio
I'm gonna make you worry none about the income tax
No, there's no need to hurry, I think I have to relax

It's a lazy day, I'm down with nothing else to do
It's a crazy day, I've got a thing that I wanna try with you
Now baby, don't you go away
Please don't spoil my lazy day

No, you don't have to think about nothing to do
'cause when I get you down by the barbeque
Oh, I'm gonna make a real funny walk a-like a brand new dime
No, I don't have no money but I always got plenty of time

It's a lazy day, I'm down with nothing else to do
It's a crazy day, I've got a thing that I wanna try with you
Now baby, don't you go away
Please don't spoil my lazy day

It's a lazy day
It's a lazy day
It's a lazy day
It's a lazy day
