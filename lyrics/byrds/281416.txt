See the sun how bright it is, it never was before
See the sun it shines right through my door but nooneÂ´s there
I see warm smiles I never gave reflection in the air
All the things I want today, all the things I wasted on the way


See the earth how sweet it smells, I dnot know how it feels
See the earth it sleeps beneath my heels as I pass through
I see tears that I never shed in every drop of dew
All the things I want today, all the things I wasted on the way

Hear the sky singing the songs that I could have played
Too busy talking to prove that I was not afraid
See this dried up broken straw turning into rock
See this dried up broken straw forgotten and left behind
and see deeds that I never done are flowing in the wine
All the things I want today, all the things I wasted
All the things I want today, all the things I wasted
All the things I want today, all the things I wasted on the way
