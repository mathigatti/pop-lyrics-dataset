Freedom, there's more to your life so now
Old laws, man has made only blind.
Oh, give us freedom, a call to the brave and the strong,
To stand in the face of all wrong and show the way.


Freedom lies, freedom lies, freedom lies.

Freedom to live out the dream in a song,
Give hope to the hearts of the young.
Oh, give us freedom to act out of love and not fear,
So all that is true will be clear.

Hear tomorrow, calling "Hold me, show me."

Freedom lies, freedom lies, freedom lies.

Freedom lies, freedom lies, freedom lies.
