In the blue canadian rockies
Spring is silent through the trees
And the golden poppies are blooming
'round the banks of lake louise


Now, oh, how my lonely heart is aching tonight
For that girl I left behind
And, oh, what I'd give if I could be there tonight
With the sweetheart who's waitin' for me

In the blue canadian rockies
Spring is silent through the trees
And the golden poppies are blooming
'round the banks of lake louise

Across the sea they call me
And on and on a love so true
For the blue canadian rockies
And the one I love to see
And the one I love to see
