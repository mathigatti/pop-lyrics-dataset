Things will be better now
Don´t ask me why, don´t ask me how
And both of us feel the same way
What we´re feeling inside we just can´t seem to say


Cause misunderstand is the cause of it all
It take you to the top just to watch you fall

You know what
Sometimes it´s lonely and cold
when you´re so far away from home
Confusion can lead you astray
It´s such a terrible price to pay

I bought you some clothes, I dressed you up real fine
Go and live your life, just let me live mine

Sweetness compassion is the cause of it all
She can take you to the top just to watch you fall
