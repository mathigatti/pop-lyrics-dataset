There's been another assassination
T.V. cameras moving in.
To shoot the bloodstains on the pavement
And get them on the News at Ten.
Will he live or will he die, before we go on the air?
Yes, the networks are all there, in the name of
Entertainment.


Superstar psycho, from a killer to a hero,
An overnight sensation on the lips of all the nation
Is he mad or is he sane? It makes for good conversation
I call it suffering and pain, but they call it entertainment

Real life for Entertainment,
Cheapens my reality,
So that Hollywood can make it into another "B" movie
The vultures get the rating and the people get the thrills
But the victims always pay, I guess they always will.
