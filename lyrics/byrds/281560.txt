Keep sayin´ no to her since she was a baby
Keep sayin´ no to her not even maybe
Why? Why?


You say there´s a limit there, she can´t go past that
She don´t believe you, she don´t think that´s where it´s at
Why? Why?

You say she can´t change that, it´s the way you´ve always done it
She don´t care about that, she thinks you´ve just begun it
Why? Why?

You say it´s a dead old world, dull and unforgiving
I don´t know where you live, but you´re not living
Why? Why?

Keep sayin´ no to her since she was a baby
Keep sayin´ no to her not even maybe
Why? Why?
