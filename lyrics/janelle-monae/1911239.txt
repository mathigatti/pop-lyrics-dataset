Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds, in the sky you'll get by
If you smile, through all fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find the Sun come shining through, for you


Light up your face, with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
'Cause that's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you, you just smile

Although a tear is ever so near
'Cause that's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of you crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you, my darling, just, just smile

Smile, darling baby, smile
Thank you, thank you very much
