Take me, take my letters, take my photos, take the sun
You can take my heart
Cause I ain't gonna need it on the run
I've been trying to work it out
But my words fall right apart baby
I'll leave oh, don't you know
That I can't deal with the hurt anymore
Oh baby don't leave


Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't sleep
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't eat
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love

Automn, automn's coming round
And summer's not the same
It's like winter without your smile
I spent some time just thinking to myself
I picked up one of your photos and I put it right back on the shelf

Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't sleep
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't eat
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love

I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love
I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love

Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't sleep
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't eat
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love

They say love is patient, love is kind
Love ain't never did a thing to mine
Love ain't weak, love is strong
Love be telling my heart don't go
They say love is patient, love is kind
Love ain't never did a thing to mine
Love ain't weak, Greater Than Pride
I can't live without your love

I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love
I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love
