Uuuu-uh
It's about time
Uuuuu-uuh


Tick-tock, I'm watching the clock
I can't wait til we get to rock.
I wanna scream and dream and do love for age,
Is that ok?
Tonight is me &amp; you alone,
We'll make a call or we'll even write a song
See I've been waiting and waiting for time to say
Listen baby:
When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you're giving your all
Baby, I'd love that our ways keeping really true
Cause, baby it's a primetime for our love
But I know ain't nobody peakin' but the stars above
It's primetime for our love,
But I know that heaven is betting on us.

Miguel:
Bang bang, I'm calling your name
You're like a firework, can't tamed
I wanna ride til the stars come out to play,
Is that ok?
So, tonight is me &amp; you alone
We'll take a call or we'll even write a song
This will be a?? Private bash
Listen babe
When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you're giving your all
Baby, my love is always right here for you
Yeah

Cause, baby it's a primetime for our love
Ain't nobody bigger but the stars above
It's a primetime for our love
Heaven is betting on us
It's a primetime for our love
But I know ain't nobody peakin' but the stars above
It's a primetime for our love
Heaven is betting on us

(Tonight, I don't wanna be mysterious.)

Cause, baby it's a primetime for our love
Ain't nobody bigger than the stars above
