Come, let me kiss you right there
Wake you up like sunrise
On the backs of your thighs
I'm gonna pray you this prayer
That I keep in my mind
As a lovely reminder


Even though you tell me you love me
I'm afraid that you just love my disguise
Taste my fears and light your candle to my raging fire
Of broken desire

But don't judge me
I know I got issues
But they drown when I kiss you
Don't judge me
Baptize me with ocean
Recognize my devotion

The water's perfectly good
Let's reintroduce ourselves
From a free point of view
If I'm gon' sin, it's with you
Tattoo your love on my heart
Let the rumors be true

Even though you tell me you love me
I'm afraid that you just love my disguise
Taste my fears and light your candle to my raging fire
The dirty desire

But don't judge me
I know I got issues
But they drown when I kiss you
Don't, don't judge me
Baptize me with ocean
Recognize my devotion

What if I, what if I touched you right there?

Even though you say that you love me
Is it me or do you love my disguise?
If I missed you, would you think I was lonely
If I say what's on my mind?

Even though you say that you love me
Is it me or do you love my disguise?
If I kissed you, would you think I was lonely
If I let you inside?

Come, let me kiss you right there
But if I kissed you right there
Would you tremble inside, or just call it a night?
What if I gave you a show
You could touch if you like
Right there
If I kissed you would you think I was lonely?
If I

It feels so good
Come, let me kiss you right there
Just say that you love me
