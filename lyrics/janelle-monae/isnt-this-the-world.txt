I've walked around
Just about all my life
Slept on park benches
Many many nights


Even remember the days
I had nothing to eat
But someone to love me
Is all I need

What we gotta do, me and you
We have to change our selfish ways
No matter who else does
We have to rise, rise above
Come together in love

But isn't this the world?
The place that we call home, home
But if this is the world
Then why do I feel alone?

On top of living this life
Of love without
I barely know
And talked about

It's not the riches
That I live to see
But someone to love me
Is all I need

What we gotta do, me and you
We have to change our selfish ways
No matter who else does
We have to rise, rise above
Come together in love

But isn't this the world, the world?
The place that we call home, home
But if this is the world
Then why do I feel alone?
(Why do I feel alone)

But isn't this the world? (Isn't this the world)
The world
The place that we call home (Isn't this the world)
Home
But if this is the world
If this is the world (Isn't this the world)
(Isn't this the world?)

Oh, what a wonderful world (Isn't this the world)
Isn't it
Isn't it
(Isn't this the world)
