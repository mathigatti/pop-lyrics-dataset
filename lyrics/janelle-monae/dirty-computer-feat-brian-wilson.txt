Dirty computer, walk in line
If you look closer you'll recognize
I'm not that special
I'm broke inside
Crashing slowly, the bugs are in me


Dirty computer, breaking down
Picking my face up off the ground
I'll love you in this space and time
'Cause baby all I'll ever be is

Your dirty computer
Dirty computer

Searching for someone to fix my life
Text message, god up in the sky
Oh, if you love me, won't you please reply?
Oh, can't you see that it's only me, your dirty computer?

Dirty computer
Your dirty computer
Dirty computer

I'll love you in this space and time
I'll love you in this space and time
