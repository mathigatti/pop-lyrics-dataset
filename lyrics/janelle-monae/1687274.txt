So you think that I'm alone?
But being alone's the only way to be
When you step outside
You spend life fighting for your sanity


This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?

If you want to be free
Below the ground's the only place to be
'Cause in this life
You spend time running from depravity

This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?

Bring wings to the weak
And bring grace to the strong
Make all evil stumbles as it flies in the world
All the tribes come and the mighty will crumble
We must brave this night
And have faith in love.

I'm trying to find my peace
I was made to believe there's something wrong with me!
And it hurts my heart
Lord have mercy, ain't it plain to see?

This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold...
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for

Do you know it's a cold, cold war?
Do you? Do you? Do you?

It's a cold, cold war
You better know what you're fighting for

Bye, bye, bye, bye
Don't you cry, when I say goodbye?
