Early late at night
I wander off into a land
You can go, but you mustn't tell a soul
There's a world inside
Where dreamers meet each other
Once you go it's hard to come back
Let me paint your canvas as you dance


Dance in the trees
Dance
Paint mysteries
The magnificent droid plays there
She plays there
Your magic mind
Your magic mind
Makes love to mine
Makes love to mine
I think I'm in love, angel

Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take her back to Wondaland
She thinks she left her underpants

Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take her back to Wondaland
Take me back
She thinks she left her underpants

The grass grows inside
The music floats you gently on your toes
Touch the nose, he'll change your clothes to tuxedos
Don't you freak and hide
I'll be your secret santa, do you mind?
Don't resist
The fairygods will have a fit

We should dance
Dance in the trees
We'll dance
Paint mysteries
All dance
The magnificent droid plays there
She plays there
Your magic mind
Your magic mind
Makes love to mine
Makes love to mine
I think I'm in love, angel

Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take her back to Wondaland
She thinks she left her underpants

Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take her back to Wondaland
She thinks she left her underpants

Hallelujah
This is your land
Hallelujah
This is my land
Hallelujah
We belong here stay the night
Stay the night
I am so inspired
You touched my wires
My supernova shining bright

Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take her back to Wondaland
She thinks she left her underpants


Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take her back to Wondaland
She thinks she left her underpants

Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take me back to Wondaland
La la la la la la la

Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take her back to Wondaland
She thinks she left her underpants

You know I love you baby
This is your land
Yes I need ya
This is my land
Yes I want to know enough
We belong here stay the night
Take me back I wanna stay the night
I'm so inspired
I'm so inspired baby
You touched my wires
Ooooo
My supernova shining bright
I wanna go, don't you wanna go?

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu,,,

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
