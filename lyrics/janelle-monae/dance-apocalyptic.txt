Bands that make her dance
Apocalyptic now
Bands that make her dance
Apocalyptic (Woo!)
Bands that make her dance
Apocalyptic now
Bands that make her dance
Apocalyptic
You're goin' crazy
The hitmen always spy you
Do that dance!
Smokin' in the girls' room
Kissin' friends
It's over like a power book
It's floatin' in the bathroom stall (Ah!)
You're so freaked out!
Worried about the market
You bought a house!
But I'm allergic to the house bitch
Credit card
They bought a new wife
Poor shattered little lonely men
But I really really wanna thank you
For dancing till the end
You found a way to break up
You're not afraid to break out
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me should you break up
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang! (ooh chanlanga-langa-lang)
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me we should break up
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!
2x
You got a life
But there's zombie in the front yard
Take a bath
But nothing gets the funk off
You're on tv
Rockin' and a rollercoaster
Dangers love that rock and roll
Sick and tired
Of bubble tasting plastic
You want to cry
But -- real bitch
You're asking why
The pain is always equal
But enjoy this -- espresso brown
(Uh uh, uh uh!)
But I really really wanna thank you
For dancing till the end
You found a way to break up
You're not afraid to break out
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me will you break up
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me will you break up
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!
2x
You're goin' crazy
The hitmen always spy you
Do that dance!
Smokin' in the girls' room
Kissin' friends
Keep a rockin' and a rollin'
Cause' the dangers love that rock and roll
You're so freaked out!
Worried about the bomb threats
You bought a house!
But I'm allergic to the house bitch
Credit card
You're forking down the --
Just to make enough to pay your rent
But I really really wanna thank you
For dancing till the end
You found a way to break up
You're not afraid to break out
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me will you break up
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang! (oh baby!)
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me will you break up
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!

Look at cha!
You're just like a little old earthquake
Break it! Break It
You got to break it!
Ain't no order in this court room
Smash, smash, bang, bang (you all going to jail)
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!
What's the matter?
Your chicken taste like pork?
You have triplets instead of twins?
Does your food taste plastic?
Grandaddy, I think I wanna dance.
