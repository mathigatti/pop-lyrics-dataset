I’m supposed to be here in Atlanta
This is really, really destiny
But still sometimes I just want to go home back to Kansas
Yeah, I know I’m country, but I have a dream
I mean, I really, really want to make an impact on this world
I mean, I really want to share with the world what I — what I have to talk about
I want to inspire


All I really want to do is just sing, this is all I want to do
I’m tired of working, I just want to do what I love to do
All I want is to inspire people and to be remembered
As someone who really, really wanted to make an impact through her music
That would be my dream
I have to always remember to keep God first, though
Yep, if I just stay focused I guess I’ll be where I want to be in life

I guess this is my audition
