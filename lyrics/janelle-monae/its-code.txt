[Verse 1]
Love is knowing all my mind
Feeling real dumb, all dressed up in my new suit
Took my name, my site, my song
Been trying to find myself all day long
I heard them saying that love will be a curse or a listless fringe
Love belongs in movies
Now I know I'll plaque with your heart
Cause when I turn back around I saw
You in someone else's arms
Walking around town, all dressed up making your move


[Pre-Chorus]
But I was scared to fall in love
I never thought I'd be the one, to push you in the arms, oh!

[Chorus]
Oh baby, it's code
I want you to hold me, and love me until I won't no more
And need me, and need me until I need no more
Baby, it's code
Baby, it's code

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Oh baby)
Oh baby, hey baby!
I want to be in your arms, ohh!
Please don't leave...

[Outro]
Please! I need a nurse
I've been... hurt!
I need a glass of Merlot Black
I know I was wrong, but can't you see the harm that have been done to me
Oh!
