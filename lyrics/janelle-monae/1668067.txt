Welcome to my world:
Oceans vs. Mountains
Call me the poor girl
Cause I love to fight them
But Im quite sweet,
If you take the time to get to know me.
Deep down my heart rattles around like a bone lost deep inside
See I like to fall in love, but not with that type of guy.
Ooo wee you got my clouds on fire,
Were tight rope walking and the worlds the wire
Remember kissing on Broadway, you and I?
I was being your baby and ticking and tocking your clock,
See we done jumped the broom and now youre no good.
And I was dreaming bout children, Emily Ann,
Our darling baby with her daddys eyes,
And it meant so much to me
And you know I needed your good love,
Baby how could you just go and change it all?
You turned my spring to fall
I needed you, you know,
But when the love is gone its time to go.


If you dont think I mean it then youll feel it when Im gone
I said Im done (enough of yo love)
I said Im done (enough of yo love)
Im up to 3 oclock in the morning
While you party out til da dawn and
I said Im done (enough of yo love)
I said Im done (enough of yo love)
Darlin aint no feelin left its just a killin
Oh!!!
Just grab my gun (and lets go out)
Grab my gun (and lets go out)
It aint no room for love its just this burnin
Got me reelin!
Call the law (and hold the applause)
Call the law (and hold the applause)

You coming home, but the birds are gone
With they sad songs
They soaring on
But they might be wrong
I really wish you could change babe
Reclaim your throne
Down here in the darkness
