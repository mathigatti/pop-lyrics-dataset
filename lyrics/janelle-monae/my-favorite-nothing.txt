My favorite nothing loved me so
And I'd trick him, he'd treat me
In the end I let go
I never found him worth my time
How selfish, when he'd give his life for mine


He even tried to make a new start
Around the time I said we needed time apart
I knew that sticks and stones would break your bones
But I didn't know my words would break your heart

I can't believe love just passed me by
I can't believe I just looked love right in the eyes
I can't believe love just passed me by
I can't believe love just passed me by

See I've been hurt too many times before
I thought that you were going to hurt me too
Love lifts me up then brings me down, down, down
I really wish you were around â€” and now you're gone

I never gave you what was due you
I ended up just doing me
I wanted to apologize to you
But now it's too late
Because you're six feet under me

I met a boy one day
Messed up and broke his heart
He won't come back to me
He's so far gone, you see

I can't believe love just passed me by
I can't believe I just looked love right in the eyes
I can't believe love just passed me by
I can't believe love just passed me by

See I've been hurt too many times before
I thought that you were going to hurt me too
Your love lifts me up and then it brings me down
How I wish you were around
