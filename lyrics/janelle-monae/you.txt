I need to talk to you
Let's make it last — oh, let's make it last
Embrace what we talked about
Don't wanna look back — I don't wanna look back
And see what I've been without
Now I've made up my mind
To make this work with you
'Cause you and no one else
Fills me like you do
See my father knew best
When he said a man should fight for me
And baby I'm gonna do
Whatever feels right for me


You, hey, you

Darling, I know it's hard
With this long distance and all
But I'm tired of writing you with this pen
Can't, better talk on the phone again
Why can't we go back to how things used to be?
You would look in my eyes
And tell me that you love me
See, my mama knew best
When she said that you were right for me, ooh
And I'm gonna do whatever feels right for me
Darling I'll fight for you, you
I'll fight for you, and you, and you, and only you, you

Forget climbing mountains
I'm flying home to you
Girl, there just ain't no way
There just ain't no way
I can live without you
'Cause it's all about you
I don't wanna live without you, darling
I would fight for you

You, hey, you
