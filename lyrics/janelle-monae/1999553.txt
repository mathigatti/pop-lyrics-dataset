Do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do


Every five minutes checkin my phone
Sittin on the edge of my bed
Just to see if you called
See I've been waitin all day
Lately I've been actin strange and things
Walkin round like I'm in a trans
And that ain't me at all

See I tried to brush it off as just a silly game
That young girls like to play
But as time moved on I knew
My heart only beats for you
See what I'm trynna say is

You make me feel
The way I felt when I first met you
And my soul got chills
You make me feel
Like I can't breathe without you love
And that's oh so real

See I never thought I'd find love
A girl like me, it was impossible
And now I find myself in love
Boy, you got my nose wide open
I can't believe that you would be the one
Who would end my childish games for good

See I've tried to brush it off
As just a silly game that young girls like to play
But as time moved on I knew
My heart only beats for you
See what I'm trying to say is

You make me feel
The way I felt when I first met you
And my soul got chills
You make me feel
Like I can't breathe without you love
And that's oh so real

Ever since you walked in my life
Boy I swear I ain't been the same
Ain't it funny how things do happen
You came in and you re-arranged
My heart
And I'm so grateful baby
I mean I'm truly grateful baby
You made a difference in my life
And I can't explain the way that I feel
This journey through my life
