We party every night
Then we all just walk off in the rain
Even angels fight
And our wings just keep getting in the way


Babe, don't wait
Our love's so strong
So deep in my heart
Yeah, I've been feelin' it all day long
Babe, I can't wait
Love's so strong
I feel it all over
And oh

What an experience
Can you feel it, feel it, feel it
What an experience
Yeah, I can really, really feel it
Can you feel it, feel it, feel it
Put your hand over my heart

The world's just made to fade
And all the parties someday blow away
But the memories come home
It's funny how they
Come back with a song

Babe, don't wait
Our love's so strong
So deep in my heart
Yeah, I've been feelin' it all day long
Babe, I can't wait
Love's so strong
I feel it all over
And oh
