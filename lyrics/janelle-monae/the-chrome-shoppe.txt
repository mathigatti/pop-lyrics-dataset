Good morning, midnight. This is DJ Crash Crash, and I'm here at the Dark Park Metal Shoppe getting my chrome polished. Y'all here know why we're getting our chrome right?

(Cause it won't shine by itself.)

It won't shine by itself, right, it won't shine by itself is right. Well tonight, we've got the Electrified Betas throwing an end-of-the-world cyber freak festival. Some fun [?] sucks for y'all to do. Don't let it break you now. Lookie here, we got the sisters looking good, shining bright, telling you all about it.

Yeah, this is Melanie 45221

And Asada 8550

With the new, new chapter of the Electrified Betas! We will be at the youth auditorium tonight, along with DJ Crash Crash, and the Wondaland Jam Authority.

Female alpha platinums are in for free. Clones and humans welcome after midnight.

We're gonna have a bouncing electro-booty contest, an atomic kissing contest and much, much more!

No bounty hunters allowed. Bring your punk ass up here looking for Cyndi Mayweather, and you might get hurt!

Woo! That's right, sisters. Power up, power up! Now take us to our next song.

This is Cindy's newest jam, "Dance Apocalyptic", here at 105.5 WDRD.
