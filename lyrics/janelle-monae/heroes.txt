I, I wish I could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
(Keep, keep, keep us together)
Only we can beat them
Forever, ever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes just for one day
(One day)


I, I will be king
And you, oh you, you will be queen
Though nothing, nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us (heroes) just for one day
(One day, hey, hey)

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, all the guns shot above our head
(Over our head)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall
(Nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
We can be heroes just for one day
Just for one day
(Sing it to me now)

We, we can be heroes
Oh, we, we can be heroes
Oh, we, we can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
