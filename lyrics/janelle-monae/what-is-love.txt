What is love
If it's not with you
I know when you're alone you feel it too
In your arms is where I long to be
Cause being with you gives me sanity


Listen to me darling
I wake up every morning
Thinking bout the way you feel
I wonder if you know it
And what good is the party
If you're not around
Listen to me now

What good is love
If it's not your love
What good is love
If it's not your love
What good is love
If it's not your love


What's a song
I know when you're alone
You've got to feel it too
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
What is love
Listen to me darling
What is love if it's not with you
