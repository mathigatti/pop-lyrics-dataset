Tommy thinks the crazies are back in my mind
Tommy says the children are clouding my head
When everything is wrong I dance inside my mind


That's when I come alive like a schizo running wild
That's when I come alive now let's go wild

We're kicking at your window and keeping you up
And if you come to find me I'll color you red
We dancing in the dungeon every Monday night

That's when I come alive like a schizo running wild
That's when I come alive now let's go wild

You want to see me crazy taking my meds
And wipe away my noises you think I'm a mess
Take me six feet under while your roses died I came alive

You better leave the town I'm coming for you
Call the Tommy up and tell him come help you out
I'm getting wild on you you better go and call the law

Tommy thinks the crazies are back in my mind
Tommy says the children are clouding my head
When everything is wrong I dance inside your mind
You come alive
