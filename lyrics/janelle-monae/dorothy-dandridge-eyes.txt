Looking out the corner of her eye
And she sits alone and drinks her wine
Every man just wants to pass her by
And hopes that he can catch her eye


That glow, it's in her eye
Give you visions in your mind
Just from another space and time
That's when you know you're hypnotized
And her intoxicating will not be denied
Oh, and when you touch her glow
She then becomes your drug
You fell some deep in love with that girl

It's too late, you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love her, you love her, you love that girl
It's too late, you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love that girl

Like a rear Pacaso or Monet
That kind of view you studied everything
Every woman wants her grace and style
But no one who can replicate her smile

That glow, it's in her eye
Give you visions in your mind
Just from another space and time
That's when you know you're hypnotized
And her intoxicating will not be denied
Oh, and when you touch her glow
She then becomes your drug
You fell some deep in love with that girl

It's too late, you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love her, you love her, you love that girl
It's too late, you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love that girl

All eyes on you
In your bed, in your
All the men you love in the world
All I know that the

It's too late, you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love her, you love her, you love that girl
It's too late, you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love that girl

In your eyes, we see the tiny white snowcaps of mountains
The purple glow of distant stars, the blue shine of black
Red rose petals falling slowly in the sunny air
Orange clouds, pink moons, and the tongue of the sun
Who knew heaven could keep us just like this
