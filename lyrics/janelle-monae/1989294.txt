Give me a second I
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the empire state
My lover she's waiting for me
Just across the bar
My seats been taken by some sunglasses
Asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home


Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the Sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the Sun

Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I
I just thought maybe we could find a ways to fall apart
But are friends in back
So let's raise a cup
Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let's the set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the Sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the Sun

Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight

The world is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the Sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the Sun

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight
