You...
Since that magic day
We've been like magnets in a play
We smash in then pull away... Every day... (Every day)
You... You... You're a jet, a flying gun...
You kill me softly with your sun...
You melt my wings then call it fun...
I should run...


Chorus:

Faster and faster I should run...
Faster and faster from your arms...
Faster and faster I should run...
Faster and faster from your arms...

I...
Watch my power die...
Falling out of starry skies...
You kryptonite my life...
Every night... (faster, faster)
Oh, the...
Ending of the road...
Dashing prince or horny toad...
Who really ever knows?
I should know...

Chorus 2:

Faster and faster I should run...
Faster and faster from your arms...
Faster and faster I should run...
Faster and faster from your arms...

Bridge:

Mmm yeah, yeah, yeah... Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I'm runnin'... (I'm runnin'. I'm runnin', runnin', runnin')
Shakin' like a schizo... (I'm shakin' like... Shakin' like a schizo)
'Lectric sheep... ('lectric sheep... All over my feet)
Dancin' in the window... (They're dancin', dancin', dancin' in the window)
My heart beats... (My heart beats. It beats for you and only you)
Kickin' like a kick drum... (And it's kickin' like a kick, kick drum)
Am I a freak? (Am I a freak? Ah, am I a freak?)
Or just another weirdo? (Or just another little weirdo?)
Call me weak... (Call me weak, or better yet you can call me...)
Or just call me your hero... (You can call me your hero, baby)

Breakdown:

You didn't gun down all my good times, I know right from wrong...
Kissin', lovin', feelin' good and not just feelin' down...
Hide your chainsaw deep in kisses, that don't make it quiet...
You got me runnin', mutterin', screamin' each and every night...

Faster and faster I should run...
Faster and faster from your arms...
Faster and faster I should run...
Faster and faster from your arms...
Faster and faster I should run...
Faster and faster from your arms...
