We're dancing free but we're stuck here underground
And everybody trying to figure they way out
Hey hey hey, all we ever wanted to say
Was chased erased and then thrown away
And day to day we live in a daze


We march all around til' the sun goes down night children
Broken dreams, no sunshine, endless crimes, we long for freedom
You're free but in your mind, your freedom's in a bind

Oh make it rain, ain't a thang and the sky to fall
(The silver bullet's in your hand and the war's heating up)
And when the truth goes bang the shouts splatter out
(Revolutionize your life and find a way out)
And when you're growing down instead of growing up
(You gotta ooh ah ah like a panther)
Tell me: Are you bold enough to reach for love?

He lived in sector ten
He had a friend named lindermann
Sail away, sail away susan
So strong for so long
All I wanna do is sing my simple song
Is it square or round, rich or poor
At the end of day and night all we want is more

I keep my feet on solid ground
And use my wings when storms come around
I keep my feet on solid ground for freedom
You're free but in your mind your freedom's in a bind

Oh make it rain, ain't a thang and the sky to fall
(The silver bullet's in your hand and the war's heating up)
And when the truth goes bang the shouts splatter out
(Revolutionize your life and find a way out)
And when you're growing down instead of growing up
(You gotta ooh ah ah like a panther)
Tell me: Are you bold enough to reach for love?

And when the world just treats you wrong
Just come with me and I'll take you home
No need to pack a bag
Who put your life in the danger zone?
You running dropping like a rolling stone
No time to pack a bag
You just can't stop your heart from hanging on
The old man dies and then a baby's born
Chan-chan-chan-change your life
And when the world just treats you wrong
Just come with us and we'll take you home
