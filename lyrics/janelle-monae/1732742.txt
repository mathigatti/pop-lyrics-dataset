Good Morning Cy-boys and Cyber Girls!
I'm happy to announce that we have a star cross winner in today's heartbreak sweepstakes.
Android No. 57821 otherwise known as Cyndi Mayweather
has fallen desperately in love with a human named Anthony Greendown!
And you know the rules?
She is now scheduled for immediate dis-assembly!
Bounty hunters you can find her in the Neon Valley Street District
on the fourth floor at the Leopard Plaza apartment complex.
The Droid Control Marshall's are full of fun rules today.
No faizers only chainsaws and electro-daggers!
Remember only card carrying hunters can join our chase today.
And as usual there will be no reward until her cyber-soul is turned into the Star Commission.
Happy hunting's!!!!
