[Caller #1]
Hello my name is [?] and I live in Neon Valley, I just wanna say I'm disappointed.

[DJ Crash Crash]
You're disappointed.

[Caller #1]
Disgusted actually.

[DJ Crash Crash]
Really.

[Caller #1]
Yeah, this whole thing.

[DJ Crash Crash]
Really.

[Caller #1]
I mean, they should just do whatever they do to people like that.

[DJ Crash Crash]
People like that, what does that mean?

[Caller #1]
I mean she's not even approached them. She's a droid.

[?]

[DJ Crash Crash]
She's not a person. Well, you're right, she's not a person, she is a droid. She is an android Alpha Platinum 9000, and she is jammin'.
