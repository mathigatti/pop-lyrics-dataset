Day and night, I find myself
Trying to figure out a way to make this work somehow
But my emotions always get in the way
Of what I really mean to say
And it only makes things worse, somehow


It's not fair (it's not fair)
I wanna be there (wanna be there) where you are
Oh it's, it's not fair (it's not fair)
I wanna be there (wanna be there) where you are

It's like every time I talk to you
Things fall right apart again
'Cause I start feeling that emptiness
That lies deep in my heart
And this telephone
It won't change that im still alone
And I wish that things could go
Back to how they used to be before

It's not fair (it's not fair)
I wanna be there (wanna be there) where you are
Oh it's, it's not fair (it's not fair)
I wanna be there (wanna be there) where you are

Oh even a walk through the park is not the same
When you're not there
Even the picture frame it feels my pain
And who's to blame? All I know,

It's not fair (it's not fair)
I wanna be there (wanna be there) where you are
Oh it's, it's not fair (it's not fair)
Oooh I wanna be there (wanna be there) where you are

Ooh la la la la la
la la la la la lala
la la la la la lala la la
Ooh la la la la oooh
la la la la lala
la la la la la lala la oooh

Ooh It's, it's not fair
I wanna be there where you are
Oh it's, it's not fair
I wanna be there where you are
