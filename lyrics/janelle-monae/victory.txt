Today I feel so troubled deep inside
I wish the tears would roll back in my eyes
Will I rise?
Oh, I'll keep singing songs until the pain goes
If loving you means fighting till the end
Then I'll fight harder, baby, just to win
And if tomorrow shall come to me
I'll count your every kiss as a victory


Cause to be victorious
You must find glory in the little things
To be victorious
You must find glory in the little things

Surrounded by the schemes and senseless lives
And blaming others, feeling victimized
Oh, tomorrow, one day they'll know
To win you'll have to lose all the things you know
Trying to light the fire deep inside
Father take all the fears and sorrow from my life
Cause when the rain falls
My seed will grow
I'll be further to my dreams tomorrow

Cause to be victorious
You must find glory in the little things
To be victorious
You must find glory in the little things

There's a greater love
In the little things (oh, the little things)

Cause to be victorious
You must find glory in the little things
To be victorious
You must find glory in the little things

It's the little things, all the little things
You'll find a greater love in the little things
There's a greater love, love, love
