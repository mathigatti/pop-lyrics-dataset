I'm locked inside
A land called foolish pride
Where the man is always right
He hates to talk but loves to fight
Is that all right?


On real cold days
He loans us lots of hate
But he says that we must pay
To take it all away
Is that ok?

Bridge:
But I'm asking you will you stay with me
In this land where we are free
And I know it's rough and you've had enough
But one day we'll be happy

When I look into the future
I see danger in it's eyes
Hearts of hatred rule the land
While others left outside
Killing, Bleeding Citizen
While music slowly dies
And I get frightened I, see I get frightened

Chorus:
Oh how, oh how I need you baby
You keep me from going crazy
I really need you baby, need you to stay
Oh how, oh how I love you baby
These people are so crazy
I really need you baby, need you to stay

Verse 2:
She always fights, for her man but not her rights
Even though it's 3005
When will we end this genocide?
And that's not right

Her children cry
No food to eat and afraid as flies
The color black means it's time to die
And nobody questions why
Cause they're too scared to stop them now

Bridge

'Cause when I look into the future
I see danger in it's eyes
Babies die before they're born
And no one ever smiles
The writers and the artists, all are paid to tell us lies
To keep us locked inside, they keep us locked inside

Chorus

I can make a change
I can start a fire
Lord, make me love again
Fill me with desire

I can make a change
I can start a fire
Lord, make me love again
Father, fills my desire

And when I look into your pretty eyes I almost want to cry
I think about my life and I don't want to live a lie
How I need you baby, I need you right by my side
I need you tonight, I need you tonight

Yeah! How I need you baby
See i can't let you go, I need you
On the other side
On the other side

I love you so and I'll never let you go
On the other side!
