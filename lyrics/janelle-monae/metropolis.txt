View a sky without any blue
Breakfast on incandescent, built to chew
Dream to find another world
Where a cyborg can love and a cyber girl is still a queen


Where there's no law
Tying my heart from the start
Where there's no war, if my dreams run a little wild
But if there's no call from joy control
Warning me against this disease in my heart
Freein' my soul

Population 10 zillion and six
Where signs say, "welcome to the star core metropolis."
Me, I live on the wired side of town
Reaching and searching for a space called paradise found

Where there's no law
Tying my heart from the start
Where there's no war, if my dreams run a little wild
But if there's no call from joy control
Warning me against this disease in my heart
Freein' my soul

And it's a common thought
That wired folk can be sold and bought
That we have no feelings no memories or minds
That we're bionic strumpets only worth a dime
To some it's a surprise when I smile
And when I hold your hand, they say
"How can a wired thing understand?
Love is too deep; it's too wide to feel
When your soul is a button
And your foot glows in heels."
Program. Rrogram. reprogram
One nation, under a microchip
Neon slaves, electric savages
Open your hearts. Ypen your eyes. your chariot will arrive

Hey, anthony greendown from sector nine (from sector nine)
With beautiful eyes
I've served you now about thirty-eight times
Thirty-eight times I've looked in those eyes
You see me laughing, the love when I hold your hand
I wanna take you, take you with me to another land

Where there's no law
Tying my heart from the start
Where there's no war, if my dreams run a little wild
But if there's no call from joy control
No call
Please, go with me
Oh! Come with me
I need you
Let's leave. Let's leave
Come, come, come
