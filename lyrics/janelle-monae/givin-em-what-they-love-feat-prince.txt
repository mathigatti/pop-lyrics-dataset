You want to, I wanna
Give'em what they


I am sharper than a razor
Eyes made of lasers bolder than the truth
They want me locked up in the system
'Cause I'm on a mission blame it on my youth
Too long I've been out here on my own
Now I'm bout to bring it home like a rolling stone
I ain't never been afraid to die look a man in the eye

I come to give you what you love
It's time to give you what you love
Imma give you what you love
Giving you what you love

I am sharper than a switchblade
First and last of what God made and that's the truth
But man, keep on tryna hold me back
While another chicken head
Come home to roost
Too strong, tryna do me wrong
And the last one standing will order to my dance
Ohho, dance!
Run tell your teacher and your preacher
Imma give you what you love

I go to give you what you love
It's time to give you what you love
It's time to give you what you love
Giving you what, giving you what
Giving you what you love

I say to take you time! Take what you love
Baby, just enough but never too much
Baby take your time! Take what you love
And baby cry, you'd better look at that baby
Take your time, take what you love
Take your time, take what you love
Baby, just enough, but never too much
Baby take your time, yeah, I wanna give you some love
Would you give me what you love?
Alright, yeah, alright
Give me what you need

Yeah, yeah, yes sir, yeah, yey!
Oh! Oh!
I wanna give you some love
Some love, some love, some love

Two dimes walked up in the building
Tall and concealing wearing fancy things...
Chopped up with a knife, hammered like a screw
When they walked in the room we didn't know what to do
One looked at me and I looked back
She said me "can you tell me where's the party's at?"
She followed me back to the lobby
Yeah, she was looking at me for some undercove love
