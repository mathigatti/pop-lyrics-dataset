Look into my eyes
Let them hypnotize
These eyes will make you perfect like a god


Fall in love with me (fall in love with me)
Only then you'll see (only then you'll see)
What these eyes have been planning for you

You life my heart when I fly
Good morning, good night
It's [?] darling, what lover's meant to see

Look into my eyes (look into my eyes)
Fall in love with me (fall in love with me)
And we will both watch the sun against the sea

Fall in love with me
Cross the golden sand
There's a road winding up into sun rays

Let us [?] winding down
Think of all the heavens that you felt
May our love be so bright and so true
May our love be so brave and so true
