Pink like the inside of your, baby
Pink behind all of the doors, crazy
Pink like the tongue that goes down, maybe
Pink like the paradise found


Pink when you're blushing inside, baby
Pink is the truth you can't hide, maybe
Pink like the folds of your brain, crazy
Pink as we all go insane

So, here we are in the car
Leaving traces of us down the boulevard
I wanna fall through the stars
Getting lost in the dark is my favourite part
Let's count the ways we could make this last forever

Sunny, money, keep it funky
Touch your top and let it down

Ah, yeah, some like that
Ah, ah, some like that
Ah, yeah, some like
'Cause, boy, it's cool
If you got blue
We got the pink

Pink like the lips around your, maybe
Pink like the skin that's under, baby
Pink where it's deepest inside, crazy
Pink beyond forest and thighs

Pink like the secrets you hide, maybe
Pink like the lid of your eye, baby
Pink is where all of it starts, crazy
Pink like the halls of your heart

So, here we are in the car
Leaving traces of us down the boulevard
I wanna fall through the stars
Getting lost in the dark is my favourite part
Let's count the ways we could make this last forever

Sunny, money, keep it funky
Touch your top and let it down

Ah, yeah, some like that
Ah, ah, some like that
Ooh, yeah, some like
'Cause, boy, it's cool
If you got blue
We got the pink

Huh, yeah, some like that
Oh, some like that
Yeah, some like that
'Cause, boy, it's cool
If you got blue
We got the pink

Pink like the inside of your, baby (we're all just pink)
Pink like the walls and the doors, maybe (deep inside, we're all just pink)
Pink like your fingers in my, maybe
Pink is the truth you can't hide

Pink like your tongue going round, baby
Pink like the sun going down, maybe
Pink like the holes in your heart, baby
Pink is my favourite part
