Well if ya, lookin for me, I'm probably in Metropolis
I, I do this for the love so this is non-profit shit
I'm, I'm boardwalkin', so you can call this Monopoly
Obviously, my approach to music ain't moderate
As, my mascoma spins, I am the anomaly
I Love all my haters, cause my haters is what got me here
Strangers "Hey, Bobby!" me, groupies try to body me
But I'm a different planet so excuse my astrology
But there are no apologies, for droppin' all these prophecies
Breakin over barriers, you juggernauts ain't stoppin' me
Balanced and symmetrical, I guess I'm just geometry
Guess I'm just atomically built the way that I bomb-on-a-beat
Bomb-on-a-beat, you slide on a beat, we slide on our feet, we tightrope
I don't need no optometry, I'll do this in a blindfold
Honestly we live the type of life people would die for
So we keep on tippin', never slippin', yeah, we tightrope!


Baby, baby, baby
Whether you're high or low
(high or low)
Baby whether you're high or low
(high or low)
You got to tip on the tightrope
(tip, tip on it)
Now let me see you do the tightrope
(tip, tip on it)
And I'm still tippin' on it

Lupe

Greetings, welcome to the meeting of the minds
That be thinking all the time 'bout defeating all the blind
Following, swallowing, drinking of the time
Honored traditions, of, keeping in a line
I prefer to figure eight and Mandelbrot
Rock all night, 'til they candles on my mantle stop
And it's paid programming on, every single channel watched
Televised revolutionaries on the chapel tops
Shouting, down at Babylonian accounting
Medieval mathematics keep us average in amounting
But I surpass that, I dropped out of they math class
I am, cause I thought, now my tightrope's like a sidewalk

Baby, baby, baby

Whether you're high or low
(high or low)
Baby whether you're high or low
(high or low)
You got to tip on the tightrope
(tip, tip on it)
Now let me see you do the tightrope
(tip, tip on it)
And I'm still tippin' on it

Janelle

N-n-n-n-now I can run with the fellas and rock a stage acapella
Never! Can you hear me?
I am unpredicatable like the weather
T-t-talkin bout me, I stay floatin' like a feather
Jump on the elevator baby we
We on the next level
Album just dropped and I been on a couple covers
Black and white tux, ain't no need for no other colors
T-t-talkin bout "W-w-why dont she change her clothes?"
Well, they ain't seem to mind the last 3 times I posed in Vogue
Some people get high, and then some people get low
Well I'm gon' keep it in the middle so my people can know
Underdogs stand up tall cuz I'm talkin to yall
I can't pause, I balance all like im Dominique Dawes, and I'm gone!

Whether you're high or low
(high or low)
Baby whether you're high or low
(high or low)
You got to tip on the tightrope
(tip, tip on it)
Now let me see you do the tightrope
(tip, tip on it)
And I'm still tippin' on it
