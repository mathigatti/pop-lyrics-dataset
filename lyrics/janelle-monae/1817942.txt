You are my everything
You are my everything
The reason why I hoped and dreamed
You and I are a story untold
And now you're gone and my hearts turned cold


What can describe how I feel inside with a heart so small
Don't feel sorry for me, don't you feel guilty since you moved on
Internally, you murder me my emotions bleed no more
I'll have chills at night probably til I die and feel a love reborn

Cause you are my everything
The reason why I hoped and dreamed
You and I are a story untold
And now you're gone and my hearts turned cold

Emotionally I was confused but only for a second there was I fooled
Gave you all of me every part of me even sacrificed my precious jewels
Then you patiently chipped away at me using your words as tools
And I compromised my identity and gave into me just to play by your rules

You are my everything
The reason why I hoped and dreamed
You and I are a story untold
And now you're gone and my hearts turned cold

Now that I'm free, I can release all that I have in me
All that I've held in for so long
Won't let that keep me from moving on
Now that I'm free, I can release all that I have in me
All that I've held in for so long
Won't let that keep me from moving on

What's loves advice speak from your heart let the truth see you thru
Cause what goes around always comes around and this could be you singing

You are my everything
The reason why I hoped and dreamed
You and I are a story untold
And now you're gone and my hearts turned cold


Cause you are my everything
The reason why I hoped and dreamed
You and I are a story untold
And now you're gone and my hearts turned cold
