I remember, another time
I smell the breeze, I feel the sun
Our memories, come back to me
The way we used to dance, the way you clapped your hands
I remember, the smell of girls who lived in the,
I've been delayed, I've been denied
Then you came around and took the crown



We were unbreakable
We were like roll &amp; roll
We were like a king and queen
I want you to know
No matter how the story's told
We were like roll &amp; roll
We were unbreakable
I want you to know


I remember, a time alone
Wanted to dance, locked in your arms
Your melody, stays on me
You were twenty-one, thought we owned the sun
And I remember, I plan to run
My rebel ways, and your [?] arms is
We go insane, thought it would be fun
And now your queen is on to take the throne


Let me tell you that it's alright. (etc.)
Help me sing it louder!
