What can I do to make you feel secure
Remove all your doubts
So that you'll know for sure
That you're the apple of my eye, boy
Fulfillment of my dream
Time will show the value
Of just what you mean to me
More precious than silver, yeah
More precious than diamond rings
Or anything I could give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you could have my love
Beside you there to guide you through
Well baby, good to know you do


I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time

I tell you I love you
But you won't believe it's true
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings
Or anything that I could give you
It wouldn't mean a thing, ha
If you could have my love
Beside you there to guide you through
Well baby, good to know you do, yeah

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time

I know just how you feel
So let your little heart lay down upon me
In time it will reveal
That special love inside
Will all reveal in time
