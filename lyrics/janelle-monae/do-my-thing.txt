Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey


I wear my clothes like this, because I can
And I wear my hair like this, because I can
And I walk around like this, because I can
And I do my thing like this, cuz it's who I am
And if you are expecting me to give you an apology
For being nothing that you're used to
Go right on and hand away
Hold your breath and concentrate
Keep holding till your face turn blue, turns blue

My role, it ain't your role
But trust, I know
I know just where I'm going
My flow, it ain't your flow
But trust, I know
I know just how I'm flowing
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my, I'mma do my thing
Please feel free to hate and complain
Said I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my, I'mma do my thing
Say what you want, but this one ain't gonna change
Said I'mma do my thing

I can't wear my clothes like you, because I'm not
I can't do my hair like you, because I'm not
I can't walk around like you, because I'm not
I can't do my thing like you, well that just ain't hot
And if you are expecting me to give you an apology
For being nothing like you're used to, used to
Go right on and hand away
Hold your breath and concentrate
Keep holding till your face turns blue

My role, it ain't your role
But trust, I know
I know just where I'm going
My flow, it ain't your flow
But trust, I know
I know just how I'm flowing
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my, I'mma do my thing
So please feel free to hate and complain
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my, I'mma do my thing
And say what you like, cuz this one ain't gonna change
I'mma do my thing

You don't know where I'm going, and so you think I'm lost
I ain't on your page, ok,
So to you, that means I'm off
When I dance, I dance to the beat
Of a drummer you don't hear and you can't see
So if I look offbeat to you,
The problem must be you not me
Irregular, but never irrelevant
Unusual, but never uncool
You're not caught for my close,
You don't get me, well I don't get you
Either a believer of the fact that you need equal's love
So I won't go into the vast with you
Open your mind and speed up

My road, it ain't your road,
But just don't know just where I'm going
My flow it ain't your flow,
But trust me, I know, just how I'm flowing
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my thing
Please feel free to hate everything
Said I'mma do my thing
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my thing
Say what you'd like cause this one ain't gonna change
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my thing
