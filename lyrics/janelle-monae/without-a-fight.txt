I kept thinkin' I could never see this day
It seemed so far away
Hey, da da da dada da da
It's so funny how quick things can change
Don't wanna make the same mistakes
Hey, over and over again (over and over again)
This time I'll be a little smarter
I'll push myself a little harder
'Cause my dreams ain't that much farther, hey


I won't give up without a fight
Imma reach for the sky
Try 'till I get it right
So I can see the day
When I can have things my way

Imma start all over (over)
Things are getting closer (closer)
I can see it baby...

Although I've had my highs and lows
Imma push down that road, yeah
Da dat da dada da da
My Lord keeps sending me the signs
I know this one is gonna be mines
It won't happen if I don't try, no
This time I'll be a little smarter
I'll push myself a little harder
'Cause my dreams ain't that much farther, hey

I won't give up without a fight
Imma reach for the sky
Try 'till I get it right
So I can see the day
When I can have things my way
Imma start all over (over)
Things are getting closer (closer)
I can see it baby

Imma be that one
Shining brighter than the sun
ba dat dat dada da da
It's time to have some fun
Feels like I've already one
Don't give up without a fight

I won't give up without a fight
Imma reach for the sky
Try 'till I get it right
So I can see the day
When I can have things my way

Imma start all over (over)
Things are getting closer (Closer)
I can see it baby...
Da dat dat da da da da da
