(and when the world just treats you wrong
Just come with me and i'll take you home
No need to pack a bag
Who put your life in the danger zone?
You running dropping like a rolling stone
No need to pack a bag
You just can't stop your hurt from hanging on
The old man dies and then a baby's born
Chan, chan, chan, change your life
And when the world just treats you wrong
Just come with me and i'll take you home
Shan, shan shan shan-gri la
Na na na na na na na na na na na)
