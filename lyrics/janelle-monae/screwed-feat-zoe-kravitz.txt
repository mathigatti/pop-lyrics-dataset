[Janelle Monáe]
I live my life in a magazine
I live my life on a TV screen
I live my life on birth control
I lost my mind to rock and roll


[Janelle Monáe &amp; Zoë Kravitz]
And I, I, I hear the sirens calling
And the bombs are falling in the streets
We're all screwed
And ah, ah, ah, it's not perfect, baby
But I go sex crazy
But I feel so screwed
Sex, body
We're gonna crash your party

[Janelle Monáe &amp; Zoë Kravitz]
Let's get screwed
I don't care
You fucked the world up now, we'll fuck it all back down
Let's get, let's get screwed
I, I don't care
We'll put water in your guns
We'll do it all for fun
Let's get screwed

[Zoë Kravitz]
Wanna get screwed on a holiday
(Wanna get screwed on a holiday)
Wanna get screwed in a matinee
(Wanna get screwed in a matinee)
Wanna get screwed at a festival
(Wanna get screwed at a festival)
Wanna get screwed like an animal

[Janelle Monáe &amp; Zoë Kravitz]
And I, I, I hear the sirens calling
And the bombs are falling in the streets
We're all screwed
And ah, ah, ah, it's your birthday, baby
But we go sex crazy
But we feel so screwed
Sex, body
We're gonna crash your party

[Janelle Monáe &amp; Zoë Kravitz]
Let's get screwed
I don't care
You fucked the world up now, we'll fuck it all back down
Let's get, let's get screwed
I, I don't care
We'll put water in your guns
We'll do it all for fun
Let's get, let's get screwed

[Janelle Monáe]
See, if everything is sex
Except sex, which is power
You know power is just sex
You screw me and I'll screw you too
Everything is sex
Except sex, which is power
You know power is just sex
Now ask yourself who's screwing you

[Janelle Monáe &amp; Zoë Kravitz]
Let's get screwed
I don't care, I don't care
You fucked the world up now, we'll fuck it all back down
Let's get screwed
I don't care
We'll put water in your guns
We'll do it all for fun
Let's get screwed

[Janelle Monáe &amp; Zoë Kravitz]
I, I, I hear the sirens calling
And the bombs are falling in the streets
We're all screwed
And ah, ah, ah, it's your birthday, baby
But we go sex crazy
But we feel so screwed

And the bombs are falling in the streets
We're all screwed

[Janelle Monáe &amp; Zoë Kravitz]
(We're so screwed)
Let's get screwed
I don't care
Let's get screwed
I don't care
See everything is sex
Except sex, which is power
You know power is just sex
You screw me and I'll screw you too
Everything is sex
Except sex, which is power
You know power is just sex
Now ask yourself who's screwing you

[Janelle Monáe]
Hundred men telling me cover up my areolas
While they blocking equal pay, sippin' on they Coca Colas (oh)
Fake news, fake boobs, fake food—what's real?
Still in The Matrix eatin' on the blue pills (oh)
The devil met with Russia and they just made a deal
We was marching through the street, they were blocking every bill (oh)
I'm tired of hoteps tryna tell me how to feel
For real
