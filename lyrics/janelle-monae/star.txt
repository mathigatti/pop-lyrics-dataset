You can be a star
Oh, you can be a star
Oh, you can be a star
You can be a star
A star
You've got the greatest gift in the world — in the world, in the world
Just believe and you can do it, oh, girl


As a little girl
There was so many things I wanted to be
The big stage the attention of the crowd
Had always inspired me
So every night when I knelled down to pray
I'd ask the Lord to make me a star one day
Then a voice said

You can be a star
You can be a star
Oh, you can be a star
You can be a star
A star
You've got the greatest gift in the world — in the world, in the world
Just believe and you can do it, oh, girl

As time went on
I let doubt get the best of me
Saying: You're just a country girl
And being a star is only in your dreams
That night my mother set me down to say
Have faith, the world will know who you are one day
She told me

You can be a star
Oh, you can be a star
Oh, you can be a star — you can be a star
You can be a star
A star
You've got the greatest gift in the world — in the world, in the world
Oh, just believe and you can do it, girl

Is it worth it? — I don't know
That life isn't perfect — oh, I don't know)
Things will get worse if
You become a star — won't somebody help me out right now?
Is it worth it? — Tell me
That life isn't perfect — Let me know
Things will get worse if
You become a star — oh, if I become a star

So many broken promises
In rising to the top
Expectations of who I should be
Changed how I see this industry
So I learned
Follow my heart and go with my soul
Stay true to me and never lose sight of my goals
And remember what I was told

You can be a star
You can be a star
Oh, you can be a star
You can be a star
A star
You've got the greatest gift in the world — in the world, in the world
Just believe and you can do it, oh, girl

You can be a star
You can be a star
Oh, you can be a star
Oh, you can be a star
A star
You've got the greatest gift in the world
Just believe, have faith, you can do it, oh, girl
