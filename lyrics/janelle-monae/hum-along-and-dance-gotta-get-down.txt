There's a fear in the air
And there's blood on the floor
Hear a deafening scream
Crying out for more
The city's on fire
Smoke is burning my eyes


I got one more chance in here
To come along and just hum along
And now

Dance
(Come on y'all!)
Down down down
Gotta get down
Down down down

This might be our last night
The wolf's at the door
My stomach is growlin'
We all know the score
My legs are getting weary
My heart is so low

I got one more chance in here
To come along and just hum along
And now

Dance
(Come on y'all!)
Down down down
Gotta get down
Down down down

Gotta get down (to get up)
Gotta get down (to get up)
