Take me to the river
My soul is looking for a word from God
Ooh God
Like a rose in the cold will I rise
I packin my space suit
And I’m taking my shit and moving to the moon
Where there are no rules
Wake up Mary have you heard the news
You got to wake up Mary
You got the right to choose
I tried and heard the pride
but the way the stars look into my eyes tonight
Tell me who can who can I trust?


To get lost in your thoughts
Is a very very complex thought
And the things that you find are surprising
It’s the way you believe that becomes the very thing you see
Take a ride in the sky it’s just calling

Ooh when all your friends are gone
And the trees will burn when the comets play on
Tell who can, who can I trust
I wanna fly, fly!
Honey, girl, sister, ooh!

Ride, ride, ride Sally won’t you ride

I know you love me but I’m still gone
I know you love me but I’m still gone
I know you love me but I’m still gone
I’ve got to make my peace I got to move

Just wake up Mary, have you heard the news?
Just wake up Mary, you’ve got the right to choose
Just wake up Mary, it’s some amazing news
Just wake up Mary, you got the right to choose
Real love

Real love, I wanna feel a real love
A true love, ain’t nobody got to steal love
I wanna know what it really means to be in love
Baby, just talking about a free love
Sometimes I just want to get away
Right now, I’m going on right now
Baby, baby, baby, baby
