This song is for my mama
This song is for you


Hey, mr. President
Tomorrow I'm paying my rent
My fuel is runnin' low
And I've got places to go
Quit slowin' me down

Can we talk about the education of our children?
A book is worth more than a bomb any day
And remember a mirror to africa
Who will bring the cure before it's too late

Don't you see the hurt in their eyes?
So much disappointment in many faces
Use your heart and not your pride
We can't go on and keep pretending

Please, mr. President
Where's all the money you spent
Food is fallin low
And they have nowhere to go
Quit slowin me down

I ask you to have mercy on us father
You think we know the rules by now
We can't go starting wars with hearts of hatred
Out nations greed won't make it better
Or quiet the fears in our hearts

Don't you see the hurt in their eyes?
So much disappointment in all of their faces
Use your heart and not your pride
We can't go on and keep pretending

Oh, please, mr. President

Dear mr. President
I hope you got the letter I sent
A dollar only goes so far
And we need help here, no matter who we are

See we come from different worlds and different places
Until there's one great land, one nation under God
Times are getting harder and we need you to be like moses
And lead your people through
Please be careful, be careful
Of what you do, what you do
