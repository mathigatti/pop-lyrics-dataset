He's a tramp, but we love him
Pulls a new scam, every day
He's a tramp, we adore him
And we know he'll always stay that way


He's a tramp, he's a charmer
He's a sly one, he's a bull
He's a tramp, and we love him
Oh, just don't expect him at your beck and call

You can never tell when he'll show up
He gives you plenty of trouble guess he's just a no count pup
Who would it on the double

He's a tramp, he's a loner
And there's nothing more to say
If he's a tramp, then who needs him
Oh, we know he'll always stay that way (he'll never change)
Listen, darling
We know he'll always stay that way (we tried to help him)
We know he'll always stay that way
