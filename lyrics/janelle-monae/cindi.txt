As i search for a home
And a place to belong
I find it hard to fit in
I meet lots of pretty girls
In this fantasy world
Waiting for their turn to shine
So i try to be cindi, in hopes that they'd notice
But i wasn't their cup of tea
Its so lonely, when i'm only being me


Who's that girl in the mirror
With hair like a rock star
She wants to dance but she has cold feet
Her confidence is low
So much talent but who'll know
When she's afraid to follow her dreams
So i talk to her heart and made up her mind
That i gotta except her for me
But its so lonely, when i'm only being me

Ooooooohhh
You gotta be you and i've gotta be me
Only, only be me
