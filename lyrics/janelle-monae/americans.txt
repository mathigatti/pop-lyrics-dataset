Hold on, don't fight your war alone
Halo around you, don't have to face it on your own
We will win this fight
Let all souls be brave
We'll find a way to heaven
We'll find a way


War is old, so is sex
Let's play God, you go next
Hands go up, men go down
Try my luck, stand my ground
Die in church, live in jail
Say her name, twice in hell
Uncle Sam kissed a man
Jim Crow Jesus rose again

I like my woman in the kitchen
I teach my children superstitions
I keep my two guns on my blue nightstand
A pretty young thang, she can wash my clothes
But she'll never ever wear my pants

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Learned the words from my mom and dad
Cross my heart and I hope to die
With a big old piece of American pie
Love me baby, love me for who I am
Fallen angels singing: Clap your hands
Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land
I'm not crazy, baby, naw
I'm American
I'm American
I'm American
I'm American

Seventy-nine cent to your dollar
All that bullshit from white-collars
You see my color before my vision
Sometimes I wonder if you will fly
Would it help you make a better decision?

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Learned the words from my mom and dad
Cross my heart and I hope to die
With a big old piece of American pie
Just love me baby, love me for who I am
Fallen angels singing: Clap your hands
Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land
I'm not crazy, baby, naw
I'm American
I'm American
I'm American
I'm American

Let me help you in here
Until women can get equal pay for equal work
This is not my America
Until same gender loving people can be who they are
This is not my America
Until black people can come home from a police stop without being shot in the head
This is not my America
Until poor whites can get a shot at being successful
This is not my America
I can't hear nobody talkin' to me

Just love me baby, love me for who I am
Fallen angels singing: Clap your hands
Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land
I'm not crazy, baby, naw
I'm American (love me baby)
I'm American (love me for who I am)

Until Latinos and Latinas don't have to run from walls
This is not my America
But I tell you today that the devil is a liar
Because it's gon' be my America before it's all over
Please sign your name on the dotted line
