Good morning twilight.
Not a star in the sky.
Lost without my baby
And I just don't know why.


A lonely night on Peachtree
Clubs are closed (It's only three)
Dreary weather on my mind
I think it's raining all the time.

Visions of you in havana
'round my head like dragonfly.
[sigh] It makes my heart sigh.
Since my baby left me
All I can do is cry.

Lonely night on Peachtree.
Clubs are closed; it's only three.
Dreary weather on my mind
I think it's raining all the time.

Looking for a love in a weary rain
My heart's broken
And-I-can't-stand'
Can't stand loving you

Lonely night on Peachtree.
Clubs are closed; it's only three.
Feels like I'm paying love dues.
I've got the Peachtree blues.
I've got the Peachtree blues.
