I walked 47 miles of barbwire
Use a cobra snake for a necktie
I got a brand new house on the roadside
Made outta rattlesnake hide
I got a brand-new chimney up on top
Made out of a human skull
Now come on take a little walk with
me honey and tell me who do you love


Chorus:
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love

Tombstone hand on graveyard vine
Just 32 and I don't mind dyin'
I roda a lion to town use a
rattlesnake whip
Take it easy Arlene don't give me no lip
Who do you love

Chorus

The night was dark
The sky was blue
Down the alley the icewagon flew
Hit a bump somebody screamed
You shoulda heard just what I seen
Who do you love

Chorus

Tombstone hand on a graveyard vine
Just 32 and I don't mind dyin'
I rode a lion to town use a
rattlesnake whip
Take it easy Arlene don't give me no lip
Arlene took me by the hand
She said oowee baby you know I understand
Arlene honey let's raise some sand
Be my woman I'll be your man
Who do you love

Chorus
