Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hangin' about


I've been livin' like a star 'cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black!

Back in a band, I got a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes I'm in a band with a gang
They gotta catch me if they want me to hang

'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another trap
So look at me now, I'm just a makin' my pay
Don't try to push your luck, just get outta my way

'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yeah, I'm back!
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black!

Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black!

Aw, yeah! Let's go!
Keep on goin'! Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, aw, yeah, yeah!
Here we go!

Well, I'm back (I'm back!)
Back (well, I'm back!)
Back (I'm back!)
Back (I'm back!)
Back (I'm back!)
Back
Yes, back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Outta sight!
