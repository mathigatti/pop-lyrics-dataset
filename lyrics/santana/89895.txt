Move on, there's no time to waste complaining
Move on, can't you feel your heart expanding
Every time I turn around
Ignorance one step behind
So come on and try again
You can make it if you try


Move on, there's no time for hesitation
Move on, all you need is motivation
Every time I turn around
Ignorance one step behind
So come on and try again
You can make it if you try

Keep on moving on
Keep on moving
Got to keep on trying
Every step of the way
Got to keep on trying
Every step of the way
