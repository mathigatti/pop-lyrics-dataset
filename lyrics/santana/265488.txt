Sometimes, I imagine the world without you
But most times, I'm just so happy that I ever found you
It's a complicated web, that you weave inside my head
So much pleasure with such pain
Hope we always, always stay the same


I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the nick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging' the lows
' Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my life is good
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you

You go, and then I can finally breathe in
'Cause baby I know, in the end you're never leaving
Well we're rarely ever sane
I drive you crazy and you do the same
But your fire fills my soul
And it warms me up like no one knows

'Cause I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the nick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging the lows
' Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my life is good
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you

[guitar solo]

I'm feelin' the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the nick of time
I'm ridin' the highs, I'm diggin' the lows
'Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days

Oh I'm feelin' the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the nick of time
I'm ridin' the highs, I'm diggin' the lows
'Cause at least I feel alive
I've never faced so many emotional days
But my life is good
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you

Oh I'm feelin' the way that you cross my mind
And the way that you save me in the knick of time
Oh I'm feelin' the way when you walk on by
I feel light, I feel love, I feel butterflies
