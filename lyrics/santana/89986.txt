Somewhere in heaven
There is a place
Waiting for you and me


He made a promise
Gave every drop of blood
Died on the cross so we'd be free

Oh Oh Oh Oh

Somewhere
Somewhere in heaven
There's a place waiting
Waiting for you and me

He made a promise
Gave every drop a blood
And died right on the cross
So we'd be free

He made a promise
When he gave every drop
Of his blood
Died on the cross
So we'd be free
