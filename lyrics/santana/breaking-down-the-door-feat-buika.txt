Tina was no deceiver
Few were inclined to believe her
(Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?)
She was lucky to marry
A rich, rich man handsome like Harry
(Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?)
Harry was a charmer
No one believed he could harm her
(Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?)
Aba Tina, aba Tina
Aba Tina, aba Tina


The wedding was the talk of the town
The girl gone down in a long white gown
(Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?)
They said she wanted to marry above her
All she want was someone to love her
(Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?)
News came first, they called her a liar
Had no sound, she mouth full of wire
(Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?)
Aba Tina, aba Tina
Aba Tina, aba Tina

In the end Tina was buried
By the church where she got married
(Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?)
Tina should have outlived us
Now we pray that she will forgive us
(Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?)
Tina was no deceiver
Few were inclined to believe her
(Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?
Aba Tina, oh
Who you have there breakin' down the door?)
Aba Tina, aba Tina
Aba Tina, aba Tina
