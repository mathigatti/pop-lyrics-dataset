What does it take
To win your love for me
How can I make
This dream come true for me
Ooh I just got to know
Oh baby cause I love you so


I tried I tried I tried I tried
Every way I could
To make you see how much I love you
I thought you understood

Oh, I gotta make you see
What does it take to win
Your love for me

REPEAT
