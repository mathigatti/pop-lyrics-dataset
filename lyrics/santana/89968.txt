She has the innocence and vision of a child
How can I ever really know her?
We're riding on a carousel
That's running wild
Around in circles 'til it's over


And every time we reach the end
We go around again 'cause

Chorus:
She can't let go
And I don't wanna tell her no
She can't let go
And I don't wanna tell her no

I see her starin' out the window at the rain
But she will never leave the fire
Sometimes it burns all night and covers up the pain
Sometimes it only leaves us tired

And every time we reach the end
We go around again 'cause

Repeat chorus
