You better take it easy baby
Before you go away
You did me dirty
You'll get yours one day


Chorus:
You better
Watch your step...
Talkin' about you
Watch your step...
You better
Watch your step...

Keep your eyes open wide
'Cause you'll be hurtin' down inside

You better leave me all your money
Before you go away
Don't think I'm funny honey
All I've got to say

Chorus

'Cause when you took your love
from me
You left me full of misery
I'm gonna be all right

Chorus

When you need me by your side
I'm gonna say go somewhere and hide
Watch your step...
You better watch out baby
everything you do
I'm gonna keep my eyes focused,
right on you
You better walk right baby
There's just one thing I know
You better watch your step...
When you need me by your side
I'm gonna say go somewhere and hide
