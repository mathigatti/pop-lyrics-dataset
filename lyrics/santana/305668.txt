Love, Devotion Surrender


Listen, 
if you're tired of walkin' around and getting nowhere, 
I know, there's a path that's leading towards the Master. 



Chorus: 
Love, devotion and surrender 
love, devotion and surrender
love, devotion and surrender 
love, devotion and surrender. 


Oh, brother, listen to the rhythm of your heartbeat, 
It's keeping time with all the universal children (Chorus) 


Sister, sing the song created for your brother
louder, till the (your) heart embraces all the harmony (Chorus)
