Sometimes I wish I knew your name 
At times I want to say hello 
But you seem so far away 
To let my feelings show 
And though I don't know what to say 
I feel that someday soon one day 
Love will place you by my side 
And it shall be our guide 


And then mañana sera se si 
Means our love will always be 
Something special and also true 
Girl I long to be with you 
Oh mañana sera se si 
Means our love will always be 
Something special and also true 
Girl I long for you 

When I have you by my side 
You will always be my pride 
Love so simple yet so sweet 
I do think you're all I need 
So I thought I'd let you know 
That my heart forever grows 
Closer to your warm embrace 
Everytime I see your face 

And then mañana sera se si 
Means our love will always be 
Something special and also true 
Girl I long to be with you 
Oh mañana sera se si 
Means our love will always be 
Something special and also true 
Girl I long for you 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

And so mañana sera se si 
Means our love will always be 
Something special and also true 
Girl I long to be with you 
Oh mañana sera se si 
Means our love will always be 
Something special and also true 
Girl I long for you 

Do you know I don't know you 
I wanna show you I do love you 
That I do do, do love you 
Oh babe, I think about you 
Even though I don't know you 
I wanna show you I do love you 
And that I do do, I think about you 
Oh babe, I do love you 
Even though I don't know you 
I wanna show you I do love you 
I think about you 
Oh do do, oh do do, oh do do 

Chorus (2x)
