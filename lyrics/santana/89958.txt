One day you're up, next day
You're down
Where does it end
War in the east, war in the south
No one can win


Hunger and strife taking the lives
Brothers and friends
Young people grow, way much
Too fast
To realize

Chorus:
That the spirit brightens up
The sun
Everything in life must be as one

Nations collide, defending
Their pride
Blood is the price
The price is too high, no need
To die
Let's turn it around
Let's change the face, the
Human race
Progress will come
Just take the time, look deep
Inside
We'll understand

Repeat Chorus

Can't you feel the spirit
Grow into the light
Can't you see the spirit
Glowing in the night
