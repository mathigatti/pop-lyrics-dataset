Hey, baby
What's your name be, baby?
Come on, little girl, sit on my lap


So tell me what you want to do
And where you want to go
We can fly, we can drive, we could walk, baby
I don't know

And maybe take a top down
With the wind in your hair
Maybe to the beach or the mountains
You know, I don't care
I don't care, I donâ€™t care

Whoah oh oh
I'll take you where you want to go
Whoooah oh oh
Anywhere you want to go

I can see the sunshine
From the oil on your skin
All you've got to do is take a chance now
Baby, come on in

We could go to Santa Cruz
La Paz or to Spain
Maybe to the Mardi Gras New Orleans
And down your hurricanes

Whoah oh oh
I'll take you where you want to go
Whoooah oh oh
Anywhere you want to go

Whoah oh oh
I'll take you where you want to go
Whoooah oh oh
Anywhere you want to go
