Oh, we're lost in translation
Transient love
Then you pulled up in a Nova
It was over, yeah
I found a personal salvation
In your arms and eyes
Did it hurt when you fell?
Probably not, I could tell


You're like
Kali Durga Radha Sita Saraswati Parvati
I would love to lay you
Way up in the Himalayas
No, no need to be modest, baby
You appear to be a goddess, babe
Sweet, unholy thoughts of you
Let us pray

Oh, heavenly father, wherever you are
Could this be mine, all mine, all mine?

Your body is a temple
It just might be the temple of doom
Got an Indiana Jones for you, baby
There's no telling what I might do

You're like
Kali Durga Radha Sita Saraswati Parvati
I would love to lay you
Way up in the Himalayas
No, no need to be modest, baby
You appear to be a goddess, babe
Sweet, unholy thoughts of you
Let us pray
