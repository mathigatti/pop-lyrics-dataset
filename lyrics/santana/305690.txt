Hey everybody
Let's lend a hand
'Cause there's no tomorrow
Unless we take a stand



I see the future
Sliiping away
So I feel the need
To make a better way


You know my mother
She's your mother too
â€˜Cause this here planet
Gave birth to me and you


I got the feeling 
That you'll understand
When we say let's do it
