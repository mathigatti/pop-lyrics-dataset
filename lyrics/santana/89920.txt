The sun is slowly rising
The day is just beginning
Let me take you to a
Place you've never been to
Imagine that you're walking
With me in the jungle
The natives they are dancing
And singing to a ritual


E papa re, e papa re...

The music's getting to you
Your knees are feeling shaky
Your mind is getting dizzy
The spell is taking over

Suddenly you find yourself
Surrounded by these people
Ain't no use to try and struggle
You know it would be useless
Out of nowhere comes their leader
Commanding all attention
He signals them to set you free
But to keep on singing

E papa re, e papa re...

All around below above
The magic's flowing freely
Everybody's soaked in sweat
Drenched by their own feelings
Incantations cry out loud
The fire keeps on burning
now you're in a time and space
From where there's no returning
