I look at you all
see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor
and I see it need sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps


I don't know why nobody told you
how to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
they bought and sold you

I look at the world and I see it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
you were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
no one alerted you

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

Oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
