I lay not sleeping
Don't know what to do
Lay out in waiting
Lord for the noon


Pass so slowly
Time without you
I can't see why
My open eyes can't see

So much to look by
So many things to be
Can't keep looking
In and out of me
She looks at nothing
Someone you all have seen
She never cried
As I watched her leave

Try to help me
Find the change in me
Oh, oh, oh

Try to help me
Find the change in me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
