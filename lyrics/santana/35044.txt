Watch the master plan, the pastures span
Through the streets, move the sheep
Flipped the beat, like the shepherd
It's a new day, my crew stay forever striving
Give thanks cause we alive, and been through the gutter
Now we see the horizon
It's clear to me now
Used to be confused, took a lot of years to see how
Now, we moving planets
Take the average mind and expand it
You take for granted like we're always gonna be disadvantaged
But soon come, it soon come, ya soon done
Ya start run, you stumble, we catch one
In the rhythm, Santana lick the guits with precision
Not accidental, intentional conscious decision
To Zion, we're marching through with African Mayans
Conquering Babylon with the heart of a lion
And the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down


Tell me, how long has it been
Is everything, everything alright my friend

You see, time is passing, people asking how come none of thisain't lasting
Money will make people deal like they don't even have to feel
But no, it ain't real, it ain't real

Oh, do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
Ooh, do you like the way

How long, how long will we wait, to sit down and communicate
See, everything is relative, if you want to get then give
Can't we all just build and live,can't we, can't we ?

Do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
