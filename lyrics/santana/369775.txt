She said I feel stranded
And I can't tell anymore
If I'm coming or I'm going
It's not how I planned it
I got a key to the door
But I just won't open


I know I know I know
Part of me says let it go
That life happens for a reason
I don't I don't I don't
Cause it never worked before
But this time, this time
I'm gonna try anything to just feel better

Tell me what to do
You know I can't see through the haze around me
And I'll do anything to just feel better

And I can't find my way
God, I need a change
Yeah and I'll do anything to just feel better
Any little thing to just feel better

She said I need you to hold me
I'm a little far from the shore
And I'm afraid of sinking
You're the only one who knows me
And who doesn't ignore
That my soul is weeping

I know I know I know
Part of me says let it go
Everything must have a season
Round and round it goes
Every day is the one before
But this time, this time
I'm gonna try anything to just feel better

Tell me what to do
You know I can't see through the haze around me
And I'll do anything to just feel better

I can't find my way
God, I need a change
And I'll do anything to just feel better
Any little thing to just feel better

Long try to holding on
To all the things I ought to leave behind, yeah
It's really getting nowhere
I think I need a little help this time

Yeah

I'm gonna try anything to just feel better

Tell me what to do
You know I can't see through the haze around me
And I'll do anything to just feel better

I can't find my way
God, I need a change
And I'll do anything to just feel better
Any little thing to just feel better
