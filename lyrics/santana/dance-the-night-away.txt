Have you seen her? So fine and pretty
Fooled me with her style and ease
And I feel her from across the room
Yes, it's love in the third degree
Ooh, baby baby
Won't-cha turn your head my way?
Ooh, baby baby
Ah come on! Take a chance
You're old enough to


Dance (dance) the night away
Whoa-oh (ah) come on g-girl, dance the night away

A live wire, barely a beginner
But just watch that lady go
She's on fire, 'cause dancin' gets her higher than-uh
Anything else she knows

Ooh, baby baby
Won't-cha turn your head my way?
Ooh, baby baby
Well don't skip romance 'cause
You're old enough to

Dance (dance) the night away
Oh-oh-oh (ah) come on g-girl, dance the night away
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh yeah

Dance (oh) the night away. Hey, hey, yeah!
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Ah come on baby (dance the night away) hey, hey yeah!
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Uh, come on baby, baby (dance the night away) ooh, ooh, yeah
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Ah, ha ow!
