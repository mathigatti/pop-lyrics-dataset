You, always making promises
Who gets the blame for your mistakes
You, made a game of politics
Now fear and guilt on your face


But I can't feel your pain
And I won't share your shame
All I know is what I feel
Music sets me free

I don't mind walking in the rain
Ooh, tears of heaven soothe my pain
Love is the sound that makes me sing
I love to play a melody

But you can't hear the sound
But you can't, you can't feel the beat
All I know is what I feel
Music sets me free

I don't mind walking in the rain
Ooh, tears of heaven soothe my pain
Love is the sound that makes me sing
I love to play a melody

But you can't hear the sound
But you can't, you can't feel the beat
All I know is what I feel
Music sets me free

Two points of view
Two points of view
Two points of view
One for me, and one for you

But you can't hear the sound
But you can't, you can't feel the beat
All I know is what I feel
Music sets me free

Two points of view
Two points of view
Two points of view
One for me and one for you

Two points of view
Two points of view
