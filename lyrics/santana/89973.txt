Before we go
I want you to know
How much I love
Sharing with you
All that I have
And all that I am
Belongs to you
All of the time


You been so kind
And wonderful
By being here
So close to me
Deep in my heart
I clearly see
That you and I
Will soon be free

I'll be standing here
Waiting on you
I can hardly wait
To make you mine (mine, mine...)
It's time to go
And nothing can stop
Or even delay
Our journey's goal
Remember to be one with you heart
One with the sky, one with the sea
