Don't you feel a change a-coming
From another side of time
Breaking down the walls of silence
Lifting shadows from your mind
Placing back the missing mirrors
That before you couldn't find
Filling mysteries of emptiness
That yesterday left behind.


Chorus:
And we all know it's better
Yesterday has passed
Now let's all start the living
For the one that's going to last.

(Repeat Chorus)

Don't you feel the day is coming
That will stay and remain
When your children see
The answers
That you saw the same
When the clouds have all gone
There will be no more rain
And all the beauty of all things
Is uncovered again.

Chorus

(Repeat Chorus)

Don't you feel the day is coming
And it won't be too soon
When the people of the world
Can all live in one room
When we shake off the ancient
Chains of our tomb
We will all be born again
Of the eternal womb.

Chorus (Repeat 3x)
