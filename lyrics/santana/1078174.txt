Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell, 
It was love from above, like it saved me from hell, 
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see, 
And the devil himself could be pulled out of me, 
There were drums in the air as she started to dance, 
Every soul in the room keeping time with there hands, 
And we sang? 


(Chorus) 
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, 
And the voices bang like the angels sing, 
We`re singing? 
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, 
And we danced on into the night, 
Ay oh ay oh, 
Ay oh ay oh, 
And we danced on into the night, 

Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place, 
You could tell how we felt from the look on her face, 
She was spinning in circles with the moon in her eyes, 
The room left them moving between you and I, 
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time, 
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night, 
And we sang? 

(Chorus) 
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, 
And the voices bang like the angels sing, 
We`re singing? 
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, 
And we danced on into the night, 
Ay oh ay oh, 
Ay oh ay oh, 
And we danced on into the night, 
Ay oh ay oh, 
Ay oh ay oh, 
And we danced on into the night, 

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell, 
It was love from above, like it saved me from hell, 
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see, 
And the devil himself could be pulled out of me, 
There were drums in the air as she started to dance, 
Every soul in the room keeping time with there hands, 
And we sang? 

(Chorus) 
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, 
And the voices bang like the angels sing, 
We`re singing? 
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, 
And we danced on into the night, 
Ay oh ay oh, 
Ay oh ay oh, 
And we danced on into the night,
(And the voices bang like the angels sing), 
Ay oh ay oh, 
Ay oh ay oh, 
And we danced on into the night, 
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, 
(Ay oh ay oh), 
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, 
(Ay oh ay oh), 
Singing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, 
(Ay oh ay oh), 
And we danced on into the night?
