Tell me
Just what you want me to be
One kiss
And boom you're the only one for me
So please tell me
Why don't you come around no more?
Cause right now
I'm crying outside the door of your candy store


(Chorus)
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of
that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bed
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm telling you my babe
It's all in the game of...

Love is
Whatever you make it to be
Sunshine
Instead of this cold lonely sea
So please baby
Try and use me for what I'm good for
It ain't saying goodbye
It's knocking down the door of your candy store

(Chorus)
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of
that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bed
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm telling you my babe
It's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love

You roll me
Control me
Console me
Please hold me
You guide me
Divide me
In two

(Solo)

So please tell me
Why don't you come around no more?
Cause right now
I'm crying outside the door of your loving store

(Chorus)
It just take a little bit of this, a little bit of
that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bed
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm telling you my babe
It's all in the game of love
It's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love
Let's play the game of love

Roll me
Control me
Please hold me
(Make me feel good)
I'm here on my own
