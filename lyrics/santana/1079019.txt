Like a gift from the heavens
It was easy to tell
It was love from above
That could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul
It was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air
As she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands


And we sang a, away, away, away
And the voice sings rang like the angels sing
And singing a, away, away, away
And we danced on into the night
And we danced on into the night

Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes
With no room left to move in between you and I
And we forgot where we were
And we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night

And we sang a, away, away, away
And the voice sings rang like the angels sing
And singing a, away, away, away
And we danced on into the night
And we danced on into the night
And we danced on into the night

Like a gift from the heavens
It was easy to tell
It was love from above
That could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul
It was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands

And we sang a, away, away, away
And the voice sings rang like the angels sing
And singing a, away, away, away
And we danced on into the night
A, away, away, away
And the voice sings rang like the angels sing
And singing a, away, away, away
And we danced on into the night
A, away, away, away
A, away, away, away
Singing a, away, away, away
And we danced on into the night
