Chorus:
Try a little harder now
Try a little harder now
Try a little harder now
Try a little harder now


No one ever said it would be easy
Doin' whatever you do
You just might have to suffer
But keep on movin' right through
You've got to

Chorus

Sometimes you have to change your tune
To get where you want to be
But don't you let that satisfy you
You can have all you see

Chorus
