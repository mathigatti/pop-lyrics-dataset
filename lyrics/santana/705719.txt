This is total junk
and the opposite of what I want
How life guides me
has never been righty!


CHORUS:
But the Paris Finale
Brought back memories
of those days where I dream
of the city that seemed...

A BEAUTY!

Now I'm feeling better
Because I've just seen whatever
Life and Dreams come together
For the feelings that will last forever!

CHORUS

Paris Finale is a dream, a beam, where you cross with wisdom.(repeat and fade)
