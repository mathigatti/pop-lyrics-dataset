Growing darkness never leaves me,
Just in time, time to see the sun.
And every shadow disbelieves me,
Making mine, mine a longer run, yeah....


Clouds roll past and leave their thunder,
Just a wanning, a warning to be heard.
And all the people sit and wonder,
If the Lord, will wash their sins away.
