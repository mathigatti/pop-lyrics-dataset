Yesterday I was alone and Blue
My heart was heavy and then came you
Oh I can see that you were meant for me
Now I have found you, I'll never let you go


You know that I love you
I need you
You know that I'm caring, sharing
Everything I've got
Don't you know that I want you
I need you too
And I will be happy with you for the rest of my life

Many lovers they come and go
But your sweet loving lingers on and on
Oh I can feel, that this time it's for real
So hold me closer, and never let me go

You know that I love you
I need you
You know that I'm caring, sharing
Everything I've got
Don't you know that I want you
I need you too
And I will be happy with you for the rest of my life
And I will be happy with you for the rest of my life

Well your sweet love is all I need
Without you I just can't go on

You know that I love you
I need you
You know that I'm caring, sharing
Everything I've got
Don't you know that I want you
I need you too
And I will be happy with you for the rest of my life
I'll be happy with you for the rest of my life
