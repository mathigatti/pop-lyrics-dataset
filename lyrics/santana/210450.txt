We're in time with music
Of the universe
Doctor of Mother Earth
We are all one,
We are all one with the sun


Reflecting words to say
Silently I want to be

With symphonies of stars you came
Singin' through my soul
I see you in the golden sunset
Glowin' through my soul

In the summerdays
We went to the sea
How smooth it laid,
How calm against these skies?
Dancin' in your eyes

With symphonies of stars you came
Singin' through my soul
I see you in the golden sunset
Glowin' through my soul

We're in time with music
Of the universe
Doctor of mother earth
We are all one,
We are all one with the sun

We are all one with the sun
