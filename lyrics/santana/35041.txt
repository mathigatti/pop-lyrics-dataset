Hey now, all you sinners
Put your lights on, put your lights on!
Hey now, all you lovers
Put your lights on, put your lights on!


Hey now, all you killers
Put your lights on, put your lights on!
Hey now, all you children
Leave your lights on, better leave your lights on!

Cause there's monster living under my bed
Whispering in my ear
And there's an angel, with a hand on my head
She say I've got nothing to fear

There's a darkness living deep in my soul
I still got a purpose to serve
So let your light shine, deep into my home
God, don't let me lose my nerve
Don't let me lose my nerve

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Wooh hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now

Hey now, all you sinners
Put your lights on, put your lights on
Hey now, all you children
Leave your lights on, you better leave your lights on!

Cause there's a monster living under my bed
Whispering in my ear
There's an angel, with a hand on my head
She say's I've got nothing to fear
She says, you have to shine like star
You have to shine like star
And never fade away
