Lightning in the sky
Thunder on the ground
Man and beast alike
Seeking shelter from the storm
All around there is fear in the air
All around there is fear in the air


Burning drops of rain
Flood my thirsty soul
Cold chills to the bone
Glowing eyes filled with pain
All around there's a cry no one hears
All around there's a cry no one hears

Always on the run
Never taking time to see
Beauty all around
Nature's dance is just for me
All around, Nature's dance
Just for me
All around, Nature's dance
Just for me

Rainbows glowing high
Evening shadows fall
Don't you wait for me
I won't be back for your call

I am free from your spell, I am free
I am free from your spell, I am free
I am free from your spell, I am free
Free, free, free...
Free from your spell, I am free
