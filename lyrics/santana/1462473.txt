Who would have thought that you could hurt me
The way you've done it
So deliberate, so determined


Since you have been gone
I bite my nails for days and hours
And question my own questions on and on

So tell me now, tell me now
Why you're so far away
When I'm still so close

You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
You said you would love me until you die
As far as I know you're still alive
Baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart

I tried so hard to be attentive
To all you wanted always supportive always patient
What did I do wrong?
I'm wondering for days and hours
It's here, it isn't here where you belong

Anyhow, anyhow
I wish you both all the best
I hope you get along

You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
You said you would love me until you die
As far as I know you're still alive
Baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart

You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
You said you would love me until you die
As far as I know you're still alive
Baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart

Open heart
Open heart

Should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart

Open heart
Open heart

Should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
