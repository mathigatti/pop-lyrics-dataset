(scream) I just gotta get away
Can't stand it
Children suffer every day


Tell me baby
What's it for
Fighting daily
For the turf

We're still killing each other
In the name of the Lord
There's a brand new graffiti
With blood on the walls

Peace... are you that far away?

Now you can feel it
Other people's pain
Love can heal it
Gentle as the rain

Oh, the United Nations drag their feet on the floor
All they do is spend your money
They don't tell you what for

Peace... what price we have to pay
Peace... there's gotta be a better way

People tell me it's useless to look for a way
I believe that tomorrow starts right here, today

Peace... are you that far away
Peace... there's gotta be a better way

Peace... are you that far away
Peace... there's gotta be a better way
Peace, peace
There's gotta be a better way
Peace, peace oh oh oh peace
