Open your eyes
Let it begin with me
Brand new day
Fresh new way to live
The mornin' is callin'
Walk with me into the sun


Everything is comin' our way
Everything is comin' our way
Everything is comin' our way

Here's my hand
Reaching out to you
Take it, darlin'
And lead me on, yeah

Everything is comin' our way
Everything is comin' our way
Everything is comin' our way
Ah

Everything is comin' our way
Everything is comin' our way
Everything is comin' our way
Ah

I can feel it in my bones
No man stands alone
Sister, Brother
From all the same seed

Everything is comin' our way
Everything is comin' our way
Everything is comin' our way
