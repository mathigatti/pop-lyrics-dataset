One way in and one way out
You don't know what it's all about
You look to the left
You look to the right
The brightest day and the darkest night


Chorus:
And if you see me stealin' away
You better believe that I'd much
rather stay
Daughter of the night
Everything right
Is getting to you baby
Sister of the sun
Born on the run
Just let me move you baby
On the road well I been told
The people need a highway code
The harder the chase
The sweeter the catch
I ain't the driver but you met your match

Chorus

You can win and you can lose
Listen mama you got to choose
You can give up tryin'
Or break downi cryin'
Or keep on goin'
Change your mind

Chorus
