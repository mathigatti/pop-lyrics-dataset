Searchin', I'm always searchin'
Searchin' for my beloved
I'm gonna keep on searchin' 'cause
I need your love, yea
Listen, my heart is callin'
Longing to have you near me
Please believe me what I'm sayin'
is true
Every morning I wake up to you
Searchin', searchin', searchin',
searchin'
Every night my thoughts return to
calling you
Lover, don't keep me waiting
You must hear what I'm saying
I'm gonna keep on searchin' till I win
your love
I can almost hear her gentle voice
Searchin', searchin', searchin',
searchin'
I can almost hear her smile of light
Searchin', searchin', searchin',
searchin'
I can almost feel the love reach out
to me
