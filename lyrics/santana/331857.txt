She's a force of nature
That I can't out run
A devil and a savior all in one
Her eyes can heal me
Or they can make me bleed
Her lips have me addicted to the poetry
Of never really knowing
Just who I am (where I stand)
And I admit that I don't mind at all
I would trade my world away
To stay inside this dream
I'd never find a better place to fall


I've got a lover, a brown skin girl
She's got a magic of another world
And everytime that I think of her
I'm on fire, fire
She knows a way, a spiritual flow
Of making me dizzy, like the vertigo
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul
Like fire, yeah

I get a strong vibration
If she just says my name
And it drives me crazy
Cause I don't know if she feels the same
She likes to breathe some mystery
In all she does
She laughs and says that I'm under her spell
Now I won't lie, I enjoy the ride
And pray it never ends
I feel her deeper than anything I've felt

I can't help but crave another taste of her
Like a drowning man that's praying for the rain
How she worked her way inside- I'll never understand
She's too beautiful to ever take the blame
But she'll always fan the flame
