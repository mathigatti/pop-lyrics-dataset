Chorus: 
Let there be light
Let there be joy
Let there be love
And understanding
Let there be peace
Throughout the land. 



Verse: 
Let's work together
In harmony
Let's build a better world
No suffering


And in times of darkness
Just reach out
â€˜Cause there is a promise
It won't be denied


Repeat Chorus Six Times


Narration: 


This is truly paradise
Being here in this celestial garden
With all the ones you love
Where nothing dies or ever grows old
And to be bathed in light
That cast no shadow


Yes
This is the Kingdom within
Still you know
Sometimes I miss seeing and feeling
The Spirits Dancing in the Flesh 



Spirits Dancing in the Flesh


Intro: 
Can't you see them all around
They're all around us
Spirits, spirits dancing all around us


Chorus - Chant: 


Spirits
Dancing in the Flesh, the Spirits
Spirits
Dancing in the Flesh, the Spirits
Spirits
Dancing in the Flesh, the Spirits
Spirits
Dancing in the Flesh, the Spirits
