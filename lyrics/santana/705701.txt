From nowhere 
Through a caravan 
Around the campfire light 
A lovely woman in motion 
With hair as dark as night 
Her eyes were like that
Of a cat in the dark 
They hypnotize me with love


She was a gypsy woman 
She was a gypsy woman 

She danced around and round 
To a guitar melody 
From the fire her face 
Was all aglow 
How she enchanted me 
Oh how I'd like to hold her near 
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear 

I love you gypsy woman 

All through the caravan 
She was dancing with all the men 
Waiting for the rising sun 
Everyone was having fun 

I hate to see the lady go 
Knowing she'll never know 
That I love her 

That I love her 

She danced around and round 
To a guitar melody 
From the fire her face 
Was all aglow 
How she enchanted me 
Oh how I'd like to hold her near 
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear
