You are my river
Keep on flowing through
Filling my life
With all of you


You are the freedom
I've been searching for
Oh, how I love you
Just for who you are

There will be hard times
Everyone must go through
Testing his love
Just to see if it's true
But the hard times will come
But they all pass away
I have seen the light
In my life today

That's why I love you
Just for who you are

You are my river
