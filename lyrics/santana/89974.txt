Here I am, once again
This time, babe, I'm gonna do it right
Mind's made up, heart is set
Ain't no way I'm gonna compromise


Something happened, Hollywood skies
I was mesmerized
Suits and ties with platinum eyes
Cold cash junkies got the best of me

Victim of circumstance

Got myself back together
Learned my lesson well
I had to put up a fight, to make it right
Freedom's ringing like the sound of a bell

Victim of circumstance

One more thing I want to say to you
Before you go away
Don't you let 'em, no!
Don't you let 'em, no!
