Jennifer was an angel
in a clothing store.
There was a fragrance
I know there was an angle present.


Something like Gardenia,
would be there every time
I'd seen her.
But she kept her wings under cover,
maybe she saved it for her lover's eyes only.
For her lover's eyes.

Callaghan was a builder
from the site next door.
He was over powered
the moment that he smelt the flowers.

Something like Gardenia
whould be there every time
I'd seen her.
But she kept her wings under cover
maybe she saved it for her lover's eyes only.
For her lover's eyes.

Don't tell me I'm in love
for the first time.
Don't tell me I'm in love
at last
I really can't believe in romance.
Tell me I was wrong

Callaghan had fallen
from the seventh floor.
His eyes were open
and not a single bone was broken.
Essence of Gardenia,
had been there in his rear view mirror.
She kept her wings under cover,
maybe she saved it for her lover's eyes only.
For her lover's eyes
