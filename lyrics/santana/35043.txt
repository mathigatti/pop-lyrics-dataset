Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday Sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone


But you stay so cool
My mu√±equita, my Spanish harlem Mona Lisa

You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove

And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood

'Cause you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the Moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Cause you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the Moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it
