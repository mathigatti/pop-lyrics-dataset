Tell me
Just what you want me to be
One kiss and boom
You're the only one for me
So, please, tell me
Why don't you come around no more?
Cause right now I'm crying
Outside the door of your candy store


It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now grew up to that
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of

Love is whatever you make it to be
Sunshine instead of this cold lonely sea
So, please, baby, try
And use me for what I'm good for
It ain't saying goodbye
It's knocking down the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now grew up to that
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you my babe
It's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love

You roll me
Control me
Console me
Please, hold me
You guide me
Divide me
Into

(Make me feel good)
So, please, tell me
Why don't you come around no more?
Cause right now I'm dying
Outside the door of your loving store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now grew up to that
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love (a little bit of this)
It's all in this game of love (a little bit of that)
It's all in the game of love (a little bit of that)
Let's play the game of love (a little bit of this)

Roll me (a little bit of this)
Control me (a little bit of that)
Please, hold me
(Make me feel good)
(A little bit of that)
(A little bit of this)
Now, you're all my own
All my own
(A little bit of this)
(A little bit of that)
(A little bit of that)
(A little bit of this)
