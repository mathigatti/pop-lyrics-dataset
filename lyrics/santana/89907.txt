When I was a little boy
I was raised down south in Mexico
Nothing ever happened that was new to me
Then one day we saw circus posters on the wall
Suddenly, All my friends and I
We heard a sound
It was loud
Music all around us seemed to make us free


Life is just a passing paradise
Life is just a passing paradise

Everybody started dancing
I never saw so many people having so much fun

Now I'm living in this country
And I've got myself a steady job
I keep seeing people happy everywhere
All I get to do is play my guitar

Come on! Everybody get together, have some fun
Come on! Everybody get together, have some fun

Life is just a passing paradise
Life is just a passing paradise

Everybody started dancing
I never saw so many people having so much fun
