When I was a young boy
I was raised in Africa
In a little village
Deep in the heart of Kenya
I remember one time
I was outside hunting game
When I heard the thunder
Of a storm that frightened me


Suddenly
All around me darkness
And I could feel
Something evil near me
Closing in
So I started running
I tried to hide
But it overcame me

I became a prisoner of
The spell that entered me
And the same thing happened
To my friends and family
In the yeart that followed
Drought and famine filled the land
Many days of sorrow
Endless nights of burning pain

Suddenly
A light appeared before me
And I could see
The virgin shining on me
And in her arms
Was the child inside me
And I could feel
Everlasting freedom all around me
