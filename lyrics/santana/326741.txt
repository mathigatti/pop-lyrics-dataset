Oh way oh
hey...
Oh way oh
Oh way oh


If the world divides from the bitter sweetness love provides
I will redefine my place within this union
If the world is a lie and the better me can't show it's side
I will try to find my way to higher ground

Ooh! There's a million stories
And a million ways to get there from here

Baby I'm gonna put your skin on mine, be inside you all my life
But if you let your heart open up your mind
There's a whole new your world on the other side
I'm gonna be your satellite
I´ll hang over your world at night
And I can hear you sleep beneath the candle light
I can see your dreams like they were mine

Oh way oh
Oh way oh
Oh way oh
Oh way oh way oh

When I, I hear you scream, I hear you cry
It's makes me realizes that I am only human
If the world relies on the balance between love and pride
Then I'll abandon all my pride and bring you love

Ooh! There's a million reasons
And a million ways to get to your heart

Baby I'm gonna make you step outside
The corners of your world and find
That if you let your heart open up your mind
There's a whole new world on the other side
I'm gonna be your satellite
I´ll hang over your world at night
And I can hear you sleep beneath the candle light
I can see your dreams like they were mine

Oh way oh
Oh way oh
Oh way oh
Oh way oh way oh

Baby I'm gonna put your skin on mine, be inside you all my life
But if you let your heart open up your mind
There's a whole new world on the other side
I'm gonna be your satellite
I'll hang over your world at night
And I can hear you sleep beneath the candle light
I can see your dreams like there were mine

Oh way oh
Oh way oh
Oh way oh
Oh way oh way oh
