Nothing is new, they say, under the sun
But then again my soul feels a change
It feels so new
Life is an open vision of the highest bliss
Because of you, life is new
Because of you, life is new


Alone I try to change the world
Only to find that I had beared
You came along
And with the wave of your hand you showed us the weight
Because of you, life is new
Because of you, life is new
Because of you, life is new
