Walking down on Main Street
Cold chills in the air
Looking for a helping hand
Ain't nobody there
Dreams, nightmares, and fantasies
Weave their way around
I can see past appearances
They can't bring me down


Chorus:
But tell me
Who loves you
When you're down and out
And you're all alone
Who loves you
When you've lost your mind
And you lose control

Television, radio and all the magazines
Focus on the negative
Time and time again
Young men give their lives away
Believing in a cause
Ware is always profitable
They write you off a loss

Repeat Chorus
