Where's my pal, where's my friend
All good things must have an end
Sad things and nothings
On and on they go
I guess he went to Mexico


Chorus:
They all went to Mexico
Buenas dias, got to go
Tengo que obedecer
Mi corazon
They all went to Mexico
Where's my mule, where's my dray
Straw hat's packed up and gone
away
Mule don't go north and dray go slow
They both went to Mexico
Where's my sweetie, where's the face
That lit dark corners every place
She put up with me long time you know
And then she had to go to Mexico

Chorus

Wheres my brown dog, where's my hound
He liked my truck he hung around
But he's a canine romeo
And I guess he went to Mexico
Where's that woman so sweet, so mean
Her heart was cautious her mind was keen
She was always looking for the peccadillo
I hope she went to Mexico

Chorus

Where's December's happy crew
With German bikes and sidecars too
They take the truck south to St. Louis, MO
Motorcycle all the way to Mexico
Where's my luck, where's my grace
Has it all been just a foolish chase
Every time I hear that rainy chill wind blow
I think it might be time to head to Mexico
