My mind runs away with me
I just want to be with you
Where? Where I don't care
To be next to you
To be by your side...


I..I..Oh I..
I just wanna get next to you
I..I..Oh I..
I just wanna get next to you

My mind will not leave me alone
Can't sleep, I just want to be with you
Your touch is all I need
Your touch is all I need
To see me through

Repeat Chorus
