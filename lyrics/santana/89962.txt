Chorus:
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you


Little girl again you are blue
Another fellow has gone and left you
I see you've come back to me
Your best frind
To tell another tragic story again
And once more you look into my eyes
And one more time you ought to realize

Repeat Chorus

I must confess you're not to be blamed
For being caught in those boys' vicious games
This time I won't let you go back
Never again, my dear, in fact
I'm gonna stop the blueness
In you
Also confess what my heart
Wants me to

Repeat Chorus

Just once more you look in my eyes
And one more time you ought to realize

Repeat Chorus
