Don't expect and you won't be disappointed
And don't judge
Offer your love


Don't make promises to the world
Keep them to yourself
You'll be better off

Hey! I know what I'm talking about
I know what I'm talking about

Don't complain
Go out and do it yourself
Later on, you'll be better off

Don't look back, especially if it's painful
Turn within, you're going to find delight

Free as the morning sun
Free as the morning sun
Free as the morning sun
