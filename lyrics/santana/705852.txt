Verse

You know they say that one hand washes the other 
Well you better start, better start looking out for me
Cause there's a way that you can be minus one lover
Just keep making it hard deliberately


Chorus

If you're going to play with fire don't cry when you burn your fingers 
I'm not going to be the fool that you get tired of 
Someones got to clean up their act before the show is over 
Baby such are the facts of love

Verse 

Its been so long since we made magic together 
But you never stopped taking real good care of yourself 
There comes a time you see your face in the mirror 
And something tells you the pain ain't good for your health no no

Modified Chorus

If you going to play with fire don't cry when you burn your fingers 
I'm not going to be the fool that you get tired of 
Somebody's got to clean up their act before the show is over 
Baby such are the facts, the facts of love, the facts of love, the facts of love ...
