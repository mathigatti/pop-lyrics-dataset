Everybody tells me, we love your songs
Your soul is precious, but it just ain't good enough
You need a single to help you through
Program directors, they all make the rules
I said, you're kidding, you're putting me on
What about the Constitution, freedom of expression
Listen to the music, just feel the sound
Love is the motion, that's what makes the world go around


Sing, Songs of Freedom
Bring joy to the world
Sing, Songs of Freedom
Bring joy to the world

Everybody listen, stop and take some time
To understand the world situation
There is no meaning in fighting the way we do
Let's come together and forgive each other

Sing, Songs of Freedom
Bring joy to the world
Sing, Songs of Freedom
Bring joy to the world
