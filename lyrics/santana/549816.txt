It's midnight - And I don't want to see you leaving
Thought of you - going back - back to him -
is killing me
Baby please - how can you torture my heart
We both know - where we belong
we belong here in each other's arms


Come with me and we can make the heavens sing
Can't deny the forces that you feel within
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing
"Let me love you tonight"
"Let me love you tonight"

(if you)
Go we'll never know - what tomorrow brings
Got to be a way to end this - suffering
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing
"Let me love you tonight"
"Let me love you tonight"

Baby I - I don't wanna see you hurtingâ€¦(no more)
Gotta do what's right - 'cos we can't - can't go on
like this anymore
I'm on my knees - you know it's over with him
So why go back - when all that you need
You know that it's right here with me

Come with me and we can make the heavens sing
Can't deny the forces that you feel within
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing
"Let me love you tonight"
"Let me love you tonight"

(if you)
Go We'll never know - what tomorrow brings
Got to be a way to end this - suffering
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing
"Let me love you tonight"
"Let me love you tonight"
