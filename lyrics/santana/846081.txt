It's like the ocean baby
You make me feel so sexy
Love so understating
For only you I'm waiting
You turn me on
My love is on and on and

Your touch it makes me crazy
I feel your body and me
It's like the ocean at sea
My love is never ending
You and me
It's like a dream my baby

Amore,(can you give me all the love)
sexo (can you give me all the sex)
Amore,(give it to me all night long)
my love is on and on and on (turn me on and turn me
on)
Amore,(can you give me all the love)
sexo (can you give me all the sex)
Amore,(give it to me all night long)
my love is on and on and on (turn me on and turn me
on)

It's like the wind beneath me
The passion flows so freely
Close to you I get free
Your everything that I need
I turn you on
My love is on and on and

I feel it all in my knees
And I know how good it will be
It's like the wind beneath me
My love is never ending
You and me
It's like a dream my baby

Amore,(can you give me all the love)
sexo (can you give me all the sex)
Amore,(give it to me all night long)
my love is on and on and on (turn me on and turn me
on)
Amore,(can you give me all the love)
sexo (can you give me all the sex)
Amore,(give it to me all night long)
my love is on and on and on (turn me on and turn me
on)

Feeling your body close to me 
All your moves make me go crazy

Amore,(can you give me all the love)
sexo (can you give me all the sex)
Amore,(give it to me all night long)
my love is on and on and on (turn me on and turn me
on)
Amore,(can you give me all the love)
sexo (can you give me all the sex)
Amore,(give it to me all night long)
