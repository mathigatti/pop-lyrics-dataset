You be you and let me be me
No strings attached emotionally
I wanna get a little crazy
That's puttin' it plain
You got the medicine
And I got the pain


When you just wanna feel good
Like the doctor said
One good dose of loving
It's gonna straighten out your head

(tag):
You got an open invitation
On that you can rely
You got a prepaid reservation
And that's the only way to fly

Let's make love, the feeling is right
Just passing by like ships in the night
Oughta get a little friendly
There's no time like now
You bring the attitude and I'll show you how

Anytime you're ready
Anytime at all
Just come on over
Don't even have to call
