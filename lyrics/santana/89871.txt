I told you
You'd have to leave
And you listened with a cryin stare.
Now you've got the nerve
To tell me baby
Yeah, Yeah, a no, no
You don't care
You just don't care baby.
Sun
Turns back at the sight of you
And your evil only clouds the air.


You you just laugh at what you do.
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hum
Now you don't care.
Hey
You don't care for me.

Your feelings smashed
Now you're leaving to find
Someone who'll dare
To change all the wrong
Like you done to me
Hey, Hey, Hey, No, No
You donit care.
Hey, Hey, Hey, you don't care.
