I'm just a bachelor 
Lookin' for a partner 
Someone who knows how to ride 
Without even fallin' off 
Gotta' be compatable 
Takes me to my limits 
Girl when I break you off 
I promise that you won't wanna' get off
If you're horny 
Let's do it 
Ride it --My pony 
My saddle's waiting 
Come and jump on it!!! 
(repeat) 


Sittin' here flossin'
Peepin' yo steelo 
Just once if I had the chance 
The things I would do to you 
You and yo body 
Every single portion 
Send chills up and down yo spine 
Juices flowin down your thigh 

(Repeat the hook) 

If we gonna' get nasty baby 
First we'll show and tell 
'til I reach yo ponytail 
Lurk all over and through you baby 
Until we reach the stream 
You'd be on my jockey team 

(repeat the hook)
