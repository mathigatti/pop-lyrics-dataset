You came to me
In a silver dream
With a glowing flow
Of a mountain stream


You lift my soul
Way beyond the sky
Just to wake me up
With your golden smiles

Chorus:
Silver dreams and golden smiles
Silver dreams and golden smiles
Silver dreams and golden smiles
Silver dreams and golden smiles

I knew one day
You would come my way
You would help me see
The reality

Heaven and earth
They are one, the same
In my heart I know
When you call my name

Chorus

Dreaming when I'm wide awake
See, when my eyes are closed
Flying, I don't need no wings
Being everywhere at once
Hold me, hold me in your arms
Fill me with your glowing grace

Chorus
