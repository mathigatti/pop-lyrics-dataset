Love brings a change
I wanna take a chance
And let it grow
I trust my feelings
I wanna be with you
Wherever you go


Oh baby
We're more than friends
So precious it should never end
Oh baby
Can't help but win

Stand up, say it loud
What we need is a lot more love
Stand up, say it loud
What we need is a lotta good good love

Tonight is our turn
We have the opportunity
Don't be afraid
Want to make you happy
Satisfy the dreams inside our heads

Ooh daylight comes around so fast
I wanna make this evening last
Ooh baby, I've given my best

Stand up, say it loud
What we need is a lotta love
Stand up, shout it out
What we need is a lot more love

Ooh baby, new dreams to share
And someone that will truly care
If you're lonely
I will always be there

Stand up, say it loud
What we need is a lot more love
Stand up, shout it out
What we need is a lotta good good love
