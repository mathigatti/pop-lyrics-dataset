When you walked out the
door, baby,
Thought I would die
I didn't realize
Oh, you were the brightest star
Up in the sky, yeah
Now that you're gone, oh how I miss
you so
Please come back to me, I need
your love
Baby ever so more, yeah, yeah


Come back, girl
Bring your sweet love back to me
I can't do without it, no...

If you want, I'll show you what I have
You can take, take what you want
of me
Just don't take the things that we
know are bad
Oh baby, oh baby, I need your
love, yeah

Girl...oh, yeah...oh...
Come back...won't you come back
Please, oh, please, please
please, please
Pretty pretty pretty pretty please
I need your love, oh, baby, yeah
