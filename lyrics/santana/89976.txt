Chorus:
Let there be light
Let there be joy
Let there be love
And understanding
Let there be peace
Throughout the land.


Verse:
Let's work together
In harmony
Let's build a better world
No suffering

And in times of darkness
Just reach out
'Cause there is a promise
It won't be denied

Repeat Chorus Six Times

Narration:

This is truly paradise
Being here in this celestial garden
With all the ones you love
Where nothing dies or ever grows old
And to be bathed in light
That cast no shadow

Yes
This is the Kingdom within
Still you know
Sometimes I miss seeing and feeling
The Spirits Dancing in the Flesh
