Tell me the things that you see
Or is it some time that you need
All of the things that you've done
I'm certain that you had your fun


Go out and make it better
You can make it if you try
Try to make it better

Somebody calls in the night
Says he can make things go right
I know there'll soon come a day
Things will start falling your way

I'll try to help if I can
So don't hide your head in the sand, oh no
Why are you feeling so low
You're wondering where will you go
