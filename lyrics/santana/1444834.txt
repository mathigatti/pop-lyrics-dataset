He gives another smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on
She says


Whatever happens
Don't let go of my hand

Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid that what they're doing is not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens
Don't let go of my hand

Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy,"
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens
Don't let go of my hand

Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand
