Let me begin by telling you
Something that happened turned my head around
I took a walk on a cloudy day
I met a friend, this is what he said


Now is the time for change
I'm trying to get to a higher place
Life is surrounded by grace
Let's join together singing songs of freedom

What do you do when you gain the world
You pay the price, baby, you lose your soul
Live in a world of make believe
It won't work, baby, can't you see?

Now is the time for change
I'm trying to get to a higher place
Life is surrounded by grace
Let's join together singing songs of freedom

Praise.....Praise

It's three o' clock in the mornin'
When I'm all by myself
And I feel the spirit comin' on again

Now is the time for change
I'm trying to get to a higher place
Life is surrounded by grace
Let's join together singing songs of freedom
