It's so hard just waitin'
But I guess that's what I have to do
My poor heart keeps on breakin'
With every moment I'm away from you
I know you're smart takin'
Your time
'Cause of what it cost you
Once before
But it's not then and I love
You a lot
Now and forever


Chorus:
How long do I wait before you make up your mind
How long I wonder
How long before you take away the hardest of times
How long I wonder

It's unfair when two who care
Have to face such a perilous sea
Despair lingers everywhere
Like a cloud nobody can reach
I understand you're afraid of it all
Love is one hell of a step
I'll be there if you panic or fall
No matter what the depth

Repeat Chorus

Solo

All I can say I've already said
More than a thousand times
It's up to you to believe
Every word
Before I lose my mind

Repeat Chorus
