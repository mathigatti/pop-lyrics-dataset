Ooooh, ah ah
When I look into your eyes,
I see the ocean in the shore
And I know just what I'm living for
When I look into your eyes. yeah,


When I look into your eyes,
All the love there is arrives
And everything around me dies,
When I look into your eyes

When I look into your eyes,
The sun melts deep into the sky,
And plants a seed inside my soul,
And takes me up into the sky. yeah, yeah
