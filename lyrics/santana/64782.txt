Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
Oooh, and it's alright
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never going to come down
If I said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied


Everytime I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say, 'Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will and tails we'll try again'
So I say, ''Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
Cause without you they're never going to let me in'

When's this fever going to break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
Oooh, and it's alright
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never going to come down
If said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied

Everytime I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say, 'Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will and tails we'll try again'
So I say, 'Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
Cause without you they're never going to let me in'

And slowly I begin to realize this is never gonna end
Right about the same time you walk by
And I say, 'Oh, here we go again, oh'

Everytime I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say, 'Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will and tails we'll try again'
So I say, 'Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
Cause without you they're never going to let me in'

So I'll say, 'Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will and tails we'll try again'
So I say, 'Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
Cause without you they're never going to let me in'
