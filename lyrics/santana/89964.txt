It gives me such a thrill
When you tell me 'bout the way
You feel
It really makes my day
I just love to hear you say


Chorus:
Say it again, say it high say it low
Say it again, so the whole wide
World will know
Say it, that you're still lovin' me
Still lovin' me, still in love with me
Say it again, tell me where, tell me when

Say it again, that our love will never end
Say it, that you're still lovin' me
Still lovin' me, still in love with me

You know it sounds so sweet
It just knocks me right up off of
My feet
To hear you talk that way
I just love to hear you say

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
I hear the echoes in my mind
They're calling to me all the time
I hear those voices start to sing
Again and again

Instrumental
