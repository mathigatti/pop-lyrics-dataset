Stay
Beside me
Don't go away
Cause if you leave me I will lose my inspiration
I don't wanna be another victim of frustration


Stay
Please guide me
I need your love
That I may see
Below, above, and all around is all confusion
You're the only one that breaks the spell of all illusion

Take me
I belong to only you
Your love
Coming down like a gentle rain
To soothe my pain
Gently
Oh, won't you stay

Below, above, and all around is all confusion
You're the only one that breaks the spell of all illusion
Take me
I belong to only you
Your love
Coming down like a gentle rain
To soothe my pain
Gently
Oh, won't you stay
