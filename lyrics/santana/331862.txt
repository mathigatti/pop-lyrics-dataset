(Verse 1)
If you don't love me baby
Let me know
Cause you're breaking my heart
And it hurts me so


Playin' these games
And messin' with my mind
Girl you made me believe
You were only mine

(Chorus)
I don't wanna lose your love
Oh oh
I guess I have to let you go
I don't wanna watch you leave
Oh oh
I guess I have to walk away

(Verse 2)
Girl you said you loved me
And you'd never go
You were lyin' to me
You thought I'd never know

I just wanna tell you
Girl before I go
Take a good look at me
I won't look back no more

(Spanish Chorus)

No quero perder tu amor, oh
Pero te voya dejar irr
No quero mirarte irr, oh
voya tener que andar de aqui

(Repeat Verse 2)
(Spanish Chorus)
(Chorus Out)
