Saja is an instrumental piece.
The following lyrics are for Right On.



Hey baby
That's all right people
I know that's all right
Oh when we love, Oh each other
I know that's all right
Oh feel it, feel it, Oh everybody
Feel it
God knows that's all right, yeah


Some of us were born with
Money to spend
Some of us were born with
Races to win, oh yeah
Some of us are aware that it's
Good to fuss and care, oh yeah
Some of us feel the icy wind of
Poverty blowing in the air


But those of us who simply
Like to socialize
For those of us who tend the
Sick and heed the people's cry
Let me say to you: Right on
Right on, feel it, yeah
Oh, Oh, Oh, People and I say right on
Right on honey, right on


For those of us who live yeah, 
Well peace is craved
For those of us who live with hatred is enslaved
For those of us who live a life
Surrounded by good fortune and
Wealth, talk about it
For those of us who live a life
(hey, hey, hey) enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned
In the sea of happiness
For the sould who takes pride in his
God and himself and everything else
That's all it is. We need love
Love, love, sweet love
Wonderful love
Oh, true love, love
Love for your brother and love, 
Love for God
Love pure love
Oh, true love can cover hate every time
Give out some love and you'll find peace sublime
My darling, one more thing
