Woke up this morning with this pain inside my heart
Never felt that they would go and now leave you in the dark
You told me that you needed me and I showed you I'd be there
But now you've got me wrapped up in this crazy love affair


See lately I've been thinking about he things you do to me
How we been through all this ups and downs and I was too blind to see
But now my vision's better so I'm writing you this letter
By the time you get home I'll be gone and my life will be much better

It's hard enough those days
These are games that we play

(Chorus)
There's one thing I want you to know now
Before I pack my bags and go
Girl, you got it all wrong
Got it all wrong, got it all twisted baby

I gave you everything
Even gave you my ring
For better or for worse
Baby gave you my name
Get through every season
Summer, winter, spring and fall
Amd one thing you can say
Is I was with you through it all

I'll miss your touch, I'll miss your ways
These games with love that we can't play
I ve gotta walk away, I ve gotta leave
So I can find my way to still believe
Cause I love you to much
And there's no love with no trust

Theres one thing I want you to know now
Before I pack my bags and go
Girl, you got it all wrong
Got it all wrong, got it all twisted baby

One thing I want you to know now
Before I pack my bags and go down
Girl, you got it all wrong
Got it all wrong, got it all twisted

Lethal injection
Bitter sweet affection
All in the wrong direction
But we had our connection
Try not to be affected
Oh but I guess I was
Now I know what my momma meant
When she told me about love
Take your time, don't rush in
Get to close and you'll get burned
But I guess I've got a heartache
You live, you learn
Thought that I was cheated
But baby not this time
It's just your insecurities
Messing with your mind

You drive me away
And there's nothing left to say

Theres one thing I want you to know now
Before I pack my bags and go
Girl, you got it all wrong
Got it all wrong, got it all twisted baby

One thing I want you to know now
Before I pack my bags and go down
Girl, you got it all wrong
Got it all wrong, got it all twisted

Talk about the walk away
Baby it's about that time
Packing up everything I own
Taking everything gotta go now baby (repeat)
