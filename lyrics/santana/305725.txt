Come on, baby, don't you wanna go
Way down south, talkin' 'bout Mexico


Straight through the jungle, out to the sea
We'll have some fun if you fly away with me
Like some old movie in black and white
We'll fall in love in the middle of the night

Chorus:
Me and you, down in Veracruz
Do what you wanna do, down in Veracruz

Come on, baby, don't you wanna come
In the town, people movin' to the drums

Rosa's Cantina, it never stops
Drinkin' cerveza, people party 'til they drop
Forget the laundry, forget the rain
We'll get to heaven on the seven-thirty plane
