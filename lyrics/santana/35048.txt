Beauty and grace is what touches me most
Good times can put me in fear
Always feel safe when things are bad
So I cannot let you come near
It seems that I thrive on the dark side of things
I always feel alive when the death bell rings
Now you come and bring out the tears in me


Pain never makes me cry, but happiness does
It's so strange to watch your life walk by
Wishing it was
Wishing it was more like a fantasy
That everyday surprises me
Wishing it was

Oh, oh (wishing it was)
Oh, oh (wishing it was)

This feeling won't last cause I cannot survive
I tell you I've been here before
When it's movin so fast
It's a matter of time
One of us walks out that door
It seems that I thrive on the dark side of things
I always feel alive when the death bell rings
Now you come and you bring out the tears in me

Pain never makes me cry, but happiness does
It's so strange to watch your life walk by
Wishing it was
Wishing it was more like a fantasy
That everyday surprises me
Wishing it was

Oh, oh (wishing it was)
Oh, oh (wishing it was)

Give this some thought
And I'm sure you will know
This is the way it must be
Emotions will rise, emotions will flow
You bring out the tears in me

Pain never makes me cry, but happiness does
It's so strange to watch your life walk by
Wishing it was
Wishing it was more like a fantasy
That everyday surprises me
Wishing it was

Oh, oh (wishing it was)
Oh, oh (wishing it was)

Oh, oh (wishing it was)
Oh, oh (wishing it was)
