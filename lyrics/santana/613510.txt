Going back to the memories
Reminiscing 'bout you and me
Thinking how it used to be
It's plain and clear I treated you bad
But girl you know that I care
Every relation have wear and tear
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart
says.


Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So girl don't let this love die
Never meant to 'cause you no pain,
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.
Don't let this love die.

(Chorus)
Just Cry Baby Cry
(Don't cry no more)
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines


Can you feel me reaching out to you girl, can you hear my open
thoughts
Never want to disrespect you girl don't let this come break us
apart.
'Cause I know I would die without you, my girl can you hear my
broken heart.
It's calling out to the good times that we had back at the
start.

Baby… (Don't call me baby…)
You know I need you in my life daily. (You know you played me)
I was a player but now your love changed me. (Dead wrong…)
I'm going crazy I'm gone Never thought losing you would be so
hard

(Chorus)
It's your turn to cry baby cry
(Don't cry no more)
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

So let go
And move on
What we were
Is now undone
My tears have all dried
It's your turn now to cry

Bridge
You're losing your love and your trust for me girl
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.
If you wanted Just like we started.
Girl 'cause I don't want to fight no more.
Make it like it was before.
I'd tell you the truth
And you'd cry and I'd cry
Let's back to the place
And look in your eyes
Can you feel it inside
No doubts in your sky
The sun is gonna shine

Just Cry Baby Cry
(Don't cry no more)
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines
