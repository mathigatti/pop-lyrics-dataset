Loving you this way
Has made my tired heart sing
Lady, you touch my soul
With all the love you bring


Being so close to you
Is where I want to be
Don't turn your smile away
Don't break my fantasy

Summer lady
You look good to me
Summer lady
You're my fantasy

Seeing your presence near
Every time I wake
My life would be incomplete
If I didn't have you there

Summer lady
You look good to me
Summer lady
You're my fantasy

Bridge

Solo

Laying here in my room
With all my worldly things
Don't make up for all my dreams
Of you in my fantasy

Summer lady
You look good to me
Summer lady
You're my fantasy
Summer lady
You look good to me
Summer lady
You're my fantasy
Please don't take my dreams away
Oh, summer lady
