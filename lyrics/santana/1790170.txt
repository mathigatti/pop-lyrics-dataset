Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out alone
Riders on the storm
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirming like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road, yeah
(2X)
Girl you gotta love your man
Take him by the hand
Make him understand
The world on you depends
Or life will never end
Gotta love your man, yeah
(2x)
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out alone
Riders on the storm
(4x)
Riders on the storm
