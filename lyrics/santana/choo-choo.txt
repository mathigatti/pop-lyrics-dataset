You make me happy
When you shake your hips
When you sweat
I wanna taste your lips


Come over here, girl
And bring your heart to me
Your good lovin'
Will set me free, free, free, free

Honey, when you eat
I love to watch you chew
And when you touch me
You make everything new

Why don't you tell me
That I'm in your dreams?
Tell me that you are my one and only queen

You are my girl
I wanna take you round
The world, world, world
You are my angel
Spread your wings
And fly, fly in the sky

Hey, little girl
I'm gonna take you home
Want you to play
With my electric train
(Choo-choo!)
If you're nice
I'll take you for a ride
We'll share some lovin'
Get high, high, high, high

It's getting' hot
I'm real thirsty
My throat is dry
I need a drink
This is your birthday
I'll make your dream come true
And, baby, you can have some sweet ice cream, too

You are my girl
I wanna take you round
The world, world, world
You are my angel
Spread your wings
And fly, fly in the sky

You are my girl
Wanna take you round
The world, world, world
You are my angel
Spread your wings
And fly, fly in the sky

You are my girl
I wanna take you round
The world, world, world
You are my angel
Spread your wings
And fly, fly in the sky

You are my girl
Wanna take you round
The world, world, world
You are my angel
Spread your wings
And fly, fly in the sky
