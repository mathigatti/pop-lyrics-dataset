Love makes the world go round
Oh, love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round
Oh, love makes the world go round


Everybody gather round
This is a town, this a place
To bring a pigeon and make a change
The power fashion
You'd embrace

We will ignite
We will elevate
We can't help but sing
Yeah, we were dancing

We will heal this planet
And the human race

People, let's join hands
Put our minds together and understand
We are the ones
That bring a difference
We are the ones we've been waiting for

Lightning, love
Power and grace
These are the tools
To build a rainbow bridge

Woman and children
Teaching man to live in harmony

Love makes the world go round
Oh, love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round
Oh, love makes the world go round

Everybody knows that love makes the world go round
Everybody knows that love makes the world go round
Everybody knows that love makes the world go round
Everybody knows that love makes the world go round

Love, oh, love
Love, oh, love
