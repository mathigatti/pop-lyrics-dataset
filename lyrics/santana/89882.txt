What's that sound I hear coming from the ground
that' going 'round and 'round I can feel it pull me down
On my knees tears of joy have come to me
As the flower sounds made it plain to see


that this world is a perfect place to live
there is a warm soft wind blowing 'round me just to give
all the leaves such a haunting melody
that forever will be a part of me

Just like a ship out on the sea
floating alone no one around me or beyond me
the sun is on me

then suddenly I felt a kiss out of the breeze
that did caress me and posess me
oh it astounds me

All around there's a feeling in the air
that with the grace of time we'll be getting closer there
but day by day I can see they walk away
and I wonder, Lord will they ever know

that this world is a perfect place to live?
Just look into your heart, find the love that's there to give
Realize that the secret is to share
