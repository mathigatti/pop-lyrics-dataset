In this world there is so
Much anger
Our lives are in danger
We are all living in fears
We've got to stop the tears


Life is for living
Why must we wait
We all need some loving
Then why do we hate?

In South Africa things are
Still the same
The face of humanity still
Hasn't changed
People have to fight to live together
And share with one another

Chorus:
We can change this to be
A better place for all
If we listen to others when they call
Give a shoulder to lean on
When they fall
Let us bring down the
Apartheid wall

Innocent people pay with their lives
'Cause the truth it cuts like a knife
Mandela's life is wasted in jail
Raise your voices for freedom

Chorus

Woza Mandela
Sibizi' gama lakho
Woza Mandela
