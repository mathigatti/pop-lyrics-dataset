(feat. Ozomatli)

Way down here on these dead end streets
People live in doubt and fear
And it kept them down for oh so long
Now their time is getting near
I don't know where
I don't know how
I don't know when
But I'll tell you right now


[Chorus:]
One of these days you'll cross that line
The people gonna take you by surprise
The're gonna look their leaders in the eye (yeah)
One of these days you'll cross that line
The people gonna think with their own minds
They're gonna leave the system for behind (yeah)

How many of us spend our lives
On the outside lookin in
Well it seems they got us all convinced
That we're never gonna win
I don't know where
I don't know how
I don't know when
But I'll tell you right now

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Do you really think we'll ever stop
Lookin for as brighter day
While it looks today like you're on top
It could neverstay that way
