FEELS LIKE FIRE

I'm telling you it's over
Now there's an angel
Holding me
My way's easy
Even if you're fallen
Oh you're struggling
There's still beauty
In what we do


So que sera
Let's go sailing on
There's a wise man
In every fool

Chorus
I say come back
Come in from the cold
Into the warm
I feel like fire
Guiding you back home
As darkness falls

So everyone stands in line
Cos they wanna stay alive
To wait alone
No dog no bone
And then you find it's over
Still it tears your heart
To slip away
From the crowd

But if you have
What it takes
To return to where
All the world
Knows your name
Then que sera
Let's go sailing on
There's a wise man
In every fool

Chorus
I say come back
Come in from the cold
Into the warm
I feel like fire
Guiding you back home
As darkness falls

I say come home
Leave it all behind
And settle down
I feel my love
Can give me what I want
For all time
