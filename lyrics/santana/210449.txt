I've been searching for freedom
I've been looking for someone
In the dreams of my heart, I see your face
Calling me into the light


You're the viision of beauty
You're so radiant and lovely
I just can't believe you're here with me
Your touch is my ecstasy, my love

Looking into the future
We can see the beginning
Children living in peace and harmony
That is the way it will be
