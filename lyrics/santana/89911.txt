Well I told you 'bout your attitude
And it didn't do me any good
'Cause you took your love away
Left me here alone with all this lonely heartache.


There are places I remember
Where the ladies still are tender
Against you they can't compare
Baby we've just got to get it back together.

All I ever wanted was to be with you
All I ever wanted was to be with you.

I just got to get it through to you
That my loving heart is ever true
Please come back to where you belong
Girl you got to know I'll never do you wrong.

All I ever wanted was to be with you
All I ever wanted was to be with you.
Yeah you.
Oh oh.

All I ever wanted was to be with you
All I ever wanted was to be with you.

Well I told you 'bout your attitude
And it didn't do me any good
'Cause you took your love away.

All I ever wanted was to be with you
All I ever wanted was to be with you
All I ever wanted was to be with you
All I ever wanted was to be with you
You!
