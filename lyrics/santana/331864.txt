(Chorus)
I got a man and he's so good to me
I give love and he gives it back to me
Say it for me once if you know what I mean
I said my man's what a man's supposed to be

I got a man and he's so good to me
I give love and and he gives it back to me
Say it for me once if you know what I mean
I said my man's what a man's supposed to be

(Mary Verse 1)

He opens his arms and holds on to me
He tells me he loves me and oh I feel it
And all that I am and all that I'll be
Is there in his eyes when I hear him sayin' please

(Sleepy Pick Up)
Who loves you baby?

(Big Boi Verse 1)
I do, I do trust you
See see this ain't just bout having sex
I don't even have to touch you
But you lustful I'm buggin'
You feel me bulgin' while we huggin'
We all over one another (scattered, covered, smothered)
You're my choosey lover
Never loving others only rubbing me (me)
Satisfy Big to the utmost mentally and physically (ly)
Every king must crown a queen to make his kingdom mean anything
Through thick and slim we gon' win we a team by any means y'all

Chorus (2x)

(Mary Verse 2)
The touch of his hand the sound of his voice
The way that he loves me 'til he knows I feel it
And all through the night forever rejoice
The angel above me starts to sweetly sing to me

(Sleepy Pick Up)
Who loves you baby?

(Big Boi Verse 2)
I do, I do adore you
I'm the best man for the job
Another man couldn't do nothing for you
Cause you're spicy just like me
We come together like thunder and lightning
With all of that scratching and biting
So exciting it's frightening
I'm your do-right man and you're my do right not my just for tonight woman
Making me feel just like a baker quick to put something in your oven
Not no dumplin's or no stuffin' but our own lil' flesh and blood'n
A bouncin' lil' baby something pretty girl or handsome son child

Chorus (2x)

My man's what a man's supposed to be…
I got a man….
