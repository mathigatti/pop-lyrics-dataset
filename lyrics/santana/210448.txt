I am just a mirage
Oh - I am just a mirage
When you look at me
Thru your crystal glass you will see
That I am now your past
But you give your love to me
In your life I wasn't meant to be.
Oh I am just a mirage
Oh I am just a mirage
Just a mirage fading away like water


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I am just a mirage
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I am just a mirage
I am just a mirage
But until that day has come
When you say I'll be your only one
I will live the way it's meant for me
With ups and downs and mystery.
