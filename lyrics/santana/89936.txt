Well, hello, what's your name
Can I take you by the hand
Won't you please come with me
To a place of ecstasy
Paradise by the sun
Girl, I'm sure we'll have some fun
By your eyes I can see
That you want to be with me
I've been waiting for so long
Now that I've found you
Ain't no way I'm gonna let you go


CHORUS:
Let me inside
Open up your heart
Come on and
Let me inside
Open up your heart

Night is clear, moon is bright
Stars are shining everywhere
In my arms you'll be safe
There's no need to be afraid
It's a warm summer night
And the temperature is right
Let your hair hang low
Girl, I want to feel the flow
I've been waiting for so long
Now that I've got you
Ain't no way I'm gonna let you go

CHORUS
