Intro shout

Standing in the doorway
Beneath the moonlit sky
An angel stood before me
And looked me in the eye
Aye aye


Aye aye aye
Aye aye aye
Aye aye aye

She moved up right beside me
And we began to dance
The groove was all around us
The slipped into a trance
Aye aye

Aye aye aye
Aye aye aye
Aye aye aye

Bridge - spanish lyrics
Middle section - african lyrics

Dancing to the rhythm
Moving to the beat
Everybody's singing
You could feel the heat
Aye aye
