I am on the rock and then I check a stock
I have to run like a fugitive to save the life I live
I'm going to be iron like a lion in zion
I'm going to be iron like a lion in zion
Iron lion zion


I'm on the run but I have got no gun
See they want to be the star
So they fighting tribal war
And they saying iron like a lion in zion
Iron like a lion in zion
Iron lion zion

I'm on the rock, running and you running
I take a stock, running like a fugitive
I had to run like a fugitive just to save the life I live
I am going to be iron like a lion in zion
I am going to be iron like a lion in zion

Iron lion zion, iron lion zion, iron lion zion
Iron like a lion in zion, iron like a lion in zion
Iron like a lion in zion
