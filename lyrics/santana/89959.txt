Somebody deceived you,
Your hearts broken into pieces
Right now (I,)
I know how you feel
I'm with you, here for you
I know just what you have been
Through
Ooo, Baby, I know how you feel


But don't forget about tomorrow
Put aside your sorrow
And believe in me
I'm waiting here deep down
Inside you
For my love to guide you
Bring you back to me

Chorus:
I love you, said I love you
Right now!
I need you, said I need you
Right now!
I want you, said I want you
Right now!
I love you, said I love you
Right now!

You sit there pretty baby
Why don't you stop anticipating
Ooh yeah, I want to give love
To you
I'm standing here and waiting
Your tears falling down like
Raindrops
Ooo, I want to give love to you

But don't forget about tomorrow
Put aside your sorrow
And believe in me
I'm waiting here deep down
Inside you
For my turn to guide you
Bring you back to me

Repeat Chorus

When darkness comes
And it surrounds you
There's a light inside you
Let it show the way
No matter how far you have fallen
You can hear the callin'
This is what is said

Repeat Chorus
