I believe in never let my strip get hotter
Than something I can get out of
One that heats up on me
I told 'em this would be a once time dance
Meaning one time chance
After I said that, oh
That's when he got close to me
All the other music stopped but the violin
Conversation, one dance, sip a bottle of the best
Now I'm asking myself "what has he done to me?"


This can't turn into love, no
The rose petals were all in the air
Just might need that firetruck
To come and get me

Dip me in water
'Cause this boy's fire
It's got a hold of me

Can't say I don't want it
'Cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know
If I'm going or coming

Dip me in water
'Cause this boy's fire
It's got a hold of me

Didn't have to know from your body

Put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale, on me

Gotta call a cab
If I don't need gonna have me
With every young stunna in the hood wanna have me
Uh, so much of him I couldn't surrender
'Cause I know where this could end up
And with that right now I can't play
I know I drive him loco
But that's just the way
You make a mama's hips go

This can't turn into love, no
The rose petals were all in the air
Just might need that firetruck
To come and get me

Dip me in water
'Cause this boy's fire
It's got a hold of me

Can't say I don't want it
'Cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know
If I'm going or coming

Dip me in water
'Cause this boy's fire
It's got a hold of me

Didn't have to know from your body
Put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale, on me
