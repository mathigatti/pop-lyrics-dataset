Woke up into a dream
And I was walking
Up and down the streets
Of Cairo


And then I heard a voice
That said I know you
It's time for you to turn
And face me

Her hair was long
Her eyes reached out and touched me
She said I know just
What it is you're after

Death is all around you
So you look for freedom
I know where to find it
Let's go to the river

We sailed upon the Nile
I was enchanted
By the beauty in her magic
She showed me that my fears were unimportant
And then she touched me
With her vision

Her skin was dark
Her voice was liquid fire
She said I am your mate
And soul's desire

Love is all around you
Light is deep within you
Life is always flowing
Let's go down the river
