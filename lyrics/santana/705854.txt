Where you are that's where i
wanna be
And through your eyes, all
the things I wanna see
And in the night, you are my ream
You're everything to me


You're the love of my life
And the breath in my prayers
Take my hand, lead me there
What I need is you here

I can't forget when we are one
From your lips
the Heavens pour out
I can't forget when we are one
With you alone, I am free

Everyday, everynight, you alone
You're the love of my life
Everyday, everynight, you alone
You're the love of my life

We go dancing in the moonlight
With the starlight in your eyes
We go dancing till the sunrise
You and me we're gonna dance,
dance, dance
