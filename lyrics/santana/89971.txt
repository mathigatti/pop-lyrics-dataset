Deeper, Deeper, dig, dig, Deeper, Deeper

Get a little closer
You don't have to be afraid
You have to trust your inner pilot
Don't let it drift away


Dig a little deeper
You gotta get it in your soul
Reach out with your spirit
And let your feelings show

Deeper, Deeper, dig, dig, Deeper, Deeper

You can't deny the feeling
That touches you inside
When you're tired and lonely
You don't have to lose your pride.

Take the time to listen
Stay a little while
Got a song to sing for you
Let the music get you higher, higher.
