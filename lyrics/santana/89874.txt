Got no time for foolin' with you baby
Your stupid game is about to end.
You played it out.
Thought you had it made.
And it looks like someone passed you by again.


I left her standin' in her corner
She told me she was tryin' to find her way.
I've got to leave before I get much older
Cause she ain't moved in nearly forty days.

I've got a woman that's treatin' me better.
She takes her time and she ain't so cruel.
I've got someone to take you over
Your mother ain't so bad,
What happened to you?
