Have you ever lost a love
Drowning in your tears
And you swear your never ever gonna love again
But you're counting all the years


You just live through the day
Trying not to hurt every night
Well there's magic in the blues
Magic that'll make it alright

You just need a little lovin'
Someone holding you
Well the sky is gonna open
And the sun will shine for only you

You just live through the day
Tryin' not to hurt every night
You just need a shot of the magic
Everything is alright
Yeah

Close your eyes pretty baby
Try to sleep a little while
You know I'll be there in the morning
I just wanna make you smile

Cause you live through the day
Tryin' not to hurt every night
Well there's magic in the blues
Everything will be alright

Everything is alright
Everything is alright
Yeah
