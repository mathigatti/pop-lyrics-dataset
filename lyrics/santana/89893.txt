It's been so long since I've seen your face
Yet I know soon I'll have your embrace
I'll be waiting
Waiting just for you
Life keeps afloat and my love grows and grows
You are the lightin'
I'll be wating
Waiting just for you
Oh, it's been a long, long time by
I don't mind
Rhythm deep, to know the earth
Keep waiting, waiting
Waiting just for you
