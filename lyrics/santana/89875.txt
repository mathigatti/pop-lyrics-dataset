Is that you
Your eyes slowly fading?
Is that you
Your mind full of tears?
Is that you
Searching for a good time?
Is that you
Waitin' for all these years?


Chorus:
And I hope you're feelin' better
Yes I hope you're feelin' good
Yes I hope you're feelin' better

Is that you?
Look across the ocean
Is that you
Thinkin nothin' is really there?
Is that you
Waiting for the sunshine?
Is that you
When all you see is glare?

Chorus

Is that you
Who never saw your baby?
Is that you
Who never had a friend?
Is that you
Movin' to a new town?
Is that you
Will di'monds replace your friends?

Chorus
