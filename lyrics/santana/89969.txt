One taste
That ain't so much
You think you'll be safe from her touch


She calls
You can't hide
Your back's to the wall, the wall's on fire

Ooh, when her music starts to play
Ooh, you could dance your life away.

Once it's gotcha, never set you back down
Once it's gotcha, you'll lose your head in the clouds

Sweet dreams
Of her kiss
No heaven could be quite like this

Your love
Runs so strong
You can't get enough, right or wrong

Ooh, when her music starts to play
Ooh, you could dance your life away
