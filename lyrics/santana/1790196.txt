Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, the city of angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
I never worry, now that is a lie
Well, I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry
Well, I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
Well, I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hold me, oh no, no, yeah, yeah
Love me, I say yeah, yeah
(Under the bridge downtown)
(Is where I drew some blood)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
(I could not get enough)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
(Forgot about my love)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
(I gave my life away)
I gave my life away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Away)
No, no, no, yeah, yeah
(Away)
No, no, I say, yeah, yeah
(Away)
Here I stay.
