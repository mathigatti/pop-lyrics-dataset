You got persuasion
I can't help myself
You got persuasion
I can't help myself
Something about you baby
Keeps me from goin' to somebody else


Yeah, any way you want
Now, now baby
You put me in a daze
All the time
Look whacha got for me baby
Like the devil in disguise

Something about you baby
You're one
You're one of a kind

Oh this spell you put on me
Has just outdone me babe
I can't keep the rain from comin down

Look out now
I can't get out from under
But I wouldn't want to
Even if I can

Something about you baby
Make me feel
Make me feel like a man
