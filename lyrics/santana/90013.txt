In this world there is so much anger
Our lives are in danger
We are all living in fears
We've got to stop the tears


Chorus:
Life is for living
So why must we wait
We all need some loving
So then why do we hate?

In South Africa things are still the same
The face of humanity still hasn't changed
People have to fight to live together
And share with one another

Chorus

We can change this to a better place for all
If we listen to others when they call
Give a shoulder to lean on when they fall
Let us bring down the apartheid wall

Innocent people pay with their lives
Cause the truth, it cuts like a knife
Mandela's life is wasted in jail
Raise your voices for freedom

Chorus ( 3 X)

Woza Mandela
Sibizi' Gama Lakho
Woza Mandela
