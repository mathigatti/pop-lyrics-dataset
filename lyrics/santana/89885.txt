Chorus:
Give me life, oh give me love
It's all I need, It's all I ask
I'll give you life, I'll give you love
That's what I need to feel like this


Love was meant to be what you have been to me
Not just a runnin' free
What am I gonna do to make my dreams come true
You're all I need, I feel

(Repeat Chorus)
