You told me in the morning light
The meaning of love has changed
I should've known it
Cause it feels like you're sleeping away
Hold on, little darlin'
How can I make you stay?
Oh no, no, no
No, I never wanna have to say
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Don't make me feel this way
Chill to the bone - I'm all alone
I don't wanna feel this way


Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

My heart is open with a chance you will take it away
And leave me with an empty world
It doesn't have to be this way
Baby, don't go
For love that we made
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I never wanna say
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Don't make me feel this way
Chill to the bone - I'm all alone
I don't wanna feel this way

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
