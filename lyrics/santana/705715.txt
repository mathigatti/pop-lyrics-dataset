All the people I knew 
seem to have become one, and that one is you 
In your hands I find myself 
growing to be near my eternal goal 
You are the sun, air and soil, helping grow 



Life has found a way, at last 
showing me the true light, and that light is you
In your hands I find myself glowing and embracing my eternal goal 
You are the sun, moon and stars, helping glow
