Where you are, is where I wanna be
And through your eyes, all the things I wanna see
And in the night, you are my dream
You're everything to me


You're the love of my life
And the breath in my prayers
Take my hand, lead me there
What i need is you here

I can't forget the taste of your mouth
From your lips all the heavens pour out

I can't forget when we are one
It's you alone and I am free

Everyday, every night, you alone
You're the love of my life
Everyday, every night, you alone,
You're the love of my life

We go dancing in the moonlight
With the starlight in your eyes
We go dancing till the sunrise
You and me we're gonna dance, dance, dance
