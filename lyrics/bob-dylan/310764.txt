Strange things have happened, like never before
My baby told me I would have to go
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong


Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home
No use in worrying, 'cause the world gone wrong
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

I told you, baby, right to your head
If I didn't leave you I would have to kill you dead
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

I tried to be loving and treat you kind
But it seems like you never right, you got no loyal mind
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind
Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

Said, when you been good now, can't do no more
Just tell her kindly: There is the front door
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong
