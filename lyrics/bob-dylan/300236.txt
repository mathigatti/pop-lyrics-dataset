Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To do anything with you
Well I'm walkin' down the road
With my head in my hand
And I'm lookin' for a woman
Who needs a worried man
Just a one kind favor that I'm asking you
Allow me just one more chance


Honey just allow me one more chance
To ride your aeroplane
Honey just allow me one more chance
To ride your passenger train
Well I've been lookin' all over
For a girl like you
I can't find no better so you'll have to do
Just a one kind favor that I'm asking you
Allow me just one more chance

Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To do anything with you
Well I'm lookin' for a woman
That ain't got no man
Is just lookin' for a needle
It's lost in the sand
Just a one kind favor that I'm asking you
Allow me just one more chance

Just a one kind favor that I'm asking you
Allow me just one more chance
