Someday you'll find
That the world's left you out
No true love, no nothing
Just roaming about
Parties and people
And a cold heart within
And each time you're dancing
You're waltzing with sin


You're satan made over
In perfect disguise
Unfaithful, unworthy
And oh so unwise
I pity the heart
Of the next guy you win
Like me you'll be losing
While waltzing with sin

Let's try it again
Some day you'll find
That the world's left you out
No true love, no nothing
Just roaming about

Well, parties and people
And a cold heart within
And each time you're dancing
You're waltzing with sin
You're satan made over
In perfect disguise
Unfaithful, unworthy
And oh so unwise

I pity the heart
Of the next guy you win
Like me you'll be losing
While waltzing with sin.
