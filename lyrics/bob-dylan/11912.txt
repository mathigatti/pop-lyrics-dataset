Mama, take this badge off of me
Cause I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door


Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

Mama, put that gun to the ground
Cause I can't shoot them anymore
There's a long black cloud comin' on down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
