Katie's been gone since the spring time;
She wrote one time'n sent her love.
Katie's been gone for such a long time now.
I wonder what kind of love she's thinkin' of.


Dear Katie,
If you can hear me,
I can't wait to have ya near me.

Oh, Katie, since ya caught that bus,
Well, I just don't know how things are with us.
I'm still here and you're out there.

Katie laughed when I said I was lonely.
She said, There's no need t'feel that way.
Katie said that I was her only one,
But then I wonder why she didn't wanna stay.

Dear Katie, if I'm the only one,
How much longer will you be gone?
Oh, Katie, won't ya tell me straight:
How much longer do I have to wait?

I'll believe you,
But please come through.
I know it's wrong to be apart this long;
You should be here, near me.

Katie's been gone and now her face is slowly fading from my mind.
She's gone to find some newer places,
Left the old life far behind.
Dear Katie, dont ya miss your home?
I dont see why you had to roam.

Dear Katie, since you've been away
I lose a little something every day
I need you here, but you're still out there.
Dear Katie, please drop me a line,
just write, Love, to tell me you're fine.

Oh, Katie, if you can hear me,
I just cant wait to have you near me.
I can only think
Where are you,
What ya do, may be there's someone new.
