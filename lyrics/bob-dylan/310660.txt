Love is a burning thing,
can change into a firy ring.
Bound for wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire.


I fell into a burning ring of fire.
I went down down down
and the flames went higher.
And it burns burns burns,
that ring of fire,
that ring of fire.

They say that love is sweet
when hearts like ours meet.
I fell for you like a child.
Oh but the fire went wild.

I fell into a burning ring of fire.
I went down down down
and the flames went higher.
And it burns burns burns,
that ring of fire,
that ring of fire.

I fell into a burning ring of fire.
I went down down down
and the flames went higher.
And it burns burns burns,
that ring of fire,
that ring of fire.

I fell into a burning ring of fire.
I went down down down
and the flames they went higher.
And it burns burns burns,
that ring of fire,
that ring of fire.
And it burns burns burns,
that ring of fire,
that ring of fire.
