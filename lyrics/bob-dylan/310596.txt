My parents raised me tenderly, I was their only son;
My mind got mixed with wanderin' when I was much too young.
Was just a kid of thirteen years when I first left my home;
Been a long time comin', Ma, I'll be a long time gone.


On a road through south New Mexico, in the dust and rolling sage,
I thought I'd try to find some work, but they said I was young of age.
My eyes, they burned, when I heard, "Go home where you belong."
Been a long time comin' and I'll be a long time gone.

Many times by the highway side I tried to flag a ride.
With bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth, I'd watch the cars roll by.
In the empty air, my only guide, I traveled on alone,
Been a long time comin' and I'll be a long time gone.

You might see me on your crossroads, when I'll be passing through,
And dream you'll one day follow as I drift beyond your view,
Destined for a journey that will never lead me home-
Been a long time comin' and I'll be a long time gone.

If I could help one drifter on this long, relentless road,
I'd warn him of its random ways and the dangers it might hold,
But I know I ain't no prophet and I ain't no prophet's son-
Just a long time comin' and I'll be a long time gone.

So you can have your beauty when skin-deep, it only lies,
And you can have your youthhood, it will fade before your eyes.
When my roving days are through, just carve upon my stone:
"Been a long time comin' and I'll be a long time gone."
