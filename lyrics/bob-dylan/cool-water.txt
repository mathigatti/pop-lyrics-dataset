And I’m a fool
Each star’s a pool of water, cool clear water.
But with the dawn I’ll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear water.


The shadows sway and seem to say,
“Tonight we pray for water,
Cool, clear water.”
And way up there he’ll hear our prayer
And show us where there’s water,
Cool, clear water.

Keep a-movin’, dan, don’t you listen to him, dan
He’s a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can you see that big green tree
Where the water’s running free
And it’s waiting there for you and me.
Cool, clear water.

Dan’s feet are sore, he’s yearning for
Just one thing more than water
Cool, clear water.
Like me, I guess, he’d like to rest
Where there’s no quest for water
Cool, clear water
