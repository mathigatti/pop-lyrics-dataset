Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, hut-hut
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, hut-hut


Took a walk and passed your house
Late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn
Way down tight
From within, a dim light cast
Two silhouettes on the shade
Oh, what a lovely couple they ma-ade

Put his arms around your waist
Held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste
In the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy
Whose silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eye-eyes

Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Ty-oh, oh-oh
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Ty-oh, oh-oh

Lost control and rang your bell
I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat
Down your door
When two strangers who had been
Two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock
Your on the wrong blo-ock

Rushed down to your house with wings
On my feet
Loved you like I never loved
You my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be
Two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days
Two silhouettes on the sha-ade

Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Ty-oh, oh-oh
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Ty-oh, oh-oh
Two silhouettes on the shade
Silhouettes
