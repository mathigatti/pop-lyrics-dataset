They say everything can be replaced, 
That every distance is not near,
So I remember every face,
Of every man who's put me here.
Chorus: 
I see my light come shining,      
From the west unto the east.
Any day now, any way now,                                   I shall be released. 
They say every man needs protection,
That every man must rise and fall.
Yet I swear I see my reflection,
Somewhere so high above this wall.


**Chorus

Yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
A man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
He's crying out that he was framed.

**Chorus
Any day now, any way now,
I shall be released
