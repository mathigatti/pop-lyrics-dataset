Well there's two trains running
And they're running this way
One leaves at midnight
The other at the break of day
At the break of day
At the break of day
Oh lordy


I've been troubled, I've been a fool
I've been crazy my whole life
Well, I done fell in love
With another man's wife
With another man's wife
Oh, lordy

I'm gonna find me a woman
Who shines like a morning star
I'm gonna find me a woman
Ride like a Cadillac car
Ride like a Cadillac car
Ride like a Cadillac car
Oh, lordy
Oh, lordy

Well I'm afraid of everybody
And I can't trust myself
Well, the woman I love has
Put me on top of the shelf
Put me on top of the shelf
Put me on top of the shelf
Oh, lordy
Oh, lordy

Well ther's two trains running
And they're running this way
One leaves at midnight
Other at the break of day
At the break of day
At the break of day
At the break of day
