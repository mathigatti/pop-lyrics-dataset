When first I came to Louisville
Some pleasure there to find
I met a maid from Lexington
Whose beauty filled my mind.
Her rosy cheeks her ruby lips
Like arrows pierced my breast
And the name she bore was Fora, the lily of the west.


I courted lovely Flora
She promised ne'er to go.
But she turned unto another man
Which filled my heart with woe.
She robbed me of my liberty, 
deprived me of my rest..
Then go you faithless Flora, the lily of the west

I stepped up to my rival
My dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar
And I boldly bade him stand.
All in my desperation
I pierced him in the breast
I killed a man for Flora, the lily of the west.

I had to stand my trial
I had to make my plea
They placed me in the prisoners box
And then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away
Deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora, the lily of the west.
