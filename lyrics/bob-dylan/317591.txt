Well, I'm gonna get you a sally gal,
I'm gonna get you a sally gal,
I'm gonna get you a sally gal,
I'm gonna get you a sally gal.
Well, I'm just one of them ramblin' men,
Ramblin' since I don't know know when.
Here I come and I'm a-gone again.
Sally says I got no end


I'm gonna get you a sally gal,
I'm gonna get you a sally gal,
I'm gonna get you a sally gal,
I'm gonna get you a sally gal

Well, that long ol' train 'round the road,
Sally says I'm bound to go.
If Sally says I'm bound to go,
Sally, she ought to know

I'm gonna get you a sally gal,
I'm gonna get you a sally gal,
I'm gonna get you a sally gal.

I'm gonna get you a sally gal
