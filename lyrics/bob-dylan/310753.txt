When did you leave heaven?
How could they let you go?
How's every thing in heaven?
I'd like to know


Why did you trade heaven?
For all these earthly things?
Where on earth did you hide your halo?
Where did you lose your wings?

Have they missed you?
Can you get back in?
If I kiss you would it be a sin?
I am only human
But you are so divine
When did you leave heaven
Angel mine?
