I'm a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye to Colorado
Where I was born and partly raised


Your mother says I'm a stranger
My face you'll never see no more
But there's one promise, darling
I'll see you on Gods golden shore

Through this open world I'm a-bound to ramble
Through ice and snows, sleet and rain
I'm a-bound to ride that mornin' railroad
Perhaps I'll die on that train

I'm going back to Colorado
The place that I've started from
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me
Honey I never would have come
