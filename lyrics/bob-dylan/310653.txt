I've been around this whole country
But I never yet found fennario


Well, as we marched down
As we marched down
Well, as we marched down to fennario
Well, our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
Her name that she had was pretty Peggy-o

Well, what will your mother say
What will your mother say
What will your mother say, pretty Peggy-o
What will your mother say
To know you're going away
You're never, never, never coming back-o?

Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs, pretty peggy-o
Come a-running down your stairs
Comb back your hair
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-o

The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone, pretty Peggy-o
The lieutenant he has gone
Long gone
He's a-riding down in texas with the rodeo

Well, our captain he is dead
Our captain he is dead
Our captain he is dead, pretty Peggy-o
Well, our captain he is dead
Died for a maid
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-o
