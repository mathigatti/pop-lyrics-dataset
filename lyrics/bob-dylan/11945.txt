Your Breath is sweet, your eyes are like
Two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not me but to the stars above


One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee for I go
To the valley below

Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick an choose
And how to throw the blade
And he oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food

Your sister sees the future
Like your moma and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure know no limits
Your voice is like a meadow larks
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee for I go
To the valley below
