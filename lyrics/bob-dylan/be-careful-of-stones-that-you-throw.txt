A tongue can accuse or carry bad news
The seeds of destruction it will sow
So unless you have made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw
My neighbor was passin' my garden one time
She smiled and I knew right away
That it was gossip not flowers that she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say


"That bad girl down the street
She should be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot
She knows not to speak to my child nor to me."
My neighbor then smiled and I thought
A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of destruction it will sow.
So unless you have made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw

A car speeded by, the screamin' of brakes
A sound that made my blood chill
For if my neighbor's one child
Hadn't been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl I love still
Her child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
"Oh, who was that brave girl so sweet?"
I covered the crushed broken body and said
"That bad girl down the street."

A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of destruction were sown
So unless you have made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you, you throw
