Maybe I'm right and maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak and maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you


Maybe I'll win and maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance
The terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start
Then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live the life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Maybe I'll live the life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
