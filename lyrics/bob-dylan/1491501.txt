If you ever go to Houston
Better walk right
Keep your hands in your pockets
And your gun belt tight


If you're asking for trouble
If you're looking for a fight
If you ever go to Houston
Boy, you better walk right

If you're ever down there
On back near Lamar
You better watch out for
The man with the shining star

Better know where you're going
Or stay where you are
If you're ever down there
On back near Lamar

Well, I know these streets
I've been here before
I nearly got killed here
During the Mexican War

Something always
Keeps me coming back for more
I know these streets
I've been here before

If you ever go to Dallas
Say hello to Mary Ann
Say I'm still looking along the trigger
Hanging on the best I can

If you see her sister Lucy
Say I'm sorry I'm not there
Tell her other sister Nancy
To pray the sinner's prayer

I got a restless fever
Burning in my brain
Gotta keep right forward
Can't spoil the game

The same way I'll leave here
Will be the way that I came
Got a restless fever
Burning in my brain

Mister policeman
Can you help me find my gal?
Last time I saw her
Was at the Magnolia Motel

If you help me find her
You can be my pal
Mister policeman
Can you help me find my gal?

If you ever go to Austin
Fort Worth or San Anton'
Find the barrooms I got lost in
And send my memories home

Put my tears in a bottle
Screw the top on tight
If you ever go to Houston
Buddy, you'd better walk right
