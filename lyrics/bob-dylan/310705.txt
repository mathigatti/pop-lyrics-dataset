I have heard rumors all over town,
They say that you're planning to put me down.
All I would like you to do, Is tell me that it isn't true.


They say that you've been seen with some other man,
That he's tall, dark and handsome, and you're holding his hand.
Darlin', I'm a-countin' on you,
Tell me that it isn't true.

To know that some other man is holdin' you tight,
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.

All of those awful things that I have heard,
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
So darlin', you better come through,
Tell me that it isn't true.

All of those awful things that I have heard,
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
So darlin', I'm countin' on you,
Tell me that it isn't true.
