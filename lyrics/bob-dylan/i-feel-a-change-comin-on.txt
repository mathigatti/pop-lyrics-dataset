Well, I'm looking the world over
Looking far off into the east
And I see my baby coming
She's walking whith the village priest


I feel a change comin' on
And the last part of the days
already gone

We got so much in common
We strive for the same old ends
And I just can't wait
Wait for us to become friends

I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already
gone

Well, life is for love
And They say that love is blind
If you wanna live easy
Baby, pack your clothes with mine

I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already
gone

Well,now what's the use of dreaming'?
You got better thing to do
Dreams never did work for me anyway
Even when they did come true

You are as whorish as ever
Baby, you can't start a fire
I must be losin' my mind
You're the object of my desire

I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already
gone

I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver
And I'm reading James Joyce
Some people, they tell me
I've got the blood of the land in my voice

Everybody got all the money
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes
Everybody got all the flowers
I don't have one single rose

I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already
gone
