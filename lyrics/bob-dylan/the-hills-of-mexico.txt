’Twas in the town of griffin
In the year of sixty-five
A well known famous drover
Stepped up to me and talked
Sayin’ "how do you do, young cowboy
And how’d you like to go
Spend the summer pleasantly
In the hills of mexico"

Well, me being out of work right then
To this drover I did say
"Well, this going out on the buffalo range
Depends on your pay
But if you pay good wages
Transportation to and fro
I think I might go with you
To the hills of mexico"

Well, we crossed the river, boys
Our troubles they begun
Lightening, flashlight, hell-fire
Had made the cattle run
I tread towards the hiding place
Comanches waiting to pick us off
On the hills of mexico
