How'd ya like to spend Christmas
On Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to spend the holiday
Away across the sea?
How'd ya like to spend Christmas
On Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to hang a stocking
On a great big coconut tree?


How'd ya like to stay up late
Like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail
In with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas
On Christmas Island
You will never stray for everyday
Your Christmas dreams come true

How'd ya like to stay up late
Like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail
In with your presents
In a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas
On Christmas Island
You will never stray
For everyday
Your Christmas dreams
Come true
On Christmas Island
Your dreams come true
