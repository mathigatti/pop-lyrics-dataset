I could have told you
She'd hurt you
She'd love you a while
Then desert you
If only you'd asked
I could have told you so


I could have saved you
Some crying
Yes, I could have told you she's lying
But you were in love
And didn't want to know

I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises she'll never keep
And soon it's over and done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so

I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises she'll never keep
And soon it's over and done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so
