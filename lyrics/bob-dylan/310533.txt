Mary wore three links of chain
Every link was Jesus name
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on


Mary, Mark and Luke and John
All them prophets so good and gone
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on

Well I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Streets up there are lined with gold
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on

Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
