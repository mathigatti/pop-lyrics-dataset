I got this graveyard woman
You know she keeps my kid
But my soulful mama
You know she keeps me hid
She's a junkyard angel
And she always gives me bread
Well, if I go down dyin'
You know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed


Well, when the pipeline gets broken
And I'm lost on the river bridge
I'm cracked up on the highway
And on the water's edge
She comes down the thruway
Ready to sew me up with thread
Well, if I go down dyin'
You know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

Well, she don't make me nervous
She don't talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley
And she don't need no crutch
She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead
Well, if I go down dyin'
You know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

Well, you know
I need a steam shovel mama
To keep away the dead
I need a dump truck mama
To unload my head
She brings me everything and more
And just like I said
Well, if I go down dyin'
You know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed
