The falling leaves
Drift by my window
The falling leaves
Of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses


The sunburned hands
I used to hold
Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song

But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall
Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear

Old winter's song
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall
