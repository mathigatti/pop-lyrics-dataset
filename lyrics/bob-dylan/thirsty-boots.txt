You've long been on the open road
You've been sleepin in the rain
From the dirty words and muddy cells
Your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and muddy cells
Will soon be hid in shame
So only stop to rest yourself
Till you'll go off again


So take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
Maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes

But tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plain from field to town
A-marching to be free
And of the rusted prison gates
That tumbled by degree
Like laughing children one by one
Who looked like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
Maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down
The crooked rainbow trails
From dancing cliff-edged shattered sills
Of slender shackled jails
But the voices drift up from below
As the walls they're being scaled
All of this and more
Your song shall not be failed

So take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
Maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes
