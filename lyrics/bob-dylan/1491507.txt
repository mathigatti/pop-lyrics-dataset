Talk about me babe, if you must
Throw on the dirt, pile on the dust
I'd do the same thing if I could
You know what they say, they say it's all good
All good, it's all good


Big politicians telling lies
Restaurant kitchen, all full of flies
Don't make a bit of difference
Don't see why it should
But it's all right, 'cause it's all good
It's all good, it's all good

Wives are leaving their husbands, they're beginning to roam
They leave the party, and they never get home
I wouldn't change it, even if I could
You know what they say man, it's all good
It's all good, all good

Brick by brick they tear you down
A teacup of water is enough to drown
You oughta know if they could, they would
Whatever going down, it's all good
All good, say it's all good

People in the country, people on the land
Some of 'em so sick, they can hardly stand
Everybody would move away, if they could
It's hard to believe, but it's all good, yeah

The widows cry, the orphans plea
Everywhere you look there's more misery
Come along with me babe, I wish you would
You know what I'm saying, it's all good
All good, I said it's all good, all good

A cold blooded killer stalking the town
Cop cars blinking, something bad going down
Buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood
But there's nothing to worry about, 'cause it's all good
It's all good, I say it's all good, whoo

I'm gonna pluck off your beard and blow it in your face
This time tomorrow I'll be rolling in your place
I wouldn't change a thing, even if I could
You know what they say, they say it's all good
It's all good, oh yeah
