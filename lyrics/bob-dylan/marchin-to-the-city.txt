Well I'm sitting in church
In an old wooden chair
I knew nobody
Would look for me there
Sorrow and pity
Rule the earth and the skies
Looking for nothing
Anyone's eyes


Once I had pretty girls
Did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
Snowflakes are falling
Around my head
Lord have mercy

It feel heavy like lead
I been hit too hard
Seen too much
Nothing can heal me now
But your touch
Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city

And the road ain't long
Loneliness
Got a mind of its own
The more people around
The more you feel alone
I'm chained to the earth
Like a silent slave
Trying to break free

Out of death's dark cave
Once I had a pretty girl
Done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
Boys in the street
Beginning to play
Girls like birds

Flying away
I'm carrying the roses
That were given to me
And I'm thinking about paradise
Wondering what it might be
Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Go over to london
Maybe gay paree
Follow the river
You get to the sea
I was hoping we could drink from
Life's clear streams
I was hoping we could dream
Life's pleasant dreams
Once I had a pretty girl
But she done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city

And the road ain't long
Well the weak get weaker
And the strong stay strong
The train keeps rolling
All night long
She looked at me
With an irresistable glance
With a smile

That could make all the planets dance
Once I had a pretty girl
She did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
My house is on fire
Burning to the skies
I thought the rain clouds
But the clouds passed by

When I'm gone
You'll remember my name
I'm gonna win my way
To wealth and fame
Once I had a pretty girl
But she did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long
I don't know
