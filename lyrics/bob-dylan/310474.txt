In the lonely night 
In the shadows of a pale moonlight 
I think of you in black and white 
When we were made of dreams.
I walk alone through the shakin' street, 
I'm a-listenin' to my heart beat 
In the record breaking heat 
Where we were born in time.


Not one more night, not one more kiss, 
Not this time, I'll have no more of this. 
It's much too cruel, it's much too cool, way too revealing. 
You came, you saw, just like the law 
You married young, just like your ma, 
Oh babe, how you left me reelin' with this feelin'.
Up on the rising curve 
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve, 
I held you close and got what I deserve 
Where we were born in time.

You pressed me once, pressed me twice, 
You hang the flame, but you'll pay the price. 
Oh babe, and that fire is still smokin'. 
You were snow, you were rain 
You were striped, lord and you were plain, 
Oh babe, truer words have never been spoken or broken.
In the hills of mystery, 
In the foggy web of destiny, 
You can have what's left of me, 
Where we were born in time.
