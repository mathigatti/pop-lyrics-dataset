I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
I overlooked that point completely
Until the big affair began


Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl I'd found

Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl
The one girl I'd found

My boiling point is much too low
For me to try to be a fly Lothario
