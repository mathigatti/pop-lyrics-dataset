I've seen love go by my door
It's never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
Been shootin' in the dark too long
If something's not right it's wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go


Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known careless love
It always has hit me from below
But this time it's more correct
Right on target so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Purple clover Queen Anne lace
Crimson hair across your face
You can make me cry if you don't know
Can't remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoiling me too much love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could spend forever with you and never realise the time

Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud
But there's no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking to

I'll look for you in old Honolula
San Francisco, Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now I know
But I'll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
