How long can I stay
In this nowhere caf√© 'fore night turns into day
I wonder why I'm so frightened of dawn
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on


There's a moment when
All old things become new again
But that moment might have come and gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on

I look away but I keep seeing it
I don't want to believe but I keep believing it
Shadows dance upon the wall
Shadows that seem to know it all

Am I too blind to see
Is my heart playing tricks on me
I'm lost in the crowd, all my tears are gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on

Everything I touch seems to disappear
Everywhere I turn, you are always here
I'll run this race until my earthly death
I'll defend this place with my dying breath

From a cheerless room
In a curtain gloom, I saw a star from Heaven fall
I turned and looked again but it was gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on
