I'm beginnin' to hear voices and there's no one around
Well I'm all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday, she passed by
Well my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
Well, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist
It's almost like, almost like I don't exist.
I'm twenty miles out of town, Cold Irons bound.


Well, the walls of pride, well they're high and they're wide
Can't see over to the other side
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay
But it's sadder still to feel your heart turn away.
One look at you and I'm out of control
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
I'm twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound.

There's too many people, too many to recall
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside mud
Up over my head, nothing but clouds of blood.
I found my world, found my world in you
But your love just hasn't proved true.
I'm twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound
Twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound.

Well the winds in Chicago ah, they torn me to shreds
Reality has always had too many heads
I tried to love and protect you because I care
I'm gonna remember forever the joy we've shared
I'm looking at you and I'm on my bended knee
You've no idea what you did to me
I'm twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound
Twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound.
