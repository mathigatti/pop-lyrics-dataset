One man's loss always is another man's gain

Let's take a cherry, I can't make it no more
Can't stop, she's breaking all time on the floor
Better come down easy or don't come down at all
You don't try and to please me, somebody's gonna fall
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain


Eight o'clock in the morning, better step aside
Let me be to your warning, you better go by
Three times a loser, number 45
Better not lose her, best stayed alive
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain

Wish I'd have found me at the wall
One look at the watch, you better lord at all
You can't stop it or wait it at night
Too hard to keep you waiting, calls me aside
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain
