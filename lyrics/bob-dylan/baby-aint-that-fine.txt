The bells are golden chimes
The sun is going to shine
Before this heart of mine


Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine
Hey, la la la
Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine

I get a little bit tingle up and down my spine
I every time you say you're mine
You're gonna be my baby
I'm a-gonna be your guy
We're gonna cook some lovin'
It's a-gonna sizzle and fry

Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine
Baby ain't that fine
