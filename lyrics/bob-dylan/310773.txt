You're gonna quit me, baby,
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd.
Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd.
Good as I been to you.


Give you my money, honey,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lawd, Lawd.

You're gonna quit me, baby,
Put me outta doors, Lawd, Lawd.

Six months on the chain gang,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lawd, Lawd.

Day you quit me, baby,
That's the day you die, Lawd, Lawd.

Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lawd, Lawd.

Day you quit me, baby,
That's the day you die, Lawd, Lawd.
