Well, I wandered again to my home in the mountain 
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free 
I looked for my friends but I never could find them 
Ev'rybody I met was a rank stranger to me. 


Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger 
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see 
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces 
Ev'rybody I met, rank strangers to me. 

"Well, they all moved away" said the voice of a stranger 
"To some beautiful home on that bright, crystal sea" 
Some beautiful day, well, I'll meet 'em in heaven 
Where no one will be a stranger to me. 

Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger 
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see 
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces 
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
