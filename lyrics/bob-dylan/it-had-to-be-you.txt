Why do I do just as you say
Why must I just give you your way
Why do I sigh, why don't I try to forget


It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying, "I have to wait"
I saw them all, just couldn't fall till we met
It had to be you, it had to be you

I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss but they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you

For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you
