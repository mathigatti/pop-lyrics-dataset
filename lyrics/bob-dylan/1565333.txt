Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down
Santa Claus Lane


Vixen, Blitzen
And all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing
Children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings
And say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus
Comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down
Santa Claus Lane

He's got a bag
That's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells
Jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed
Cover up your head
'Cause Santa Claus
Comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down
Santa Claus Lane

He doesn't care
If you're rich or poor
He loves you just the same
Santa knows
That we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts
With Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus
Comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down
Santa Claus Lane

He'll come around
When the church rings out
It's Christmas morn again
Peace on Earth
Will come to all
If we
Just follow the light
So fill you hearts 
With the christmass cheers
'Cause Santa Claus
Comes tonight
'Cause Santa Claus
Comes tonight

Peace on Earth
Will come to all
If we
Just follow the light
Let's give thanks
To the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus
Comes tonight
'Cause Santa Claus
Comes tonight

Let's give thanks
To the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus
Comes tonight
Tonight
Tonight
