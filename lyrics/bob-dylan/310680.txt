1. Was in the summer,
One early fall,
Just tryin' to find my
Little all and all
Now she's gone,
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.


2. Was in the spring,
One summer's day.
Just when she left me,
She gone to stay.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

3. Now don't come runnin'
Holdin' up your hand.
Can get me a woman
Quick as you can get a man.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

4. Happen for days,
Didn't know your name.
Oh, why should I worry
Or crave you in vain?
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

5. Went to the station,
Down in the yard,
Gonna get me a freight train,
Work's done got hard.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

6. The lonesome days,
They have gone by,
Why should I beg you?
You said good-bye.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.
