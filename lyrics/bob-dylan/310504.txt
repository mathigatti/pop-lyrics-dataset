Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til someone will let me ride
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til someone will let me ride
If I can't find my baby I'm gonna run away and hide


Well, I been pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back
Pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back
Well, I been praying for salvation
Laying round in a one-room country shack

Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed
'Til there's nothing left to see
'Til the chains have been shattered and I been freed

But I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above
Rolling through the rain and hail
Looking for the sunny side of love

Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
I keep on walking 'til I hear her holler out my name
