Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha 
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
Honey, we could be in Kansas 
By time the snow begins to thaw 
They say the darkest hour 
Is right before the dawn 
They say the darkest hour 
Is right before the dawn 
But you wouldn't know it by me
Every day's been darkness since you been gone. 
Little rooster crowin' 
There must be something on his mind 
Little rooster crowin' 
There must be something on his mind 
Well, I feel just like that rooster 
Honey, ya treat me so unkind 
The birds are flyin' low babe 
Honey I feel so exposed 
Well, the birds are flyin' low babe 
Honey I feel so exposed 
Well now, I ain't got any matches 
And the station doors are closed 
Well, I struggled through barbed wire 
Felt the hail fall from above 
Well, I struggled through barbed wire 
Felt the hail fall from above 
Well, you know I even outran the hound dogs 
Honey, you know I've earned your love 
Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship 
Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship 
Ain't that just like my heart, babe 
When you kissed my lips?
