I crossed the Rubicon on the 14th day 
of the most dangerous month of the year
At the worst time at the worst place 
That’s all I seem to hear
I got up early so I could greet the Goddess of the Dawn
I painted my wagon, I abandoned all hope 
And I crossed the Rubicon


The Rubicon is the Red River
Going gently as she flows
Redder then your ruby lips 
And the blood that flows from the rose
Three miles north of purgatory 
One step from the great beyond
I prayed to the cross and I kissed the girls
And I crossed the Rubicon

What are these dark days I see 
In this world so badly bent?
How can I redeem the time 
The time so idly spent
How much longer can it last
HHow long can this go on
I embraced my love put down my head 
And I crossed the Rubicon

I feel the bones beneath my skin 
And they’re tremblin’ with rage
I’ll make your wife a widow 
You’ll never see old age
Show me one good man in sight 
That the sun shines down upon
I pawned my watch and I paid my debts 
And I crossed the Rubicon

Put my heart upon the hill 
Where some happiness I’ll find
If I survive then let me love 
Let the hour be mine
Take the high road 
Take the low, take the one you’re on
I poured the cup and I passed it along 
And I crossed the Rubicon

You defiled the most lovely flower 
In all of womanhood
Others can be tolerant 
Others can be good
I’ll cut you up with a crooked knife 
And I’ll miss you when you’re gone
I stood between heaven and earth 
And I crossed the Rubicon

You won’t find any happiness here 
No happiness or joy
Go back to the gutter and try your luck 
Find you some nice young pretty boy
Tell me how many men I need 
And who I can count upon
I strapped my belt and buttoned my coat 
And I crossed the Rubicon

I feel the Holy Spirit inside 
And see the light that freedom gives
I believe it’s within the reach 
Of everyman who lives
Keep as far away as possible 
It’s darkest ‘fore the dawn
I turned the key and I broke it off 
And I crossed the Rubicon

Mona Baby, are you still in my mind
I truly believe that you are
Couldn’t be anybody else but you 
Who’s come with me this far
The killing frost is on the ground 
And the autumn leaves are gone
I lit the torch and I looked to the east 
And I crossed the Rubicon
