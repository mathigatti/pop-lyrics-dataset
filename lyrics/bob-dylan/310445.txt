Now and then there's a fool such as I
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you are gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.


Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you happened to be untrue
I am a fool but I love you, dear, yes I will until the day I die.
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.

Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you are gone, when you are gone, I will dream a little
I will dream as years go by
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.

Now and then there's a fool, a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I am a fool, yes, but I love you dear, I will love you dear
Till the day, till the day I die
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I.
