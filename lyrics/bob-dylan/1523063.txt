I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land
In Dixie Land where i was born
Early on one frosty morn
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land
I wish I was in Dixie
Away, away
In Dixie Land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie
In Dixie Land where i was born
Early on one frosty morn
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land
I wish I was in Dixie
Away, away
In Dixie Land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie
