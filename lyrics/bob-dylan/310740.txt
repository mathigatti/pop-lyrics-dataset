Up on Cripple Creek 
When I get off of this mountain
You know where I want to go
Straight down the Mississippi river
To the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana
Little Bessie, a girl that I once knew
And she told me just to come on by
anything she could do
{Refrain}
Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
Good luck had just stung me
To the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win
on another to show
Odds were in my favor
I had him five to one
When that nag to win came around the track
Sure enough he had won
{Refrain}
I took up all of my winnings
And I gave my little Bessie half
And she tore it up and blew it in my face
Just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world
I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine
Dips her doughnut in my tea
{Refrain}
Now me and my mate were back at the shack


We had Spike Jones on the box

She said, "I can't take the way he sings

But I love to hear him talk"



Now that just gave my heart a fall

To the bottom of my feet

And I swore as I took another pull

My Bessie can't be beat



{Refrain}



Now, it's hot in California

And up north it's freezing cold

And this living off the road

Is getting pretty old



So I guess I'll call up my big mama

Tell her I'll be rolling in

Bet you know, deep down, I'm kinda tempted

To go and see my Bessie again



{Refrain}
