I'm searching for phrases,
To sing your praises,
I need to tell someone,
It's soon after midnight,
And my day has just begun.


A gal named Holly,
Took my money,
She was passing by,
It's soon after midnight,
And the moon is in my eye.

My heart is cheerful,
It's never fearful,
I've been down on the killing floors,
I'm in no great hurry,
I'm not afraid of your fury,
I've faced stronger wars than yours.

Charlotte the Harlot,
Dresses in scarlet,
Mary dresses in mink,
It's soon after midnight,
And I've got a date with a fairy queen.

They chirp and they chatter,
What does it matter,
The laugh and dine and never love,
2 timing slim
Who's ever heard of him,
I'll drag his corpse through the mud.

It's now or never,
More than ever,
When I meet ya I did'nt think you'd do,
It's soon after midnight,
And I don't want nobody but you.
