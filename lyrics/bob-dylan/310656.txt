Well, you can read out your Bible
You can fall down on your knees
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama
But it ain't gonna do no good


You're gonna need
You're gonna need my help someday
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'
Please quit your low down ways

I’ve been looking all over
For a girl like you
I can’t find no one, no when, no how
Pretty mama, so you have to do

You're gonna need
You're gonna need my help someday
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'
Please quit your low down ways

And i woke up this morning, and i look out my door
I can tell my mill caw, pretty mama
But the way she lows, if you seen my mill caw lord, lord, travel home
I ain’t had no milk bottle since my caw been gone

Babe you’ve been ramblin’ from miles around
I know you’ve been meting another man
In another man’s house, in another man’s hometown

You're gonna need
You're gonna need my help someday
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'
Please quit your low down ways

So, you can read out your handbook
You can fall down on your knees
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama
But it ain't gonna do no good

You're gonna need
You're gonna need my help someday
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'
Please quit your low down ways
