Up in the mornin', out on a job,
Work like the devil for my pay.
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do,
But roll around heaven all day.
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids,
Wheat till I'm wrinkled and gray


While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do,
But roll around heaven all day.
Good lord up above, can't you hear me cryin'?
Tears all in my eyes.
Send in a cloud with your silvery linin',
Lift me to paradise

Oh, show me that river, take me across,
Wash all my troubles away.
Like that lucky old sun, gimme nothin' to do,
But roll around heaven all day.
Like that lucky old sun, gimme nothin' to do,
But roll around heaven all day.
