Well, you're coming down
High street walking in the sun
You make a dead man rise
And holler she's the one


Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen

Well, it's a long old highway that don't ever end
I got a Saturday Night Special, I'm back again
I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line
You probably don't know but I'm gonna make you mine

Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you is the queen

I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm moving along
People think they know, but they're all wrong
You're something nice, I'm gonna bet my dice
I can't say I haven't paid the price

Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you is the queen

Well, I found out the hard way, I've had my fill
You can't fight somebody with his back to a hill
Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark
If you hold me in your arms, things don't look so dark

Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen
