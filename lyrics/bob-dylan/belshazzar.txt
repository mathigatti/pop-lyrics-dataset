Well, the bible tells us about a man
Who ruled babylon and all it's land
Around the city
Well, the bible tells us about a man
Who ruled babylon and all it's land
Around the city, he built a wall
Declared that babylon would never fall


He had and wives
He called his babylon paradise
On his throne he drank and ate
But for belshezaar it was gettin' late
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided, it could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
Praised the false gods of their time
Holy things they scorned and mocked
Suddenly all their mocking stopped
For on the wall, there appeared a hand
Nothin' else, there was no man
In blood the hand began to write
And belshezaar couldn't hide his fright

He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided, it could not stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand
Well, no one around could understand
Just what was written by this mystic hand
Belshezaar tried, he couldn't find
A man who could give him some peace of mind

Daniel, the prophet, a man of God
He saw the writing on the wall in blood
Belshezaar asked him what it said
And daniel turned to the wall and read
You are weighed in the balance and found wanting
Your kingdom is divided, it cannot stand
You are weighed in the balance and found wanting
Your houses are built upon the sand
