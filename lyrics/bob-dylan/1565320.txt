The jingle bells are jingling
The streets
Aare white with snow
The happy crowds are mingling
But there's no one that I know


I'm sure that you'll forgive me
If I don't enthuse
I guess
I've got the Christmas blues

I've done my window shopping
There's not a store I've missed
But what's the use of stopping
When there's no one on your list

You'll know the way I'm feeling
When you love and you lose
I guess
I've got the Christmas blues

When somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Christmas is a joy of joy
But friends when you're lonely
You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls
And little boys

May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But 'til it's January
I'll just go and disappear
Oh Santa
May have brought you
Some stars for your shoes

But Santa only brought me
The blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered
Christmas blues

Oh Santa
May have brought you
Some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me
The blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered
Christmas blues
