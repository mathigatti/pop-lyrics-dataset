Well, the comic book and me
Just us, we caught the bus
The poor little chauffeur, though
She was back in bed
On the very next day, with a nose full of pus
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread


It's a one-track town
Just brown, and a breeze, too
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're headin' out
For Wichita in a pile of fruit
Get the loot, don't be slow
We're gonna catch a trout
Get the loot, don't be slow
We're gonna catch a trout
Get the loot, don't be slow
We're gonna catch a trout

Now, pull that drummer out
From behind that bottle
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells
Take me down to California, baby
Take me down to California, baby
Take me down to California, baby

Yes, the comic book and me
Just us, we caught the bus
The poor little chauffeur, though
She was back in bed
On the very next day, with a nose full of pus
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
