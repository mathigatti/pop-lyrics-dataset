Oh all the money
that in my whole life I did spend
Be it mine right or wrongfully
I let it slip gladly
past the hands of my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully
But the bottles are done
We've killed each one
And the table's full and overflowed
And the corner sign
Says it's closing time
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road


Oh ev'ry girl that ever l've touched
I did not do it harmfully
And ev'ry girl that ever I've hurt
I did not do it knowin'ly
But to remain as friends and make amends
You need the time and stay behind
And since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past
I'll bid farewell and be down the line

Oh ev'ry foe that ever I faced
The cause was there before we came
And ev'ry cause that ever I fought
I fought it full without regret or shame
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Must meet the dawn
And if I see the day
I'd only have to stay
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone

Oh, ev'ry thought that's strung a knot in my mind
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung
But it's not to stand naked
under unknowin' eyes
It's for myself and my friends
my stories are sung
But the time ain't tall
Yet on time you depend
and no word is possessed
By no special friend
And though the line is cut
It ain't quite the end
I'll just bill farewell till we meet again

Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract, and bother me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me
But if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
So I'll make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn
