[Chorus:] 
This land is your land, this land is my land 
From California, to the New York Island 
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters 
This land was made for you and me 


As I was walking a ribbon of highway 
I saw above me an endless skyway 
I saw below me a golden valley 
This land was made for you and me 

[Chorus] 

I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps 
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts 
And all around me a voice was sounding 
This land was made for you and me 

[Chorus] 

The sun comes shining as I was strolling 
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling 
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting 
This land was made for you and me 

[Chorus] 

As I was walkin' - I saw a sign there 
And that sign said - no tress passin' 
But on the other side... it didn't say nothin! 
Now that side was made for you and me! 

[Chorus] 

In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple 
Near the relief office - I see my people 
And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin' 
If this land's still made for you and me. 

[Chorus 2x]
