In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You're comin' thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams


You're blowing down the shaky street
You're hearing my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
Where we were born in time

Not one more night, not one more kiss
Not this time, baby, no more of this
Takes too much skill, takes too much will
It's revealing
You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma
You tried and tried, you made me slide
You left me reelin' with this feelin'

On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
You won't get anything you don't deserve
Where we were born in time

You pressed me once, you pressed me twice
You hang the flame, you'll pay the price
Oh, babe, that fire
Is still smokin'
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain
Oh, babe, truer words
Have not been spoken or broken

In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You can have what's left of me
Where we were born in time
