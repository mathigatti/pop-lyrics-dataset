The evening winds are still
I've lost the way and will
Can't tell you where they went
I just know what they meant


I'm always on my guard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

The friend you used to be
So near and dear to me
You slipped so far away
Where did we go astray?

I passed the old school yard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me
Ever since the day
The day you went away

I felt that emptiness so wide
I don't know what's wrong or right
I just know I need strength to fight
Strength to fight that world outside

Since we've been out of touch
I haven't felt that much
From day to barren day
My heart stays locked away

I walk the boulevard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

The sun is sinking low
I guess it's time to go
I feel a chilly breeze
In place of memories

My dreams are locked and barred
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me
Hum, without you near me
