Oh, fare thee well, my own true love, fare thee well but for a while
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.


Ten thousand miles away from home, ten thousand miles or more
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
If I never nomore return to you, Mary Ann.

Oh, don't you see that crow fly high, she'll surely turn to white
If never I prove false to you
Let the day turn to night, my dear, Mary Ann.

If I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And a great big bowl for two to mix it in
I'd pour a drink for you my dear, Mary Ann
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you my dear, Mary Ann.
