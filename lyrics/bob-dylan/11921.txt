There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief


Business men they drink my wine
Plow men dig my Earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth

No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who fell that life is but a joke?

But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too

Outside in the distance
A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl
