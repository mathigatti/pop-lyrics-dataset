A hungry feelin' came o'er me stealin'
As the mice were squeelin' in my prison cell.
And that auld triangle, oh it jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the royal canal.
To begin the morning with the water boilin'
"Get out of bed, clean up your cell."
And that auld triangle goes jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the royal canal.


On a fine spring evenin' the lake lay dreamin'
The sea-gulls beamin' high above the wall.
And that auld triangle goes jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the royal canal
The screw was peepin' and the lake lay sleepin'
As he lays there weepin' for his good gal sal.
And that auld triangle play jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the royal canal

In the female prison there are seventy women
And it took all of them where I'd like to dwell.
And that auld triangle would go jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the royal canal
Oh the day was dyin' and the lake was sighin'
As I lay cryin' in my prison cell.
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the royal canal
