My love, she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
Don't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true like ice, like fire


People carry roses
And make promises by the hours
My love, she laughs like the flowers
Valentines won't buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall

Some speak of the future
My love, she speaks softly
Knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge

Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks she don' bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Banker's nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wisemen bring

The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows rainy
My love, she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing
