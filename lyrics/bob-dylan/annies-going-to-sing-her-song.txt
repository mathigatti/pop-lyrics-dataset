What's your hurry? Just watch this.
This is one you mustn't miss:
Annie's going to sing her song,
Called "take me back again."
A drink for me, a drink for you;
You're going to need a drink or two:
Annie's going to sing her song,
Called "take me back again."


You never heard it sung before;
I hear it twice a month or more,
Complete with tears and sheepish grins;
It only lacks the violins
The tune goes flat from time to time,
The lyric sometimes fails to rhyme,
But annie's going to sing her song,
Called "take me back again."

La la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la,
Annie's going to sing her song
Called "take me back again."
It sometimes lasts the whole night long,
Depends on how long she's been gone,
I sit and look as hard as nails;
She knows the damn thing never fails

Take the bottle, fill your cup;
Don't miss the part where I fold up;
Annie's going to sing her song,
Called "take me back again."
La la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la,
Annie's going to sing her song,
Called "take me back again."

It isn't annie's only tune;
The other I'll be hearing soon,
Next week, tomorrow, or today;
She sings it when she goes away
Take the bottle, fill your cup;
Don't miss the part where I fold up;
Annie's going to sing her song,
Called "take me back again;"
Come on, annie, sing you song,
Called "take me back again."
