One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road


I cry alone at night
Please tell me it's only night
And she's calling me back at night
And she's already home

One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road

I cry alone at night
There is no friend in sight
I love getting back at night
But I wish I don't

One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road

This bottle is dried up too
And I'll be all cried up soon
I can't see no God on the moon
It's a long way to go

One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road

I cry alone at night
He's not alone at night
I'll be there my whole night
But I wish it was whole

One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road
