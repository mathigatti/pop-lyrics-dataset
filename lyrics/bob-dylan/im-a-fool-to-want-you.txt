I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too
I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you


To seek a kiss, not mine alone
To share a kiss that devil has known
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time
When I would need you

And once again these words I'll have to say
Take me back, I love you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong, I can't get along without you
