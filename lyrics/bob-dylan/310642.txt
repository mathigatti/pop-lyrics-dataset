The trail is dark and dusty
Their're road is kind of rough,
But the good road is waiting
And boys it ain't far off.


Trails of troubles,
Roads of battles,
Paths of victory,
We shall walk.

I walked down to the valley,
I turned my head up high.
I've seen that silver linin'
That was hangin' in the sky.

Trails of troubles,
Roads of battles,
Paths of victory,
We shall walk.

The evenin' dusk was rollin',
I was walking down the track.
There was a one-way wind is blowin'
And it was blowin' at my back.

Trails of troubles,
Roads of battles,
Paths of victory,
We shall walk.

The gravel road is bumpy,
It's a hard road to ride,
But a clearer road is a-waiting
With the cinders on the side.

Trails of troubles,
Roads of battles,
Paths of victory,
We shall walk.

The morning train was movin',
The hummin' of its wheels,
Told me up a new day
Commin' across the fields.

Trails of troubles,
Roads of battles,
Paths of victory,
We shall walk.
