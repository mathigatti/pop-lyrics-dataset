Well the woman that I love she's got a hook in her nose
Her eyebrows meet she wears sexy damn clothes
She screams when I stutter and she walks with a hop
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop
You know I love her  yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world


If I ever lose her I'll go insane
I go Heaven crazy when she calls my name
She says baby baby baby I l-l-l-love you
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
You know I love her  yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world

The woman that I love she's got two flat feet
Her knees knock together walking down the street
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
She ain't much to look at but like I said
I love her  yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world

(She's so ugly.... gotta be ugly....)

I don't mean to say that she's got nothing done
She's got a weird sense of humor that's all her own
When I get low she sets me on my feet
Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet
You know I love her (she's so ugly)
yeah I love her (man she's ugly)
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world

(she's so ugly....  man she's ugly)
(gotta be ugly....  woman be ugly)
(ugly ugly....  she's so ugly)

Well the woman that I love she's got a hook in her nose
Her eyebrows meet she wears sexy damn clothes
she screams when I stutter and she walks with a hop
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop
You know I love her  yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world
