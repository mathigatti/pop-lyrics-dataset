In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light 
Where wisdom grows up in strife 
My bewildered brain, toils in vain 
Through the darkness on the pathways of life 
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air 
Tomorrow keeps turning around 
We live and we die, we know not why 
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down 


We eat and we drink, we feel and we think 
Far down the street we stray 
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by 
Things I never meant nor wished to say 
The midnight rain follows the train 
We all wear the same thorny crown 
Soul to soul, our shadows roll 
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down 

Well, the moon gives light and it shines by night 
When I scarcely feel the glow 
We learn to live and then we forgive 
O'r the road we're bound to go 
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours 
That keep us so tightly bound 
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies 
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down 

Well, I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes 
I followed the winding stream 
I heard the deafening noise, I felt transient joys 
I know they're not what they seem 
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain 
You'll never see me frown 
I owe my heart to you, and that's sayin' it true 
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down
