Down where the tradewinds play
Down where you lose the day
We found a new world
Where Paradise starts we traded hearts
Way down where the tradewinds play


Music was everywhere
Flowers were in her hair
Under an awning of silvery boughs we traded vows
The night that I sailed away

Oh, tradewinds, what are vows that lovers make
Oh, tradewinds, are they only made to break
