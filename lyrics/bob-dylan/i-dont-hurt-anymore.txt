I don't hurt anymore;
All my teardrops are dry
No more walking the floor
With that burning inside
Just to think it could be;
Time has opened the door
And at last I am free
I don't hurt anymore


Oh, you still deny
I wanted to die
The day taht you said we were through.
But now that I find
You're out of my mind,
I can't believe that it's true
I forgot it somehow
That I cancelled before
And it's wonderful now.
I don't hurt anymore.

No use to deny
I wanted to die
The day that you said we were through.
But now that I find
You're out of my mind,
I can't believe that it's true
I forgot it somehow
That I cancelled before
And it's wonderful now.
I don't hurt anymore.
