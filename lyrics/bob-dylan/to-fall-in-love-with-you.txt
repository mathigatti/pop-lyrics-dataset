A tear goes down
My day is real
But your drying eye
Upon the shame
Each needs a road
For me from you
What paradise?
What can I do?
That die for my
And the day is dark
I can’t believe for the end of time
What I could find
Oh time is right
Oh I fell in love
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with you


The day is dark
Our time is right
Day in the night
Deep in the night
I can’t yet be back
I heard my surprise
I see it in your lips
I knew it in your eyes
Well I feel your love
And I feel no shame
I can’t unleash your horde
I call your name
What you’re to me
What can I do?
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with you

It just rolls
Upon the sand
Ever this for now
I’m made a man
Can make you feel
What I can find
I know it in my days
Oh in my daily mind
Oh will ages roll
Will ages fly?
I hear your name where angels lie
What do I know?
For to come it’s true
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with you

How can the doors trust on a nail?
How can I be surprised
Of most every day?
In the distant road
I can’t be the same
I feel no love
I feel no shame
I can’t watch the bay
Out on my own
We’ve a destined man
I can attest it all
I didn’t find where I could go
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with you
