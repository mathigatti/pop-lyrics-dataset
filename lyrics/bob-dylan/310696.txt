Well the pressures down the boss aint here
He's got north for a while
They say that vanity got the best of him 
But he sure left here in style
By the way that's a cute hat and a smile so hard to resist
But whats a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?



You know i once knew a woman who looked like you,
She wanted a whole man, not just a half,
She used to call me sweet daddy when i was just a child
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
In order to deal in this game youve got to make the king disappear, 
Its done with a flick of the wrist
Whats a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

You know a woman like you should be at home, 
Thats where you belong,
Taking care of somone nice,
Who don't know how to do you wrong.
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Well there's no way to tell by the first kiss.
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

You know you can make a name for yourself,
You know you can hear them tires squeal,
You can be known as the most beautiful woman 
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.

You know news of you has come down the line 
Even before you came through the door
They say in your fathers house, theres many mansions 
Each one of them s got a fire proof floor.
Snap out of it people are jealous of you,
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

Got to be an important person to be in here baby,
Got to have done some evil deed,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Got to play your heart until your lips bleed.

They say that patriotism is the last refuge
To which a scoundrel clings
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Steal a lot and they make you a king.
Theres only one more step from here baby,
Its called the land of permanent bliss.
Whats a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
