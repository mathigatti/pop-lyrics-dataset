It's been raining in the trenches all day long, dripping down to my clothes
My patience is wearing thin, got a fire inside my nose
Searching for the truth the way God designed it
The truth is I might drown before I find it


Well I need a woman, yes I do
Need a woman, yes I do
Someone who can see me as I am
Somebody who just don't give a damn
And I want you to be that woman every night
Be that woman

I've had my eyes on you baby for about five long years
You probably don't know me at all, but I have seen your laughter and tears
Now you don't frighten me, my heart is jumping
And you look like it wouldn't hurt you none to have a man who could give ya something

Well I need a woman, oh don't I
Need a woman, bring it home safe at last
Seen you turn the corner, seen your bootheels spark
Seen you in the daylight, and watched you in the dark
And I want you to be that woman, all right
Be that woman every night

Well, if you believe in something long enough you just naturally come to think it's true
There ain't no wall you can't cross over, ain't no fire you can't walk through
Well, believing is all right, just don't let the wrong people know what it's all about
They might put the evil eye on you, use their hidden powers to try to turn you out

Well I need a woman, just to be my queen.
Need a woman, know what I mean?
