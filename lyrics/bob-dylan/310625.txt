I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun 
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done 
Instead of stopping when we could we went right on 
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone. 


You belong to someone else, and I do too 
It's just crazy bein' here with you
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat 
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street. 

I didn't want to want you, but now I have no choice 
It's too late to listen to that warning voice 
All I hear is thunder of two hearts beat 
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street 
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street. 

You're not free to belong to me
And you know I could never be your own
Your lips on mine are like a sweet, sweet wine 
But we're heading for a wall of stone.

Warning signs are flashing ev'ry where, but we pay no heed 
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a pickin' up speed 
Disaster's getting closer ev'ry time we meet 
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street 
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street 
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.
