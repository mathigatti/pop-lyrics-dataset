Well I got troubles, troubles on my mind
Yes, when I got those troubles, troubles on my mind
Well, I'm gonna forget my troubles, leave my troubles behind,
behind
I'm gonna swing it up
Swing down,
Grab my baby, and wind, wind, wind,
well, swing your troubles, swing your troubles away
Well, swing, baby, swing your troubles today
