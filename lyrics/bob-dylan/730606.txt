Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off my feet
And I'm back in the rain
Oh, and you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now
Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
He's singing his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird
Oh, singing just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singing through these tears
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days
And I know where I can find you
Oh, in somebody's room
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh but what a shame, that all we've shared can't last
I can change I swear
Oh, see what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream
I'm going out of my mind
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to the heart
Ever since we've been apart
