Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road
Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road


Takes a good woman mama
To satisfy my weary soul

Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K. C. line
Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K. C. line?

Well I just wanna ask you
If you seen that gal of mine
Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea
Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea
Don't my gal look good
When she's comin' after me?

Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road
Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road
Make a solid road

Takes a good woman mama
To satisfy my weary soul
