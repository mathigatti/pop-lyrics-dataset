I was young when i left home 
An' I been out a-ramblin' round 
An' I never wrote a letter to my home 
To my home, lord, to my home 
An' I never wrote a letter to my home. 


It was just the other day 
I was bringin' home my pay 
When i met an' old friend i used to know 
Said, "Your mother is dead an' gone 
An' your sisters all gone wrong 
An' your daddy needs you home right away.'' 

Not a shirt on my back 
Not a penny on my name 
But I can't go home this a-way 
This a-way, lord, this a-way 
An' I can't go home this a-way. 

If you miss the train I'm on 
Count the days I'm gone 
You will hear that whistle blow hundred miles 
Hundred miles, honey baby, lord, lord, lord 
An' you'll hear that whistle blow hundred miles. 

An' I'm playin' on a track, ma'd come an' woop me back 
On them trusses down by Ol' Jim McKay's 
When I pay the debt i own to the commissary store 
I will pawn my watch an' chain an' go home 
Go home, lord, lord, lord 
I will pawn my watch an' chain an' go home. 

Used to tell my ma sometimes 
When I see them ridin' blind 
Gonna make me a home out in the wind 
In the wind, lord in the wind 
Make me a home out in the wind. 

I don't like it in the wind 
I go back home again 
But i can't go home this a-way 
This a-way, lord, lord, lord 
An' i can go home this a-way. 

I was young when i left home 
An' I been out a-ramblin' round 
An' I never wrote a letter to my home 
To my home, lord, to my home 
An' I never wrote a letter to my home
