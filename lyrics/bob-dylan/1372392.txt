You are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know, dear
how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away


The other night dear as I laid sleeping I dreamed I held you by my side
When I awoke dear I was mistaken and I hung my head and cry
You are my sunshine...

You told me once dear you really loved me and no one else could come between
But now you've left me and you love another and you have shatered all my dreams
You are my sunshine...

I'll always love you and make you happy if you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another you'll regret it all some day
You are my sunshine...
Please don't take my sunshine away
