If not for you
Babe, I couldn't find the door
Couldn't even see the floor
I'd be sad and blue
If not for you


If not for you
Babe, I'd lay awake all night
Wait for the mornin' light
To shine in through
But it would not be new
If not for you

If not for you
My sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all
I'd be lost if not for you
And you know it's true

If not for you
My sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all
Oh! What would I do
If not for you

If not for you
Winter would have no spring
Couldn't hear Robin sing
I just wouldn't have a clue
Anyway it wouldn't ring true
If not for you
