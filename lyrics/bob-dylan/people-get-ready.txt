People get ready, there's a train a-comin'
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the lord.


People get ready for the train to jordan
Picking up passengers, coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
There's room for all among those loved the most.

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
Oh, there's no hidin' place against the kingdom's throne.

So people get ready, there's a train a-comin'
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith, open the doors and board 'em
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the lord.
