I didn't know that you'd be leavin'
Or who you thought you were talkin' to.
I figure maybe we're even
Or maybe I'm one up on you.


I send you all my money
Just like I did before.
I tried to reach you honey,
But you're driftin' too far from shore.

Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore

I ain't gonna get lost in this current,
I don't like playing cat and mouse.
No gentleman likes making love to a servant.
Especially when he's in his father's house.

I never could guess your weight, baby,
Never needed to call you my whore.
I always thought you were straight, baby,
But you're driftin' too far from shore.

Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore

Well these times and these tunnels are haunted,
The bottom of the barrel is too.
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.

Never no more do I wonder,
Why you don't never play with me any more.
At any moment you could go under,
'Cause you're driftin' too far from shore.

Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore
Driftin' too far from shore

You and me we had completeness,
I give you all of what I could provide
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
We were the wrong side.

I've already ripped out the phones, honey.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
I can finish this alone, honey,
You're driftin' too far from shore.
