Oxford town, Oxford town
Everybody's got their heads bowed down
Sun don't shine above the ground
Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford town


He went down to Oxford town
Guns and clubs followed him down
Just because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford town

Oxford town around the bend
He went to the door, he couldn't get in
All because of the colour of his skin
What do you think about that my friend?

Me, my gal and my gal's son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
Don't even know why we come
We're goin' back where we come from

Oxford town in the afternoon
Everybody's singin' a sorrowful tune
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon

Oxford town, Oxford town
Everybody's got their heads bowed down
Sun don't shine above the ground
Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford town
