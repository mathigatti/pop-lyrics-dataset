Full moon and empty arms
The moon is there for us to share
But where are you?
A night like this
Could weave a memory
And every kiss


Could start a dream for two
Full moon and empty arms
Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon
And next full moon
If my one wish comes true
My empty arms will be filled with you

Full moon and empty arms
Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon
And next full moon
If my one wish comes true
My empty arms will be filled with you
