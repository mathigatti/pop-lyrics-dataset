Braggin'
Wastin' all your time just braggin'
When ya' should be busy
Plowin' and a'plantin'
You stand there a'rantin'
Get no harvest to your heart


Braggin'
You ain't got no cause for braggin'
When your barn needs mendin'
And your lawn needs mowin'
How come you're a crowin'
Like a no-good rooster at dawn

Braggin' 'bout your fishin'
'Bout your horseshoe pitchin'
Bet you always keep the score
Talkin' 'bout your meddle
That's the kind they peddle
Down at the 5 and 10 store

Braggin'
Folks ain't got no use for braggin'
If your fields are greener
Folks will hear about it
You don't hafta shout it
Fields were greener 'fore you were born
