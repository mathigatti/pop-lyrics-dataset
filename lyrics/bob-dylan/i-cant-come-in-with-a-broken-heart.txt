Well I go get broke down, before I bust down
Gotta get in without a broken heart well
Get a hoe down before a low down
Before my guilt is acid hot
Well every single morning
I can't take it no more
Well if you with a heartache
Go down baby
She don't care about that us apart
Well she gonna have 'em, but she won't invite me
But I can't come in with a broken heart
I hold down, can't come down
Is comin' in without a broken heart
Well you cheated, showed her down
But I don't come around
O when she'll take ya tear us apart
