When your mother sends back all your invitations
And your father to your sister he explains
That you're tired of yourself
And all of your creations
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?


Now when all of the flower ladies want back
What they have lent you
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And all of your children start to resent you
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all the clowns
That you have commissioned
Have died in battle or in vain
And you're sick of all this repetition
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

When all of your advisers
Heave their plastic
At your feet to convince you of your pain
Trying to prove that your conclusions
Should be more drastic
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all the bandits
That you turned your other cheek to
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And you want somebody
You don't have to speak to
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
