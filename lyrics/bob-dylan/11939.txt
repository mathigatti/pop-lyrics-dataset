Oh God said to Abraham, kill me a son
Abe said man you must be puttin me on
God said no, Abe said what
God said you can do what you want Abe but
Next time you see me coming you better run
Well, Abe said where you want this killin done
God said out on highway 61


Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
they wouldnt give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, where can I go
Howard said theres only one place i know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
Oh Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down highway 61

Well, Mack the finger said to Louis the king
I got fourty red, white and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that dont ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louis the king said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to highway 61

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things were'nt right
My complexion she says is much too white
He said come here and step into the light
He said h'mm you're right,
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with her seventh son
And they were both out on highway 61

Now the roving gambler, he was very bored
Trying to create our next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell on the floor
He said I've never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And head out on highway 61
