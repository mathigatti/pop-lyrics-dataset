Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell.
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.


She had sweethearts a-plenty and men of high degree.
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Oh, her true love e'er to be.

"Oh daughter, oh daughter, your body I will confine.
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Oh, would ever suit your mind.

"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Oh, would have this heart of mine.

Now Jackie's gone sailing with trouble on his mind.
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Oh, his darling girl behind.

She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Oh, convey herself away.

"Before you step onboard, sir, your name I'd like to know."
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."

"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Oh, to face the cannonball.

"I know my waist is slender and my fingers they are small,
But they would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."

The war soon being over, they hunted all around.
Among the dead and dying her darling love she found,
Oh, her darling love she found.

She picked him up all in her arms and carries him to town,
And sent for her physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds.

This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
This couple they got married, so why not you and me,
Oh, so why not you and me.
