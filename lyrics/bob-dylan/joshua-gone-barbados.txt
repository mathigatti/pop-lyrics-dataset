Cane standing in the fields
Getting old and red
Lot of misery in georgetown
Three men lying dead
And joshua, head of the
Government, say strike for better pay


Cane cutters are striking
Joshua gone away
Joshua gone barbados
Just like he don't know
People on this island
They got nowhere to go

In the city, you can hear how the women bawl
Joshua gone barbados, he don't care at all
Sonny child the overseer
I swear he's an ignorant man

Walking through the canefield
Pistol in his hand
Strike be all in vain
Joshua gone barbados
Just like he don't know
People on the st. Vincent
They got no place to go
