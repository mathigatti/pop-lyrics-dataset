Down in some lone valley
Yes, in a lonesome place
Where the wild birds do hover
And their notes do increase
Farewell pretty saro
I bid you adieu
But I'll dream of pretty saro
Wherever I go


Yeah, my love she won't have me
So I understand
She wants every holder
Who owns a house and land
I cannot maintain her
With silver and gold
And all of the funs in
That a big house can hold

If I was a poet
And could write a fine hand
I'd write my love a letter
That she'd understand
I'd write it by the river
Where the waters overflow
And I'll dream of pretty saro
Wherever I go
