You know, there's two ol' maids layin' in the bed,
One picked herself up an' the other one, she said:
"Get your rocks off!
Get your rocks off! (get 'em off!)
Get your rocks off! (get 'em off!)
Get your rocks off-a me! (get 'em off!)"


Well, you know, there late
One night up on blueberry hill,
One man turned to the other
Man and said, with a blood-curdlin' chill, he said:
"Get your rocks off! (get 'em off!)
Get your rocks off! (get 'em off!)
Get your rocks off! (get 'em off!)
Get your rocks off-a me! (get 'em off!)"

Well, you know, we was layin'
Down around mink muscle creek,
One man said to the other man
He began to speak, he said:
"Get your rocks off! (get 'em off!)
Get your rocks off! (get 'em off!)

Get your rocks off! (get 'em off!)
Get your rocks off-a me! (get 'em off!)"
Well, you know, we was cruisin' down
The highway in a greyhound bus
All kinds-a children in the side road
They was hollerin' at us, sayin'

"Get your rocks off! (get 'em off!)
Get your rocks off! (get 'em off!)
Get your rocks off! (get 'em off!)
Get your rocks off-a me!"
