Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore
My flashlight's from Taiwan
My tablecloth's from Malaysia
My belt buckle's from the Amazon
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet
It was put together down in argentina
By a guy makin' thirty cents a day


Well, it's sundown on the union
And what's made in the USA
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the pearls are from Japan
Well, the dog collar's from india
And the flower pot's from Pakistan
All the furniture, it says "made in Brazil"
Where a woman, she slaved for sure
Bringin' home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve
You know, that's a lot of money to her

Well, it's sundown on the union
And what's made in the USA
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

Well, you know, lots of people complainin' that there is no work
I say: why you say that for when nothin' you got is USA made?
They don't make nothin' here no more,
You know, capitalism is above the law
It say: it don't count 'less it selles
When it costs too much to build it at home
You just build it cheaper someplace else

Well, it's sundown on the union
And what's made in the USA
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

Well, the job that you used to have
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador
The unions are big business, friend
And they're goin' out like a dinosaur
They used to grow food in Kansas
Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Is gonna be against the law

Well, it's sundown on the union
And what's made in the USA
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

Democracy don't rule the world
You'd better get that in your head
This world is ruled by violence
But I guess that's better left unsaid
From Broadway to the milky way
That's a lot of territory indeed
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed

Well, it's sundown on the union
And what's made in the USA
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way
