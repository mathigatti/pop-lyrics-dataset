The light 
In this place 
Is really bad
Like being 
In the bottom 
Of a stream
Any minute now 
I'm expecting 
To wake up 
From a dream
Miss so much 
The softest touch
Like the grave 
Of some child child
Who neither wept 
Nor smiled
I'm hiding my faith 
In the rain
I've been 
Dreamin' of you
That's all I do
And it's 
Driving me insane


Somewhere dawn 
Is breaking
Light is streaking 
Across the floor
Church bells 
Are ringing
I wonder who 
They're ringing for
Travel under any star
You'll see me 
Wherever you are

The shadowy past 
Is so vague and so vast
I'm sleeping 
In the balance of pain
I've been dreamin' of you
That's all I do
But it's 
Driving me insane

Maybe they'll get me 
Maybe they won't
But whatever 
It won't be tonight
I wish your hand 
Was in mine right now
We could go 
Where the moon is wide

For years 
They had me 
Locked in a cage
Then they threw me 
Onto the stage
Somethings 
Just last longer 
Then you 
Thought they would
And they never 
Ever explain
I'm dreamin' of you
That's all I do
And it's 
Driving me insane

Well 
I eat when I'm hungry
Drink when I'm dry
Live my life 
On the square
Even if the flesh 
Falls off my face
It won't matter as long 
As you're there

Feel like 
A ghost in love
Underneath 
The heavens above
Feel further away 
Then I ever did before
Feel further 
Than I can take
Dreamin' of you 
That's all I do
But it's 
Driving me insane

Everything in the way 
Is so shy like the day
In queer and unusual form
Spirals of golden haze here 
In there in a blaze
Like beams of light 
In a star

Maybe you're here 
Or maybe you weren't
Maybe you 
Touched somebody 
And got burned
The silent sun 
Has got me on the run
Burning a hole 
In my brain
I'm dreamin' of you
That's all I do
But it's 
Driving me insane
