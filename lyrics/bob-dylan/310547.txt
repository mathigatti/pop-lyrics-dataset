Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
But won't get the girl I'm loving
Won't go down Highway 51 no more


Well, I know that highway like I know my hand
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand
Running from up Wisconsin
Way down to no man's land

Well, if I should die before my time should come
And if I should die before my time should come
Won't you bury my body
Out on Highway 51?

Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
I said, Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
But won't get the girl I'm loving
Won't go down Highway 51 no more
