I'm your teenage prayer
Take a look at me baby
I am a teenage prayer
When it's cloudy all the time
All you gotta do is


(Take a look at me babe)
(Good, go 'head)
(I'm your teenage prayer)
Take a look at me baby
(Just take a look at me baby)
I am your teenage prayer
(Yes I'm your teenage prayer)
Take a look at me baby
(Just take a look over here at me baby)
I am your teenage prayer
(I'm your teenage prayer)

Take a look and when it's cloudy all the time
All you gotta do is say you're mine
I come runnin' anywhere
Take a look at me baby
(Just take a look at me baby)
I'm your teenage prayer

Take a look at me baby
I'm your teenage dream
Take a look at me baby
I'm your teenage dream
(Yes and I'm a dream)
When it's rainy in your heart
Just come to me and start
Tell me how I do and cheer
Oh, just come and take a look at me baby
I'm your teenage prayer

Well oh, let it rain
For any dime just come and see my face
Any time you just got to read my lines
I won't give you any respect
Oh, no
Take a look at me baby
(Just take a look over here at me baby)

I'm your teenage prayer
(Take a look at me baby, I'm a teenage prayer)
Come and take a look at me baby
(Yes take a look over here baby)
I'm your teenage prayer
('Cause I'm your teenage prayer)

When it's cloudy all the time
All you gotta do is say you're mine
I come runnin' anywhere
Take a look at me baby
(Take a look at me baby)
I'm your teenage prayer
(Prayer, hair, where)

Yes I'm your teenage prayer
You might think I'm not
Somebody might think I'm nowhere
But I'm here to tell you I'm your teenage prayer
I know what you need
I can feel it in my bones and I feel it on my throne
You're my teenage prayer
Any day any night
You just come to me when you're in fright
And I'm your teenage prayer

Take a look at me baby
(Just take a look at me baby)
I'm your teenage prayer
(You know I'm your teenage prayer baby)
Take a look at me baby
(Take a look at my hair baby)
I'm your teenage prayer
(I'm the teenage pair)

When it's cloudy all the time
All you gotta do is say you're mine
'Cause I come runnin' to you anywhere
Oh, yeah, oh you're so real
Take a look at me baby
I'm your teenage prayer
