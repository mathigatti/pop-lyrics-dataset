It's funny how you loved me
Then forgot so suddenly
It's funny to everyone but me
(It's the talk of the town)


They told me this would happen
Now they're laughing secretly
It's funny to everyone but me
(Gosh, he's crying again)

I should shrug my shoulders and say
Good riddance to a bad affair
But how can I do, but my head tells me to
When my heart tells me how much I care

It's so funny, I still love you
It's the joke of the century
It's funny to everyone but me
(I have the right to think of you)

It's so funny, I still love you
It's the joke of the century
Ah, but it's funny to everyone but me
