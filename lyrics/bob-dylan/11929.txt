If you're traveling to the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.


If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds.

Please, see if her hair hangs long
It rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
For that's the way I remember her best

I'm wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I have often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

So if you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was the true love of mine.
