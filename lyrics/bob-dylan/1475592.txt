Oh well, I love you pretty baby
You're the only love I've ever know
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throw
Beyond here lies nothing
Nothing we can call our own


Well, I'm moving after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what I do without it
Without this love we call ours
Beyond here lies nothing
Nothing but the moon and stars

Down every street there's a window
And every window made of glass
Will keep on loving pretty baby
For as long as love will last
Beyond here lies nothing
But the mountains of the past

Well, my ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head
Beyond here lies nothing
Nothing done and nothing said
