I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Any time, night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreaming my life away


Dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream

Dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream
When I want you in my mind
And I need you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream

Dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Any time night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreaming my life away

I need you so that I could die
I want you so and that is why
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream
