See the Pyramids 
Along the Nile
Watch the sun rise 
On a tropic isle
Just remember darling 
All the while
You belong to me...


See the market place 
In old Algiers
Send me photographs 
And souvenirs
Just remember 
'Til your dream appears
You belong to me....

I'll be so alone 
Without you
Maybe 
You'll be lonesome, too
Maybe 
You'll be lonesome too 
And blue

Fly the ocean 
In a silver plane
See the jungle 
When its wet with rains
Just remember 
Till you're home again
Or until I come home to you
You belong to me..
