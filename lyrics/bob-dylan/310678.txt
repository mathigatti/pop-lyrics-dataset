Sign on the window says, "Lonely"
Sign on the door said, "No Company Allowed,"
Sign on the street says, "Y' Don't Own Me"
Sign on the porch says, "Three's A Crowd"

Her and her boyfriend went to California
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune
My best friend said, "Now didn' I warn ya
Brighton girls are like the moon
Brighton girls are like the moon"

Looks like a-nothing but rain
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street
Hope that it don't sleet

Build me a cabin in Utah
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout
Have a bunch of kids who call me, "Pa"
That must be what it's all about
That must be what it's all about
