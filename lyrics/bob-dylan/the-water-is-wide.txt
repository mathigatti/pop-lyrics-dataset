The water is wide an' I can't cross over
Neither have I wings to fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love an' I


There is a ship an' she sails on the sea
Loaded deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
And know not how I sink or swim

I leaned my back up against some oak
Thinkin' it was a trusty tree
But first it bent an' then it broke
Just like my own false love to me

Oh love is gentle, love is kind
Gay as a jewel when first it's new
But love grows old an' waxes cold
An' fades away like some morning dew

The water is wide an' I can't cross over
Neither have I wings to fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love an' I
