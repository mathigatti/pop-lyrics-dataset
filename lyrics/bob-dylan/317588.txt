If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly the river to the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
I had a man, who was long and tall
Moved his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well


'Member one evening, it was drizzling rain
And in my heart I felt an aching pain
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Once I wore my apron low
Been a-keep' you away from my door
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Now my apron is up to my chin
You pass my door but you never come in
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Muddy river runs muddy 'n' wild
You can't care the bloody for my unborn child
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Number nine train ain' done no harm
Number nine train take my poor baby home
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Fastest man I ever saw
Skid Missouri on the way to Arkansas
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
