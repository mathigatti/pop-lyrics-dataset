I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler 
I'm a long way from home 
And if you don't like me 
You can leave me alone 


For it's dark and it's rainin' 
And the moon gives no light 
And my pony can't travel 
This dark road at night 

Oh, i once had me a true love 
Her age was sixteen 
She was the flower of Belton 
And the rose of Saline 

But her parents didn't like me 
Now she's just the same 
If I'm writ on your books, gal 
Just blot out my name 

I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler 
I'm a rambler, I'm a gamble
