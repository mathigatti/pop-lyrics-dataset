Well, I'm looking the world over
Looking far off into the East
And I see my baby coming
She's walking with the village priest
I feel a change coming on
And the last part of the day is already gone


We've got so much in common
We strive for the same old ends
And I just can't wait
Wait for us to become friends
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

Well, life is for love
And they say that love is blind
If you want to live easy
Baby, pack your clothes with mine
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

Well, now what's the use in dreaming
You got better things to do
Dreams never did work for me anyway
Even when they did come true

You are as whorish as ever
Baby, you can start a fire
I must be losing my mind
You're the object of my desire
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

I'm a-listening to Billy Joe Shaver
And I'm reading James Joyce
Some people, they tell me
I've got the blood of the land in my voice

Everybody got all the money
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes
Everybody got all the flowers
I don't have one single rose
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day's already gone
