Oh, I'm sailin' away my own true love
I'm sailin' away in the morning
Is there something I can send you
From across the sea
From the place that I'll be landing?


No, there's nothin' you can send me
My own true love
There's nothin' I'm wishin' to be ownin'.
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Oh, but I just thought
You might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'

That I might be gone a long old time
And it's only that I'm askin'
Is there something I can send you
To remember me by
To make your time more easy passin'

Oh, how can, how can you ask me again?
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I would want you today
I would want again tomorrow

Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Saying: I don't know
When I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'

If you, my love, must think that-a-way
I'm sure your mind is roamin'
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you're goin'

So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes
There's something you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather
