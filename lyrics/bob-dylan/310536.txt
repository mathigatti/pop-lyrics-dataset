Done laid around and stayed around this old town to long
sommers almost gone yeh winters commin on
Done laid around and stayed around this old town to long
and I feel like I gotta travel on


there's a lonesome freight at six'o eight commin through the town
commin through the town yeh I'll be homeward bound
A lonesome freight at six'o eight a commin through the town
but I feel like I gotta travel on

That chilly wind will soon begin but I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way yeh I'll be home to stay
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
But I feel like I gotta travel on

(not sure on next verse)

High Police and Sherriff are commin after me
yeh commin after me yeh commin after me
The high Police and Sherriff are comin after me
and I feel like I gotta travel on

wanna see my honey, wanna see her bad
wanna see my honey, wanna see her bad
she's the best girl a man could ever have

Papa writes to Johnny But Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home no Johnny can't come home
Papa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
cause he's been on the chain gaing to long
