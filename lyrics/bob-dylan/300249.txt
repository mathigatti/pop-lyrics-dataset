Oh my name it is nothin' my age it means less
The country I come from is called the Midwest
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
And that land that I live in has God on its side


Oh the history books tell it they tell it so well
The cavalries charged the Indians fell
The cavalries charged the Indians died
Oh the country was young with God on its side

Oh the Spanish-American War had it's day
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
With guns in their hands and God on their side

Oh the First World War, boys, it came and it went
The reason for fighting I never did get
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead
When God's on your side

The Second World War came to an end
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too have God on their side

I've learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes, it's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them to run and to hide
And accept it all bravely with God on my side

But now we got weapons of chemical dust
If fire them we're forced to then fire them we must
One push of the button and shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When God's on your side

In a many dark hour I've been thinkin' about this
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side

So now as I'm leavin'
I'm weary as Hell
The confusion I'm feelin' ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head and fall to the floor
If God's on our side he'll stop the next war
