How many times have you heard someone say,
"If I had his money, I could do things my way."
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in Ten with a satisfied mind.


Once I was winning in fortune and fame;
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game.
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime,
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonesome or a love that's grown cold;
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When life is over, my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt. 
But one thing for certain, when it comes my time, 
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
