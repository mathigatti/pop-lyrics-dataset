Where she leads me I do not know
Well, she leads me where she goes
I can't find her nowhere


Well, she needs me here
All aware I can't hear her walk
I just cannot hear her talk
Though sometimes, you know you will

And when she comes my way
I'll just be left any night or day
I will hear her say

That I don't wanna try
I tried, also cried
But I can't leave her behind
