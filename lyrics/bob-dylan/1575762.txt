If you're travelling in the north country fair,
where the wind hits heavy on the borderline,
remember me to one who lives there,
for she once was, a true love of mine.


See for me that her hair's hangin' long,
It curls and falls all down her chest,
see for me that her hair's hangin' down,
for that's the way I remember her best.

If You go where the snowflakes fall,
where the rivers freeze, and summer ends,
please she if she has a coat so warm ,
to keep her from the howling wind.

If you're travelling in the north country fair,
where the wind hits heavy on the borderline,
remember me to one who lives there,
for she once was a true love of mine.

If you're travelling in the north country fair,
where the wind hits heavy on the borderline,
remember me to one who lives there,
for she once was a true love of... MINE!

True love of mine x6

She once was a true love of mine
