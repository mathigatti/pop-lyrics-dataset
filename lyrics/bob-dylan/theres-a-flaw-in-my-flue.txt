I used to sit by my fireplace
And dream about you
But now that won't do
There's a flaw in my flue


Your lovely face in my fireplace
Was all that I saw
But now it won't draw
My flue has a flaw

From every beautiful ember a memory arose
Now I try to remember and smoke gets in my nose
It's not as sweet as the unit-heat
To dream about you
So darling, adieu
There's a flaw in my flue
