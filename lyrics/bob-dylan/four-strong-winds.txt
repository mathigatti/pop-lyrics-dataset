Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change
Come what may
But the good times all are gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if you ever come this way


Think I'll go down to alberta
Where there's good there in the fall
I've got some friends that I can go workin' for
But I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that don't change
Come what may
But the good times are all gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if you ever come this way

(A few lines are inaudible)
But by then it would be springtime
There ain't too much for you to do
So I see you when I pass this way again

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change
Come what may
But the good times are all gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
