I was bruised and battered and I couldn´t tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
I saw my reflection in a window I didn´t know my own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin´away
On the streets of Philadelphia


I walked the avenue till my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of Philadelphia

Ain´t no angel gonna greet me
It´s just you and I my friend
My clothes don´t fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip the skin

The night has fallen, I´m lyin´awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the streets of Philadelphia
