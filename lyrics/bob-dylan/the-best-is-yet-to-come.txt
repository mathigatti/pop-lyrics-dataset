Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still it's a real good bet the best is yet to come


The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine

Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet!

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly
We're gonna taste of the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before but you ain't left the ground

Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here!

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
