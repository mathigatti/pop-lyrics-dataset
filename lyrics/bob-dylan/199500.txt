I knew a man Bojangles and he'd dance for you
In worn out shoes
Silver hair, ragged shirt and baggy pants
That old soft shoe
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high
Will he likely touch down
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance.


I met him in a cell in New Orleans
I was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
Laughing slapped his leg stale
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance.

He said the name Bojangles and he danced to lick
All across the cell
He grabbed his pants for a better stance
Oh he jumped so high and he clicked up his heels
He let go laugh, he let go laugh
Shook back his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance, yeah, dance.

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years of how his dog and him
But just traveled all about
His dog up and died, he up and died
And after 20 years he still grieves
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance.

He said I dance now at every chance, honky-tonks
For drinks and tips
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drink so bit
He shook his head and he shook his head
I heard someone ask him, please

Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
dance, dance
Mr Bojangles, dance.
