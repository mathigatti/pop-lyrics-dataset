Once upon a time, you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say: Beware, doll! You're bound to fall!
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal


How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

You've gone to the finest school, all right, miss lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody has ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say: Do you want to make a deal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own?
With no direction home?
A complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own?
With no direction home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts, but you better take your diamond ring
You better pawn it, babe!
You used to be so amused
At napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse!
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own?
With no direction home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?
