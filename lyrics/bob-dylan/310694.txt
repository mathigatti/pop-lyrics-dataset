I've got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where you are


Sugar baby get on down the road, you ain't got no brains nohow
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now

Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff
Plenty of places to hide things here if you want to hide them bad enough
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but you know she not really my aunt
Some of these memories, you can learn to live with and some of'em you can't

Sugar baby get on down the line, you ain't got no brains nohow
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now

The ladies down in Darktown, they're doin' the Darktown strut
Y'always got to be prepared, but you never know for what
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing

Sugar baby get on down the road, you ain't got no brains nohow
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now

Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
Any minute of the day, the bubble can burst
Try to make things better for someone sometimes you just end up makin' it thousand times worse

Sugar baby get on down the road, you ain't got no brains nohow
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now

Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
You got a way of tearin' the world apart, love, see what you've done
Just as sure as we're livin', just as sure as you're born
Look up, look up, seek your Maker, 'fore Gabriel blows his horn

Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense nohow
You went years without me, might as well keep goin' now
