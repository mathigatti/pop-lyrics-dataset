In at the top of the tower
It was about a quarter hour
I want it back and I'm just over here
Nuts on my left side
Reacted to the only
The only thing that I'd seen with my eyes
She said


Run Run Run!!
As fast as you can run while you can walk
They give you all so much because you're right on time
Run Run Run!!
But don't you know that I'm up!?

I'm going on my way, yeah
I'm tired of all the ends
All the ends
But she protects her son on the end
And I said
And after,
But I go out to work!

I'm breaking down on Tuesday
On Wednesday, I pay my rent!
I give it up
To what I said
Leave me in peace
He said

Run Run Run!!
Fast as you can run while you can walk
They give you all so much because you're out of time
Run Run Run!!
But I said that was yours!

I'm tired of all the ends
All the ends
And bringing back to my thumb
When I said I was right
But she protects her son standing right there
On the end
And after
But I go out to work!
