I don't wanna waste your time
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna say
I've got to say
We worked hard, darling
We don't have no control
We're under control


I don't wanna do it your way
I don't wanna do it your way
I don't wanna give it to ya, your way
I don't want to know

I don't wanna change your mind
I don't wanna change the world
I just wanna watch you go by
I just wanna watch you go by
We were young, darling
We don't have no control
We're out of control

I don't wanna do it your way
I don't wanna do it your way
I don't wanna give it to ya, your way
I don't want to know

I don't wanna change your mind
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna know you're alright
I've got know you're alright
You are young, darling
For now, but not for long
Under control
