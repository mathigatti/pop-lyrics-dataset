I wanna be forgotten
And I don't wanna be reminded
You say: Please, don't make this harder
No, I won't yet


I wanna be beside her
She wanna be admired
You say: Please, don't make this harder
No, I won't yet

Oh dear, is it really all true?
Did they offend us and they want it to sound new?
Top ten ideas for countdown shows
Whose culture is this and does anybody know?
I wait and tell myself: Life ain't chess
But no one comes in and yes, you're alone

You don't miss me, I know

Oh Tennessee, what did you write?
I come together in the middle of the night
Oh that's an ending that I can't write, 'cause
I've got you to let me down

I wanna be forgotten
And I don't wanna be reminded
You say: Please, don't make this harder
No, I won't yet

I wanna be beside her
She wanna be admired
You say: Please, don't make this harder
No, I won't yet
