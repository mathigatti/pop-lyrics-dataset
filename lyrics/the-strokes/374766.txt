How did anybody find out where I was?
How did anybody find that out
I was hiding from the world, I was a squirrel
You chopped down my tree to get my fur


Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Ooh Fear of sleep
Can't you wait
I'm not done
Fear of sleep
Here you come

Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Fall asleep
You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun

I guess everybody's week must have been pretty rough
Cause everybody's drunk, loud and pissed off
I know you hate to be impressed with someone else (other than yourself)
But you know trying to hold back on being an asshole helps

Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Where'd you go?
Fear of sleep
Ooh Fear of sleep
So you know
I'm not done
Here we go
Here you come

Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Fall asleep
You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun
