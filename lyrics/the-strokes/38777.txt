You said you couldn't stay
You've seen it all before
I know


They sold you on their way
Oh, honey, that's okay

No harm, he's armed
Setting off all your alarms
When I find out
I hope it's you who set this trap

And store fronts rarely change
At least I'm on my own again
Instead of anywhere with you

Oh, tell me it's all the same

And I've lost my page again
I know this is surreal
But I'll try my luck with you
Oh, this life is on my side
Oh, I am your one
Believe me, this is a chance, oh oh

Let's see what is for sale
He's trying not to give his job a chance
Oh, it's never gonna be
It's sad, but I agree
The signals don't seem right
It lasts for just one night, and then
I'm sorry that I said
That we were just good friends

No harm, he's armed
Setting off all your alarms
Entranced
I can't be here in time
I'll think about that

And I've lost my plage again
I know this is surreal
But I'll try my luck with you
Oh, this life is on my side
Oh, I am your one
Believe me, this is a chance, oh oh
