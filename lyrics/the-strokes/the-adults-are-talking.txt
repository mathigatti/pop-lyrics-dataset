They’ve been saying, you’re sophisticated
They’re complaining, over-educated
You are saying all the words I’m dreaming
Say it after me
Say it after me


They will blame us, crucify, and shame us
We can’t help it if we are a problem
We are trying hard to get your attention
Climbing up your wall
Climbing up your wall

Don’t go there cause you’ll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don’t make sense
When you’re trying hard to do the right thing
But without recompense

And then you did something wrong and they said it was great
And now you don’t know how you could ever complain
Because you’re all confused cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same as you

You were waiting for the elevator
You were saying all the words I’m dreaming
No more asking, questions or excuses
Information’s here
Here and everywhere

Don’t go there cause you’ll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don’t make sense
When your trying hard to do the right thing
But without recompense

And then you did something wrong and they said it was great
And now you don’t know how you could ever complain
Because you’re all confused cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same way as you

But I don’t, I don’t want anything
I know it’s not, it’s not your fault
I don’t want anyone
As I do in life for you

(Stockholders)

Same shit different life
I‘ll get it right some time
Maybe not tonight
Maybe not tonight
Maybe not tonight
Maybe not tonight
Maybe not tonight
