Those that try anything once
Should we care about the only ones?
All the time that I need is never quite enough
All the time that I have is all that’s necessary


You’re livin’ a lie
You’re livin’ a lie
You’re living too fast
You've got to cope with the past
You never ask why
You never ask why
You’re livin' a lie
Baby, you’re flying too high

No one talks, about the war
On my block, or by the shore
All alone in a room
Do you want what I want, too?
All the time in the world
Is all that’s necessary

You’re livin’ a lie
You’re livin’ a lie
You’re living too fast
You gotta pray for the best
You never ask why
You never ask why
You’re livin' a lie
Baby, you’re flying too high

You never ask why
You never ask why
You’re livin’ a lie
Baby you’re flying too high
Don’t get on your phone
Don’t reach for the door
You know the answer that you’re looking for

You’re livin’ a lie
You’re livin’ a lie
You’re living too fast
You've got to cope with the past
You never ask why
You never ask why
You’re livin’ a lie
Baby, you’re flying too high
