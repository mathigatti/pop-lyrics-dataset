Tell me what happened (x3)
If you like
Get off on the same floor (x3)
Every night
What are the reasons (x3)
To fight more?
I wanna tell you (x3)
Nothing more


Yeah, my mind give a hand
Never once give a damn

I'm done with the office (x3)
Hello forest
Still want to ask you (x3)
Something more

Yeah, my mind give a hand
Never once give a damn

I don't want to fight, don't wanna beg you anymore(x3)

I don't wanna argue (x3)
You think you want
I wouldn't hurt you (x3)
Maybe i hurt you if i could
