A perfectly sun day
I think I'm staying now, today
And take it on my way
And somehow I can see your life
Ah, rip then!


And storefronts rarely changed
At least I'm on my own again, instead of
Travelling with you
I'm sorry, it seems
Sometimes I forget my way

And I lost my way again
Ah, this is, this is a chance
And I hope you never change
This life is on my side
And I am the one
"Believe me, this is a chance", oh oh

Let's see what's for sale
I think we're really make it there
But I'm antious
There's simply only throught
I take no personal true

The signals don't seem right
They last for just one night, and then...
I'm sorry that I said:
"That we were just be friends"
Oh, no

And I lost my way again
This is... this is a chance
And I hope you never change
This life is on my side
And I am the one
"Believe me, this is a chance", oh oh
