Close the door
Not all the way
He don’t understand
We don’t understand
So don’t you go and remind me
I don’t know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place


Can I waste all your time here in the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I waited around, you were not around
Having a hard time watchin' you

You got it now, don’t you?
I wanted to understand your face
So don’t you wanna remind me
I don’t know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place

Can I waste all your time here in the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I waited around, you were not around
Having a hard time watchin' you
Watchin' you

I needed someone
I needed someone
