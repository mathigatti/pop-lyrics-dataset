Some people think they're always right
Others are quiet and uptight
Others they seem so very nice (nice nice nice oh-ho)
Inside they might feel sad and wrong (oh no)


Twenty-nine different attributes
Only seven that you like (oh-ho)
Twenty ways to see the world (oh-ho)
Are twenty ways to start a fight (oh-ho)

(Oh, don't, don't) don't get out
I can't see the sunshine
I'll be waiting for you, baby
'Cause I'm through
Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

Oh men don't notice what they got
Women think of that a lot
A thousand ways to please your man (oh-ho)
Not even one requires a plan (I know)

(And) countless odd religions too
It doesn't matter which you choose (oh, no)
One stubborn way to turn your back (oh-ho)
This I've tried, and I refuse (oh-ho)

(Don't, don't) don't get out
I can't see the sunshine
I'll be waiting for you, baby
'Cause I'm fool
Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

(Alright)

Shut me up
Shut me up
And I'll get along with you
