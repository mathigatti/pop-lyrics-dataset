Say a prayer now
Don't be scared now
You don't want trouble
Well we might get some
We might get some
It's troublesome
But don't you worry
You can help me


Killing lies, killing lies
Killing lies, killing lies

First you're worried
Then you're hurried
Don't think that everything
Is gonna stay the same
That's impossible
Before I left you go
Let me look at you
Don't you worry
You will help me

Killing lies, killing lies
Killing lies, killing lies
Oh, yes, I noticed you
You are a friend of mine
