Unchain me
It's not my midnight yet
Act like a wolf but think like a sheep (Wall Street)
Unchain me
Cause this is my bank’s advice
We’re gonna give it back to you
Some other day


Take off from the runway
Thinking of a sad day
Racing down the highway
Looking at me sideways

What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?

Unchain me
It’s time
I know the way uptown
Unchain me
I've waited for the time
Get you with your pyjamas on

Take off from the runway
Thinking of a sad day
Playing with his new toys
Looking at the sad boys

What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?

And we take
What we like from them
And then say
What do you want from me?

Don’t wait so long
Way too long
They wait too long
I can’t stay awake too long
You never wait for some
Other generation
I’ll wait somewhere
Alone
Get it in your head, get out of (my way)

What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
