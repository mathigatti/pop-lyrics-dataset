I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, Momma running out of luck
Like my sister, don't give a fuck


Oh his strange manners, I love 'em so
I wish you'd wear your new trench coat
I don't show up on weekdays
That's something that you learned yesterday

I just want to misbehave
I just want to be your slave
You ain't got nothing I want, but
I want it all
I just can't figure out
Nothin'

I wanna steal your innocence
To me my life, it don't make sense
I took five dollars, won't get me far
My last resort is to steal your car
Drive you to work; you'll be on time
These little problems they're not yours and mine
Come on and listen to what I say
I've got some secrets that'll make you stay

I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
Oh, you ain't got nothing I want, but
I want it all
I just can't figure out
Nothin'

And all he said is, I'm a freak
He ordered them to make mistakes
And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Today the day that I was born
He won't leave me alone he keeps asking for more
Together again, like the beginning
But for the record it's between you and me

I wanna steal your innocence
To me my life, it don't make sense
Oh, his strange manners I love 'em so
Why won't he wear his new trenchcoat?
I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, Momma running out of luck
Like my sister don't give a fuck

I just want to turn you down
And maybe later I'll turn you around
You ain't never had nothing I want, but
I want it all
I just can't figure out
Nothing

And all he said is, I'm a freak
He ordered them to make mistakes
And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Today the day that I was born
He won't leave me alone he just asks for more
Together again, like the beginning
I said it's between you and I
