They found our city under the water
Gotta get my hands on something new
You don't want to be without this
Something isn't adding up


Decide my past
Define my life
Don't ask questions
Cause I don't know why

Someone
Didn't wanna know their name
Drifting
You don't wanna know what's going down
Even though I really like your place
Somehow we don't have to know each other's name

They found our city under the water
I began to listen to your eyes
You don't want to live without it
Even others, they'd abide

Decide my past
Define my life
Don't ask questions
Cause I don't know why

Someone
Didn't wanna know their name
Drifting
You don't wanna know what's going down
Even though I really like your place
Somehow we don't have to know each other's name

Someone
I didn't wanna know their name
Drifting
You don't wanna know what's going down
Even though I really like your place
Somehow we don't have to know each other's name

Decide my past
Define my life
Don't ask questions
Cause I don't know why
I don't listen
And I don't speak
At least got talent
But I don't know why
