Last night she said
Oh baby, I feel so down
When you turn me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh baby, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door


Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen whole minutes now
Oh baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles

The people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh baby, don't feel so down
And turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh baby, I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cus I left that night

Oh people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh baby, I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door
