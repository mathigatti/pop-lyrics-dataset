I think I know what you mean,
But watch what you say.
'Cause they'll be trying to knock you down in some way.


Sometimes it feels like the world
Is falling asleep.
How do you wake someone up
From inside a dream?

Your mind would wander and search
For its place in the night.
Your body followed this feeling
Like following light.

Once that your music was born
It followed you 'round
And then it gave your activities meaning and let you be loud.

You're sad but you smile.
It's not in your eyes.
Your eyeballs don't change.
It's the muscles around your eyes.

An egg to fertilize,
A pulse to stabilize,
A body to deodorize,
A life to scrutinize,
A child to criticize,
Young adults to modernize,
Citizens to terrorize,
Generations to desensitize.

Your dreams are sweet and obsessed,
And you're overworked.
You're overtaken by visions
of being overlooked.
How disappointed would
D(ead)I(dealisitc)D(esperate)I(inventor)P(ioneer)P(hilosophers) be
To see such power in our hands
All wasted on greed?
And I am a prisoner to instincts
Or do my thoughts
Just live as free and detatched
As boats to the dock?
Just like when music is born
And detached from your heart.
Is your free time to free minds or
For falling apart?

Night after night,
You turn out the light.
You don't fall asleep right away.
"Are we... are we done?"

A desk to organize,
A product to advertise,
A market to monopolize,
Movies stars to idolize,
Leaders to scandalize,
Enemies to neutralize,
No time to apologize,
Fury to tranquilize,
Weapons to synchronize,
Cities to vaporize.
