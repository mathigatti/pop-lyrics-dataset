It's not the first time
That I've watched you
Passing by
I've tried too hard
To get back there
But, you're not on time
Anymore


Tried to believe in you for a second time
You said the wall's closed in
But you're crawling

Back inside

So please
Run away
So please
Run away

I tried to believe in it
For a second try
It's there in the safe
Why don't you
Close the blinds

For the night?

So please
Run away
So please
Run away

So please
Run away
So please
Run away
Run away
So please
Run away
Runaway
