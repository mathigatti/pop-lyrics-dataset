Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired


Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted
When they lied I knew it was just
Stable children trying hard not to realize
I was sitting right behind her

Oh dear, can't you see?
It's them it's not me
We're not enemies
We just disagree
If I was like him
All pissed in this bar
He changes his mind
Says I went too far
We all disagree
I think we should disagree, yeah

Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying here just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired
