I was just sitting there
Dime in hand
I will be the one
And it's so easy darling,
Please take off and I'll be safe
He's all alone outside
And if you try too hard then you got to let go
I had it all worked out
And in the end I'll still be alone


In your eyes
And it is no big surprise
Safe in my eye sight, open up the EEEeee...

I wanted all of this
And in the end I'll still be alone
Atop your hills your face
Pass me down a look in your eye
And in this beacoming
You'll be changing just for me
Your screaming says that I'm
The one in looking out yourssss...
