Everybody sees me
But it's not that easy
Standing in the light field
(Standing in the light field)
Waiting for some action
(Waiting for some action)
Oh but why won't you come over here?


Why won't you come over here
We've got a city to love!
Why won't you come over here
We've got a city to love!

Old-time grudges will die so slowly
I know you miss the way I saw you

And cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold

Nobody could see me
Everything's too easy
Standing in the light field
(Standing in the light field)
Waiting for some actress
(Waiting for some actress)
To say: Why won't you come over here?

Why won't you come over here
We've got a city to love!
Why won't you come over here
We've got a city to love!

Old-time love song will die so swiftly
You never trust me
For a while it was nice
But it's time to say Bye!

Cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
No, no, no
Cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold

Oh no, no, no, no
Cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold

No no, you're so cold
