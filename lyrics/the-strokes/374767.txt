Two can be complete without the rest of the world
Two can be complete without the rest of the world
Do it for the people that have died for your sake
An entire generation that has nothing to say
How'd you make your way to me?


Let's say you made a deal with me
And I got your name and your home address
And you're all trashed up with your big red belt
I would almost say that you might need help
I could drop you off at the next red light
If it don't make sense or it don't feel right

All the girls could never make me love them the way I love you

Can't you see the sky is not the limit no more?
I can see the elevator crashed trough the floor
I can still see yesterday sailing away
Seven billion people who got nothing to say
Are you coming on to me?

I saw your face then I heard that song
It was so inviting it hurt my bones
Well it looks like you but your eyes are grey
And your hair is gone but your mind's okay
Yes I like your smile but your forehead's cold
I don't want you to be afraid and go

I would cheat and lie and steal now I'll stay at home and kneel for you

I was waiting
For my baby, to arrive
Right by my side

Oh please
Leave me alone tonight
Forget the past

Two can be complete without the rest of the world
Oh you know I said it just to get you to laugh
Do it for the people that have died for your sake
An entire generation of entertainers to blame

The light is red
The camera's on.
Get yourself a lawyer and a gun.
Hate your friend's new friends like everyone.
Childhood's end can be so competitive,
Oh sky's not the limit and your never gonna guess what is...
