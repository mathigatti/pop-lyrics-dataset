You were
(Right,) modern girls always have to go
(Right on time.)
Old-fashion men always want a mistress
(You were right,)
Modern girls always get their way
(I was wrong.)
Modern men dream of what they can't say
(That's alright.) that's alright
(I don't belong.) I don't belong


(Why you sitting over there?) why you gotta say it if you know it's sounding wrong
Says that he'll apologize and it won't take too long
(Always thinking about yourself) you don't wanna trust nobody else

(Time)
There's a few things that are gonna have to change
(I'm your son)
Everyone has the same opinion
(Won't you please)
Your time is almost over
(Don't be mean)
We won't get the chance to do this over
(That's alright) alright
(I don't belong) I don't belong

(Why you sitting over there?) I don't want the imprint of your key upon my nose
We don't have to tell no one, cuz no one wants to know
(Always thinking about yourself!) you don't have no hapiness at home

Oh yes, we're falling down (oh yes, we're falling down)
Oh yes, we're falling down (oh yes, we're falling down)
Oh yes, we're falling down (oh yes, we're falling down)
Yes, we're falling down (oh yes, we're falling down)

Oh yes, we're falling down (oh yes we're falling down)
Oh yes, we're falling down (oh yes we're falling down)
Oh yes, we're falling down (oh yes we're falling down)
So fuck and help me up (so fuck and help me up)

(You don't love me.) always thinking about yourself
(I am an animal.) always thinking about yourself
(I'm not practical.) always thinking about yourself

Was I?
Was I?
