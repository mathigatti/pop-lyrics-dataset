80's people dancing, oooh
Always get it right
I'd listen but I can't tonight
I can't tonight, I can't tonight
Well, it's something that you do to get it right
End up reviled for it
Yeah, that's the thanks I get


I don't understand
Your fucked up system, this sinister city
Try to sell the water
Try to sell the air
Try to sell your daughter
Try to sell her hair
Verse!

We all want to watch the fight
Is it on Sunday?
Hide in a hole with a gun in your hand
In front of someone you want dead
I guess
Hiding in your suit

I did not know that
They're bringing me back to my past
I got my head in my hands
I got my head in my
I got my head in my hands
I got my head in my
I got my head, it's just something that you do to get it right
End up reviled for it
And that's the thanks I get

Jail, that's what you get
Stepping to the system
Profiting from war
Fighting as the victim
Always wanting more
Trying to trick your brothers
Get them to fight it for you

I cannot believe my eyes
Darling, I can tell you lies
Coast to coast L.A. to Chicago
I don't know geography all that well

Defying Western logic
Even if it shows you're wrong
I guess that's a classic
Been with us all along
