knowing you
you'll wait for clear skies
to tell us how changes come about
with the sunlight
so we'll count drop that falls
while you throw us some old line
this will pass, this will pass
and I'm spending any time
wasting any time
you will, that's all you ever wanted
and I'm spending any time
wasting any time
you will, that's all you ever wanted
