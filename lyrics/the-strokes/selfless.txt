Can the dark side light my way? Oh, yeah, yeah
Lay your hand across my face, yeah, yeah
Time we lost, that's all my fault


Please don’t be long, 'cause I want your love
I don't have love without you arm
Life is too short, but I will live for you

How did this fit in your story? Yeah-eah
Why’d you let them judge your body? Yeah-eah
I'll be waiting' there outside, yeah

Please don't be long, 'cause I want your arm
I don't have fun without your love
Life is too short, but I will live for you
You're mucking off, but I will live for you, my selfless love

Bite my tongue and wait my turn
I waited for a century
Waste my breath, no lessons learned
I turn and face the enemy
I'm not scared, just don’t care
I’m not listening, you hear?
He's never there, but I don't care
I can't tell you what and where

Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah
