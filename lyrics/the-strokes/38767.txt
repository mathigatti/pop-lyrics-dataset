Up on a hill is where we begin
This little story a long time ago


Stop to pretend, stop pretending
It seems this game is simply never-ending

Oh, in the sun, sun having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go
Oh, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leavin' just in time
Stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
So I'll pretend I'm leaving

I feel so different now we trained in A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed, my vision's clearer now, but I'm unafraid

Flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties

Oh, in the sun, sun having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go
Oh, darling let me g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time
Stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
So this is why I'm leaving
