I can't escape it
I'm never gonna make it out of this in time
I guess that's just fine
I'm not there quite yet
My thoughts, such a mess
Like a little boy
What you runnin' for?


Arrive at the door
Anyone home?
Have I lost it all?

Struck me like a chord
I'm an ugly boy
Holdin' out the night
Lonely after light
You begged me not to go
Sinkin' like a stone
Use me like an oar
And get yourself to shore

A bang at the door
Anyone home?
It's just what they do
Right in front of you
Like a cannonball
Slammin' through your wall
In their face, I saw
What they're fightin' for

I can't escape it
I'm never gonna make it to the end, I guess

Struck me like a chord
I'm an ugly boy
Holdin' out the night
Lonely after light
Bangin' on the door
I don't wanna know
Sinkin' like a stone
So use me like an oar

Hard to fight what I canâ€™t see
Not tryna build
No dynasty
I can't see beyond this wall
But we lost this game
So many times before

I been on a cold road
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise
I been on a cold road
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise
