Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, thanks my friend, though it was too late
Oh why, oh why
I don't know


So you think things move pretty fast down here
Well, just wait my dear 'til you look up there
Oh maybe some day you'll know

Had his second kid, was an early night
Got to be well dressed 'cause he hates to fly
Oh, loves his job, takes it home

Anything they wanted
They could have it, have it
Didn't even notice
I don't mind it, mind it

Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, thanks my friend, thought that we was dead
Oh why, oh why
I don't know

Think things move pretty fast down here
But just wait, my dear 'til we get up there
Oh maybe some day they'll know

Come on, tell me does she
Warm the room when he comes
Or does he just know how to leave
When it gets cold
Well, I don't care, i don't care
'Cause it's free
