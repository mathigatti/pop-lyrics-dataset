Say it all
Just get it all off your chest
Shake it up
500,000 Times
Say no more
We don't believe anything
Teenage angst
Come all ages


Baby, show me where to go
Somethings I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
All The Time

Say it all
I'm not awake anymore
Change my mind
2,000 Times before
Seen a knight
Dance on the side of the road
Teenage angst
Come all ages

Baby, show me where to go
Somethings I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
All The Time

Feel the dizzy enough
In the running show
All I want to see
All I want to know
Watch you as you stay
Faces at your door
Waiting for your peers
Partner training, please

Baby, show me where to go
Somethings I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
Out all the time
Cause I don't wanna see everybody get together
Leave these dreams alone
You don't wanna have to tell me that I wanted you go
Everybody needs a shadow, oh
