Get dressed in your bed, while she's asleep
It isn’t right, but it isn’t hard
Tell me, tell me won't you understand
Show me, show me, show me a better plan
It’s summer lies, it’s someone else’s nothing
Here it comes now


You ask me to stay,
You ask me to stay,
You ask me to stay,
But there’s a million reasons to leave

Find a job, find a friend, find a home, find a dog
Settle down, out of town
Find a dream, shut it down!

Please, please don’t point it that way
It’s just a trigger that goes once and you’ll be unafraid
I wish that I'd been noticed, but it never goes that way
The silence that you brought has gone, gone, gone

Tell me, tell me won’t you understand?
Show me, show me, show me

You ask me to stay,
You ask me to stay,
You ask me to stay,
But there’s a million reasons to leave

Show me what to say, show me what to be
Show me what to see, show me what to be

Find a job, find a friend, find a home, find a dog
Settle down, out of town
Find a dream, shut it down!

I don’t wanna be in there with you, darling, no
I don’t wanna be in there without your loving either
I waited for your thoughts
Can’t wait no longer
