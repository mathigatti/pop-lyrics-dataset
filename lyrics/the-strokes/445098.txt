Well On Top of Me You Look This Way
Saying to Me That I Would Say
Every Little Creature That Lives Alone
Time Gets Enough to Get Him Sit Right Down


And Now Time's a Reaching and I'm Not There
And in the End and I Am Said/sad
All the Little People, They're in Your Way
And a Something..... Someone to Bowl With

And I'm Tired
But I'm Older
And I Said That I Was Wrong
And I'm Not Going That Way
See I Ain't Going That Way
And I'm Not Going That Way
And I'm Not Going That Way

In a Church Wehn Went in Your in That Fate
Bring It Down and a Past in Your Visit
All the Little Poeple That Run Around
And I Touch Them Someone That's Underground

And Hes Always 
From the Corpses 
And All a Trying Yaw Yaw Yaw (Well That's What It Sounds Like)
Finally a Part of Something New 
I'll Show Them All Back Home

Where's the Child I Overheard? 
And I'm Not Going That Way 
I'm Not Going That Way 
I'm Not Going That Way
Cause I Always Go Your Side In
