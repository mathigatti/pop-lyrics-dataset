Happiness is two different things
What you take and then what you bring
One is pleasure, one's discipline
One's devotion, one's just the ring


Desire and reward
Long term and  short term joy

Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart

One has nothing to do with the other
and the world is all cousins not brothers

Hard to take you off my love
One's an instant, one takes some will
One gives life and one makes you kill
One's the means and one's for the end

Desire and reward
Long term and  short term joy

Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart

One has nothing to do with the other
and the world is all cousins not brothers

Don't you give in,
You're beginning!
