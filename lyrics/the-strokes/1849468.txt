Putting your patience to the test
Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice


Selling your body to the street
Selling your girlfriends to the night, for cheap
Wearing a jacket made of meat
Sealing a letter made with horse's feet
And now you've heard that...

Waves turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's on USA
Platinum's on the rise
Playboys in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb

Putting your patience to the test
Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours, it's someone else's voice

And now you see that

Blondes turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's on USA
Porn's on the rise
Psycho's in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb

Darling, ain't nobody gonna tell us
They're gonna be oh so jealous
We're gonna be oh so silent
They're gonna be stoned on silence

I didn't want to ask you baby, I didn't want to ask anybody baby
Is anyone asking maybe?
Can anyone even hear me/this shit?
Why are you waiting beyond the door?

Life turns to dust
And rain turns to rust
Gossip is a truth
And money pays for the lies we trust
Your love is a surprise
Homeless saints are in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A nice place for you and I
