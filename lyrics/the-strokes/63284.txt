When I lived this life I was jus seventeen
And This house was built on mamas broken dreams
And I put it all aside
When she looked me in the eyes
Oh


And arrest these teachers for what they have read
And give all your money to the living dead
Like a call girl in her prime
Arriving just in time
Oh

I am a sentimental man
I try to reach to God with just one hand
Rejecting offers to be with you
Only does is to
Get you by your side
A new way to wave goodbye
And i'm waiting
My Lady

And i'm redefining what they could not deceive
Upon their big arrival and then she don't think
And he took them to his side,only could not wait to hide

I am a sentimental man
I try to reach to God with just one hand
Rejecting offers to be with you
Only does is to
Keep you by your side
A new way to say goodbye
And i'm waiting
My Lady

Well I lived this life and I was just seventeen
This house was built on mamas broken dreams
And I put it all aside
When she looked me in the eyes

Whose are, not for too long did I say something wrong, girl?
Will I?
