Talk to me now i'm older
You're friend told you 'cause i told her
Friday nights have been lonely
Change your plans and then phone me


We could go and get 40's(fourthies)
Fuck going' to that party
Oh,really?your folks are away now?
All right,let's go,you convinced me...

12:51
It's the time my voice
Found the words i sought
Is it the stage i want?
The world is shutting out for us
Oh,we were tense for sure
But we was confident

Kiss me now that i'm older
I won't try to control ya
Friday nights have been lonely
Take it slow but don't warn me

We could go and get 40's
Then we'd go to some party
Oh,really?your folks are away now?
All right,i'm coming,i'll be right there...
