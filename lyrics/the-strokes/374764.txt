Oh with strangers to impress so near
Old friends don't realize I'm here
I wish two drinks were always in me
I'd pretend I had the perfect day


Take me to the water
Make me understand
That I was wrong

For me tomorrow is my first day
So please don't tempt me in the wrong way

It's almost after midnight
I can see the city lights, we're here.

Change your mind tonight
You belong to the city now
and you're closer now, I know
You belong on the radio

I swear I'll give it back tomorrow
But for now I think that I'll just borrow
All the chords from that song
And all the words from that other song I heard
Yesterday

Change your mind tonight
You belong to the city now
And you're closer now, I know
You belong on the radio

I will not disturb you
I was just returning you a compliment
