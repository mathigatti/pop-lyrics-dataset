Im Tired of the Lost So Left Alone
Surrounded By the Souls Ive Grown
Arriving Just in Time to See the Earth Destroyed, Yeah
I Said Drag Me There, Or Just Take Me Home
See I Dont Mod Rock
Someday Or Never
But I Just Keep Rolling, Rolling
Protected By the Saints in All 50 States
American Minds Destined to Be Great
I'm From Around Here So I Should Know, Yeah,i Said Yeah
I Said Drag Me Home Or Just, Take Me Home
I Said Im Waiting Oh Just Say My Darling
Rolling, Rolling
I Said Yeah
(Inaudible)
Im Tired of the Lost So Left Alone
Surrounded By the Souls Ive Thrown
Arriving Just in Time to See the Earth Destroyed, Yeah
I Said Drag Me There, Or Just, Just Take Me Home
Cause I'm Leaving
And Im Rolling, Rolling
