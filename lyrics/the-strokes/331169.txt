Whether you're in L.A
Sunny laid back L.A
Wether you're in New York
Comfort 'round your block
Wether you're in the UK
Where the sky is dark
And the grass is kinda green
Ya know like Central Park


Still my favourite place in this whole wide world
Has got to be in the middle of the ocean floor
I see you poking out of the ocean paradise on earth

The 50th state, what?
Hawaii-eh!-ooohhoohhohh

Ooooooo oh oh oh!
I wanna live in something different
Oh oh oh
A nuclear disaster might be on our way
But I don't care I'm in the USA

Whether you're drunk or stoned
Or we're sober and old
If I'm with you I'm a happy man
If you feel safe and cold
While you count your gold
If your problem is you can't
Find your remote control

Still my favourite person in this whole wide world
Is a woman who could understand every word
And when she speaks to me, she makes me see the world
As my favorite place

Hawaii-eh!
We got it made
Ohhhh
Yes I know
Can we go
By plane or boat
Ohhhhhh

Whether you take it slow or you let me go
Whether you tell me somethin that I did not know
Whether you're neat and polite or you scream and fight
Whether you keep something from me that I would not like

Still my favourite attitude in this world so far
Is the friendly spirit of an iron heart
Like the way folks are in this most special place
I don't care what happens, I'm taking a plane to

Hawaii ha aw wa I e!!
Hawaii ha aw wa I e!!
I said
Hawaii ha aw wa I e!!
I said
Hawaii ha oh aw I e!!
I said
Hawaii ha ow wa I e!!

Kauai or oahu
Molokai or lanai
Maui and the big guy
A.K.A. Hawaii, Hawaii
Hawaii, Hawaii
Ooooooo oh oh oh!
All I want to do is something different
Oh, let me in
Cut off from Malaysia
Back in who knows when
Oh we got kinda lost
But my God, what a place!
I profess
Airforce jets
Cannot take
Away my soul
