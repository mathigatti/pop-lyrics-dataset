Sing me a song, you can be
Tell me a tale, just like me
Don't turn it my way, Happy and free
I'll turn it to shit, Happy and free


Oh ooh

All that I do is wait for you
All that I do is wait for you
I can't get along with all your friends
Don't know how to act
That's all there is
Why do I accept the things you say?
You know what to change
But not in what way
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?

I am not you, we could have
I'm almost through, great success
It's about time, such a success
That you came through, at no expense

Oh ooh

All that I do is wait for you
All that I do is wait for you
I can't get away from all your friends
I'm not coming back
That's all there is
Why do I accept the things you say?
You know what to change
But not in what way
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
