Ten decisions shape your life
You'll be aware of five about
Seven ways to go trough school
Either you're noticed or left out
Seven ways to get ahead
Seven reasons to drop out


When I said "I can see me in your eyes"
You said "I can see you in my bed"
That's not just friendship, that's romance too
You like music we can dance to

Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

There is a time when we all fail
Some people take it pretty well
Some take it all out on themselves
Some, they just take it out on friends
Oh, everybody plays the game
And if you don't, you're called insane

Don don don don't it's not safe no more
I've got to see you one more time
Soon, you were born in 1984

Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

Everybody was well dressed
Everybody was a mess
Six things without fail you must do
So that your woman loves just you
Oh, all the girl played mental games
And all the guys were dressed the same

Why not try it all?
If you'll only remember it once
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh uhhhhhhhhhhh uh uh uh uhh

Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

Ok, one more time
