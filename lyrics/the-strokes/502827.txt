Oh, the razorblade, that's what I call love
I bet you'd pick it up and mess around with it
If I put it down
It gets extremely complicated.
Anything to forget everything


You've got to take me out
At least once a week
Whether I'm in your arms
Or I'm at your feet
I know exactly what you're thinking
You won't say it now
But in your heart it's loud

Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry
Let it go

Oh, the razor blade,
Wish it would snap this rope
The world is in your hand
Or it's at your throat
At times it's not that complicated
Anything to forget everything

He would never talk
But he was not shy
She was a street-smart girl
But she could not lie
They were perfect for each other
Say it now
'Cause in your heart it's loud

Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry

Oh!

Sweetheart, your feelings are more important of course
Of course
Everyone that wanted
Everything that we would take from them
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

No, don't
Okay
