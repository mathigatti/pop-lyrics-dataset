Oh! Haha, I meant  ah!

Haha, no, I didn't mean that at all
Ooh, ooh, ooh


Here in the streets so mechanized
Rise to the bottom of the meaning of life
Studied all the rules and didn't want no part
But I let you in just to break this heart
Even though it was only one night
It was, fucking strange

Nina's in the bedroom
She said: Time to go now
But leavin' it ain't easy

I've got to let go
Oh, I've got to let go

And the hours they ran slow
I said, every night,
She just can't stop saying
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
But they ain't too smart
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
But they ain't too smart

Well, kill me now 'cause I let you down
I swear one day i'm  gonna leave this town
Stop

Yes, I'm leaving 'cause this just won't work
And they act like Romans, but they dress like Turks
Some time in your prime
See me, I like the summertime
But, hey

Nina's in the bedroom
She said: Time to go now
But leaving it ain't easy

Oh, I've got to let go
I've got to let go

Oh, trapped in an apartment
She would not let them get her
She wrote it in a letter
Oh I got to come clean
The authorities, they've seen
Darling, I'm somewhere in between

I said every night
She just can't stop saying:
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
But they ain't too smart
New York City cops
New York City cops
New York City cops
But they ain't too smart
