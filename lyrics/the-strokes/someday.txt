In many ways, they'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
It hurts to say, but I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes


When we was young, oh man, did we have fun
Always, always
Promises, they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

Oh, my ex says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
Are you say you wanna stay by my side
Darling, your head's not right

I see alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes

Oh, someday
No, I ain't wasting no more time

And now my fears
They come to me in threes
So I sometimes
Say faith my friend
You say the strangest things
I find sometimes

Oh, my ex says I'm lacking in depth
Say I will try my best
Are you say you wanna stay by my side
Darling, your head's not right

I see alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes

Oh, someday
No, I ain't wasting no more time
