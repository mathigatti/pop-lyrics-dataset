Last nite, she said
Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out


So I, I turned around
Oh, baby, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door

Well, I've been in town for just now fifteen, oh, minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walkin' for miles

The people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last nite, she said
Oh, baby, I don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out

So I, I turned around
Oh, baby, I gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night, yeah

Oh, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last nite, she said
Oh, baby, I feel so down
See, it turns me off
When I feel left out

So I, I turned around
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door, yeah
