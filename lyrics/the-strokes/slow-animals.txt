You don't have to be so down
Everyone can hear you in this whole damn crowd
You don't have to try so hard
I think they got the message, you were out of your mind
It's not so good to see you this upset
But the next generation will forget
They're always scared of where their daughter's been
Cause who knows, she could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again


Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong

Oh, please don't tell it to my face
Everyone can see that you were circling his space
The next generation will forget
Where their daughter's been
Or who knows, it could be alone with men
They're never gonna let you understand
Or show you what is to be a man
You don't wanna sit down and think or hear
You don't think anyone is in your ear
I never wanna see your face
Accuse - it's no ones fault

Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong

Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Now, they're scared of where their daughter's been
Cause who knows, she could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again

Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's wrong
