I'm tired
of everyone I know
Of everyone I see
on the street
and on TV, yeah


On the other side
On the other side
Nobody's waiting for me
On the other side

I hate them all
I hate them all
I hate myself for hating them
So I'll drink some more
I love them all
I'll drink even more
I'll hate them even more than I did before

On the other side
On the other side
Nobody's waiting for me
On the other side

I remember when you came
You taught me how to sing
Now, it seems so far away
You taught me how to sing

I'm tired of being so judgmental of everyone
I will not go to sleep
I will train my eyes to see
That my mind is as blind as a branch on a tree.

On the other side
On the other side
I know what's waiting for me
On the other side

On the other side
On the other side
I know you're waiting for me
On the other side.
