Well We Walked Around 
All Through That Day 
And We Couldnt Find Anything 
(Anything) 
Baby You Found It 
What You Wanted to Hear 
(Yeah) 
Baby Baby Baby 
Babies 
And Im Sorry About All That Stuff I Said 
You Think I Said 
But We Know, We Know That Its True 
Baby Baby, What About You? 
(Yeah) 
And We Walked Around All Through the Day 
The Hidden Ways of Past Gone Days 
And We Never Knew What to Say 
Baby Baby
