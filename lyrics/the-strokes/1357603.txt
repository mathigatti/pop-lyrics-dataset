Up on a hill is where we begin
This little story a long time ago
Stop to pretend, stop pretending
It seems this game is simply 


never-ending
In the sun, sun having fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you to say, "No"
Let me go, oh let me g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leavin' just in time
Stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow it is different
So I'll pretend, I'll pretend I'm 

leaving

Our fears are different here
We train in A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed
My vision's clearer now, but I'm 

unafraid
Flying overseas, no time to feel the 

breeze
Too many varieties
Well, in the sun, sun having fun
It's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now
Let me go, uh
Oh, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time
Stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow it is different
So this is why I'm leaving
