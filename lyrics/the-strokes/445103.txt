P.S if I may ask why
When will they be tired ?
We stayed up
All night tryin', tryin'


I see them and they see me
Why weren't they inspired ?
Yes, I know
That maybe we don't listen, listen

I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody

Don't worry about it honey, yeah
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody

He's lyin and i swear,
Dreams gets hard
And God sent them tossed
'cuz when the wrong girl gets lost
Give them their thoughts

Thinking 'bout that high school dance
Worried 'bout the finals
Yes, I know
That maybe we won't give up, give up

Stop

Talking in their trends of old
Yes, I start the fire
Whoa ooh ooh
Oh maybe we won't listen, listen

I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody

Don't worry about It honey, yeah
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody

He's lyin and I swear,
Dreams decide
And give them a chance
'cuz when the old men gets gone
Girls try to hard

This is the night
