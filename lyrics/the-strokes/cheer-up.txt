Now it's your birthday
Now you are turning 63
That was a while then she oh lord
But you won't get what you want


Now that you're older, now that you're wiser
You're getting cold
But though you're getting old
You know you can't stop any day

And so I'm making pose
And then I'm turning around
I couldn't make it up now
I couldn't make it all round

Oh darling cheer up now
Cheer up now
That's all and have another gee day
Oh darling cheer up now
Cheer up now
That's all and have a job and gee day

Now it tastes bitter
Now when she's bitter
It's all in time
Now is all on top
But lord you never grow any seed

Now you want what you are
But never mean what you say
You want to go and die
You're gonna die but she said, yeah

Oh darling cheer up now
You know it will be awhile
That's all, just have a gee day
Oh darling cheer up now
You know it will be awhile
That's all, have a God and gee day

I know that's all that you love me for
Yes I know, I've been so gay all day
