I wanna be outrageous
But inside I know I'm plain
So plain, just plain
Boring and plain


Silently obsessed with death
Just like anyone I guess
Trying for the perfect life
End up being in denial

I wanna be somebody
wanna be somebody like you
Like you, like you, like you
Like you, instead of me

Silently obsessed with death
Just like anyone I guess
Trying for the perfect life
End up being in denial
