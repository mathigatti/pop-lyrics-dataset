Was an honest man
Asked me for the phone
Tried to take control


Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

Oh, we shared some ideas
All obsessed with fame
Says we're all the same

Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

Raised in Carolina
I'm not like that
Trying to remind her
When we go back

I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train
I'll try but you see, it's hard to explain
I say the right thing but act the wrong way
I like it right here, but I cannot stay
I'm watching TV; forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young, and they are too old
The joke is on you, this place is a zoo
You're right it's true

He said he can't decide
I shake my head to say
"Everything's just great"

Oh, I just can't remember
I just can't remember

Raised in Carolina, she says:
"I'm not like that"
Trying to remind her
When we go back

I say the right thing but act the wrong way
I like it right here but I cannot stay
I'm watching TV; forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young, and they are too old
Oh man, can't you see, I'm nervous, so please
Pretend to be nice, so I can be mean
I missed the last bus, we'll take the next train
I'll try but you see, it's hard to explain
