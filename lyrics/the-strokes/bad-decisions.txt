Dropped down the lights, I'm sitting with you
Moscow, 1972
Always singin' in my sleep
I will leave it in my dreams


Oh, makin' bad decisions
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Oh, making bad decisions for you
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Uh-oh, makin' bad decisions
Makin' bad decisions for you

Pick up your gun
Put up your gloves
Save us from harm
Safe or alone

Oh, baby, I hang on everything you say
I wanna write down every word
But do me a favor when you come through
When I look around, don't wanna see you
I don't take advice from fools
Never listenin' to you

Oh, makin' bad decisions
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Oh, making bad decisions with you
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Uh-oh, makin' bad decisions
I'm makin' bad decisions with you

Pick up your gun
Put up those gloves
Save us from harm
Safe or alone

You, you didn't listen to me
But I, I didn't listen to you
I waited so long listening for
Something to work

I'm makin' bad decisions
Really, really bad decisions
I'm makin' bad decisions
On you, on you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm not gonna give a lot of credit
I don't know to use how
'Cause I can't, I can't
I can't, can't make it anymore
