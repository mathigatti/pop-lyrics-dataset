Right, wrong, what to do.
Someday it will come to you.
Hostile indians,
We named a summercamp for you.


I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to say
I'm in utter dismay
I've got nothin' to say

Harmless children
We named our soldiers after you.
Don't be a coconut.
God is trying to talk to you.
We could drag it out,
But that's for other bands to do.

I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to give
Got no reason to live
But I will fight to survive
I've got nothin' to hide
Wish I wasn't so shy

I'd like to watch
I'd like to read
I'd like a part
I'd like the lead

But I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to say
I've got nothin' to give
Got no reason to live
Oh I'll kill to survive
I've got nothin' to hide
Wish I wasn't so shy.
