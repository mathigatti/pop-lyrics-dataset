Leave me alone
I'm in control
I'm in control
And girls lie too much
And boys act too tough
Enough is enough


We're on the minds of other men
I know she was

I said just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it

I say, oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
And gonna break your back for a chance
And gonna steal your friends if he can
He's gonna win someday

I fell off the track
Now i can't go back
I'm not like that

Boys lie too much
Girls act too tough
Enough is enough

We're on the minds of other girls
I know he was

I said you take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it

That's right

Oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
And gonna break your back for a chance
And gonna steal your friends if he can
He's gonna win someday

Oh, he will
