Slip back, out of whack, at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army


No house phones but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?

We've got the right to live, fight to use it
Got ev'rything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

I'm tired of all your friends
List'ning at your door
I want what's better for you

So long my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you

Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you okay?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years

I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?

And they sacrifice their lives
And they lied about those odds
They'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again

So long my adversary and friend

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

I'm tired of all your friends
Banging down your door
Get up in the morning yelling: no more

So long my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you
