Shut Out, Pimpled and Angry 
I Quietly Tied All My Guts Into Knots 
Gave Up On Trying to Make Them 
I Figured It Take Them Too Long to Look Up 
And Besides 
It Was Undeniably Clear to Me I Don't Know Why 
When Every Other Part of Life 
Seemed Locked Behind Shutters 
I Knew the Worthless Dregs We All Are Then


Lucked Out 
Found My Favorite Record 
Lying in Wait At the Birmingham Mall 
The Songs That I Heard 
The Occasional Book 
Were the Only Fun I Ever Took 
And I Thought I Was Making Myself 
But the Trick Is Just Making Yourself

But When They're Parking Their Cars On Your Chest 
You Still Got a Veiw of the Summer Sky 
To Make It Hurt Twice When Your Restless Body 
Caves to It's Whims 
And Suddenly Struggles to Take Flight...

Three Thousand Miles Northeast 
I Left All My Friends At the Morning Bus Stop 
Shaking Their Heads 
"What Kind of Life You Dream Of? Your Allergic to Love" 
Yes I Know But I Must Say in My Own Defense 
It's Been Undeniably Clear to Me I Don't Know Why 
When Every Other Part of Life 
Seemed Locked Behind Shutters 
I Knew the Worthless Dregs We Are 
The Selfless, Loving Saints We Are 
The Melting, Sliding Dice We've Always Been.
