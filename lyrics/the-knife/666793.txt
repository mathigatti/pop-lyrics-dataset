We came down from the north 
Blue hands and a torch 
Red wine and food for free 
A possibility 
We share our mothers' health 
It is what we've been dealt 
What's in it for me? 
Fine 
Then I'll agree 


Trees there will be 
Apples, fruits maybe 
You know what I fear 
The end is always near 
x2 

Say you like it 
Say you need it 
When you don't 
Looking better 
Shining brighter 
Than you do 
x2 

(Repeat the 'Say you like it' sequence with the 'Trees there will be' sequence until end...)
