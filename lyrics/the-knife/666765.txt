Too far away from the city
Some kids left on their own
They said we have a communist in the family
I had to wear a mask


Too far away from the city
We had to make us room
Fathers were football players, Volvo workers, policemen
What the mothers did I didn't know

Music tonight
I just want your music tonight

I saw her by the organ
She was laughing while pressing the keys
She said my favourite book was dirty and
"You should not show you can read."

Too far away from the city
We never heard its noise
We learned how to stay fit and things like
Green tones hide the blush

Music tonight
I just want your music tonight
Music tonight
I just want your music tonight

Too far away from the city
We came to breathe clean air
Nature lovers' safe oasis
And the mothers walked towards the forest

Music tonight
I just want your music tonight
Music tonight
I just want your music tonight
