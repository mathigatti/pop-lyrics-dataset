When I saw you 
I thought that you were the one 
Looking good, I assumed you were handy 
You introduced yourself as Andy 


I thought you were the handy-man 
I laid my life in your hands 
Andy my man 
I thought you were the handy-man 

Then something went wrong 
And the feeling was so gone 
Slipped the hammer on your thumb 
And the saw got caught in your thong 

I thought you were the handy-man 
I laid my life in your hands 
Andy my man 
I thought you were the handy-man 

Then something went wrong 
And the feeling was so gone 
Slipped the hammer on your thumb 
And the saw got caught in your thong 

I thought you were the handy-man 
I laid my life in your hands 
Andy my man 
I thought you were the handy-man 

I thought you were the handy-man 
I laid my life in your hands 
Andy my man 
I thought you were the handy-man 

Handy-man 
Handy-man 
Handy-man 
I thought you were the handy-man 

Handy-man 
Handy-man 
Handy-man 
I thought you were the handy-man
