Reindeer, reindeer, reindeer
I caught one of your horns
And even if it rains here
It's much worse in the north


Reindeer, reindeer, reindeer
I caught one of your horns
And even if it rains here
It's much worse in the north

And you move like shadows
In the dark
And you glitter and you glimmer
And you bark

Moon's light the feathers
The sleigh this year is heavier
I thought we'd reached Warzava
But we are stuck in Vasa

And Santa here is faster
This house must be the last now
And we follow mister Santa
To the end

Reindeer, reindeer, reindeer
Your formate friend
Humble heavy loaded
And soon it's time again

And you move like shadows
In the dark
And you glitter and you glimmer
And you bark

Moon's light the feathers
The sleigh this year is heavier
I thought we'd reached Warzava
But we are stuck in Vasa

And Santa here is faster
This house must be the last now
And we follow mister Santa
To the end

Moon's light the feathers
The sleigh this year is heavier
I thought we'd reached Warzava
But we are stuck in Vasa

And Santa here is faster
This house must be the last now
And we follow mister Santa
To the end

And we follow mister Santa
To the end
And we follow mister Santa
To the end
And we follow mister Santa
To the end
And we follow mister Santa
To the end

Moon's light the feathers
The sleigh this year is heavier
I thought we'd reached Warzava
But we are stuck in Vasa

And Santa here is faster
This house must be the last now
And we follow mister Santa
To the end
