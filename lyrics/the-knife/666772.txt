Somebody saw me
Watching schoolgirls in their knees
But I don't know why
I am a schoolgirl's dream
I am a hunger ready to eat
But I don't know why


I just had to die
(aaaaaaa....)

Somebody saw me
Watching schoolgirls in their knees
But I don't know why
I am a schoolgirl's dream
I am a hunger ready to eat
And I can't tell you why

I had this urge to die
(aaaaaa......)

I got a bad desire
I'm on fire
I got a bad desire
I'm on fire
Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
I got a bad desire
I'm on fire
