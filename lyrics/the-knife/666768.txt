Fuu! 
I got to got to let you down 
But in an hour I will change my mind 
I got to got to let you down 
But in an hour I will change my mind 


It is like magic to me 
Making mistakes and be forgiven easely 
It is like magic to me 
Making mistakes an be forgiven easely (easely) 

Fuu! 
I know she lets me down 
But just for a short while 
Then she changes her mind 
I know she lets me down 
But just for a short while 
Then she changes her mind 

She does it all the time 
Making mistakes and then I'll ease her mind 

She does it all the time 
But she's so pretty and I don't mind 

I got to, got to let you down 
But in an hour I will change my mind 
It is like magic to me 
Making mistakes and be forgiven easely (easely) 

I got to let you down 
Got to let you down 
I got to let you down 
Got to let you down 

I know she lets me down 
But just for a short while 
Then she changes her mind 
I know she lets me down 
But just for a short while 
Then she changes her mind 

She does it all the time 
Making mistakes and then I'll ease her mind 

She does it all the time 
But she's so pretty and I don't mind 

She does it all the time 
Making mistakes and then I'll ease her mind 

She does it all the time 
but she's so pretty and I don't mind 

She does it all the time 
Making mistakes and then I'll ease her mind 

She does it all the time 
But she's so pretty and I don't mind
