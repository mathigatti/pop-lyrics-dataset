We can not wait much longer 
We want happiness back 
We want control of our bodies 
Everything we've lacked 
I think I even liked it 
If the feeling was mine 
A little something about my body 
Is it the warmth inside 


When we come home, we want it quiet and calm 
We want you to sing us a song 
When we come home, we pull the curtains down 
Making sure that the TV is on 

If you move a little closer 
I'll tell you what's my aim 
It's every evening on a big screen 
Hosted by celebrities 
I had a dream about deleting and killer whales 
Is it the feeling of your body 
Or is it the feeling of mine 

When we come home, we want it quiet and calm 
We want you to be around 
When we come home, we pull the curtains down 
Making sure that the TV is on 

From off to on 
From off to on
