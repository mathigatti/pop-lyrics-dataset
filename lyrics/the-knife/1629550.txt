We have lost the joy of the household
and the solace of our old age


She must have known how we loved her
oh that she could now know how deeply
how tenderly we do still
and shall ever love her dear joyous face

Pure and transparent
her eyes sparkled brightly
she often smiled

Often threw her head a little backwards
