Rumous telling me you are mourning 
And you haven't slept for several days. 
You?ve been turning inside out looking for reasons 
And your black sorry eyes made you pale. 


And you couldn't catch them 
You couldn't be there. 
You couldn't help them at all, 
And it was cold. 

If we say that there is something above the mountains 
If we say that there is something we can?t see. 
Promise you will never believe me 
Cause I guess I'm just trying to make it easy 

And you couldn't catch them 
You couldn't be there. 
You couldn't help them at all, 
And it was cold. 

Everybody was laughing when they found us 
One for you and one for me. 
Then they let us go to hunt us down again 
And still you refuse to see 
Why everything has to stay ugly 

Rumous telling me you are mourning 
And you haven't slept for several days. 
You've been turning inside out looking for reasons 
And your black sorry eyes made you pale.
