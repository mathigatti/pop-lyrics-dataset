Wrap your arms around me

I felt the earth
I felt the time
The sky was blue
Come, normalize
Then I got the urge for penetration


When we meet
Wrap your arms around me
Tell me all those things you haven’t told me

In the crowd
I’ll find you
On your lapel there’s a red carnation

All the things that’s left to do
Feel love and build a house with you
And free the unborn child at the castle
