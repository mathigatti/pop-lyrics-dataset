I've got a new story now and it goes like this 
I took my hand out of my pocket up came a fist 
It was headline news 
One more abuse 
I've got to tell it with a fist 
And it goes like this 


Ho ho ho ho 
Huh huh huh huh 

So where's the femininity 
The one with skirts and high heels 
A shiny sink and home made meals 
The one and only way 
If you enter you'll stay 
Sons and daughters you will breed 
As long as you breastfeed 
Yeah being a man is a bliss 
One Hit one Kiss 

Ho ho ho ho 
Huh huh huh huh 

Then the lights came on, it was all a scene 
Bend back, give head it's not pornography 
If you do it with lights then it's art you see 
If you do it with a twist 
Yes, artistically 

Ho ho ho ho 
Huh huh huh huh 

I could do the laundry 
The women's work 
For a reasonable salary I would wash the world 
It wouldn't affect my libido or my self esteem 
Don't need to mark my territory 
It's all obvious to me 
It's manhood's bliss 
One Hit one Kiss 
Spending time with my family 
Like the Corleones 

Ho ho ho ho 
Huh huh huh huh
