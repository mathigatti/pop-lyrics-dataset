No more tears and you'll be fine 
I stay here all night 
And when I've stayed all night 
We go out in the morning light 


And then you try to live the day 
I don't know how, but I know what to say 
Is it medicine or social skill 
Don't have the answer and nobody will 
You go screaming on without a word 
Being sad is a fulltime work 
And now the day has come to an end 
And then you start to cry again 

Is it medicine? 
Is it medicine, is it medicine or social skill? 
Is it medicine, is it medicine, is it medicine or social skill?
