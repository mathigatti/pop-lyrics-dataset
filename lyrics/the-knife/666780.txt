Charlotta making lasagna 
With me above the clouds 
Charlotta making lasagna 
With me above the clouds 
But you could have waited 


You could have locked yourself up 
For ten years or so 
And when you finally came out 
There would still be no chances for you 

Charlotta running around with Felicia 
Charlotta running around with Felicia 
But you could have waited 

You could have locked yourself up 
For ten years or so 
And when you finally came out 
There would still be no chances for you 

I look for moves and I search for breaths 
Soon it leaves me 
Thinking about death 

I look for moves and I search for breaths 
Soon it leaves me 
Thinking about death 

Beautiful sky 
My car and me leave town for a while 
You are a yellow surprise 
Noticing water is friendly sometimes 
But you could have waited 

You could have locked yourself up 
For ten years or so 
And when you finally came out 
There would still be no chances for you 

But you could have waited (waited) 
But you could have waited (waited) 

I look for moves and I search for breaths 
Soon it leaves me 
Thinking about death 

I look for moves and I search for breaths 
Soon it leaves me 
Thinking about death 

Waited 
Waited 
Waited
