In the middle of nowhere 
When we're looking for something 
Then we raise our heads for the colour red 
I am too a spirit and a wonderer 
And I welcomed the dew as much as you did 


When we're looking for brushwood 
In the nearest neighbourhood 
Then we follow the sky with the eye 
We search vegetation 
And surprised by the rain 
We're stumbling, tripping home again 

In the middle of nowhere 
When we're looking for something 
Then we raise our heads for the colour red 
I am too a spirit and a walker 
And I welcomed the dew as much as you did 

We found the little man 
And his aeroplane 
But we never located the animal 
Examined the dirty ground 
Like it never been done 
Modern exploring of 1991
