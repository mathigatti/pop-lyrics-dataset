Reindeer, reindeer, reindeer 
I caught one of your horns 
And even if it rains here 
It's much worse in the north 


Reindeer, reindeer, reindeer 
I caught one of your horns 
And even if it rains here 
It's much worse in the north 

And you move like shadows 
In the dark 
And you glitter and you glimmer 
And you bark 

Hooves light as feathers 
The sleigh this year is heavier 
I thought we'd reached Warszawa 
But we are stuck in Vasa 

And Santa he is faster 
This house must be the last now 
And we follow mister Santa 
To the end 

Reindeer, reindeer, reindeer 
You're a form made friend 
Humble heavy loaded 
And soon it's time again 

And you move like shadows 
In the dark 
And you glitter and you glimmer 
And you bark 

Hooves light as feathers 
The sleigh this year is heavier 
I thought we'd reached Warszawa 
But we are stuck in Vasa 

And Santa he is faster 
This house must be the last now 
And we follow mister Santa 
To the end 

Hooves light as feathers 
The sleigh this year is heavier 
I thought we'd reached Warszawa 
But we are stuck in Vasa 

And Santa he is faster 
This house must be the last now 
And we follow mister Santa 
To the end 

And we follow mister Santa 
To the end 
And we follow mister Santa 
To the end 
And we follow mister Santa 
To the end 
And we follow mister Santa 
To the end 

Hooves light as feathers 
The sleigh this year is heavier 
I thought we'd reached Warszawa 
But we are stuck in Vasa 

And Santa he is faster 
This house must be the last now 
And we follow mister Santa 
To the end
