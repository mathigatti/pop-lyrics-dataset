I live in a tree
Come home at night
Then I watch TV
Pass me the salt
By friends are birds around here
They feed me leaves
I am a tree, I am a tree


Alright!
All night!

You were on the roof top
You were looking for me
On our own island
You'll soon find me
On the train from Stockholm
Gothenburg is fear
I am a tree, I am a tree

After a while
I laid my head down and cry
And I will talk for a while
And I started to ask people why

It was warm and friendly
They were were having ice
On the avenue
Make your choices carefully

Alright!
All night!

I live in a tree
They feed me leaves

But after a while
I laid my head down and cry
And I will talk for a while
And I started to ask people why

I live in a tree
They feed me leaves
