An intersection of the plain
by the bank of some great stream
the animal carcasses
and skeletons would be
entombed
Tomorrow in a year
tomorrow in a million years
Ages resting in
the rings of a tree.
Fossils in lay in slate
marking the old forest's edge
I've stood on a mountain
dividing three regions.
Then it was just a pebble
that I held inside my hand
In between each flap
of a butterfly's wings,
countless changes
that have gone on unnoticed
A cricket rubs it's forewings
together and I am forced
to think of the time that it's taken
to build


Mountains fossils

Larva lava

As Algae moves through water.
Cupping the soil
Ages move across epochs.
Within my hands
There's grandeur in this view,
It teams with life
a constant succession
these endless forms
My heart beats 70
times per minute

Stretching out over years
a wilderness
layer on layer life embedded in stone
stretching out before me
a wilderness.
