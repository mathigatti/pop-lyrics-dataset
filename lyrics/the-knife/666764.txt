If I was a bird 
I would fly high over the world 
Come home at night to your garden 
Build a nest among the branches 
And I'll comb your hair with my beak 


If I was a bird 
I would count my time in pearls 
Under my wings you'll find shelter 
You'll breed bugs and keep me well fed 
And I proclaim the reason why I'll have to fly 

But you wanted me to be a girl 
Without feathers without urge 
Then my wings quick dissappeared 
And left was only fear 
And I proclaim the reason why I'll have to fly 

Proclaim the reason why I'll have to fly 
I'll have to fly
