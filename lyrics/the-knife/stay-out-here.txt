Lose a wall, love me
As I move that street
As I walk block block
As I move that street
As I walk block block


Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me

Stay out here
Stay out here
It is happening

They work the world as it will be
Is now when they dance
Just so just now, the euro falls
Our short century

Times Square, unauthorized, you, me
Are you on your way?
Just so just how I hear the call
Our short century

You have the most original way
Of putting one foot in front of the other

One foot yours, one mine
One foot yours, one mine
One foot yours, one mine
One foot yours, one mine

Stay out here
Stay out here
It is happening

That bridge, my back, was my first song
Lose and down, been long
And this time this time this time time
What is remembered?
Weâ€™re too much
How to stay un-down?

You have the most beautiful way
Of putting one foot in front of the other

Being horizontal is wonderful
Most things we love are open ended

Lose your way love me
Most things we love are open ended
Stay out here
It will get more frightening

Lose your way, your way
Lose your way, your way

Putting one foot in front of the other
Putting one foot in front of the other
Putting one foot in front of the other
Putting one foot in front of the other

Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
As I move that street
As I walk block block
As I make shape across your lawn
