I'm coming over but I won't be long 
I'm coming over 
I'm making a new song 


I pick a car and it's a fifteen minutes drive 
Rock Classics on the radio 
To clear my mind 

Sometimes in the weekends 
We meet up at our favourite cafe 
I'll order a chai tea and you will have the usual au lait 
And when the place get crowded 
Then they freak out 
And they play the techno louder 
Yes, when the place get crowded 
Then they freak out 
And they play the techno louder 

Here comes another day in isolation 
Hold out your hand 
Feel my brain burns 
You suck and lick but you still don't know why 
I could fuck your brains out 
But I'm not interested in that life 

Sometimes in the weekends 
We meet up at our favourite cafe 
I'll order a chai tea and you will have the usual au lait 
And when the place get crowded 
Then they freak out 
And they play the techno louder 
Yes, when the place get crowded 
Then they freak out 
And they play the techno louder 

I'm coming over but I won't be long 
I'm coming over 
I'm making a new song
