I've got soul in my bones 
Got a home, a dog and a man to call my own 
Every month 
I've got my period 
To take care of 
And to collect in blue tampons 


Na na na 
Na na na 

I've got mace, pepper-spray 
And some shoes that runs faster than a rapist rapes 
What I need is chemical castrations, hope and godspeed 

Na na na 
Na na na 

What I need is chemical castrations, hope and godspeed...
