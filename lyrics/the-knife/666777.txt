Listen now 
I am afraid of everything 
When you told me I was special 
It was the happiest moment for a long long time 


Listen now 
I keep forgetting your name 
When you laid down on the kitchen floor 
It was the happiest moment for a long long time 

We seek new seed now 
Some revolutionary 
And you will never get a hold 
We seek and we will find 
Reason to stay alive 
The price has never been this low 

Listen now 
I was afraid of everything 
Then I straightened my head up 
It was the happiest moment for a long long time 

We seek new seed now 
Some revolutionary 
And you will never get a hold 
We seek and we will find 
Reason to stay alive 
The price has never been this low 

We seek new seed now 
Some revolutionary 
And you will never get a hold 
We seek and we will find 
Reason to stay alive 
The price has never been this low
