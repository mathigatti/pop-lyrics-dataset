The doctor came in the morning 
She held my hand 
And asked "was it worth it?" 
"Could it be worse than this?" 
Please recall 
Give me a hint 
Anything will do 
If this was the last time now you should tell us what to do 


I was afraid I guess 
Now I can't think no more 
I was so concentrated 
On keeping things together 
I've learned to focus on 
I didn't want to disappoint 
Now where is everybody 
Is it still light outside?
