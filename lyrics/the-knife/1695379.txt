I don't like slippery old men
Who's got no women friends
Too rigid and too well-paid
I like the feminist way


I don't like national borders
I don't like them who like meat
We like to swing with our friends who
Are solitary to greet

Don't like the astrolic reviewer
He has his head up his ass
He liked the smell of the inside
Through the sound of rock'n'roll

Rock'n'roll
Hoa, hoa, hoa
Ha!

Don't like the voices of the right wing
Got my heart to the left
I like the lady in red, yeah
This is a socialist

Hoa, hoa
Hoa, hoa
Ha!

Rock'n'roll
