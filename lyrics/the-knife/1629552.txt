White sand made up of shells upon which rests carious rock
Then prismatic feldspar between these and former ones
Hard white rock with yellow spots
A heap of white balls beneath white sand


Same process now going on shore, living iron found in it
Sand white from decomposition of feldspar in places
Every rock is covered with pistiform concretions
 in places impossible to tell whether it is breccia of modern or older days

Lower beds of white sand become filled with large boulders of lower rocks
Beneath this comes a line of another stratum
More soily and contains large and more numerous shells
A regular bed of oysters remains attached to the rocks
