I heard a puff, I heard a blow
I felt the ground, I felt the snow 
I thought of linen and old lace
I never really saw his face 
I heard a grunt, I heard a moan 
I felt the sun, I saw the moon 
I saw the northern light above 
And the eclipse of the sun 
I am a breath, I am a wish 
I am a rocket, And a fish 
I felt his measures and his weight 
My own body as a scale 
You heard a whisper in my ear 
You are not here, you are not there 
I saw the northern light above 
The eclipse of the sun 
My feet was hurt, my knees were sore 
And I wondered why he burned 
And I wondered why he burned

I felt his measures and his weight 
My own body as a scale 
You heard a whisper in my ear 
You are not here, you are not there 
So in love that I could die 
The eclipse of the sun 
My feet was hurt, my knees were sore 
And I wondered why it burned 
And I wondered why it burned 

Then I had to climb down 
I went up to see the sun rise 
And then I had to climb back up again 
I had to be there to see the sun rise 
For the air that you sent to guide me 
Had a tonne of elephant grey 
We were all there in the morning
We were there and we wanted to stay
Then I had to climb down
I went up to see the sun rise
And then I had to climb back up again
I had to be there to see the sun rise
For the air that you sent to guide me
Had a tonne of elephant grey
We were all there in the morning
We were there and we wanted to stay
