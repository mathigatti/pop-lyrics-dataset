Sharpen my body like a pen 
Come on I need to show it 
Something too small for a lense 
If I rub it if I wipe it 


Guiding with one single hand 
Nothing's wrong you like the feeling 
I am all over the land 
Come on I need to show it 

Back on the mountain again 
I was standing watching seasons 
You're now my only friend 
I'm too heavy, I'm the burden 

Sitting and picking on myself 
It's a shiny, shiny morning 
And when the light finds my eye 
I'll be fleeting like a scent 

I hold my breath and I count to three 
On and on outworn 
It must be five hundred degrees 
Will it show, in my show 
x2
