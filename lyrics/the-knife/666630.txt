We are the people who's come here to play 
I don't like it easy 
I don't like the straight way 
We're in the middle of something 
We're here to stay 
And we raise our heads for the colour red 


I'm in the first row on your show 
In the first row on the First Floor Power show 
Your vibrato's like vulnerable leaves 
You do it crazy 
That's how you talk to me 

We are the people who's come here to play 
I don't like it easy 
I don't like the straight way 
We're in the middle of something 
We're here to stay 
And we raise our heads for the colour red 

I heard you for the first time on the radio 
When I was going somewhere in a car 
You touched my heart 
Like a knife that's very sharp 
Or like a bird, you just set free 
That?s just like me 
(I keep my knife sharp) 
When I hear you speak 

We are the people who's come here to play 
I don't like it easy 
I don't like the straight way 
We're in the middle of something 
We're here to stay 
And we raise our heads for the colour red 

I like vanilla and I like sex 
I ride the pony that I like best 
I knew I knew that there was something I missed 
I was fifteen when I first got kissed 
Before I knew about the equality way 
I wanted to get laid to "Take my breath away" 

We are the people who's come here to play 
I don't like it easy 
I don't like the straight way 
We're in the middle of something 
We're here to stay 
And we raise our heads for the colour red 

We are the people who's come here to play 
I don't like it easy 
I don't like the straight way 
We're in the middle of something 
We're here to stay 
And we raise our heads for the colour red
