We were looking for a room 
We were looking for a hotel 
We were in between 
We were a few chosen 
Somewhere to fit in 
Somthing that?s fit in 
After one day it started itching 
And we rubbed until it was bleeding 


And we ran through the moonlight far beyond 
And we laughed at the moonlight far beyond 

We were looking for something to blow up 
We were looking for someone to follow 
We had one way out 
We had some hours left 
We were so close 
We knew we were chosen 
We aimed for high speed 
And for someone who could catch me 

And we laughed at the moonlight far beyond 
And we ran through the moonlight far beyond 

We were looking for a room 
We were looking for something to blow up 
We knew we were chosen 

And we laughed at the moonlight far beyond 
And we ran through the moonlight far beyond 

And we laughed at the moonlight far beyond 
And we ran through the moonlight far beyond
