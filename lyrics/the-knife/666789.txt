I never knew this could happen to me 
I know now fragility 
I know there's people who I haven't told 
I know of people who are getting old 


Wish I could speak in just one sweep 
What you are and what you mean to me 
Instead I mumble randomly 
You stand by and enlighten me 

In a dream I lost my teeth again 
Calling me woman and half man 
Yes in a dream all my teeth fell out 
A cracked smile and a silent shout 
A cracked smile and a silent shout 

If I explain it once thoroughly 
He'll have you later 'cause it's never free 
You were at the gigantic spree 
I caught a glimpse now it haunts me 
I caught a glimpse now it haunts me
