Northern forms existed in their own homes
Thousand - yellow - cocoons
Under - over - through


A few southern vegetable forms
On the mountains of Borneo
Under - over - through
Donkey - peacock - goose

In the mouth of the river
A strange - scene - it is
Every - thing - in flames

The sky with lightning
And the water, luminous
A strange - scene - it is
Under - over - through

Six weeks old
Henrietta smiled for the first time
Tail - habits - proof
Instinct - that - moves

Emma saw him smile
Not only with lips
But eyes
Erasmus - grab - a spoon
Europe - hides - wool

Mr Peacock and Captain Beaufort
Endemic - alpine - grooves
Bread-fruit - cinnamon - tunes

Tonight it's blowing
Thick bodies of spray whirled across the bay
Whatever - might - have been
The cause - of the - retreat

Columbia livia
Great ages through
Course of days
Tumblers, Jacobins
Beak shapes, skeletal traits
Runts and Carriers
Wooden hexagonal cage
Pouters and Fantails
Tail feathers at what age?
Grey and white spotted
Markings in making
My great amusement

Behind Land house a gental cooing
Behind Land house the offspring's moving
The delight of once again being home
The delight of once again being home
