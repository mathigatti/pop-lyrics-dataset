A stream of lava formerly flowed
over the bed of sea
triturated recent shells and corals
baked into hard white rock
A precarious matter.


I found a curious little stony Cellaria
each cell provided with
a long toothed bristle
capable of various and rapid motions
often simultaneous, and can be produced
by irritation.
