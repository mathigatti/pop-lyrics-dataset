Something's got a hold on my head
And it won't leave me alone
Neon when you come on


Something's got a hold on my head
And it won't let me go
Neon when you come on

Something's got a hold on my head
And I didn't know
Neon when you come on

Something's got a hold on my head
And no, I didn't know
Neon when you come on
(And you) Come on

It brings a new type of grace
And they keep coming back for more
And it leaves me with a shimmering face
And they keep coming back
For more

And it brings a new type of grace
And they keep coming back for more
And it leaves me with a shimmering face
And they keep coming back
For more

Neon when you come on home
Neon when you come on home
Neon when you come on home
Neon when you come on home
Neon when you come on home
Neon when you come on hom

(Neon) And it brings a new type of grace
And they keep coming back for more
(Neon) And it leaves me with a shimmering face
And they keep coming back
Back for more
