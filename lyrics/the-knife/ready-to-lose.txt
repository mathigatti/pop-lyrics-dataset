Thinking about a mouth that waters
Thinking about losing
Sucking the marrow, feeding a pain
Facing a consequence


The blood
The mine
The yours
Combined
Blood control
A hazy line
Rearranging
Of desires

Ready, ready to lose a privilege
Ready, ready to lose a privilege

Dysfunctional culture, spin me away
Preserving a blood line
Fear of suffering, fear of loss
Sucked in your birthrights

The blood
The mine
The yours
Combined
Blood control
A hazy line
Rearranging
Of desires

Ready, ready to lose a privilege
An ongoing habit
A transfer of possessions

Ready, ready to lose a privilege
A final sequence
An end to succession
