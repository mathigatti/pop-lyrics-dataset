I took a cab there to hold her
I took a plane there to feel what she felt
You make me like charity
Instead of paying enough taxes

I took a plane there to feel what she felt
You make me like charity
Instead of paying enough taxes

I took a cab there to hold her
I took a plane there to feel what she felt
You make me like charity
Instead of paying enough taxes
