I'm in love with your brother
What's his name?
I thought I'd come by
To see him again
When you two danced
Oh what a dance
When you two laughed
Oh what a laugh
Has he mentioned my age love?
Or is he more into young girls with dyed black hair?
I'm in love with your brother
I thought I'd come by


I'm in love with your brother
Yes I am
But maybe I shouldn't ask for his name
And you danced
Oh what a dance
And you laughed
Oh what a laugh
Does he know what I do?
And you'll pass this on, wont you?
And if I ask him once what would he say?
Is he willing?
Can he play?

I wasn't really looking for some more than
Some company on the dancefloor and
Does he know what I do ? and
You'll pass this on, won't you? and

If I ask him once what would he say?
Is he willing?
Can he play?

Does he know what I do?
And you'll pass this on, wont you?
And if I ask him once what would he say?
Is he willing?
Can he play?

I wasn't really looking for some more than
Some company on the dancefloor and
Does he know what I do ? and
You'll pass this on, won't you? and
