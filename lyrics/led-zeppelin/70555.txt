I've been to London, seen seven wonders
I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for


There can be no denying
That the wind'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flying
And there's a new plague on the land

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands

Traversed the planet, when heaven sent me
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight
I hear the rested rivers call

And the wind is crying
From a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying
On the dark side of the globe

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands

You got me rocking when I ought to be a-rolling
Darling, tell me, darling, which way to go
You keep me rocking, baby, then you keep me stalling
Won't you tell me, darling, which way to go, that's right

Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry
And I would dearly like to know
I've all this wonder, of earthly plunder
Will it leave us anything to show?

And our time is flying
See the candle burning low
Is the new world rising
From the shambles of the old

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just, if we could just, if we could just
If we could just, if we could just join hands

That's all it takes, that's all it takes
That's all it takes, that's all it takes

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
