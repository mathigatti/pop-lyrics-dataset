Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman, who knows


I said it's alright, you know it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

Crazy ways are evident
In the way that you're wearing your clothes
Sipping, booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

You know it's alright, you said it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

I told your mama, I'd get you home
But I didn't say I got no car
I saw a lion, he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar

You know it's alright, you said it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman, who knows

I said it's alright, you know it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
