Queen of light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The prince of peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone


Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The dark lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all

Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all

I hear the horses thunder
Down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

The apples of the valley hold
The seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no

Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red

Oh, in war is the common cry
Pick up you swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know

Oh well, the night is long
The beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on

Sing as you raise your bow
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire tonight
That lights the face so cold

Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The magic runes are written in gold
To bring the balance back, bring it back

At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes
