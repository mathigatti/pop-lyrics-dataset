Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, walk a while with me
You've got so much


Many have I loved
Many times been bitten
Many times
I've gazed along the open road

Many times I've lied
Many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered
How much there is to know

Many dreams come true
And some have silver linings
I live for my dream
And a pocketful of gold

Mellow is the man who knows
What he's been missing
Many many men
Can't see the open road

Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing about a thing
You really ought to know
Oh, you really ought to know
