Been in town, my baby
We just got to rock on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah darling
We just got to go home


I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on baby, just rock, rock, rock

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah honey
We've been shaking all night
Oh, oh, oh, oh darling, we just got to roll right
Ooh, my head, rock on, rock on

Hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe

I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on baby, just rock, rock, rock

I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on baby, just rock, rock, rock
