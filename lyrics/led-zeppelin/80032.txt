If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home


Don't it make you feel bad
When you're trying to find your way home
You don't know which way to go?
If you're going down South
They go no work to do
If you don't know about Chicago

Crying won't help you
Praying won't do you no good
Now, crying won't help you
Praying won't do you no good
When the levee breaks
Mama, you got to move

All last night sat on the levee and moaned
All last night sat on the levee and moaned
Thinking about my baby and my happy home
Going, going to Chicago, going to Chicago
Sorry, but I can't take you
Going down, going down now, going down
