Leaves are falling all around, it's time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged
For such a pleasant stay, but now it's time for me to go
The autumn moon lights my way


For now I smell the rain
And with it pain, and it's headed my way
Sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on and now's the time, the time is now, to sing my song
I'm going around the world, I got to find my girl, on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And to our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on and now's the time, the time is now, to sing my song
I'm going around the world, I got to find my girl, on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old when magic filled the air
T'was in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah

Ramble on and now's the time, the time is now, to sing my song
I'm going around the world, I got to find my girl, on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Gonna ramble on, sing my song, gotta keep-a-searching for my baby
Gonna work my way, around the world
I can't stop this feeling in my heart, gotta keep-a-searching for my baby
I can't find my bluebird
