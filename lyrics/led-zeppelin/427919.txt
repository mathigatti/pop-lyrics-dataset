Some people like to rock, some people like to roll
But movin' and a-groovin's gonna satisfy my soul
Let's have a party
Woo, let's have a party
Send `em to the store 
Let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight


Now, Honky-Tonky Joe is knockin' at the door
Bring him in, fill him up, an' sit him on the floor
Let's have a party
Woo, let's have a party
Well, send him to the store 
Let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

I never kissed a bear, I never kissed a 'coon
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room
Let's have a party
Yeah, let's have a party
Send him to the store 
Let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight
We gonna have a party tonight!
