Sometimes i will, then again i think i won't
Sometimes i will, then again i think i won't
Sometimes i do, then again i think i don't


Well, i looked at my watch it was nine twenty-one
't was at a rock 'n' roll dance havin' nothin' but fun
We rolled, reelin' and a-rockin'
We was reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn

Well, i looked at my watch, it was nine thirty-two
There's nothin' i'd rather do than dance with you
And we rolled, reelin' and a-rockin'
We was reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn

Well, i looked at my watch, it was nine forty-three
And every time i spin, she spins with me
And we rolled, reelin' and a-rockin'
We was reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn
Yeah, well all right!

Yeah, i looked at my watch, it was ten 0-five
Man, i didn't know if i was dead or alive
But i rolled, reelin' and a-rockin'
I was reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn

Yeah, i looked at my watch, it was ten twenty-six
I'm gonna keep on dancin' till i get my kicks
I was reelin', reelin' and a-rockin'
We's reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn

Well, i looked at my watch and to my surprise
I was dancin' with a woman that was twice my size
I was reelin', reelin' and a-rockin'
We's reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn

Well, i looked at my watch, and it was time to go
The band leader said, "we ain't playin' no more"
We were rollin', reelin' and a-rockin'
We was reelin' and a-rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn
