Lying, cheating, hurting
Thatâ€™s all you seem to do
Messing around with every guy in town
Putting me down for thinking of someone new


Always the same, playing your game
Drive me insane, trouble is gonna come to you
One of these days and it won't be long
You'll look for me but baby I'll be gone
This is all I gotta say to you woman

Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come

Made up my mind to break you this time
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry
Do what you want I won't take the brunt
It's fading away, can't feel you anymore

Don't care what you say
'Cause I'm going away to stay
Gonna make you pay
For that great big hole in my heart

People talking all around, watch out woman
No longer is the joke gonna be on my heart
You been bad to me woman
But it's coming back home to you

Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
