Nobody's fault but mine
Nobody's fault but mine
Trying to save my soul tonight
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine


Devil he told me to roll
Devil he told me to roll
How to roll the log tonight
Nobody's fault but mine

Brother, he showed me the gong?
Brother, he showed me the ding-dong, ding-dong
How to roll the log tonight
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

Got a monkey on my back
Mo, mo, mo, mo, monkey on my back, back, back, back
Gonna change my ways tonight
Nobody's fault but mine

I will get down rolling tonight
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, nobody's fault
