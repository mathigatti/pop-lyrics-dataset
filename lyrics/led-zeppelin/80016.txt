Hangman, hangman
Hold it a little while
Think I see my friends coming
Riding a many mile


Friends, did you get some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my dear friends
To keep me from the gallows pole?
What did you bring me to keep me from the gallows pole?

I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know that we're too damn poor
To keep you from the gallows pole
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my brother coming
Riding a many mile

Brother, did you get me some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my brother
To keep me from the gallows pole?

Brother, I brought you some silver
I brought a little gold, I brought a little of everything
To keep you from the gallows pole
Yes, I brought you to keep you from the gallows pole

Hangman, hangman
Turn your head awhile
I think I see my sister coming
Riding a many mile, mile, mile

Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand
Take him to some shady bower
Save me from the wrath of this man
Please take him
Save me from the wrath of this man, man

Hangman, hangman
Upon your face a smile
Pray tell me that I'm free to ride
Ride for many mile, mile, mile

Oh, yes, you got a fine sister
She warmed my blood from cold
Brought my blood to boiling hot
To keep you from the gallows pole

Your brother brought me silver
Your sister warmed my soul
But now I laugh and pull so hard
And see you swinging on the gallows pole
Swinging on the gallows pole
