I told you, baby, long time ago
I don't want no woman, baby, mess around my door
I gotta move, baby, baby, baby, I got to move
I don't want you messing woman
I don't want your fooling round with me


Hey, told you, baby, once upon a time
You would be my woman
Said, oh, you'll be mine
But that is alright, that's alright, alright
Whoa that is alright, baby
Treat me wrong tonight

Whoa, don't want you, baby
Always fooling round with me
Oh no, no, no, no, I don't want my baby
Always fooling round with me
She tries to make me leave her
Always get away from me
