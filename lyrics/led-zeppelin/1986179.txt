I just got your letter baby
Too bad you can't come home
I swear i'm goin' crazy
Sittin' here all alone
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues


I ain't slept a week since sunday
I can't eat a thing all day
Every day is just blue monday
Since you've been away
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues

Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace

Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace

I gotta get myself together
Before i lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train goin'
And leave my blues behind
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
I got a mess of blues
