Then as it was, then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes, rivers always reach the sea


Blind stars of fortune, each have several rays
On the wings of maybe, down in birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
But as the eagle leaves the nest, it's got so far to go

Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be

Did you ever really need somebody and really need 'em bad
Did you ever really want somebody, the best love you ever had
Do you ever remember me, baby, did it feel so good
'Cause it was just the first time and you knew you would

Through the eyes and I sparkle, senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way, see your feathers preen
Kind of makes makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, the nest is in our soul

Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be

Oh darling, oh darling
Oh darling, oh yeah, oh darling

I'm never gonna leave you
I'm never gonna leave

Holding on, ten years gone
Ten years gone, holding on
