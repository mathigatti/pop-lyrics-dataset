Oh, know I feel's so strange looking at the door
Oh, trying hard to change and can't let go
Oh, crying tears of pain hurting more and more
Oh, every day's the same as you walk the floor


I'm walking the floor over you
I'm walking the floor

Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
Oh, to the hand that takes your dreamless soul
Oh, is it long to wait, is there much to pay?
Oh, sometimes it's hard waiting the day

You know, it's hard
I said it's hard, you know, it's true
I said it's hard, you know, it's hard
Still know it's true

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
And you stand alone, do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

Every love that's changed spend it fully
In the eyes of the night was it hard to see?
If it never fails in spite of it all
So you hide in the tears, enter Walter's walk

Know it's true now
You know, it's true now, oh yeah
I'm walking the floor over you
I'm walking the floor

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
As you stand alone, do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

Does it matter now, does it?
Now does it matter?
Now does it matter?
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh little baby, don't you know?

Every tear that falls
Does it matter now?
Does it matter now?
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yes
