Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teaching the golden role
American history and pracitcal math
You study them hard, hoping to pass
Working your fingers right down to the bone
The guy behind you won't leave you alone


Ring, ring, goes the bell
The cook in the lunchroom is ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open your books
Keep it the teacher don't know how mean she looks

Soon as 3 o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burdon down
Close up your books get out of your seat
Down the halls and in to the street
Up to the corner and round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in

Drop the coin right in to the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're making romance
All day long you been wanting to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe
Round and round, and round you go

Drop the coin right in
Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock 'n' roll
The feeling of drums loud and bold
Rock! Rock! Rock 'n' roll
The feeling is there body and soul
