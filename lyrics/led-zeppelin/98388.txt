The girl I love, yeah, she got long black wavy hair, oh yeah
Her mother and her father, lord
They sure don't, sure don't allow me there


Well, I'm going back to my baby, lord

A five long years gone by, yeah

Well, I'm going ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-home, I'm going home

Well, my baby when
She shakes just like a willow tree

Ah, that mean, mistreating baby
She know she
Hop, hops all over me
