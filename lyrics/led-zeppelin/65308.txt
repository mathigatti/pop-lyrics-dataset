It's been a long time since I rock and roll
It's been a long time since I did the stroll
Let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I came from?
It's been a long time, been a long time


Been a long lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely time

Yes, it has

It's been a long time since the book of love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I came from
It's been a long time, been a long time

Been a long lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely time

Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms, open your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in
It's been a long time, been a long time

Been a long lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely time
