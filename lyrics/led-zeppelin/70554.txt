Drop down, baby, let your daddy see
Drop down, mama, just dream of me
Well, my mama allow me to fool around all night long
Well, I may look like I'm crazy, I should know right from wrong


See me comin', throw your man out the door
Ain't no stranger, been this way before
See me comin', mama, throw your man out the door
I ain't no stranger, I been this way before

Put on your night shirt and your morning gown
You know by night I'm gonna shake 'em down
Put on your night shirt Mama, and your morning gown
Well, you know by night I'm gonna shake 'em down

Shake it, shake it

Your custard pie, yeah, sweet and nice
When you cut it, mama, save me a slice
Your custard pie, I declare, it's sweet and nice
I like your custard pie
When you cut it, mama, mama, please save me a slice

Oh, I chew on a piece of your custard pie
I chew on a piece of your custard pie
I chew on a piece of your custard pie
I chew on a piece of your custard pie

Drop down, drop down, drop down
Drop down, drop down, drop down

I chew on a piece of your custard pie
