Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
Stars to fill my dream
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been


To sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
They talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, I been flying
Mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, yeah, I've been flying
Mama, ain't no denying, no denying

All I see turns to brown as the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land trying to find
Trying to find, trying to find where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Hid the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream

My Shangri-la beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When moving through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision, but an open face
Along the straits of fear

Oh, oh, oh, oh

When I'm on
When I'm on my way, yeah
When I see
When I see the way, you stay, yeah

Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah
When I'm down
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah
When I'm down
Oh, my baby, oh, my baby
Let me take you there
