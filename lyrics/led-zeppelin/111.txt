There was a time
I used to call you on my very own
We were so happy woman
Talkin' for hours and hours on the telephone


Then one day
I set you up to walk right outta my life
Leaving' me all by myself
All alone, to cry every night

(Babe...) oooh, I want you to come back home yeah (come onhome)
(oooh yeah)
Sweet little girl
(ooh yeah, been gone so long)
You've been away so long

Now listen to me

I said I made up my mind
Woman when you left me there, oh
I was gonna find another sweet lover
Who's gonna feel all of my... cares

So I met a sweet little girl
Just about as nice as she could be, oh
I fell in love with that woman
But she turned around, and did the same thing again to me,woohoo...

(Babe...) Baby, please come home (come on home) home yeah...
I know, (ya been gone too long) been away so long
(Babe...) I want you to please come home, oh (come onhooome...)
(Oooh yeah)
(Ya been gone too long)

So I made up my mind
I gonna crawl right back to you woman
I'm gonna plead and plead and plead, yeah
'Till you're here by my side
I can't even walk down the same old streets we used to walkdown
'Cause I keep thinkin about all the good times
Keep thinkin' about it
I wanna make you mine
ooh babe

babe, babe, babe, please (come on home, yeah) (come on home)
(ya been gone too long)

I want you to...oh! (babe... come on home)
I want you to come back running home to me woman (oooh yeah)
I want you to think
