Been workin' from seven to eleven every night
Really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right


I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah

'Cause I love you, baby
How I love you darling
How I love you, baby
My beloved little girl, little girl

But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh, yeah

Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you I really did the best I could

Watch out

Said I've been crying, yeah yeah
Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?

Do you remember mama
When I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me no more, yeah

I open my front door, hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them
Newfangled, newfangled back-door men
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Seven, seven, seven, to eleven, every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag
Ah, yeah, it makes it a drag
