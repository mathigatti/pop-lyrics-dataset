Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light?
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end


For many hours and days that passes ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love, all of my love
Oh all of my love to you now
All of my love, all of my love
Oh all of my love to you now

The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud aryan one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

All of my love, all of my love
Oh all of my love to you now
All of my love, all of my love
Yeah all of my love to you child

Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

All of my love, all of my love
Oh all of my love to you now

All of my love, oh love yes
All of my love to you now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love, love

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

oh, yeah, it's all, all, all of my love
All of my love, all of my love to you now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love, to, to you and you, and you and yeah

I get a bit lonely, just standing up
Just standing up
Just standing up lonely
Just I get a bit lonely
