Baby, when you walk that sweet walk
Oh, you walk it good, yes you walk it good
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk
Oh, it sounds so good, oh so good


With a little bit of concentration
And a little bit of helpin' hands, yeah
And a little bit of raving madness
You know it makes me feel, baby
Both my feet are back on the ground

And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh so goodv Baby if it keeps a-shaking
It will do you good, oh so much good

With a little bit of stop-a-shakin' shakin'
And a little bit of ?fly right down?
And a little bit of sweet con-carne
It makes me feel, makes me feel
I got my feet on the ground

Ooh now baby, when you move it makes me
Really feel so good, oh so good
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
And I'm good, oh, so good
With a little bit of concentration
And a little bit of helping hand
And a little bit of "saving madness"
You know it makes me feel, baby
I'm back on the ground oh yes, sure does
It makes me feel back on the ground.

I'm feelin' good child!
Down on the ground.
Sha la la la...
