Well, oh baby, baby, don't you want a man like me?
Oh baby, baby, I'm just as sweet as anybody could be
Oh baby, baby, I want to look to your eyes of blue
Oh baby, baby, it's more than anybody else could do


Oh baby, baby, you know when I see you walking down the street
Oh baby, baby, Well you looking good enough to eat
Oh baby, baby, I don't believe I've tasted this before
Oh baby, baby, I want it now and every mouthful more of you

Talk about you, yeah

Oh baby, baby, you know that I wanted it more
Oh baby, baby, I'm about to kiss goodbye to this store
Oh baby, baby, it isn't the wrapping that sells the goods
Oh baby, baby, I got a sweet tooth when my mouth is full of you

Oh baby, it's alright, oh it's alright

Well, oh baby, baby, oh you sting like a bee
Oh baby, baby, I like your honey and it sure likes me
Oh baby, baby, I got my spoon inside your jar
Oh baby, baby, don't give me too much, don't make me starve

Oh baby, baby, sugar sister on a silver plate
Oh baby, baby, I need a mouthful and I just can't wait
Oh baby, baby, see the shaking in my hand
Oh baby, baby, don't mean to fumble but it tastes so grand

Tastes so grand, tastes so grand, baby, it's alright

Oh baby, it's alright, oh it's alright
Oh baby, it's alright, oh it's alright
Oh baby, it's alright, oh it's alright
Oh baby, it's alright, oh it's alright
