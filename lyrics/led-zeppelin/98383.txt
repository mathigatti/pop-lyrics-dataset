Oh, babe

Well, there's a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that can't wait for night
I hate to think I been blinded, baby
Why can't I see you tonight?


And the warmth of your smile starts a burning
And the thrills of your touch give me fright
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up and make it alright?
It's alright

And if you promised you'd love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me, baby
Whatever happened to you?

And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true
Hey, it ain't the first time believe me, baby
I'm standing here feeling blue, blue
Ah, yes, I'm blue

Oh, babe

Now, I will stand in the rain on the corner
I watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around, around

And the clock on the wall's moving slower
Oh, my heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found, found

Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found

Hey babe

Whoa, hand that ticks on the clock
Just don't seem to stop when I'm thinking it over
Whoa, tired of the light
I just don't seem to find, have you wait, have you wait?

Whoa, I see it in my dreams
But I just don't seem to be
I've got to get all, gotta get it all
Gotta get it all, I've got to get all

Oh, now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet
Oh, I got no reason to doubt you, baby
It's all a terrible mess

And I'll run in the rain 'til I'm breathless
When I'm breathless I'll run 'til I drop, hey
And the thoughts of a fool's scattered careless
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah

Hey now, oooh

Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I
Light of the love that I

Light of the hey now
Light of the hey now
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
