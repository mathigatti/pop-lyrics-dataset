Oh, baby, it's crying time, oh, baby, I've got to fly
Got to try to find a way, got to try to get away
'Cause you know, I gotta get away from you, babe


Oh, baby, the river's red, aw, baby, in my head
There's a funny feeling going on
I don't think I can hold out long

And when the owls cry in the night
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel
If the rivers run dry, baby, how would you feel

Craze, baby, mm, the rainbow's end
Hoo, baby, it's just a den for those who hide
A hide their loves to depths of lies
And ruined dreams that we all knew so, babe

And when the owls cry in the night
And, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Oh, baby, baby, how do you feel
If the rivers run dry, baby, how will you feel
Baby, how do you feel

Oh, yeah, brave I endure
Woo, yeah, strong shields and lore
Tthey can't hold the wrath of those who walk
In the boots of those who march
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago
