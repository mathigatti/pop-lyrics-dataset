I was burned in the heat of the moment
No, it could've been the heat of the day
When I learned how my time had been wasted
Dear fellows I turned away


Now I've got friends who will give me the shoulder
When I should happen to fall
The timing is right, now I'm older
I've got friends who will give in before I fall

La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, na, na, baby
La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, la

Corner of bleaker and nowhere
In the land of not quite day
A shiver runs down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey

So, I looked around for a hitch from a raindeer
Said you oughtta find him out in the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away, yeah

La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, na, na, baby
La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, la

The moon and the stars fill the order
As the tide tends to ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay

I don't ask that my feet fall on clover
I don't roam at opportunity's door
Why don't you take my advice, take it slower
Then your story will be your finest reward

La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, na, na, baby
La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, la

Let's do it

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise

Now everything's finally happened
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground and you're messing around
You'll land in a boat without oars

La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, na, na, baby
La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, la

Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe
I lost my way
Hey babe, hey babe
I really, really did now

Hey babe, hey babe
I don't know where I'm gonna find it
Hey babe, hey babe, do you wanna know
Do you really, really, wanna help me, yeah?

Let me tell you now, babe (oh, oh)
Let me tell you (oh, oh)
That is fells so good that it must be right
Now my babe, (oh, oh)
Let me tell you (oh, oh)
That is fells so good that it must be right

Now my babe, let me tell you
If it feels, if it feels, if it feels
If it feels so good, so good, so good
Oh yes
