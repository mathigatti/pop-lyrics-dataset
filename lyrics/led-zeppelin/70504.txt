In the days of my youth
I was told what it means to be a man
Now I've reached that age
I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try
I find my way into the same old jam


Good times, bad times
You know I had my share
When my woman left home
For a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
Only took a couple of days 'till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine
And love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear
I lost another friend, oh

Good times, bad times
You know I've had my share
When my woman left home
For a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

Good times, bad times
You know I've had my share
When my woman left home
For a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbors say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part
