This is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low


It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you, I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize
These things are clear to all from time to time

Talk, talk, talk, talk
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
But I know that I love you so
Oh, but I know that I love you so

These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient
Upon us all, a little rain must fall
