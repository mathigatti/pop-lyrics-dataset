I should have quit you, long time ago
Oh yeah, long time ago
I wouldn't be here, my children
Down on this killing floor


I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Everytime I go away and leave you, darling
You send me the blues way down the line

Said, people worry I can't keep you satisfied
Let me tell you, baby, you ain't nothing, but a two bit, no good jive
Went to sleep last night, worked as hard as I can
Bring home my money, you take my money, give it to another man

I should have quit you, baby
Such a long time ago
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles
Down on this killing floor

Squeeze me baby, 'till the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze me baby, 'till the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon, I'm gonna fall right out of bed
I'm gonna leave my children down on this killing floor
