Oh, look over there
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
One that I know since I don't know when
But she don't notice me, when I pass
She goes with all the guys who are out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
She's sure fine lookin' man, she's something else.


Hey, look over there
Across the street
There's a car just right for me
Took on a quality of luxery
But right now I can't afford the gas
I guessthe cars right out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
That cars fine lookin' man, it something else.

Hey, look-a here
Just wait and see
I'm gonna work hard and save my dough
Gonna buy the car
Get me that girl and go ridin' around
We'll go to the shop a right block down
I'll keep on right on dreamin' and thinkin' to myself
If it all comes true man, wow, that's something else.

Look a-here
What's all this
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am a-knockin' on a door
My cars out front
And it's all mine
Justa 41 ford not a 59
I've got that girl and I'm a thinkin' to myself
She's sure fine lookin' man, wow, she's something else.
