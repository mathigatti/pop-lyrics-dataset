I had a dream
Oh yeah
Crazy dream
Oh, oh


Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go

Hear my song
People won't listen now
Sing along
You don't know what you're missing now

Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow now, push, push, yeah

California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright
The song remains the same

Sing out Hare Hare
Dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights are so bright
As we go sliding, sliding, sliding
