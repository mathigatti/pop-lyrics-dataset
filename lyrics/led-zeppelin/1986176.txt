Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Yes' i got my rain check
Shake my head and walk away


Oooo-people that's the way i feel
Oooo-people that's the way i feel
Sometimes i think i want
Then again i think i don't
Sometimes i want to stay here
Then again i want to leave here
Then again i want to stay
Yes, i got my train fare
Pack my grip and ride away

Oooo-people that's the way i feel
Oooo-people that's the way i feel
Sometimes i think i want
Then again i think i don't
