If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There'll still be you and me


Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain, whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die

Inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration, look to see

And so today, my world it smiles
Your hand in mine we walk the miles
Thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one

Happiness, no longer sad
Happiness, I'm glad

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There'll still be you and me, and me
