I hear you knock on my door
I ain't been saving this thing for you, honey
Don't want you ringing my bell
It's too late for you to be my honey


Oh, it's my love
Oh, it's my own true love
Oh, it's my love
Oh, it's my own true love, my own

Don't want you wasting my time
Tired of you doing the things that you do
It's no use standing in line
Fall in line, you'd better from a queue

And they say oh, it's my love
Oh, it's my own true love
Oh, it's my love
Oh, it's my own true love, my, my own

I could sail on the river run dead
But I know that it's done
I could wish for million years
But I know I'm not that young

I could cry within the darkness
And sail away
I could save a lifetime forever
But you know, you know, you know what I say

And I said oh, it's my love
Oh, it's my own true love
Oh, it's my love
Oh, it's my own true love, my, my own

Oh, it's my love
Oh, it's my own true love
Oh, it's my love
Oh, it's my own true love

My own true love
My own true love
My own true love
My own true love

I said, oh, it's my love
Oh, it's my own true love
Oh, it's my love
Oh, it's my own true love, my own
