Hear my baby coming down the track
Betcha my baby's coming back
Someday she'll get back to me
We're gonna raise a family


Oh, we're gonna groove, yeah groove
Yeah, we're gonna groove
We're gonna love
Until the break of day

Sweet as sweet as sweet can be
You don't know whatcha do to me
Let me say you're my one desire
You just set my soul on fire

Oh, we're gonna groove, yeah groove
Yeah, we're gonna groove
We're gonna love
Until the break of day

Sweet as sweet as sweet can be
Lemme tell ya you don't know whatcha do to me
You just set my soul on fire
Woman you know you're my one desire

We gonna groove
We gonna groove
We gonna groove
We gonna groove
