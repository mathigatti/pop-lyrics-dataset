From the window of your rented limousine
I caught your pretty blue eyes
One day soon you're gonna reach sixteen
Painted lady in the city of lies


Ah, do ya know my name? Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, baby
I must be the one you need yeah

Clutching pages from your teenage dream
In the lobby of the hotel paradise
Through the circus of the LA Queens
How fast you learn the downhill slide

Oh, I don’t like this game still don’t know your name
You know I'm the one you want
Baby yes ooh yes
I must be the one you need, need, need, need
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh you got to tell me
Just a minute just a minute

Lips like cherries on the brow of our queen
Come on flash and brush your eyes
Said you dug me since you were thirteen
Then you giggle as you heave and sigh

Oh do ya know my name? Do I look the same?
Baby I got to tell you
I'm the one you want
Everybody know I’m the one you need

Yeah, yeah

Oh get it yeah
C’mon now
C’mon now
C’mon now

Hours hours with the moments in between
Oh baby how the time flies
The fun of comin' on a plan and leavin'
Baby, dry those silver eyes

Oh, do you know my name? Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want
Oh oh, yeah yeah
I must be the one you need

Yeah

Oh yeah that's right
Oh yeah that's right
Oh that's right
That's right that's right
Oh yeah that’s right

That’s right
