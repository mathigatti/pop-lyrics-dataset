You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Exhibition is your habit
Emotions second hand
Oh, oh, oh, oh


Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around
And she said, don't you want?
Don't you wan't coca-coca-cocaine?

Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to
Try it, friend, yeah

Heard a cry for mercy in the city of the damned
Oh, oh babe, damned
Impossible to go lower the next stops on the ground
Oh, low on the ground

You want to know is it quite over?
To fame and tears and losing hair
And I said didn't mean to did not mean to fail
You didnt plan it, you overran it, yeah

You wanna do it, you wanna
You wanna do it when you wanna
You wanna do it, do it when you wanna

When you blow it, babe, you got to blow it right
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama
Baby, fake with all your might
When you fake it, mama, please fake it right

For yourself, babe, will you fake it?
You're faking it for your life
For your life, for your life, for your life

Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna
Do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna

Oh, I can have you, baby
But I dont know what to do, yeah
Sometime, baby, nothing I could do

Wanna find myself a crystal
Payin through the nose
And when they couldnt resist you
I said just go with the flow

And now your stage is empty
And now the curtain, baby, please
Fold up your show

Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to frying
Hadn't planned it
I over ran in frying for your life
