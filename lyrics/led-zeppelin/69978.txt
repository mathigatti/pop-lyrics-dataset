It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turn to you, you smiled at me
How could they say no


Whoa, the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Whoa, the songs to sing
When we at last return again

Swept New York a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
To know the shrieks the seaman hears
The devil is in his home

Oh, to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh, to touch the dream
That hides inside and is never seen, yeah

Into the sun, the south the north
Flys the birds of gold
The shackles of commitments fell
In pieces on the ground

Oh, to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Whoa, to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd, yeah

To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
With guidance from the curving path
That churns up into stone

If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah

Days went by when you and I
Made an eternal summers glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual time to grow

Oh, the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh, Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again

Wandering upon the rings
What place to rest the search
With the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth

Oh, the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth, whoa

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

I know the way, know the way
Know the way, know the way
I know the way, know the way
Know the way, know the way

Oh, the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth, whoa

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
