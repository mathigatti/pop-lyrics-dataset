In my time of dying, want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do is take my body home


Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well, so I can die easy

Jesus, gonna make up siviers
Jesus, gonna make up my dyin' bed
Meet me, Jesus, meet me
Oh meet me in the middle of the air
If my wings should fail me, Lord
Oh please meet me with another pair

Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well, so I can die easy

Jesus, gonna make up
Somebody, somebody
Oh, oh Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make you my dyin' bed

Oh, Saint Peter, at the gates of heaven
Won't you let me in
I never did no harm
I never did no wrong

Oh, Gabriel, let me blow your horn
Let me blow your horn
Oh, I never did, did no harm

I've only been this young once
I never thought I'd do anybody no wrong
No, not once

Oh, I did somebody some good
Somebody some good yeah
Oh, did somebody some good yeah
I must have did somebody some good yeah
Oh I believe I did

I see the smiling faces
I know I must have left some traces

And I see them in the streets
And I see them in the field
And I hear them shouting under my feet
And I know it's got to be real
Oh, Lord, deliver me
All the wrong I've done
You can deliver me, Lord
I only wanted to have some fun

Hear the angels marchin'
Hear the' marchin', hear them marchin'
Hear them marchin', the' marchin'

It's got to be my Jesus
Oh, it's got to be, it's got to be my Jesus
It's got to be my oh
It's got to be my Jesus
Oh take me home
Come on, come on I can hear the answer, sing it
Oh, here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Bye-bye

Oh, don't you make it my dyin', dyin', dyin'
Cough, that's gonna be the one, isn't it?
Come have a listen, then
Oh yes, thank you
