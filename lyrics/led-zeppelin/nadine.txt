I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off this bus


Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I see you darling
You got something else to do

Seems like every time I catch you
Datcha you're up to something new

I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walking toward a coffee colored cadillac
I was pushing through the crowd to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Downtown searching for her, looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty dollar bill, told him 'catch that yellow cab

She move around like a wave of summer breeze
Go, driver, go, go, catch her balmy breeze
Moving thru the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear
