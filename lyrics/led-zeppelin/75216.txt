Underneath your hood
Baby, I could work all night
Believe I've got the perfect tools

Factory air-conditioned
Heat begins to rise
Guaranteed to run for hours
Mama it's a perfect size

Groovin' on the freeway
Gauge is on the red
Gun down on my gasoline
I believe I'm gonna crack a head

Inside your showroom doors

Oh, I can't stop talking about love
I can't stop talking about love
Oh lemme go on down
I can't stop talking about
I can't stop talking about love
I can't stop talking about love
My baby
I can't stop talking about love
My baby, my baby, my baby
Who is
Who is, who is
Who is, who is
