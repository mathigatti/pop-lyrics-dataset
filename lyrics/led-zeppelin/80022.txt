I received a message from my brother, across the water
He sat laughing as he wrote the end's in sight
So I said goodbye to all my friends
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox
'Cause I know it's time to fly


Oh yeah, come on, meet me in the morning
Meet me in the middle of the night
Oh yeah, the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright

I just jumped a train that never stops
So now somehow I'll know I never finished paying for my ride
Just and someone pushed a gun into my hand
Tell me I'm the type of man to fight the fight that I'll require

Oh yeah, come on, meet me in the morning
Meet me in the middle of the night
Oh yeah, the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright

Oh, mama, well, I think it's time I'm leaving
Nothing here to make me stay
Whoa, mama, well, it must be time I'm going
They're knocking down them doors
They're trying to take me away

Please, Mr. Brakeman, won't you ring your bell?
And ring loud and clear
Please, Mr. Fireman, won't you ring your bell?
Tell the people they got to fly away from here

I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby
Southern lady, had a very, very special smile
We are in the middle of a change in destination
When the train stops, all together we will smile

Oh, oh, come on, come on, meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night
Oh, oh yeah, everybody know the morning time is coming
Don't it make you wanna feel alright, ah, ah, yeah
Make me feel alright, fly now, baby, get to fly, yeah, fly now, baby
