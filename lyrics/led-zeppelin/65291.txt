Ai, ai, ai, ai, ai, ai

Baby, please don't go

When I read the letter you wrote to me
It make me mad, mad, mad
When I read the news that it told me
It make me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so, I can't let you go

Oh baby, please don't go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
You hurt me to my soul
Oh, oh

When I read the letter you sent me
It made me mad, mad, mad
When I read the news that it brought me
It made me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so, I can't let you go
I love you, oh baby, I love you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh baby, baby, please, please, please, please
