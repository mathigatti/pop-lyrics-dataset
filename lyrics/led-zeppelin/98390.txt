In the evening, when the day is done
I'm looking for a woman, but the girl don't come
So don't let her, play you for a fool
She don't show no pity baby, she don't make no rules


Oh, I need your love, I need your love
Oh, I need your love, I just got to have

So don't you let her, oh, get under your skin
It's only bad luck and trouble, from the day that you begin
I hear you crying in the darkness, don't ask nobody's help
Ain't no pockets full of mercy baby, 'cause you can only blame yourself

Oh, I need your love, I need your love
Oh, I need your love, I just got to have

Oh, it's simple, all the pain that you go through
You can turn away from fortune, fortune, 'cause that's all that's left to you
It's lonely at the bottom, man, it's dizzy at the top
But if you're standing in the middle, ain't no way you're gonna stop

Oh, I need your love, I need your love
Oh, I need your love, I just got to have

Oh whatever that your days may bring
No use hiding in a corner, 'cause that won't change a thing
If you're dancing in the doldrums, one day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
When you're the master of the off-chance, when you don't expect a lot

Oh, I need your love, I need your love
Oh, I need your love, I just got to have
