There's something happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
A telling me I've got to beware


I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
A gettin' so much resistance from behind

I think it's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singin' songs and a carrying signs
Mostly sayin' hooray for our side

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the men come and take you away

You better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
You better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
You better stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
You better stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
