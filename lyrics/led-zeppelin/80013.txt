Down by the seaside
See the boats go sailing
Can the people hear
What the little fish are saying


The people turned away
The people turned away

Down in the city streets
See all the folk go racing, racing
No time left
To pass the time of day

The people turned away
The people turned away

So far away, so far away

See how they run, see how they run
See how they run, see how they run

Do you still do the twist?
Do you find you remember things that well?
I wanna tell you, some go twisting every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell

Out in the country
Hear the people singing
Singing about their progress
Knowing where they're going

The people turned away
The people turned away

Sing loud for the sunshine
Pray hard for the rain
And show your love for Lady Nature
And she will come back again

The people turned away
The people turned away
