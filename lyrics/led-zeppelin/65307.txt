Wanna whole lotta love

Way, way down inside
Honey, you need it

Way, way down inside

Every inch of my love, gonna give you my love

Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love

Way down inside

Shake for me, girl
I wanna be your backdoor man

Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
