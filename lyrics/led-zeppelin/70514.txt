Bright light almost blinding
Black night still there shining
I can't stop, keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew


Had a friend, she once told me
You got love, you ain't lonely
Now she's gone and left me
Only looking for what I knew

Hum, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing, you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just

Met a man on the roadside crying
without a friend, there's no denying
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
Looking for what you knew

So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down, although it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew

Hum, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just

I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy
It's very easy
It's very easy
It's easy, easy, yeah
