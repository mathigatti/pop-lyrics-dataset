Measuring a summer's day
I only finds it slips so away to grey
The hours, they bring me pain


Tangerine, Tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years between

Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these?
To think of us again and I do

Tangerine, Tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years between
