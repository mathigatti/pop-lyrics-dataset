How many more times
Treat me the way you wanna do?
When I give you all my love
Please, please be true


I'll give you all I've got to give
Rings, pearls and all
I've got to get you together baby
I'm sure, sure you're gonna crawl

I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinking it all over
Just what I had missed
Got me a girl and I kissed her
And then, and then
Whoops, oh, Lord, well I did it again

Now I got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way that makes eleven
But I'm in constant heaven
I know it's all right in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine
I can't get through to her 'cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give

Oh, rosie, oh, girl
Oh, rosie, oh, girl
Steal away now, steal away
Steal away, baby, steal away
Little robert anthony wants to come and play

Well they call me the hunter, that's my name
They call me the hunter
Thatâ€™s how I got my fame
Ain't no need to hide
Ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my gun

How many more times
Barrelhouse all night long
How many more times
Barrelhouse all night long
I've got to get to you, baby, baby
Please, come home
