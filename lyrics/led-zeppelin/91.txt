Oh, she's my baby
Let me tell you why
Hey, she drives me crazy
She's the apple of my eye


'Cause she is my girl
And she can never do wrong
If I dream too much at night
Somebody, please, bring me down

Hey, I love that little lady
I got to be her fool
Ain't no other like my baby
I can break the golden rule

'Cause I get down on my knees
Oh, I pray that love won't die
And if I always try to please
I don't know the reason why

If she would come back
Only stay with me
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit of my love

I give to you girl
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit
Every, every little bit of my love

I don't have to go by plane
I ain't gotta go by car
I don't care just where my darling is
People I just don't care how far

I'm gonna crawl, I'm gonna crawl
I don't care if I got to go back home
I don't care what I got to stand to her back
I'm gonna crawl, I'm gonna crawl

I'm gonna move the car, baby
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
My baby give me good loving

Yes, I love her, I guess I love her
Yes, I love her, I wanna crawl
