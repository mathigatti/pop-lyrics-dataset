When I done quit hollering baby
I believe I'll shake 'em on down
Get my babe, won't be late
You know by that I mean seconds late
Ah, must I holler, must I shake 'em on down
Well I've been mistreated babe
I believe I'll shake 'em on down


Well I ain't no monkey, I can't climb no tree
No brown skin woman gonna make no monkey out of me
I ain't no monkey, sure can't climb no tree
I been mistreated babe
I believe I'll shake 'em on down
Well I've been mistreated babe
I believe I'll shake 'em on down

Listen mama, put on your morning gown
Put in your nightshirt mama
We gonna shake 'em down
Must I holler? Must I shake 'em on down?

Gave my baby a twenty dollar bill
If that don't get her, sure my shot, shot, shotgun will
Yeah, I gave my baby a twenty dollar bill
If that don't get that woman, I'm sure my shotgun will
