Walking in the park just the other day, baby
What do you, what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sitting on the grass
With flowers in their hair said


Hey boy, do you wanna score?
And you know how it is
I really don't know what time it was, woh-oh-oh
So I asked them if I could stay awhile

I didn't notice, but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us said
Please, hey, would we care to all get in line, get in line

Well, you know, they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun, woh-oh-oh
He said that his friends would all drop by
Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?

There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rusting
Not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they're coming, woh-oh-oh
I know that it's all a state of mind

If you go down in the streets today, baby, you better
You better open your eyes
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies

So I've decided what I'm gonna do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly

Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

I really don't know
I really don't know
