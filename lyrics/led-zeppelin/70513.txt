We came from the land
Of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun
Where the hot springs blow


The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, singing and crying
Valhalla, I am coming

On we sweep
With threshing oar
Our only goal
Will be the western shore

We came from the land
Of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun
Where the hot springs flow

How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

On we sweep
With threshing oar
Our only goal
Will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing
