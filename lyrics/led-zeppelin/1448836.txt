Well on a train I met a dame
She rather handsome
We Kinda looked the same
She was pretty from New York City


I'm walking down that old fair lane
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so
I said train kept a rolling all night long

Train kept a rolling all night long
Train kept a rolling all night long
Train kept a rolling all night long
With a heave and a ho
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no!

Well get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
I'm in heat I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no!

Well we made a stop in Albuquerque
She must thought I was a real cool jerk
Climbing off the train and looking handsome
Looking so good jack couldn't let it go
Oh, but I just couldn't tell her 
So I said train kept a rolling all night long
