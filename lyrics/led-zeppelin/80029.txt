Let me tell you, when she talks, she talks
And when she looks me in my eye
She's my baby, Lord I want to make her mine, baby

And you want me to love you, love some other men?

She's my lover baby and I love her so, and
She's the one that really makes me whirl and twirl, and!
She's the kind of lover that makes me feel the whole world and
She's the one who really makes me jump and shout, ooh!

Take it on, take it, take it, take it
