You know you shook me
You shook me all night long
You know you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
You shook me so hard, baby
Baby, baby, please come home


I have a bird that whistles
And I have birds that sing
I have a bird that whistles
And I have birds that sing
I have a baby, won't do nothing
Oh, buy a diamond ring

You know you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
I know you really, really did baby
I said: You shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
You shook me so hard, baby
You shook me all night long
