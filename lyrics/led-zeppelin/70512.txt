Baby, baby, I'm gonna bring it on home to you
I've got my ticket, I've got that load
Got up, gone higher, all aboard
Take my seat, right way back, oh yeah


Watch this train roll down the track
I'm gonna bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
Watch out, watch out

Try to tell you, baby
What you trying to do?
Trying to love me, baby
Love some other man too

Bring it on home
Bring it on home

Went a little walk downtown
Messed and got back late
Found a note there waiting
It said, daddy, I just can't wait

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it back home to me, baby

Tell you, pretty baby
You love to mess me around
I'm gonna give you loving, baby
Gonna move you outta town

Bring it on home
Bring it on home

Sweetest little baby, daddy ever saw
I'm gonna give you loving, baby
I'm gonna give you more
Bring it on home

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
