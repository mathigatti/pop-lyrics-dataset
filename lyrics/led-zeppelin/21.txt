Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'll leave you when the summertime
Leave you when the summer comes a rolling
Leave you when the summer comes along


Baby, baby, I wanna leave you
I ain't joking woman, I got to ramble
Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I believing
We really got to ramble
I can hear it calling me the way it used to do
I can hear it calling me back home

Babe I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby, you know, I've really got to leave you
Oh I can hear it calling me
I said don't you hear it calling me
The way it used to do

I know I never, never gonna leave you, babe
But I got to go away from this place
I've got to quit you, yeah
Baby, ooh, don't you hear it calling me?
Woman, woman, I know, I know

It feels good to have you back again
And I know that one day baby
Itâ€™s really gonna grow, yes it is
We gonna go walking through the park every day
Come what may, every day

It was really, really good
You made me happy every single day
But now I've got to go away
Baby, baby, baby, baby
That's when it's calling me
I said, that's when it's calling me back home
