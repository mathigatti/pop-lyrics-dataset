Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah


You hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
Run around sweet baby, lord how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you baby, here I come again

Every day I work so hard, bringing home my hard earned pay
Try to love you baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

Been dazed and confused for so long itâ€™s not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy baby, let them say what they will
Tongue wag so much when I sent you the bill
