Hey, girl, stop what you're doing
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you, but I like it a lot
Won't let me hold you
Let me feel your loving charms


Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I’m having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

Hey, girl, I got something I think you ought to know
Hey, babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah
I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause I like your charms

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I’m having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

I want you to love me all night
I want you to love me all night
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
