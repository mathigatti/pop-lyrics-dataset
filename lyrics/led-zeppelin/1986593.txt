You know it hurts so much
C'mon and please me
You know i need your tender touch


Love me like a hurricane
And then you start to
You tell me that you'll come on over
Then you say you won't
Love me like a hurricane
And then you start to
I'll give it to you straight right now
Please

Oh please don't tease me
You know it hurts so much
C'mon and squeeze me
You know i need your tender touch

Tell me that you love me babe
Then you say you don't
You tell me that you'll come on over
Then you say you won't
