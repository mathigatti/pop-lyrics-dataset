Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bag, my foot's outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball


(Ah-ha)
(Aw, aw, yeah)

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more
Singing about the good things and the sun that lights the day
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost it's way?

(I don't know)
(Oh, oh, yeah)

(Na, na, na, na, na)
(Na, na, na, na, na)

Sitting round, singing songs 'til the night turns into day
Used to sing on the mountains, but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

(Oh, yeah)
It sure is fine
Blow my mind
When the tears are going down
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Oh, so good)
