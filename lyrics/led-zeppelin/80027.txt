How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into day
Oh twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into day


When a minute seems like a lifetime
Oh baby, when I feel this way

Sittin lookin at the clock
Oh time moves so slow
I've been watchin for the hands to move
Until I just can't look no more

How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes slip into day
A minute seems like a life time
Baby, when I feel this way

To sing a song for you
I recall you used to say
Oh baby, this one's for me to
Which in the end is you anyway

How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes slip into day
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh baby, when I feel this day

There was a time that I stood tall
In the eyes of other men
But by my own choice I left you woman
And now I can't get back again

How come twenty-four hours
Sometimes slip into day

Well, well, well, well

A minute seems like a lifetime
Baby, when I feel this way
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh baby, when I feel this way

I feel this way
