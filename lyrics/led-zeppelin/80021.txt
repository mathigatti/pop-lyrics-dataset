And if you feel that you can't go on
And your will's sinkin' low
Just believe and you can't go wrong
In the light you will find the road
You will find the road


Hey, oh
Did you ever believe that I could leave you
Standing out in the cold

Hey, yeah, baby
I know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through
To the very depths of my soul, yeah

Oh, oh, baby
I just wanna show what I'd give you
It is from every bend in the road
Now listen

Oh, whoa, whoa
As I was and really would be for you, too, honey
As you would for me

Oh, I would share your load
Let me share your load
Ooh, let me share, share your load

And if you feel that you can't go on
In the light you will find the road

Hey, oh, oh
Though the winds of change may blow around you
But that will always be so

Oh, oh, oh, oh
When love is pain it can devour you
If you are never alone

I would share your load
I would share your load
Baby, let me, oh, let me

In the light
Everybody needs the light
In the light, in the light, in the light

Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, ooh, yeah
Light, light, light, in the light
