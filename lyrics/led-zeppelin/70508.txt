And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be


Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away
Leave today, way up high in the sky and whoa
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go, it only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh, what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away
Leave today, way up high in the sky and whoa
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go, it only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away
Leave today, way up high in the sky and whoa
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go, it only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Girl, the answer lies with you

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away
Leave today, way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go, it only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

Oh, the wind won't blow and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show
Catch the wind, we're gonna see it spin
We're gonna sail, little girl

Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they're never gonna know that I move like hell
