Rap (Lil' Mama)

I don't know her but
Your is a girl bird
You by my side make it work
You and her that sound up surd
Me and you more better you heard
You hear those lil girls laughing in the back
That because I spit crack on the track
I'm keep it real boy I'm trying to mack
Let me know if you down with that
Me and your girlfriend we aint no tie
You better X E I
I'm telling you like Jennifer Hudson
I got cut the last in the back of the jag
The chauffer stares I'm poppin' tags across his back
But still I laugh because this is nothing

Be your girl Lil' mama be your girlfriend
