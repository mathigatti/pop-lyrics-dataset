Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door - I'm gonna hit this city
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back


I'm talking pedicure on our toes
Trying on all our clothes
Boys blowing up our phones
Drop topping, playing our favorite cds
Pulling up to the party
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

[CHORUS]
Whoo
Don't stop, make it prop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Imma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Woah-oh oh oh
Woah-oh oh ohhhh
Ohhhh

Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now, the dudes are lining up cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about - everybody getting crunk
Boys trying to touch my junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk
Now, now - we go until they kick us out
Or the police shut us down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us down

[CHORUS]
Don't stop, make it prop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Imma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Woah-oh oh oh
Woah-oh oh oh

You build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me
With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me
You build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me
With my hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

And now, the party don't start 'til I walk in

[CHORUS 2x]
Don't stop, make it prop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Imma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Woah-oh oh oh
Woah-oh oh oh

Ohhhhh
Ohhhhh
