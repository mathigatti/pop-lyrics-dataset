Got up on the wrong side of life today, yeah
Crashed the car and I'm gonna be really late
My phone doesn't work 'cause it's out of range
Looks like it's just one of those kind of days


You can't kick me down, I'm already on the ground
No, you can't, 'cause you couldn't catch me anyhow
Blue skies, but the sun isn't coming out, no
Today it's like I'm under a heavy cloud

And I feel so alive
I can't help myself
Don't you realize?

I just wanna scream and lose control
Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and runaway, yeah
I just wanna fall and lose myself
Laughing so hard it hurts like hell
Forget about everything and runaway, yeah

So-so is how I'm doing if you're wondering
I'm in a fight with the world but I'm winning
Stay there, come closer it's at your own risk
Yeah, you know how it is, life can be a bitch

But I feel so alive
I can't help myself
Don't you realize?

I just wanna scream and lose control
Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and runaway, yeah
I just wanna fall and lose myself
Laughing so hard it hurts like hell
Forget about everything and runaway, yeah

Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, run, run away
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, run, run away

I just wanna scream and lose control
Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and runaway, yeah
I just wanna fall and lose myself
Laughing so hard it hurts like hell
Forget about everything and runaway, yeah

I just wanna scream and lose control
Throw my hands up and let it go
Forget about everything and runaway, yeah
I just wanna fall and lose myself
Laughing so hard it hurts like hell
Forget about everything and runaway, yeah
