So much for my happy ending
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
So much for my happy ending



Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something i did?
Was it something you said?

Don't leave me hangin'
In a city so dead
held up so high
On such a breakable thread

You were all the things i thought knew
And i thought we could be

You were all the things i thought knew
And i thought we could be

You were everything, everything that i wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it
All of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending
So much for my happy ending
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they(they)

But they don't know me
Do they even know you?
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do


You were all the things I thought of knew
And I thought we could be


You were everything, everything that i wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it
All of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending
So much for my happy ending
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...


So much for my happy ending
So much for my happy ending


It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you care
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done

You were everything, everything that i wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it
All of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time you were pretending
You were everything, everything that i wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it
All of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending
So much for my happy ending
So much for my happy ending
So much for my happy ending
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
