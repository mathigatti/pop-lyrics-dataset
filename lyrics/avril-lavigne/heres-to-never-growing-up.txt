Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boom box blaring
As we're falling in love
Got a bottle of whatever
But it's getting us drunk
Singing: Here's to never growing up


Call up all our friends
Go hard this weekend, for no damn reason
I don't think we'll ever change
Meet you at the spot, half past ten o'clock
We don't ever stop, and we're never gonna change

Say, won’t you say forever? Stay
If you stay forever, hey
We can stay forever young

Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boom box blaring
As we're falling in love
Got a bottle of whatever
But it's getting us drunk
Singing: Here's to never growing up
We'll be running down the street yelling kiss my ass
I'm like yeah whatever, we're still living like that
When the sun's going down we'll be raising our cups
Singing: Here's to never growing up
Oh woah, oh woah, here's to never growing up
Oh woah, oh woah, here's to never growing up

We live like rock stars
Dance on every bar, this is who we are
I don't think we'll ever change (oh no)
They say just grow up, but they don't know us
We don't give a fuck, and we're never gonna change

Say, won’t you say forever? Stay
If you stay forever, hey
We can stay forever young
