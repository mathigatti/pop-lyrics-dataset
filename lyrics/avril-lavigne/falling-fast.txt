I woke up and saw the sun today
You came by without a warning
You put a smile on my face
I want that for every morning


What is it I’m feeling?
'Cause I can’t let it go
If seeing is believing
Then I already know

I’m falling fast
I hope this lasts
I’m falling hard for you
I say
Let’s take a chance
Take it while we can
I know you feel it too
I’m falling fast
I’m falling fast

Doesn’t matter what we do
You make everything seem brighter
I never knew I needed you
Like a sad song needs a sea of lighters

What is it I’m feeling?
'Cause I can’t let it go
If seeing is believing
I already know

I’m falling fast
God, I hope this lasts
‘Cause I’m falling hard for you
I say
Let’s take a chance
Take it while we can
‘Cause I know you feel it too
I’m falling fast
I’m falling fast

I hope you know
I hope it lasts
I’m falling hard
I’m falling fast
We can go
No holding back

I hope you know
I hope it lasts
I’m falling hard
I’m falling fast
We can go
No holding back

I’m falling fast
I hope this lasts
I’m falling hard for you
I say
Let’s take a chance
Take it while we can
I know you feel it too
I’m falling fast
I’m falling fast
