I never wanted to runaway from you
I felt real bad
But that was what I did
I never wanted too
I didn't hear from you
And you weren't there for me
So that was what happened


And I'm not sorry
'Cause we were boring
I'm not ignoring anything - anything

There's only so much I can take
Before I start to doubt it
There's only so much I can give
You should think about it
Yeah, you should think about it

It's time to have my fun
There's no way it's done
Take me with no regrets
And that is what I'll do
I'll never understand
Where were you coming from?
And where did you go?
You weren't there for me

And I'm not sorry
'Cause we were boring
I'm not ignoring anything - anything

There's only so much I can take
Before I start to doubt it
There's only so much I can give
You should think about it

There's only so much we can do
Can we do without it?
There's only so much you can say
Did you forget about it?
Did you forget about it?

I never wanted to runaway from you
I felt real bad
But that was what I did

And I'm not sorry
'Cause we were boring
I'm not ignoring anything - anything

There's only so much I can take
Before I start to doubt it
There's only so much I can give
You should think about it

There's only so much we can do
Can we do without it?
There's only so much you can say
Did you forget about it?
Did you forget about it?

I never wanted to runaway from you
I felt real bad
But that was what I did
