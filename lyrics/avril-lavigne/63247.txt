Step up, step up (step up!)
Step up, step up (step up!)
Step up, step up
Step up


Fall back, take a look at me and you'll see I'm for real
I'll feel what only I can feel and if that don't appeal to you
Let me know and I'll go 'cause I flow better when my colors show
And that's the way it has to be honestly
'Cause creativity could never bloom in my room
I'd throw it all away before I'd lie
So don't call me with a compromise
Hang up the phone, I've got a backbone stronger than yours

La la la la la la (step, step up, step up)
La la la la la la la (step up, step up)
La la la la la la
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If you're trying to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see, I'm not down with that
I'm not nobody's fool
If you're trying to turn me into something else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that
I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down
Go ahead and try

You don't know, you think you know me like yourself
But I fear that you're only telling me what I wanna hear
But do you give a damn?
Understand that I can't not be what I am
I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon
It's not a simple here we go not so soon
I might've fallen for that when I was fourteen and a little more green
But it's amazing what a couple of years can mean

La la la la la la (step, step up, step up)
La la la la la la la (step up, step up)
La la la la la la
Yeah, yeah

If you're trying to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
I'm not nobody's fool
If you're trying to turn me into something else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that
I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down
Go ahead and try

Go ahead and try
Try to look me in the eye
But you'll never see inside
Until you realize, realize, realize

Things are trying to settle down
Just try to figure out
Exactly what I'm about
If it's with or without you
I don't need you doubt in me

If you're trying to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
I'm not nobody's fool
If you're trying to turn me into something else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that
I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down
Go ahead and try

Would you be laughing out loud
If I played it to my own crowd?
Try!

Go ahead and try
