I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way
She felt it every day
I couldn't help her
I just watched her make
The same mistakes again


What's wrong, what's wrong now?
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

She wants to go home, but nobody's home
It's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

Open your eyes
And look outside
Find the reason, why (why)
You've been rejected (You've been rejected)
And now you can't find
What you left behind

Be strong, be strong now
Too many too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

She wants to go home, but nobody's home
It's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

Her feeling, she hides
Her dream, she can't find
She's losing her mind
She's falling behind
She can't find her place
She's losing her faith
She's falling from grace
She's all over the place (yeah!)

She wants to go home, but nobody's home
It's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes broken inside

She's lost inside, lost inside (oh, oh)
She's lost inside, lost inside (oh, oh, yeah)
