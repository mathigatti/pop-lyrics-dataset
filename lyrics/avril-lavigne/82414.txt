There's not much going on today
I'm really bored, it's getting late
What happened to my Saturday?
Monday's coming, the day I hate, -ate


I'll sit on the bed alone
Staring at the phone

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm looking for

This is when I start to bite my nails
And clean my room when all else fails
I think it's time for me to bail (time to bail)
This point of view is getting stale, -ale

I'll sit on the bed alone
Staring at the phone

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm looking for

Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

Na na na na na - we've all got choices
Na na na na - we've all got voices
Na na na na na - stand up, make some noise
Na na na na - stand up, make some noise

I'll sit on the bed alone
Staring at the phone

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm looking for

He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
Like I was special
'Cause I was special

Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Na na na na na
