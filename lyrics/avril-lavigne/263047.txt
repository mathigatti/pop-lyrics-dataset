Layin' on the couch
Just hangin' with my boys
We're chillin' up the house tonight
I'm being myself
I'm nobody else
'Cause this is what we do alright


You'll always find

I'm not wearing any make-up
Won't hide who I am
I'll be what I am
I'm just being honest with
Myself once again
I'm my only friend

Kickin' off my shoes
I'm strummin' my guitar
I'm singin' songs about my life
If I could tell the truth
I'd tell you what I'm meant by
Me, myself, and I

You'll always find

I'm not wearing any make-up
Won't hide who I am
I'll be what I am
I'm just being honest with
Myself once again
I'm my only friend

No more mirrors
No more vanity
Give it all away for free
Donate to charity
I am happy in my skin
I drown my heart is not the same

You'll always find

I'm not wearing any make-up
Won't hide who I am
I'll be what I am
I'm just being honest with
Myself once again
I'm my only friend

Lay on my couch, hang with my boys
Chill at my house tonight
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys
Chill at my house tonight
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys
Chill at my house tonight
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys
Chill at my house tonight
