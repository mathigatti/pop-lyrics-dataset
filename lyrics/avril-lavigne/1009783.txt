Everytime you go away
It actually kinda makes my day
Everytime you leave, you slam the door
You pick your words so carefully
You hate to think you're hurting me
You leave me laughing on the floor 'cause


I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that?
You know, I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that?
You know, I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

I thought we were just hanging out
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth?
You thought the way you taste would get me high, oh
You went to all your friends to brag
Guys are always such a drag
Don't you know the reason that I kissed you
Was to say goodbye?

'Cause I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that?
You know, I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that?
You know, I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

Hanging, hanging out, I am simply
Hanging, hanging out, I am simply
Hanging

So why'd you kiss me on the mouth?
Don't you know that I

I don't give a damn about you
I don't give a shit about you
I don't give a damn about you
I don't give a shit about you
I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that?
You know, I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that?

I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that?
You know, I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that?

I don't give a damn
I don't give a shit
What you say about that?
