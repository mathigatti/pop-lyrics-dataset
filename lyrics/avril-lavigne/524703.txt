(We're rolling suicide)

Wake up (Wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup (Hide the scars to fade away the)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable


You wanted to,
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
You wanted to,
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup
You wanted to,
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table
You wanted to,

Why don't think you trust,
In my self righteous suicide,
I cry when angels deserve to DIE!!!

Father (Father), Father (Father), Father (Father), Father (Father)!
Father into your hands, I commend my spirit,
Father, into your hands,
Why have you forsaken me,
In your eyes forsaken me,
In your thoughts forsaken me,
In your heart forsaken, me oh!

Trust in my self righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die...
