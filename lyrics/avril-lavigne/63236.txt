Uh huh, life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is


Chill out, what you're yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you would see
I like you the way you are
When we're driving in your car
And you're talking to me one on one, but you've become

Somebody else round everyone else
Watching your back, like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else, it gets me frustrated
And life's like this, you
You fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get
And you turn it into
Honestly, you promised me I'll never going to find you fake it
No, no, no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're something else
Where you are and where it's at? You see, you're making me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not fooling anyone, when you've become

Somebody else round everyone else
Watching your back like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else, it gets me frustrated
And life's like this, you
You fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get
And you turn it into
Honestly, you promised me I'll never going to find you fake it
No, no, no

No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no

Chill out, what you're yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you would see

Somebody else round everyone else
You're watching your back, like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else, it gets me frustrated
And life's like this, you
You fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get
And you turn it into
Honesty, you promised me I'll never going to find you fake it
No, no

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated? (hey, hey)
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else, it gets me frustrated
And life's like this, you
You fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get
And you turn it into
Honesty, you promised me I'll never going to find you fake it
No, no, no
