I'll pick my battles 'cause I know I'm gonna win the war
(Win the war)
I'm not rattled 'cause I shattered all of this before
(This before)
Steadier than steel 'cause I'm ready with my shield and sword
(Shield and sword)
Back on the saddle 'cause I gathered all my strength for more
(Strength for more)


And I won't bow, I won't break
No, I'm not afraid to do whatever it takes
I'll never bow, I'll never break

'Cause I’m a warrior, I fight for my life
Like a soldier all through the night
And I won’t give up, I will survive, I'm a warrior
And I'm stronger, that's why I'm alive
I will conquer, time after time
I'll never falter, I will survive, I'm a warrior

Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm a warrior

Like a viking, I'll be fighting through the day and night
(Day and night)
I'll be marching through the darkness 'til the morning light
(Morning light)
Even when it's harder, like the armor, you will see me shine
(See me shine)
No, I won't stop and I won't drop until the victory's mine (oh)

And I won't bow, I won't break
No, I'm not afraid to do whatever it takes
I'll never bow, I'll never break

'Cause I’m a warrior, I fight for my life
Like a soldier all through the night
And I won’t give up, I will survive, I'm a warrior
And I'm stronger, that's why I'm alive
I will conquer, time after time
I'll never falter, I will survive, I'm a warrior, oh

Oh, you can't shoot me down
You can't stop me now
I got a whole damn army
Oh, they try to break me down
They try to take me out
You can't cut a scar on me

I’m a warrior, I'll fight for my life
Like a soldier all through the night
And I won’t give up, I will survive, I'm a warrior
And I'm stronger, that's why I'm alive
(I am stronger)
I will conquer, time after time
(I will conquer)
I'll never falter, I will survive
(I'll never falter)
I'm a warrior, oh
(I'm a warrior)

Woah, woah, woah
I'm a warrior
Woah, woah, woah
I'm a warrior
