Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Oh


Yeah
Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red

I run across through black and white
War horse
War head
Fuck 'em, man
White knuckle tight
Through black and white

Oh
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard
Loose and clean

Oh
And then I burn
Turning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Yeah

Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out hope
Burn your face upon the chrome

Yeah, oh yeah

Take the corner, going to crash
Headlights
Headlines
Another junkie, who lives too fast

Yeah
Lives way too fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast
Oh

Oh
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard
Loose and clean

Oh
And then I burn
Turning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Oh yeah

White knuckle tight

Oh
Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
My desire

Oh
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard
Loose and clean

Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme something to desire
Oh

On I burn
