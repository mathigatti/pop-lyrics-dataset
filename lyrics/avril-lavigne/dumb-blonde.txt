[Avril Lavigne]
I ain’t no dumb blonde
I ain’t no stupid Barbie doll
I got my game on
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong


Well, there you go again, telling me where I belong
You put me on the bench, don’t think that I can play strong
So quick to condescend
Well, you think I’m empty, I’m not
You won’t be so confident when I’m crushing you from the top

I’m a babe, I’m a boss and I’m making this money
I can flip like a switch and I cut like a blade
(Try to get it now)
I can sting like a bee, but I’m sweeter than honey
And I’m quick as a whip, so get outta my way
(Come and get it now)

I ain’t no dumb blonde
I ain’t no stupid Barbie doll
I got my game on
Just watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
I ain’t no dumb blonde
I am a freaking cherry bomb
I’ll be your icon
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

Stand up everybody, get up, say it loud
We’re bombshells raising hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
Stand up everybody, get up, say it loud
We’re bombshells raising hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

Well, there you go again, you’re talking down on me
I may look innocent, don’t underestimate me
I’m gold and platinum
Don’t you know I’m out of your league? (I’m so out of your league)
Step back, your time is up, sit down, I’m taking the lead

I’m a babe, I’m a boss and I’m making this money
I can flip like a switch and I cut like a blade
(Try to get it now)
I can sting like a bee, but I’m sweeter than honey
And I’m quick as a whip, so get outta my way
(Come and get it now)

I ain’t no dumb blonde
I ain’t no stupid Barbie doll
I got my game on
Just watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
I ain’t no dumb blonde
I am a freaking cherry bomb
I’ll be your icon
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

Stand up everybody, get up, say it loud
We’re bombshells raising hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
Stand up everybody, get up, say it loud
We’re bombshells raising hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I ain’t playing but I won the cup
Came through heavy on it in the Bentley truck
It was me, young Avril, security tucked
In the back, just in case one of ya’ll run up
One of y’all, uhm uhm, all of y’all be stuck
When you see a young queen in the flesh, what’s up
All the hatin’ you was doing got the Barbie poppin’
Now all of them want to be a Barbie, I’m watchin’
But you never gonna stop me, never gonna top me
Millions on millions, they never gonna dock me
I am the prototype, the pink print
No, I don’t want no frauds, wink wink

[Avril Lavigne]
(Oh no)
I ain’t no dumb blonde
I ain’t no stupid Barbie doll (hell no)
I got my game on
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
I ain’t no dumb blonde
I am a freaking cherry bomb
I’ll be your icon
Just watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

Stand up everybody, get up, say it loud
We’re bombshells raising hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
Stand up everybody, get up, say it loud
We’re bombshells raising hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
