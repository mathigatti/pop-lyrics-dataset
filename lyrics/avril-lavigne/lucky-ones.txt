It used to be you and I driving on a cold November night
It used to be you and I talking to the middle of the night
We didn't know much about anything
Just knew that it felt right
It used to be you and I laughing and I can't remember why


But now it's just me getting take out for one
Thinking about how you said it would always be us

How'd we let the ship go down
Said we that were on solid ground
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the lucky ones
Maybe we were just too young
Maybe it was all just for fun
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the lucky ones

I'm picking up the pieces of the puzzle
I guess I misunderstood
And no one said love is forever
Oh but damn it felt so good

So whys it just me here alone on the couch
Where we sat and you told me our love would never run out

How'd we let the ship go down
Said we that were on solid ground
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the lucky ones
Maybe we were just too young
Maybe it was all just for fun
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the lucky ones

And I don't know whats under stones
And I don't know what is love
But we ere in in the middle of a storm
And I thought we were the lucky ones

How'd we let the ship go down
Said we that were on solid ground
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the lucky ones
Maybe we were just too young
Maybe it was all just for fun
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the lucky ones
I thought we were the lucky ones
I thought we were the lucky ones
