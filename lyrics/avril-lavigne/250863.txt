Don't matter what people say
I never did believe them
I know, I know, they know everything
I'll be alright by myself
And no one's gonna tell me
I'm defined, confined by love


Now our days seem strange
I guess my heart was bound to change

I fell out
Out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you're falling into history

I fell out
Out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you're falling into history

I never thought that I'd say
That I don't really miss you
I lived, I breathed your breath through me
Time has a way of passing by
Until I don't remember why
Or how to hurt for you

Love's pain has gone somewhere
And I'm finally leaving in there

I fell out
Out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you're falling into history

I fell out
Out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you're falling into history

Falling into...
You're falling into...
You're falling into history, yeah

Falling into...
You're falling into...
You're falling into history

I fell out
Out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you're falling into history

I fell out
Out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you're falling into history

I'll be alright by myself
And no one's gonna tell me
I'm defined, confined by love
