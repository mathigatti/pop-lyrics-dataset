Like a bird locked up in a cage called love
He clipped her wings when she was born to fly
He said: A pretty bird, you can't sing
But I'll buy you diamonds and ruby rings
Like a bird locked up in a cage


And how can I escape this place and go higher, higher?
How can I avoid the flames from your fire, fire?
And oh, you can't hold me down, no
Oh, you can't pull me down
So birdie, fly away (higher, higher)
So birdie, fly away (higher, higher)
So birdie, fly away

I'm tired of getting lost inside this maze all day
Your twisted words are getting to my head
I say: And no more glasses and seein' stars
And no more bruises and battle scars
Like a bird locked up in a cage

And how can I escape this place and go higher, higher?
How can I avoid the flames from your fire, fire?
And oh, you can't hold me down, no
Oh, you can't pull me down
So birdie, fly away (higher, higher)
So birdie, fly away (higher, higher)
So birdie, fly away

I ain't your prisoner
You can't lock me up no more
I'll show you what I'm worth
Take back what I deserve
I ain't your prisoner
You can't chain me down no more
Goddamn, it's gonna hurt
So fly away, little bird

And how can I escape this place and go higher, higher?
How can I avoid the flames from your fire, fire?
And oh, you can't hold me down, no
Oh, you can't pull me down

So birdie, fly away (oh, oh, oh)
Can you hear me? (Oh, oh, oh)
Are you listenin'? (Oh, oh, oh)
Set me free, set me free (oh, oh, oh)
Can you hear me? (Oh, oh, oh)
Are you listenin'? (Oh, oh, oh)
Set me free, set me free
