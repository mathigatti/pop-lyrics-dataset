Say, say what you want, just don't say that you're leaving
I hope this summer breeze will last more than a season
Will you write to me? In time, we'll see
Maybe spend your whole life with me


We've packed our suitcases, we've shut up all the windows
Hold tight, soon you and I will flow anywhere the wind blows
So make life to me, hold tight to me
Stay awake the whole night with me

Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Can I take your shirt to dry my tears?
Can I meet you here this time next year?
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
We could take a chance and disappear
We could run away, get out of here
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Wish you were here

I taste the salt in the air and in your sweater that I sleep in
I dream of us riding bikes at sunset by the ocean
Those were giddy days, lazy days
Sipping rosé, time to waste (sipping rosé, time to waste)

Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Can I take your shirt to dry my tears?
Can I meet you here this time next year?
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
We could take a chance and disappear
We could run away, get out of here
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Wish you were here

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Souve-souvenir
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

And if I leave here, you're comin' with me
If you leave here, I'm goin' with you

Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Can I take your shirt to dry my tears?
Can I meet you here this time next year?
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
We could take a chance and disappear
We could run away, get out of here
Can I keep you as a souvenir?
Wish you were here
