Ohhhh, ii kanji, ii kanji baby

I wanna lock you up in my closet,
When no one's around
I wanna put your hand in my pocket,
Because you're allowed
I wanna drive you into the corner,
And kiss you without a sound
I wanna stay this way forever,
I'll say it loud
Now you're in and you can't get out

Ii kanji, ii kanji baby
ii kanji, baby, baby...

I can make you feel all better,
just take it in
And I can show you all the places,
you've never been
And I can make you say everything,
that you never said
And I will let you do anything,
again and again
Now you're in
and you can't get out
Sugu saseru, Anata no koto
Motto kite, tsawaraseru tomerarenai
Ikiga de kinai sake bukurai
Ii kanji, ii kanji baby
ii kanji, ii kanji baby...

Kiss me gently
Always I know
Hold me love me
Don't ever go
