You were perfect
I was unpredictable
It was more than worth it
But not too sensible
Young and foolish
Seemed to be the way
I was stupid
To think that I could stay
Oh, oh, to think that I could stay


Goodbye, my friend
Hello Heartache
It’s not the end
It’s not the same
Wish it didn’t have to be this way
But you will always mean the world to me, love
Goodbye, my friend
Hello Heartache
Hello Heartache

You got to see my worst
It’s not the first time
But this one really hurts
Oh, oh, yeah this one’s gonna... It hurts

Goodbye, my friend
Hello Heartache
