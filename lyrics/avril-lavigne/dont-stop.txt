You turn me on, what the hell's goin' on?
One look from you and I knew I was done


I don't mind you taking control
For once in my life, I let go
'Cause you turn me on, you're what I want
You're what I want
Hmmm

Don't stop
'Cause you know exactly why I came
Just gotta say my name
And I'm cut
I'm tangled up and goin' insane
I got you on the brain
Stuck inside your web again
You're stuck inside my head
Only you could make me act this way
So baby, don't stop

Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you
Baby, don't stop
Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you
Baby, don't stop
Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you
Baby, don't stop
Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you

I'll do your dance to this twisted romance
No turning back, take me slow, take me fast

I don't mind you taking control
For once in my life I let go
'Cause you turn me on, you're what I want
You're what I want
Hmmm

Don't stop
'Cause you know exactly why I came
Just gotta say my name
And I'm cut
I'm tangled up and gone insane
I got you on the brain
Stuck inside your web again
You're stuck inside my head
Only you could make me act this way
So baby, don't stop

Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you
Baby, don't stop
Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you
Baby, don't stop
Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you
Baby, don't stop
Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you

When you go, I feel low
You're like some kind of drug to me
When you go, I feel low
'Cause your poison is bittersweet
When you go, I feel low
You're like some kind of drug to me
When you go, I feel low
'Cause your poison is bittersweet

Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you
Baby, don't stop
Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you
Baby, don't stop
Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you
Baby, don't stop
Nobody can touch my body
Like you, like you
