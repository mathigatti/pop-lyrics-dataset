I coulda been the one u noticed
I coulda been all over you
I coulda been like all the others
Is that what im supposed to do


It woulda been really stupid
If i woulda went home with you 
To give you everything you wanted
It woulda been way to soon

I try to be sensitive
I try to be tough
I try to walk away
I try to be innocent
I try to be rough
But i just wanna play

You're my daydream
You know that i've been thinking about you..lately
And everytime i look at you 
I cant explain how i feel inside
I can't get away 
You're my daydream

Yeah
And you know and you know and you know and you know
You're making me insane
And you know and you know and you know and you know
You're doing it again...(repeats)
