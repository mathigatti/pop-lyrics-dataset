I miss you
I miss you so bad
I don't forget you
Oh! It's so sad


I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found
It won't be the same
Oh!

I didn't get around to kiss you
Goodbye on the hand
I wish that I could see you again
I know that I can't

I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found
It won't be the same
Oh!

I've had my wake up
Won't you wake up
I keep asking why
I can't take it
It wasn't fake
It happened you passed by

Now you're gone
Now you're gone
There you're go
There you're go
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Now you're gone
Now you're gone
There you're go
There you're go
Somewhere you're not coming back

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found
It won't be the same
Oh!

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found
It won't be the same
Oh!

I miss you
