Why do you always do this to me?
Why couldn't you just see through me?
How come?
You act like this, like you just don't care at all
Do you expect me to believe
I was the only one to fall?


I can feel, I can feel you near me
Even though you're far away
I can feel, I can feel you, baby, why?

It's not supposed to feel this way
I need you, I need you more and more each day
It's not supposed to hurt this way
I need you, I need you, I need you
Tell me, are you and me still together?
Tell me, do you think we could last forever?
Tell me, why?

Hey, listen to what we're not saying
Let's play a different game than what we're playing
Try to look at me and really see my heart
Do you expect me to believe
I'm gonna let us fall apart?

I can feel, I can feel you near me
Even when you're far away
I can feel, I can feel you, baby, why?

It's not supposed to feel this way
I need you, I need you more and more each day
It's not supposed to hurt this way
I need you, I need you, I need you
Tell me, are you and me still together?
Tell me, you think we could last forever?
Tell me, why?

So go and think about whatever you need to think about
Go ahead and dream about whatever you need to dream about
And come back to me when you know just how you feel, you feel

I can feel, I can feel you near me
Even though you're far away
I can feel, I can feel you, baby, why?

It's not supposed to hurt this way
I need you, I need you more and more each day
It's not supposed to hurt this way
I need you, I need you, I need you
Tell me

It's not supposed to hurt this way
I need you, I need you more and more each day
It's not supposed to hurt this way
I need you, I need you, I need you
Tell me, are you and me still together?
Tell me, do you think we could last forever?
Tell me, why?
