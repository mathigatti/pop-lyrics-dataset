No, no, no, no
No, es s-s-secreto
Hey, hey, tu, tu
Yo quiero ser tu novia

You're so fine I want you mine you're so delicious
I think about you all the time you're so addictive
Don't you know what I can do to make you feel alright (Alright...)

Don't pretend I think you know I'm damn precious
And hell yeah, I'm the mother... princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I'm right (I'm right...)

She's like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again (Again)

So come over here and tell me what I wanna hear
Better, yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again (And again...)

Because...

She's like so whatever
And she could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

(Uh)
In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?
