You held my hand and walked me home
I know why you gave me that kiss
It was something like this and made me go, oh, oh
You wiped my tears, got rid off all my fears
Why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love
Guys are so hard to trust


Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl?
The one who, who gives it all away - yeah

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you - this time?
Did you think that it was something I was gonna do - and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way - yeah

Don't think that your charm
And the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants
I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget
I'm gonna ask you to stop
I thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset
So get out of my head, get off of my bed
Yeah, that's what I said

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl?
The one who throws it all away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you - this time?
Did you think that it was something I was gonna do - and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way - yeah

This guilt trip that you put me on
Won't mess me up, I've done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you - this time?
Did you think that it was something I was gonna do - and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way - yeah

I'm better off alone anyway
