Every now and then we all want something
Even if there's no way of gettin' it
If i stomp my feet could that make be
Be the way around it, could I get myself around it


Get me what I want
Everything that yall got
So get me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot

Dont wanna always have to be so nice
Dont wanna hear you say well thats just life
I dry it out when I open my mouth
I make my way around it,i always make my way around it

Get me what I want
Everything that yall got
Get me what I want
Cause Im a big shot

So give me what I want
I always get what I want
You don't want to see me when
I don't get what I want
Thats not what you want

I'm not about to take no for an answer no
If I tell you I cant I'm still gonna go
I did it all by myself and I found
I found my way around it

Get me what I want
Everything that yall got
Get me what I want
Cause Im a big shot

So give me what I want
I always get what I want
Don't want to see me when
I don't get what I want
Thats not what you want

It's not to lovely
It could start to get ugly
It really bugs me
If I don't get my way

Get me what I want
Everything that yall got
Get me what I want
Cause Im a big shot

So give me what I want
I always get what I want
Don't want to see me when
I don't get what I want
Thats not what you want
