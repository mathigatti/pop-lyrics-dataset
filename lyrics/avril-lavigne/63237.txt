I wake up in the morning, put on my face
The one that's gonna get me through another day
Doesn't really matter how I feel inside
'Cause life is like a game sometimes


But then you came around me, the walls just disappeared
Nothing to surround me and keep me from my fears
I'm unprotected
See how I've opened up
Oh, you've made me trust

'Cause I've never felt like this before
I'm naked around you
Does it show?
You see right through me and I can't hide
I'm naked around you
And it feels so right

I'm trying to remember why I was afraid
To be myself and let the covers fall away
I guess I never had someone like you - to help me
To help me fit in my skin

I've never felt like this before
I'm naked around you
Does it show?
You see right through me and I can't hide
I'm naked around you
And it feels so right

I'm naked
Oh, oh, yeah, does it show?
Yeah, I'm naked

I'm naked around you
Does it show?

I'm so naked around you
And I can't hide
You're gonna, you're gonna see right through
(You see right through me and I can't hide)
You're gonna see right through
(I'm naked around you)

I'm so naked around you
And I can't hide
You're gonna see right through, baby
