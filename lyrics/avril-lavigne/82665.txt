La-la-ah-ah, yeah
La-la-ah-ah


I coulda been the one you noticed
I coulda been all over you
I coulda been like all the others
Is that what I'm supposed to do?

It woulda been really stupid
If I woulda went home with you
To give you everything you wanted
It woulda been way too soon

I try to be sensitive, I try to be tough
I try to walk away
I try to be innocent, I try to be rough
But I just want to play

You're my daydream
You know that I've been thinking about you lately
And everytime I look at you
I can't explain, I feel insane
I can't get away
You're my daydream, yeah

And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know
You're making me insane
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know
You're doing it again, yeah

If I'd tell you what I'm thinking
And I'd let myself trust you
Can you give me what I'm missing?
Can you make my dreams come true?

I try to be sensitive, I try to be tough
I try to walk away
I try to be innocent, I try to be rough
But I just want to play

You're my daydream
You know that I've been thinking about you lately
And everytime I look at you
I can't explain, I feel insane
I can't get away
You're my daydream, yeah

And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know
You're making me insane
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know
You're doing it again

And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know
You're making me insane
And you know, and you know, and you know
You're doing it again
