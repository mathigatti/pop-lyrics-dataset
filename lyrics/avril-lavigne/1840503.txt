I'm sorry if this hurts you
But I tried to keep what we had once, I was wrong
It wasn't keeping me awake
You didn't listen, you didn't hear me
When I said I want more, I got no more
You weren't stealing me away, oh


It's not enough, it's not enough to give me
What it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me
Everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time
To give this up

All the memories that we're losing
All the time that I spent with you everyday
I think it's running down the drain
I'm feeling that we're fading
Don't make this as hard as you think it would be
It's a lot easier than it seems, yeah

It's not enough, it's not enough to give me
What it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me
Everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time
To give this up

And I can feel it falling down
Slowly, slowly
I can see us starting to drown
Can't stop it now
I can see it burning out
So show me, show me
How you're gonna turn it around
Because

It's not enough, it's not enough to give me
What it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me
Everything I need

It's not enough, it's not enough to give me
What it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me
Everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time
To give this up

It's not enough, it's not enough (to give me)
It's not enough, it's not enough (what it is I want)
It's not enough, it's not enough (to give this up)
For me (to get me everything I need)

It's not enough, it's not enough (to give me)
It's not enough, it's not enough (what it is I want)
It's not enough, it's not enough (to give this up)
For me (to get me)
