Hey, hey, vous, vous
Je n'aime pas ta copine
No way, no way
Tu as besoin d'une nouvelle
Hey, hey, you, you
Je serais ta copine!


Hey, hey, vous, vous
Je sais que tu m'aimes bien
No way, no way
Ce n'est pas un secret
Hey, hey, you, you
Je serais ta copine!

You're so fine I want you mine you're so delicious
I think about you all the time you're so addictive
Don't you know what I can do to make you feel alright (alright)

Don't pretend I think you know I'm damn precious
And hell yeah, I'm the mother princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I'm right (I'm right)

She's like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again (again)

So come over here and tell me what I wanna hear
Better, yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again (and again)

Because

She's like so whatever
And she could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

(Uh)
In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?
