Come up to meet ya
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need ya
And tell you I set you apart


Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles
Coming in tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
And no one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science
Science and progress
Don't speak as loud as my heart

And tell me you love me
And, come back and haunt me
Oh, when I rush to the start
Running in circles
Chasing tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
And no one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Ah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
