Slippin' down a slide
I did enjoy the ride
Don't know what to decide
You lied to me
You looked me in the eye
It took me by surprise
Now are you gratified?
You cried to me


La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Don't turn around
'Cause you will get punched in the face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
It's too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it

When I was feelin' down
You'd start to hang around
And then I found your hands
All over me
And that was out of bounds
You filthy rotten hound
It's better than it sounds
Believe me

La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Don't turn around
'Cause you will get punched in the face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
It's too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it

Hey, yeah
You got to get over
Hey, yeah
You got to get over it

Too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
Just one of those things
You'll have to get over it

Don't turn around
'Cause you will get punched in the face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad

Don't turn around
'Cause you will get punched in the face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
Too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
Just one of those things
You'll have to get over it

You'll have to get over it
