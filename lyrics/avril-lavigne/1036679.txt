I've only got three dollars left in my hands
I walk down the sidewalk as I pass a dirty man
Walk up the staircase that leads to my hotel
I'm living in at a fancy hotel, yeah, yeah


Then I will go up to my room
Fixate on, what's the deal I'm alone again?
Then I will crawl into the bed
And call you up to tell you off

'Cause I'm on my own
Would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind?
Because you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight?
If I let you go tonight
Yeah, yeah, let go

I'll probably wake up a little sad
But then I'll get up and let go of it all instead
Because really it's not worth it to get in a mess over him
To bother getting stressed over him, no

So I'll just go on with my life
And fixate on everything else but you
Yeah, I'll just go on with my life
I have no reason to please you anymore

'Cause I'm on my own
Would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind?
Because you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight?
If I let you go

So find your way out of my sight
I know it's hard, it's tough to laugh
It's all messed up, don't play this game
Yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause I'm on my own
Would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind?
Because you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight? Yeah!

Well, I'm on my own
Would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind?
Because you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight?
If I let you go tonight

Yeah, yeah, oh
Getting stressed over you
Yeah, yeah
Getting messed over you
