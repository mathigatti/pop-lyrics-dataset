First glance
You nearly meet my jaw drop
First dance
And you were looking so hot
Held hands
I moved in for a lip-lock
Don’t stop, baby
Don’t stop, baby


First taste, like honey
You were so yum
Can’t wait for a second
‘Cause it’s so fun
Third base
And head it for a home run
Don’t stop, baby
Don’t stop, baby

Now, hold on tight
To this roallercoster ride
And if you’re loving this
Just give me one more kiss
‘Cause you ain’t seen nothing yet
And just let go
If you don’t we'll never know
So if you’re loving this
Just give me one more kiss
‘Cause you ain’t seen nothing yet

My place, you show up with flowers
Your face, could staring it for hours
Can’t wait to see your super powers
Don’t stop, baby
Don’t stop, baby

Your car, I’m sitting right beside you
Rock star,
At everything  that you do
My heart is ready for the next move
Don’t stop, baby
Don’t stop, baby

Now, hold on tight
To this roallercoster ride
And if you’re loving this
Just give me one more kiss
‘Cause you ain’t seen nothing yet
And just let go
If you don’t we'll never know
So if you’re loving this
Just give me one more kiss
‘Cause you ain’t seen nothing yet

Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet

‘Cause you ain’t seen nothing yet

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on tight

Hold on tight
To this roallercoster ride
And if you’re loving this
Just give me one more kiss
‘Cause you ain’t seen nothing yet
And just let go
If you don’t we'll never know
So if you’re loving this
Just give me one more kiss
‘Cause you ain’t seen nothing yet

Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet

‘Cause you ain’t seen nothing yet

Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet

‘Cause you ain’t seen nothing yet
