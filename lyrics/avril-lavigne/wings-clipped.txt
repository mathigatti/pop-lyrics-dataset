All your lovers
No, they’re not your friends
Learned the hard way fast
That every time you give someone your trust
They throw it back
They throw it back


Another Sunday
Waking on the ground
Signal breaking down
'Cause everytime you said they loved you
Left and took it back
Took it back

Taken hostage
Cut your tongue
They make you watch as
The world slips by you
Chasing something
You’re crying out, crying out, oh

They say it’s weakness
But you’re just an angel with your wings clipped
Someone came and took all of your secrets
Now you can’t fly away, now you can't fly away, eyy

They say it’s madness
Future on the line, you’re moving backwards
Someone came and broke you right in half so
That you can’t fly away, that you can't fly away, eyy

But you’re just an angel with your

Got you covered
Like a body suit
Made of lead and doubt
But you’re still wondering why you feel
Too heavy to go out
To go out

People calling
In a state for you
Think they love too loud
And so you push them all away
But it's too damn quiet now
Quiet now

Taken hostage
Cut your tongue
They make you watch as
The world slips by you
Chasing something
You’re crying out, crying out, ooh

They say it’s weakness
But you’re just an angel with your wings clipped
Someone came and took all of your secrets
Now you can’t fly away, now you cant fly away, eyy

They say it’s madness
Future on the line, you’re moving backwards
Someone came and broke you right in half so
That you can’t fly away, that you can't fly away, eyy

You can’t fly away
