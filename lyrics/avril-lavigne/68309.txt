Used to carry this big old world
on my shoulders and back
I used to lie inside my room
wondering where I am at


I felt a chill running through my veins
And wondered, would I be saved?
I felt the ice building in my soul
Would it melt away?

He's a warm breeze
Breathing life into me
He's the sunlight
Shining down on me

I used to worry my life away
Counting every dime
Shutting out the ones I loved
Never finding the time

And then one day I was overcome
By loneliness and dispair
And deep inside I thought I heard
"Lean on me, I'm here"

He's a warm breeze
Breathing life into me
He's the sunlight
Shining down on me
I pulled the burden from off my back
And tossed it into the wind
And stretched my arms toward the sky
And let my life begin

And like a tree, I have measured up
Best when I've been cut down
And like a tree, I can touch the sky
With my feet on the ground

He's a warm breeze
Breathing life into me
He's the sunlight
Shining down on me

He's a warm breeze
Breathing life into me
He's the sunlight
Shining down on me, yeah
Shining down on me
Shining down, shining down
Shining down on me
