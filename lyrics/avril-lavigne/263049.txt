I saw you last night, down at the mere
I saw how you were playing gently with her hair
I see you and I, in my mirror
I close my eyes and wish that you would be here


It's my fantasy
To have you holding me, baby
I'm going privately crazy
Do you know what you're doing to me?

Stay
Make my blue moon bright for a change
Make my dreams end right
Don't stay afraid
Be the one

Get out of my head, get into my heart
Be for real, who you; fiction or real?
I made up this lie, I made up this life
When I'm alone, it's like you're right by my side

It's my fantasy
To have you here with me, baby
I'm going privately crazy
If you came, I know just what I'd say

Stay
Make my blue moon bright for a change
Make my world turn right
Don't stay afraid
Be the one

It's my fantasy
To have you all to me, baby
I'm going privately crazy
Do you know what you're doing to me?

Stay
Make my blue moon bright for a change
Make my dreams end right
Don't stay afraid
Be the one
