When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a wavin flag


Born from a throne
Older than Rome
But violent prone
Poor people zone

But it's my home
All I have known

Where I got grown
But now its gone

Out of the darkness
In came the carnage
Threatening my very survival

Fractured my streets
And broke all my dreams

Feels like defeat to wretched retreat

So we strugglin'

Fighting to eat

And we wonderin'

If we'll be free

We cannot wait for some faithful day
It's too far away so right I'll say

When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a waving flag
(And then it goes back)

Ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh

So many wars, settling scores

All that we've been through
And now there is more

I hear them say love is the way

Love is the answer that's what they say

But were not just dreamers
Of broken down grievers

Our hand will reach us
And

This can't control us
No it can't hold us down

We gon pick it up even though we still struggling

Au nom de la survie (in the name of survival)

And we wondering

Battant pour nos vie (fighting for our lives)


We patiently wait
For some other day

Thats too far away so right now we say

Uh, well, alright
How come when the media stops covering
And there's a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling
And assume that its really all love again, nah
See we don't have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren't involved before it's never too late to start
You probably think that it's too far to even have to care
Well take a look at where you live what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again

When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a wavin' flag

And then it goes back

And then it goes back

Then it goes back

When I get older
When I get older
I will be stronger
Just like a waving flag
