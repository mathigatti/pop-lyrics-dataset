Adia, I do believe I've failed you
Adia, I know I've let you down
Don't you know I've tried so hard to love you in my way?
It's easy, let it go


Adia, I'm empty since you left me
I try to find a way to carry on
I search myself in everyone
To see where we went wrong
There's no one left to finger
There's no one here to blame
There's no one left to talk to, honey
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
But does it matter?

Adia, I thought that we could make it
I know I can't change the way you feel
I leave you with your misery
A friend who won't betray
I pull you from your tower
And take away your pain
And show you all the beauty you possess
If you'd only let yourself believe that

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
But does it matter?

We are born innocent
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
But does it matter?

Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
But does it matter?

Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
But does it matter?
