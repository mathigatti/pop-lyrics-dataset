Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, my love
I can't hide, can't hide
Can't hide what has come


I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know
Always know
Always know
That I love you so

I love you so, oh
I love you so

Goodbye, brown eyes
Goodbye for now
Goodbye, sunshine
Take care of yourself

I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know
Always know
Always know
That I love you so

I love you so, oh
I love you so, oh

La, lullaby
Distract me with your rhymes
La, lullaby
La, lullaby
Help me sleep tonight
La, lullaby, la, lullaby, la, lullaby...

I have to go (goodbye)
I have to go (lullaby)
I have to go (goodbye)
And leave you alone
But always know (goodbye)
Always know (brown eyes)
Always know (goodbye)
That I love you so

I love you so (goodbye, lullaby)
I love you so, oh (goodbye)
I love you so (goodbye, brown eyes)
I love you so (goodbye)
I love you so
I love you so

Goodbye, brown eyes
Goodbye, my love
