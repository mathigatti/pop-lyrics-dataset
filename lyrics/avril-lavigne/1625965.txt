Tripping out, spinning around
I'm underground, I fell down
Yeah, I fell down


I'm freaking out, where am I now?
Upside down and I can't stop it now
You can't stop me now, oh

Oh, oh, oh
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry

I found myself in Wonderland
Get back on my feet again
Is this real? Is this pretend?
I'll take a stand until the end

Oh, oh, oh
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry

Oh, oh, oh
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, and I won't cry
