I'm giving up
On everything, because you messed me up
Don't know how much you screwed it up
You never listened, that's just too bad

Because I'm moving on
I won't forget, you were the one that was wrong
I know I need to step up and be strong
Don't patronize me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ah, ah, ah, oh
Ah, ah, ah, oh

Gotta get away
There's no point on thinking about yesterday
It's too late now, it will never be the same
We're so different now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know I wanna run away
I know I wanna run away
Run away
If only I could run away
If only I could run away
Run away

I told you what I wanted
I told you what I wanted
What I wanted
But I was forgotten
I won't be forgotten
Never again

Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
Do you get it now?

Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
