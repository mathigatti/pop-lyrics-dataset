There is a place of quiet rest
Near to the heart of God
A place where sin cannot molest
Near to the heart of God


O Jesus, blest Redeemer
Sent from the heart of God
Hold us who wait before Thee
Near to the heart of God

There is a place of comfort sweet
Near to the heart of God
A place where we our Savior meet
Near to the heart of God

There is a place of full release
Near to the heart of God
A place where all is joy and peace
Near to the heart of God

There is a place of full release
Near to the heart of God
A place where all is joy and peace
Near to the heart of God
