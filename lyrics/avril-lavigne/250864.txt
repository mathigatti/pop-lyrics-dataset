You see, I got a little bit of a problem
Back where I come from
It feels like five people
In my population
And no one ever leaves there
I'm gonna be the first one


I guess my papa always told me the way it was
And my mama think she knows me, I know she doesn't
Ah, ah, ah

But I've got my head set on California
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya
And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off
I've got my head set on California
Here I come

I see, I got what you would call an obsession
It feels like I think sane
The limits of a small town
Frustratin' my brain
Might leave some roots there
But my head's on the next plane

'Cause my daddy always tells me the way it was
And my mama think she knows me, I know she doesn't
Ah, ah, ah

But I've got my head set on California
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya
And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off
I've got my head set on California
Here I come
Here I come

Papa always tells me the way it was
And my mama think she knows me, I know she doesn't
Ah, ah, ah

But I've got my head set on New York City
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even miss me
And I'll get a big boyfriend, just to piss you off

But I've got my head set on California
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya
And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off
I've got my head set on California
Here I come
Here I come
