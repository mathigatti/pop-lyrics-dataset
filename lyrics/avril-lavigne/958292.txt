Uh oh, uh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh, uh oh


Hey, man
Tell me what were you thinking
What the hell were you saying
Oh, come on now, stop and think about it

Hey, now
Maybe you should just listen
Maybe you should stop talking for a second
Shut up, listen to me

You're so obvious
You're so oblivious
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone
So don't apologize
And you don't even realize
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone

Uh oh, uh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh, uh oh

Hey, brow
I'm just trying to let you know
You really think that you're special
Oh, come on now, I've seen so much better

Hey there
Did you actually think that I cared?
Don't know if you want to go there
Oh, come on now, keep on, keep on dreaming

You're so obvious
You're so oblivious
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone
So don't apologize
And you don't even realize
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone

If you want to be my, oh, oh, oh
You know you can't play games
And you know what I mean
I'm sorry but you don't get my, my, oh, oh, oh
I'm gone, you're still dreaming about me
Over and over and over and over again

You're so obvious
You're so oblivious
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone
So don't apologize
And you don't even realize
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone

You're so obvious
You're so oblivious
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone
So don't apologize
And you don't even realize
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone

Uh oh, uh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh, uh oh

Alone
