You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control, oh oh
But you don't really give a shit
You go with it, you go with it, you go with it
'Cause you're fucking crazy rock 'n roll


You said: Hey, what's your name?
It took one look and now I'm not the same
Yeah, you said hey, and since that day
You stole my heart and you're the one to blame, yeah

And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since everyday and everything
Has felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I smile

Last night I blacked out, I think
What did you, what did you put in my drink?
I remember making out and then, oh, oh
I woke up with a new tattoo
Your name was on me and my name was on you
I would do it all over again

You said: Hey, what's your name?
It took one look and now I'm not the same
Yeah, you said hey, and since that day
You stole my heart and you're the one to blame, yeah

And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since everyday and everything
Has felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I smile
The reason why I smile

You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control

You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control

And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since everyday and everything
Has felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I smile
The reason why I smile

The reason why I smile
