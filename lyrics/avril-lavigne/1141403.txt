O holy night,
The stars are brightly shining;
It is the night of
Our dear savior's birth!
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining,
Till he appeared
And the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope,
The weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn.


Fall on your knees,
O hear the angel voices!
O night divine,
O night when christ was born!
O night divine, o night,
O night divine!

Truly he taught us
To love one another;
His law is love and
His gospel is peace.
Chains shall he break
For the slave is our brother
And in his name

All oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in
Grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us
Praise his holy name!
Christ is the king
Then already already praises we
His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim
His pow'r and glory
Evermore proclaim
