Mina saiko! Arigato! ka-ka-ka kawaii!

Mom's not home tonight
So we can roll around have a pillow fight
Like a major ranger, OMFG


U-o,u-o,u-o!

Let's all slumber party
Like a fat kid on a pack of smarties
Someone chuck a cupcake at me

Hey, hey, hey!

It's time for spin the bottle
Not gonna talk about it tomorrow
Keep it just between you and me

U-o,u-o,u-o!

Let's play truth or dare now
We can roll around in our underwear how
Every silly kitty should be

Hey, hey, hey!

Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so pretty, pretty
Don't go kitty, kitty
Stay with me

Come, come, kitty kitty
You're so silly, silly
Don't go kitty, kitty
Play with me! Ka-ka-ka kawaii!

Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, you're so pretty!
Hello Kitty, hello kitty
Hello Kitty, you're so silly

Wake up, got a secret
Pinky swear that you're gonna keep it
I've got something you need to see

U-o,u-o,u-o!

Let's be friends forever
I wanna do everything with you together
Come and play with kitty and me

Hey, hey, hey!

Come, come, kitty kitty
You're so pretty, pretty
Don't go kitty, kitty
Stay with me

Come,come, kitty, kitty
You're so silly, silly
Don't go kitty, kitty
Play with me! Ka-ka-ka kawaii!

Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, you're so pretty
Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, you're so silly
