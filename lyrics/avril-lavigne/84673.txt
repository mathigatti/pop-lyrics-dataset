I can't find the reason to let go
Even though you've found a new love
And she's what your dreams are made of.
I can't find a reason to hang on
What went wrong can be forgiven
Without you it aint worth living  alone


Sometimes I wake up crying at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine

I Took out all the pictures about our wedding day 
Its was the time of love and laughter
Happy ever after
But even though those pictures have begun to fade
Please tell me she's not real 
and that you're really coming home to stay

REFRÃO

I can give you two good reasons
To show you love is not blind
He is 2 and she is 4 and you know         
They adore you
So how can I tell them that you've changed your mind?

REFRÃO

I remember when you were mine
