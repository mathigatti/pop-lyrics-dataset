If I show you
Get to know you
If I hold you just for today
I'm not gonna wanna let go
I'm not gonna wanna go home
Tell me you feel the same


'Cause I'm 4 real, are you 4 real?
I can't help myself, it's the way I feel
When you look me in the eyes, like you did last night
I can't stand to hear you say goodbye

Well, it feels so right 'cause it feels so right
Just to have you standing by my side
So don't let me go 'cause you have my soul
And I just wanted you to know

I don't want to look back
'Cause I know that we have
Something the past could never change
And now I'm stuck in the moment
And my heart is open
Tell me that you feel the same

'Cause I'm 4 real, are you 4 real?
I can't help myself, it's the way I feel
When you look me in the eyes, like you did last night
I can't stand to hear you say goodbye

Well, it feels so right 'cause it feels so right
Just to have you standing by my side
So don't let me go 'cause you have my soul
And I just wanted you to know

Hold me down
Hold me now
I'm safe, I'm sound
When you're around

Hold me down
Hold me now
I'm safe, I'm sound
When you're around

'Cause I'm 4 real, are you 4 real?
I can't help myself, it's the way I feel
When you look me in the eyes, like you did last night
I can't stand to hear you say goodbye

Well, it feels so right 'cause it feels so right
Just to have you standing by my side
So don't let me go 'cause you have my soul
And I just wanted you to know

'Cause I'm 4 real, are you 4 real?
I can't help myself, it's the way I feel
When you look me in the eyes, like you did last night
I can't stand to hear you say goodbye

Well, it feels so right 'cause it feels so right
Just to have you standing by my side
So don't let me go 'cause you have my soul
And I just wanted you to know
