It's the first time I ever felt this lonely
I wish someone would cure this pain
It's funny when you think it's gonna work out
'Till you chose weed over me, you're so lame


I thought you were cool until the point
Up until the point you didn't call me
When you said you would
I finally figured out you're all the same
Always coming up with some kind of story

Every time I try to make you smile
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You can't, you're too tough
You think you're loveless
Is that too much that I'm asking for?

I thought you'd come around when I ignored you
Sorta thought you'd have the decency to change
But, babe, I guess you didn't take that warning
'Cause I'm not about to look at your face again

Can't you see that you lie to yourself?
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won't be too late when the smoke clears
'Cause I, I am still here

But every time I try to make you smile
You'd always go on feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You'd stand like a stone
Alone in your zone
Is it too much that I'm asking for?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't find where I am
Lying here, alone in fear
Afraid of the dark
No one to claim, alone again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't you see that you lie to yourself?
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won't be too late when the smoke clears
'Cause I, I am still here

Every time I try to make you smile
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You can't, you're too tough
You think you're loveless
It was too much that I asked him for
