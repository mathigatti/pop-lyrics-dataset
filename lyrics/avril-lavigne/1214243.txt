I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
You're living in the past it's a new generation
A girl can do what she wants to do and that's
What I'm gonna do
An' I don't give a damn ' bout my bad reputation


Oh, no, not me

And I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
Never said I wanted to improve my station
And I'm only doin' good
When I'm havin' fun
And I don't have to please no one
And I don't give a damn
'Bout my bad reputation

Oh, no, not me
Oh, no, not me

I don't give a damn
'Bout my reputation
I've never been afraid of any deviation
And I don't really care
If you think I'm strange
I ain't gonna change
And I'm never gonna care
'Bout my bad reputation

Oh, no, not me
Oh, no, not me

Pedal boys!

And I don't give a damn
'Bout my reputation
The world's in trouble
There's no communication
And everyone can say
What they want to say
It never gets better anyway
So why should I care
'Bout a bad reputation anyway
Oh, no, not me
Oh, no, not me

I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation
You're living in the past
It's a new generation
And I only feel good
When I got no pain
And that's how I'm gonna stay
And I don't give a damn
'Bout my bad reputation

Oh, no, not me
Oh, no, not
Not me, not me
