I'm tugging at my hair
I'm pulling at my clothes
I'm trying to keep my cool
I know it shows
I'm staring at my feet
My cheeks are turning red
I'm searching for the words inside my head


I'm feeling nervous
Trying to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah

If I could say what I wanna say
I'd say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?
If I could say what I wanna see
I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today?
Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

They don't do me any good
It's just a waste of time
What use is it to you?
What's on my mind?
If ain't coming out
We're not going anywhere
So why can't I just tell you that I care?

'Cause I'm feeling nervous
Trying to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah

If I could say what I wanna say
I'd say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?
If I could say what I wanna see
I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today?
Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

What's wrong with my tongue?
These words keep slipping away
I stutter, I stumble
Like I've got nothing to say

'Cause I'm feeling nervous
Trying to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah

Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

If I could say what I wanna say
I'd say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?
If I could say what I wanna see
I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today?
Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say
These things I'll never say
