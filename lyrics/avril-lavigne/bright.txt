Everything is numb
I've lost all the feelings in my bones
Got no place to go
Now I got nobody calling


I've been sleepin' through the days and nights
I've been feelin' I can't even fight for things that
Used to get me feeling so alive
And I'm feelin' li-li-li-like
I'm just another shootin' star
Disappearing in the dark
Oh, when we fall, we fall so hard

Gotta look up, just to catch that light
Out of the darkness, we burn so bright
Burning, burning bright
Burning bright
Burning, burning bright
Out of the darkness, we burn so bright
Burning, burning bright
Burning bright
Burning, burning bright
Out of the darkness, we burn so bright

'Til I'm, 'til I'm
Bright

Waking up alone
Feeling like I'm somewhere in between
Everything I know
Slowly coming back to meet me

I've been sleepin' through the days and nights
I've been feelin' I can't even fight for things that
Used to get me feeling so alive
And I'm feelin' li-li-li-like
I'm just another shootin' star
Disappearing in the dark
Oh, and we fall, we fall so hard

Gotta look up, just to catch that light
Out of the darkness, we burn so bright
Burning, burning bright
Burning bright
Burning, burning bright
Out of the darkness, we burn so bright
Burning, burning bright
Burning bright
Burning, burning bright
Out of the darkness, we burn so bright

I've gotta find the light inside of me
I've gotta fight the fight, that's up to me
I'm gonna take back all my dreams
And I-I-I-I
Find the light, and I believe
I've gotta fight the fight to set me free
I've gotta find the light inside of me

And I'm just another shootin' star
Disappearing in the dark
Oh, when we fall, we fall so hard

Gotta look up, just to catch that light
Out of the darkness, we burn so bright
Burning, burning bright
Burning bright
Burning, burning bright
Out of the darkness, we burn so bright
Burning, burning bright
Burning bright
Burning, burning bright
Out of the darkness, we burn so bright

'Til I'm, 'til I'm
Bright
