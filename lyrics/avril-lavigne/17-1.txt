Seventeen, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen


He was working at the record shop
I would kiss him in the parking lot
Tasting like cigarettes and soda pop
Seventeen

He would tell me I was beautiful
Sneaking in the neighbor's swimming pool
Yeah, he taught me how to break the rules
Seventeen

Hey, those days are long gone
And when I hear this song
It takes me back

We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be
Seventeen

Stealing beers out of the trailer park
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark
My favorite place was sitting in his car
Seventeen

We laid a blanket on the roof top
That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop
The nights were cold but we kept them hot
Seventeen

Hey, those days are long gone
And when I hear this song
It takes me back

We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be

We were running red lights
We were going all night
Didn't care about anything
'Cause it was you and me
We were living our dream
And we were seventeen

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (seventeen)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh (seventeen)

I remember what it felt like
Just a small town kind of life
If I could only just go back in time
Seventeen

We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be

We were running red lights
We were going all night
Didn't care about anything
'Cause it was you and me
We were living our dream
And we were seventeen

Seventeen
