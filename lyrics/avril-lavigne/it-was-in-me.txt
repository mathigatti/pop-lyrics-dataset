I've been through all the parties and it wasn't there
I followed where my heart leads, it wasn't there
Screamed at the top of my lungs and no one cared


I searched on the mountain's top, it wasn't there
I drove a Maserati, no fulfillment there
I round around the whole damn world, to get back here

Now let me feel high when I'm sober
Let me feel young when I'm older
Let me feel proud when it's over
I finally realized
All of this time

It was in me
All along it was in me

I took the time to listen and I found it here
I started to see the vision and it was clear
Everyone's got an opinion but I don't care

Now let me feel high when I'm sober
Let me feel young when I'm older
Let me feel proud when it's over
I finally realized
All of this time

It was in me
All along it was in me

Oh, and I
All I needed was a little faith in my life
All I needed was a little trust in myself
All I needed was to find the truth in my heart

Let me feel high when I'm sober
Let me feel young when I'm older
Let me feel proud when it's over, yeah
It was in me (Let me feel high when I'm sober)
It was in me (Let me feel young when I'm older)
Let me feel proud when it's over
I finally realized
All of this time

It was in me, all along
It was in me
