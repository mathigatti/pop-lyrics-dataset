You're so good to me, baby, baby

I want to lock you up in my closet when no one's around
I want to put your hand in my pocket because you're allowed
I want to drive you into the corner and kiss you without a sound
I want to stay this way forever, I'll say it loud


Now you're in and can't get out

You make me so hot
Make me wanna drop
It's so ridiculous
I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe
You make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous
You're so good to me, baby, baby
You're so good to me, baby, baby

I can make you feel all better, just take it in
And I can show you all the places you've never been
And I can make you say everything that you never said
And I will let you do anything again and again

Now you're in and can't get out

You make me so hot
Make me wanna drop
It's so ridiculous
I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe
You make me wanna scream
You're fabulous
You're so good to me, baby, baby
You're so good to me, baby, baby

Kiss me gently
Always I know
Hold me, love me
Don't ever go

You make me so hot
Make me wanna drop
It's so ridiculous
I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe
You make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous
You're so good to me

You make me so hot
Make me wanna drop
It's so ridiculous
I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe
You make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous
You're so good to me, baby, baby
You're so good to me, baby, baby

You're so good
