I'm not afraid of anything
I just need to know that I can breathe
I don't need much of anything
But suddenly, suddenly


I am small and the world is big
All around me is fast moving
Surrounded by so many things
But suddenly, suddenly

How does it feel, to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel, to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?

I'm young, and I am free
But I get tired, and I get weak
I get lost, and I can't sleep
But suddenly, suddenly

How does it feel, to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel, to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?

Would you comfort me yeah
Would you cry with me yeah

Ahh, ahh, ahh-ah
ahh, ahh-ah
ahh, ahh-ah
ahh, ahh-ah
Ahh, ahh, ahh-ah
ahh, ahh-ah
ahh, ahh-ah
ahh, ahh-ah

I am small and the world is big
But I'm not afraid of anything

How does it feel, to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel, to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?

How does it feel, to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel, to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?

Ahh, ahh, ahh-ah, ahh-ah, ahh-ah
Ahh, ahh, ahh-ah, ahh-ah, ahh-ah

How does it feel
You're different from me, different
(Ahh, ahh, ahh-ah, ahh-ah, ahh-ah
Ahh, ahh, ahh-ah, ahh-ah, ahh-ah)
