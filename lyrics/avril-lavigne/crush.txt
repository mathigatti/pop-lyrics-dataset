You make me lose control
Your fingers on my bones
I'm slipping through the floor
So, baby, don't crush me
'Cause there's no exit here
No way to disappear
There's not a single tear
So, baby, don't crush me


It's just the way you are
The way that you walk
The way that you talk
The way that you read me, baby
And honey, don't hide
That look in your eyes
Darlin', it drives me crazy
Don't crush, don't crush me, no
And say you'll remain

I'll let you take the wheel
My heart is yours to steal
Yeah, I know this is real
So, baby, don't crush me
The pedals to the floor
And now we're heading north
I've been down this road before
So, baby, don't crush me

It's just the way you are
The way that you walk
The way that you talk
The way that you, you read me baby
And honey, don't hide
That look in your eyes
Darlin' it, it drives me crazy
Don't crush, don't crush me, no
And say you'll remain my love

And now that I finally found ya
(I just can't live without ya)
You're making me so all about ya
(I just can't live without ya)
I don't know what I'd ever do
If I ain't got you
Because

It's just the way you are
The way that you walk
The way that you talk
The way that you read me, baby
Honey, don't hide
That look in your eyes
Darlin', it drives me crazy
Say you'll remain my love

Don't let my heart break
And crush
Don't crush, don't crush me, no
(The way that you walk)
(The way that you talk)
(The way that you, you read me, baby)
'Cause I've crushed, I've crushed, oh
(And honey don't hide)
(That look in your eyes)
(Darlin it, it drives me crazy)

Don't crush, 'cause I've crushed
Ooh, ooh, ah
