Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are
like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, a wish right

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are
like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, a wish right
now, a wish right now
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and
crashin'
