Just take it, take it
Can’t take it, take it


I know what you do, you flash me
The ways it’s done, impolitely
Just trying to find some alone time
No room to compromise

Just take it, take it
Can’t take it, take it

So sell your picture to a magazine
And they design the true photography
Is that what you always wanted to be?
Well, I’d be worried for you

Sometimes gotta try run and hide
Get away from this
I’ll get by in this life this time

Take your best shot, impress me
Write a fictional story for your fee
Try to get the world to believe
Shocking headline surprise

And just take it, take it
Can’t take it, take it

So sell your picture to a magazine
And they design the true photography
Is that what you always wanted to be?
Well, I'd be sorry for you

Sometimes gotta try run and hide
Get away from this
I’ll get by in this life this time

You see me? I see you!
You’re over there
You see me? I see you!

So sell your picture to a magazine
And they design the true photography
Is that what you always wanted to be?
Well, I'd be sorry for you

Sometimes gotta try to run and hide
Get away from shit
Sometimes gotta try run and hide
Get away from this
