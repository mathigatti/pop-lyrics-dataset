La la la la la la la

I know your kind of girl
You only care about one thing
Who you've seen or where you've been
Who's got money


I see that look in your eyes
It tells a million lies
But deep inside I know why
You're talking to him

I know what you're all about
I really hope he figures it out

She's one of those girls, nothing but trouble
Just one look and now you're seeing double
Before you know it, she'll be gone
Off to the next one

She's so good that you won't see it coming
She'll take you for a ride and you'll be left with nothing
You'll be broken, she'll be gone
Off to the next one

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Off to the next one
Oh oh, oh oh, yeah yeah
Oh oh oh

She's going to be the end of you
At least that's what they say
It's been a while, you're in denial
And now it's too late

The way she looks it makes you high
All the warning signs
'Cause her blonde hair, her blue eyes
It makes you want to die

I know what she's all about
I really hope you figure it out

She's one of those girls, nothing but trouble
Just one look and now you're seeing double
Before you know it, she'll be gone
Off to the next one

She's so good that you won't see it coming
She'll take you for a ride and you'll be left with nothing
You'll be broken, she'll be gone
Off to the next one

You know it's a game, you know it's a game
She's keeps playing around with your head
Playing around with your head

She's so insane, so insane
She's the one to blame
She's the one to blame

She's one of those girls, nothing but trouble
Just one look and now you're seeing double
Before you know it, she'll be gone
Off to the next one

She's so good that you won't see it coming
She'll take you for a ride and you'll be left with nothing
You'll be broken, she'll be gone
Off to the next one

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Off to the next one
Oh oh, oh oh, yeah yeah
Off to the next one
