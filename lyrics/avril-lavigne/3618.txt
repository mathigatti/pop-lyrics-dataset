Please, tell me what is taking place
'Cause I can't seem to find a trace
Guess it must have got erased somehow
Probably 'cause I always forget
Everytime someone tells me their name
It's always gotta be the same


(In my world) never wore cover-up
Always beat the boys up
Grew up in a five thousand population town
Made my money by cutting grass
Got fired by fried chicken ass
All in a small town, Napanee

You know I always stay up without sleeping
And think to myself
Where do I belong forever
In whose arms, the time and place?

Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world

I never spend less than an hour
Washing my hair in the shower
It always takes five hours to make it straight
So I'll braid it in a zillion braids
Though it may take all friggen day
There's nothing else better to do anyway

When you're all alone in the lands of forever
Lay under the milky way
On and on, it's gettin' too late out
I'm not in love this time, this night

Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world

Take some time, mellow out
Party it up, but don't fall down
Don't get caught, sneak out of the house

Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world

Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world
