Waking up, I see that everything is okay
The first time in my life and now it's so great
Slowing down, I look around and I am so amazed
I think about the little things that make life great


I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please, don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

I found a place so safe, not a single tear
The first time in my life and now it's so clear
Feel calm, I belong, I'm so happy here
It's so strong and now I let myself be sincere

I wouldn't change a thing about it
And this is the best feeling

This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please, don't go away
'Cause I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

It's the state of bliss you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry

It's the state of bliss you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry

It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry

This innocence is brilliant
It makes you want to cry
This innocence is brilliant
Please, don't go away
'Cause I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
(It's so beautiful it makes you want to cry)
Don't you let it pass you by

This innocence is brilliant
(It's so beautiful)
I hope that it will stay
(It's so beautiful)
This moment is perfect
Please, don't go away
I need you now
(It makes me want to cry)
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
