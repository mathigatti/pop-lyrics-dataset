He'd already asked for my number
When will he call? â€” I wonder
I'd give it away on the Friday
I haven't heard a frigging, now it's Wednesday
I don't know what he's thinking
He can leave me alone and I'll be waiting
I don't think so
There's other fish in the sea
Who'd love to swim with me


You're not the only one
Out there for me, and I know
You're not the only one
Who's gonna be here for me

There's other fishes in the sea
There's other fishes in the sea

He finally called and I'm not home
Don't even bother at all
Can't remember what he looks like
It's been fourteen days, that's not my type
I know they're not all like that
There's gotta be some that don't think they're all that
Yes, I know, so
There's other fish in the sea
Who'd love to swim with me

You're not the only one
Out there for me, and I know
You're not the only one
Who's gonna be here for me

There's other fishes in the sea
There's other fishes in the sea
There's other fishes in the sea
There's other fishes in the sea

You're not the only one
Out there for me, and I know
You're not the only one
Who's gonna be here for me

You're not the only one
There's other fishes in the sea
You're not the only one
There's other fishes in the sea
You're not the only one
There's other fishes in the sea
You're not the only one
There's other fishes in the sea
