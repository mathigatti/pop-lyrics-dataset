Storming through the party like my name was El ni√±o
When I'm hanging out drinking in the back of an El camino
As a kid, I was a skid and no one knew me by name.
I trashed my own house party cause no body came.


I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, ever showing up when we had to.
attention that we crave don't tell us to behave,
I'm sick of always hearing act your age

I don't want to waste my time
become another casualty of society.
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down.

Because you don't
Know us at all we laugh when old people fall.
But what would you expect with a conscience so small.
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised.
Maiden and priest were the gods that we praised

Cause we like having fun at other peoples expenses and,
Cutting people down is just a minor offences then,
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn.
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn.

I don't want to waste my time
become another casualty of society.
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down.

Don't count on me, to let you know when.
Don't count on me, I'll do it again.
Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing.
Don't count on me, cause I'm not listening.

Well I'm a no goodnick lower middle class brat,
Back packed and I don't give a shit about nothing.
You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin.
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing.
Then if the egg don't stain you'll be ringing off the hook,
You're on the hit list wanted in the telephone book.
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion.
The doctor said my mom should have had an abortion. (Fadingout)
bortion
bortion
bortion
bortion

I don't want to waste my time
become another casualty of society.
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down.

Waste my time with them
Casualty of society.
Waste my time again,
Victim of your conformity
And back down.
