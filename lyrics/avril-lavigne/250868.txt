You could take the stars out of the sky
Doesn't matter, our faiths will collide
You can pull the plug out
Watch all the water strain
Still I know that it would be the same
Still I know it would be the same


I see it in my mind's eye
A world made just for you and I
So I know, it's worth the wait

Oh, once is enough
That's how I feel
We do this once and for real
Love is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and for real

I'm building my life to include you
So for now I have someone to look forward to
I'm in no hurry, no worries
You're out there somewhere
Still I hope that you will be here soon
Still I hope you will be here soon

I see it in my mind's eye
A world made just for you and I
So I know, it's worth the wait

Oh, once is enough
That's how I feel
We do this once and for real
Love is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and for real

I'm waiting for something
I'm waiting for someone
I'm waiting for you, yeah

Oh, once is enough
That's how I feel
We do this once and for real
Love is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and for real

Once is enough
That's how I feel
We do this once and for real
Love is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and for real
