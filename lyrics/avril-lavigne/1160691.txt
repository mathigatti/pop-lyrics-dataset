You're indecisive when it comes to making any plans
You're on the fence
You give me reasons I never seem to understand,
They don't make sense
Maybe ain't enough for my heart
We'll see, ain't off to a great start
Baby, I want you to be mine,
You better hurry 'cause if I change my mind


[Chorus]
You will never know,
What it means, to love me
And you will never know,
What these two lips taste like to kiss
You can just suppose to what my body feels like to hold
Hope you can deal with, all you will never know

I wanna know you, what's hiding behind this wall
Who you really are
I wanna meet you on the other side of this charade
Wherever the cards may fall
I'm ready to give you my heart
Yeah, I'm willing to show up for my part
Baby, I want you to be mine,
You better hurry 'cause if I change my mind

[Chorus]
You will never know,
What it means, to love me
And you will never know,
What these two lips taste like to kiss
You can just suppose to what my body feels like to hold
Hope you can deal with, all you will never know

[Chorus]
About me, what I see, what I believe in,
How I breathe, when I weep

[Chorus]
