Let me hear you say 'hey hey hey'
Hey hey hey!
Alright, now let me hear you say 'hey hey ho'
Hey hey ho!


I hate it when a guy doesn't get the door
Even though I told him yesterday and the day before
I hate it when a guy doesn't get the tab
And I have to pull my money out, and that looks bad, yeah

Where are the hopes? Where are the dreams?
My Cinderella story scene?
When do you think they'll finally see?

That you're not, not, not gonna get any better
And you won't, won't, won't, you won't get rid of me never
Like it or not, even though she's a lot like me
We're not the same
And, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a lot to handle
You don't know trouble, but I'm a hell of a scandal
Me, I'm a scene, I'm a drama queen
I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen

Alright, alright, yeah

I hate it when a guy doesn't understand
Why a certain time of month I don't want to hold his hand
I hate it when they go out and we stay in
And they come home smelling like their ex-girlfriend

But I found my hopes, I found my dreams
My Cinderella story scene
Now everybody's gonna see

That you're not, not, not gonna get any better
And you won't, won't, won't, you won't get rid of me never
Like it or not, even though she's a lot like me
We're not the same
And, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a lot to handle
You don't know trouble, but I'm a hell of a scandal
Me, I'm a scene, I'm a drama queen
I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen

Give me an A: Always give me what I want
Give me a V: be Very, very good to me
R: R you gonna treat me right?
I: I can put up a fight
Give me an L: Let me hear you scream loud

One, two, three, four

Where are the hopes? Where are the dreams?
My Cinderella story scene?
When do you think they'll finally see?

That you're not, not, not gonna get any better
And you won't, won't, won't, you won't get rid of me never
Like it or not, even though she's a lot like me
We're not the same
And, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a lot to handle
You don't know trouble, but I'm a hell of a scandal
Me, I'm a scene, I'm a drama queen
I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen

Let me hear you say 'hey hey hey'
Hey hey hey!
Alright, now let me hear you say 'hey hey ho'
Hey hey ho!

Hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey!

I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen
