Hush, hush
Hush, hush


I didn’t mean to kiss you
You didn’t mean to fall in love
I never meant to hurt you
You never meant for it to mean this much
Hush, hush now

I wanted to keep you
Forever next to me
You know that I still do
And all I wanted was to believe
Hush, hush now

So, go on, live your life
So, go on, say goodbye
So many questions
But I don’t ask why
So, this time, I won’t even try
Hush, hush now
Hush, hush now

When I try to forget you
I just keep on remembering
What we had was so true
And, somehow, we lost everything
Hush, hush now
Hush, hush now

So, go on, live your life
So, go on, say goodbye
So many questions
But I don’t ask why, no
So, go on, live your life
So, go on, and say goodbye
So many questions
But I don’t ask why
Maybe someday
But not tonight
Hush, hush now

Hush, hush now
Hush, hush now

Don’t, don’t, don’t you ever say a word
Of what you ever thought you heard?
Don’t you ever tell a soul?
But you know
I tried to hide
But I still believe
That we
That we were always meant to be
And I can’t ever let you go, no

Hush, hush now

So, go on, live your life
So, go on, say goodbye
So many questions
But I don’t ask why, no
So, go on, live your life
So, go on, and say goodbye
So many questions
But I don’t ask why
Maybe someday
But not tonight
Hush, hush now
Hush, hush now
Hush, hush
