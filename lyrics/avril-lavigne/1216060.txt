Avril Lavigne Girlfriend Lyrics
Hey Hey You You
Non amo tua ragazza
No way No way
Trova una nuova
Hey Hey You You
Sarò la tua ragazza


Hey Hey You You
So che ti piaccio
No way No way
Non è un segreto
Hey Hey You You
Sarò la tua ragazza

You're so fine
I want you mine
You're so delicious
I think about you all the time
You're so addictive
Don't you know
What I can do
To make you feel alright

Don't pretend
I think you know
I'm damn precious
And hell yeah
I'm the mother (f*cking) princess
I can tell you like me too
And you know I'm right

She's like so whatever
You can do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

Hey Hey You You
Non amo tua ragazza
No way No way
Trova una nuova
Hey Hey You You
Sar? la tua ragazza

Hey Hey You You
So che ti piaccio
No way No way
Non ? un segreto
Hey Hey You You
Sar? la tua ragazza

I can see the way
I see the way
You look at me
And even when you look away
I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time
again and again

So come over here
and tell me what I wanna hear
Better, yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name
ever again

Because...

She's like so whatever
And you can do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

Hey Hey You You
Non amo tua ragazza
No way No way
Trova una nuova
Hey Hey You You
Sar? la tua ragazza

Hey Hey You You
So che ti piaccio
No way No way
Non ? un segreto
Hey Hey You You
Sar? la tua ragazza

(Uh)
In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

(Uh)
In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

Hey Hey You You
Non amo tua ragazza
No way No way
Trova una nuova
Hey Hey You You
Sar? la tua ragazza

(No Way) (no way)

Hey Hey You You
So che ti piaccio
No way No way
Non ? un segreto
Hey Hey You You
Sar? la tua ragazza

(No way,no way)

(Hey,Hey)

Hey Hey You You
Non amo tua ragazza ( No Way!)
No way No way
Trova una nuova (Hey,Hey)
Hey Hey You You
Sar? la tua ragazza(No Way,No Way!)

(Hey)
