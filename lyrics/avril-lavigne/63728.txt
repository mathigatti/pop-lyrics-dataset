We sat by the fire
United in song
Under the moonlight
All night long
We sang “Halleluyah”
For the joy of it all


And out on the water
A caroling loon
Sings us a sweet
Heavenly tune
There’s peace in God’s forest
The temple of life

Halleluyah
Halleluyah
We looked to the sky
Deep into Heaven’s eyes
Halleluyah

And back in the city
I’m losing control
I need a place
To ease my soul
There’s peace in God’s temple
The temple of life

Halleluyah
Halleluyah
We looked to the sky
Deep into Heaven’s eyes
Halleluyah

Halleluyah
Halleluyah
We looked to the sky
Deep into Heaven’s eyes
Halleluyah

Halleluyah
We praise Your name, God
Halleluyah
We looked to the sky
Deep into Heaven’s eyes
Halleluyah

Thank You, Jesus
We praise Your name
Thank You, Lord
Halleluyah

We praise Your name, Lord
We love You
Thank You, God
Thank You, God
Thank You, God
