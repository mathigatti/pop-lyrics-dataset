It's a forgone conclusion, your love's an illusion
And the picture's starting to fade
Boy, let's be honest, when it comes to your promise
It's just a lot of empty words that you say


And the future's only gonna be more of the same
You've only got yourself to blame

Tomorrow you didn't, yesterday you won't
'Cause I know everything you say you gonna do, you don't
And that's a given, it doesn't matter anyway
Hey, I know what love wasn't, I know what love isn't
So when you say you're gonna change, you gotta be kidding
Tomorrow you didn't, hey, hey
I'm outta here today

I used to believe in all your romantic dreaming
But it really ain't that cute anymore
'Cause my time's to precious so I wish you the best with
Whatever it is you're looking for

Baby, this is all for your own good
I'm leaving 'cause I know you never would

Tomorrow you didn't, yesterday you won't
'Cause I know everything you say you gonna do, you don't
And that's a given, it doesn't matter anyway
Hey, I know what love wasn't, I know what love isn't
So when you say you're gonna change, you gotta be kidding
Tomorrow you didn't, hey, hey
I'm outta here today

I don't need a crystalball to see it all, my dear
It doesn't matter what you say
It always turns out the same way
Your predictions are fiction
And it's tragically clear

Tomorrow you didn't, yesterday you won't
'Cause I know everything you say you gonna do, you don't
And that's a given, it doesn't matter anyway
Hey, I know what love wasn't, I know what love isn't
So when you say you're gonna change, you gotta be kidding
Yeah, tomorrow you didn't, hey, hey
I'm outta here, I'm outta here today
