Just lay your head in daddy's lap, you're a bad girl (bad girl)
One, two, three, four


Hey, hey, I'll let you walk all over me, me
You know that I'm a little tease, tease
But I wanna pretty please, please

You know, you know, you know I'm crazy
I just want to be your baby
You can fuck me, you can play me
You can love me or you can hate me

Miss me, miss me
Now you want to kiss me

Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I've been a bad girl, don't you know?
(Don't tell me what to do)
Come get it, now or never
I'll let you do whatever
I'll be your bad girl, here we go
(One, two, three, four)

Miss me, miss me
Now you wanna kiss me (mmm you're bad girl)

Baby, you know I want a little taste, taste
So let me take you all the way, way
You know you'll never be the same, same (you fuckin' bad girl)

One night you won't forget the rest of your life
So come on over to the wild side
Buckle up and baby hold on tight

Miss me, miss me
Now you want to kiss me
We both know that you love me 'cause I'm so bad

Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I've been a bad girl, don't you know?
(Don't tell me what to do)
Come get it now or never
I'll let you do whatever
I'll be your bad girl, here we go
(One, two, three, four)

I've been a bad girl
I've been a bad girl
I'll be your bad girl
I'll be your bad girl

I've been a bad girl
I've been a bad girl
I'll be your bad girl
I'm a fucking bad girl

Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I've been a bad girl, don't you know?
(Don't tell me what to do)
Come get it, now or never
I'll let you do whatever
I'll be your bad girl, here we go
(One, two, three, four)
Bad, bad, bad, bad girl
