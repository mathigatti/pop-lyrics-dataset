Remember when I cried
To you a thousand times
I told you everything
You know my feelings
It never crossed my mind
That there would be a time
For us to say goodbye
What a big surprise


But I'm not lost
I'm not gone
I haven't forgot

These feelings I can't shake no more
This feeling's running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when

I remember when
It was 'together 'till the end'
Now I'm alone again
Where do I begin?
I cried a little bit
You died a little bit
Please, say there's no regrets
And say you won't forget

But I'm not lost
And I'm not gone
I haven't forgot

These feelings I can't shake no more
This feeling's running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when

That was then
Now it's the end
I'm not coming back
I can't pretend
Remember when

These feelings I can't shake no more
This feeling's running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
