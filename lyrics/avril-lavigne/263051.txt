Don't say no to anything
Yes, yes, say yes to everything
Just find a way
To get away
(Wanna run away?)


Let's take off our clothes
And see if anybody notices
Then run away
Whad'ya say?

Have a little joy, have a little faith
Live life
Have a little, hope have a lot of fun

'Cause you, you
You never know what faith will throw
To make you stop
I-I, I'm gonna try to let this life
Pick me up and take me away

Run up to a stranger
Kiss and tell them that you love them
And then walk away
You made their day
(At least you hope you did)

Stand up in a restaurant
Start dancing on the table
Get kicked out for that behavior
Oops! I did it again

Have a little joy have a little faith
Live life
Have a little hope have a lot of fun

'Cause you, you
You never know what faith will throw
To make you stop
I-I, I'm gonna try to let this life
Pick me up and take me away

Don't you know that nothing equals nothing
Do anything, do everything, do something
Open up your mouth and let your soul sing

You, you
You never know what faith will throw
To make you stop

You, you
You never know what faith will throw
To make you stop
I-I, I'm gonna try to let this life
Pick me up and take me away
