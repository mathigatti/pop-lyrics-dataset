Grew up in a small town
And when the snow would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray


Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I'd pray
I could breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
Make a wish, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the Sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jetplane
Far away
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
Make a wish, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the Sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging with revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
Gotta keep movin on movin on
Fly away
Breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
Make a wish, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the Sun
I won't forget the place where I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway
Breakaway
Breakaway
