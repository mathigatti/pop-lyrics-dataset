There's a light inside of all of us
It's never hiding you just have to light it
It's the one thing that you gotta trust
It's like a diamond, you just have to find it


So if you ever feel like giving up
Yeah let's remember that
We were all meant to fly

Spread your wings across the universe
It's your time to, it's your time to shine
There's a light inside of all of us
Soon, you'll find that it's your time to fly
Your time to fly

A little help is all it ever takes
Somebody else to tell you it's worth fighting
A single step becomes a leap of faith
That's when you realize you started flying

So, don't you ever say you're giving up?
No, there's no looking back
'Cause we were all meant to fly

Spread your wings across the universe
It's your time to, it's your time to shine
There's a light inside of all of us
Soon, you'll find that it's your time to fly
It's your time to fly

Just reach up, don't give up
Until you've touched the sky
Just reach up, don't give up
Until you've realized

That we were all meant to fly

Spread your wings across the universe
It's your time to, it's your time to shine
There's a light inside of all of us
Soon, you'll find that it's your time to fly, fly

It's your time to, it's your time to shine, shine
Soon, you'll find that it's your time to fly

Spread your wings across the universe
It's your time to, it's your time to shine
There's a light inside of all of us
Soon, you'll find that it's your time to fly
