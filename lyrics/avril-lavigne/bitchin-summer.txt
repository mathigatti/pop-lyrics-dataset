Uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh


Everyone’s waiting on the bell
A couple seconds we’ll be raising hell
The sun is shining down
School is finally out
Nothing matters
So we might as well

Everybody’s baking in the sun
Come and party
Do it while we’re young
Move your body
When you hear the drums
So, put your hands up

It’s gonna be a bitchin’ summer
We’ll be living fast kicking ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast
Make it last forever

I’ll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up
We can fit one more
It’s now or never
It’s gonna, gonna be, be a bitchin’ summer

Uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh
A bitchin summer
Uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh
A bitchin summer

Throwing empty bottles in the fire
Whiskeys got us singing like a choir
Where we gonna run?
When the police come
But in the mall, we are so alive

Everybody’s baking in the sun
Come and party
Do it while we’re young
Move your body
When you hear the drums
So, put your hands up

It’s gonna be a bitchin’ summer
We’ll be living fast, kicking ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast
Make it last forever

I’ll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up
We can fit one more
It’s now or never
It’s gonna, gonna be, be a bitchin’ summer

Uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh
A bitchin summer
Uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh
A bitchin summer

Like like right here
It’s the beach
The party don’t stop
If we don’t get harassed
By the motherfuckin’ cops

A quarter tank of gas
About a half of pack
My cell phone’s dying
But there’s no turning back

I can feel the breeze
Steering with my knee
Drumming on my dashboard
Bumping to the beat
Hitting the windshield wiper
Searching for my lighter
I gotta get right before this all nighter

It’s gonna be a bitchin’ summer
We’ll be living fast kicking ass together
Like high school lovers
Gonna have a blast
Make it last forever

I’ll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up
We can fit one more
It’s now or never
It’s gonna, gonna be, be a bitchin’ summer

Uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh
A bitchin summer
Uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh
A bitchin summer

Pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up
We can fit one more
It’s now or never
It’s gonna, gonna be, be a bitchin’ summer
