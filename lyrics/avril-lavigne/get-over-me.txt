I messed up
Took you home
Just my luck
You're a psycho
Now I'm lockin' up my door
You had my mail, stole my phone
And how the hell did you change my passcode?
I can't take this anymore
Can't take this anymore...


First time, it was amazing
Two times, you acting crazy
Three times, you say it's my baby
It's my baby!!

You're calling me every night
Talking bout you and I
I'm hanging up, this is my last goodbye
So how can I make you see
That there ain't no you and me?
What can I do to get you out of my life?
Get over me

Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me

Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me

You broke in, stole my key
Got one made so you can watch me
Even when I am asleep
(You creep)
But that's not where the story ends
You follow me like every weekend
And you're freaking out my friends (freaking out my friends)

First time, it was amazing
Two times, you acting crazy
Three times, you want my baby, want my baby

You're calling me every night
Talking bout you and I
I'm hanging up, this is my last goodbye
So how can I make you see
That there ain't no you and me?
What can I do to get you out of my life?
Get over me

Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me

Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me

Why can't you get the message?
Move on and just forget
Some things were never meant to be
Oh woah
Why can't you get the message?
Move on and just forget
Some things were never meant to be
Get over me

Get over me
Some things were never meant to be

You're calling me every night
Talking bout you and I
I'm hanging up, this is my last goodbye
So how can I make you see
That there ain't no you and me?
What can I do to get you out of my life?
Get over me

Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me

Now I got a stage five clinger
Tryna put a ring on my finger
Only want me cause I'm a singer
Get over me
