Yeah, I will move my little self on
It won't be very much longer
One day soon, he will find me
I know this because I believe


If I get to know myself better
I will be a little bit stronger
I won't forget everything you told me
Yeah, I miss the way you'd hold me
The words you told me

Things happen for a reason
You'll become a stronger person
When life tears you up then you'll understand
It's never easy
But you'll know when you get there
As it tears you down, it builds you up
Well, it builds you up

Some girls fall, just like I did
They break our hearts, I should've broke his
Get yourself up, strut along further
My advice: you can do better!
Just say whatever

Things happen for a reason
You'll become a stronger person
When life tears you up then you'll understand
It's never easy
But you'll know when you get there
As it tears you down, it builds you up
Well, it builds you up
It builds you up

Well, you said you would love me forever
Well, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
You should maybe watch what you're saying
Why? Why? Why?

Things happen for a reason
You'll become a stronger person
When life tears you up then you'll understand
It's never easy
But you'll know when you get there
As it tears you down, it builds you up

Things happen for a reason
You'll become a stronger person
When life tears you up then you'll understand
It's never easy
But you'll know when you get there
As it tears you down, it builds you up
Well, it builds you up
It builds you up
