When you're fallin', you're crashin'
When your fire has turned to ashes
When you're screamin', your heart is bleedin'
When you're feelin' like there's no reason


I won't let you go
No, I, I won't let you go

'Cause when you're all alone
And it's cold and there's no one to hold
When you're feeling lost
And there's nowhere, there's nowhere to go
When you're feeling sad
Don't forget, you can reach for my hand
When you're feeling bad, just remember
I won't let you go, oh
I won't let you go, no
I won't let you go, oh
I won't let you go, no

When you're torn down, when you're messed up
Don't you give in, no, don't you give up
When you're drownin' and you're fadin'
Always know that I'm always waitin'

And I, I won't let you go
No, I won't let you go

'Cause when you're all alone
And it's cold and there's no one to hold
When you're feeling lost
And there's nowhere, there's nowhere to go
When you're feeling sad
Don't forget, you can reach for my hand
When you're feeling bad, just remember remember, remember

When I said forever
I know that I meant forever
And I won't let you down
I can always be found
And I'm always around

When you're all alone
It's cold, there's no one to hold
When you're feeling lost
And there's nowhere, nowhere!
When you're feeling sad
Don't forget, you can reach for my hand
When you're feeling bad, just remember
I won't let you go, oh
I won't let you go
I won't let you go, oh
I won't let you go

I won't let you go
