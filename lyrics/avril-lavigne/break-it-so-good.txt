Can't wait 'till its 4 in the morning
In bed and you're all alone
I know you feel it in your body
I know you feel it in your bones
Come and whisper you miss me
Come and give me the chance
Wanna finish what you started
I wanna get you back


I thought this could be love, but I was wrong
Didn't know what we had 'til it was gone
We could try this thing again if you want
But you better hold on

'Cause I'ma break your heart, but I'll break it so good
You ain't never had a love like that, love like that
Ah, ah, ah
You should've been breaking hearts
Always up to no good
Tell me how you like the taste of that, taste of that
Ah, ah, ah
So c'mon
Let it break, let it break
Let it break, let it break
Until you should do to me
So I'ma break your heart, but I'll break it so good
Break it so good, break it so good
Yeah, break it

Can't wait til it's 2 in the morning
You see me in a little black dress
You say you still adore me
You're still kind of a mess
Maybe I'll come and go
A taste of your own medicine
But I think you should know
You're not getting back in

I thought this could be love, but I was wrong
Didn't know what we had 'til it was gone
We could try this thing again if you want
But you better hold on

'Cause I'ma break your heart, but I'll break it so good
You ain't never had a love like that, love like that
Ah, ah, ah
You should've been breaking hearts
Always up to no good
Tell me how you like the taste of that, taste of that
Ah, ah, ah
So c'mon
Let it break, let it break
Let it break, let it break
Until you should do to me
So I'ma break your heart, but I'll break it so good
Break it so good, break it so good
Yeah, break it

I thought this could be love, but I was wrong
Didn't know what we had 'til it was gone
We could try this thing again if you want
But you better hold on

'Cause I'ma break your heart, but I'll break it so good
You ain't never had a love like that, love like that
Ah, ah, ah
You should've been breaking hearts
Always up to no good
Tell me how you like the taste of that, taste of that
Ah, ah, ah
So c'mon
Let it break, let it break
Let it break, let it break
Until you should do to me
So I'ma break your heart, but I'll break it so good
Break it so good, break it so good
Yeah, break it
