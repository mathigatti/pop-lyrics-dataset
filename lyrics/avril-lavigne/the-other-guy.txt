I know i'll never have him
But I'm there when you're not over his friend
I listen when you come to me
But cuz of who he is you don't have the time to see


I really feel the way you feel
Just cuz it's him don't mean it's not real
Your always sayin' your love's true
I listen but i can't say the same for you

What I offer's unreturned
You don't have time to see me burn
You've so far failed to see
How much you're affecting me

When you think of him
I'm thinkin' of the other guy
I'm in love to
He's constantly on my mind
If you weren't shared by blood
Then would you have the time
I don't get to choose
Who i dream of at night
You tell me how you feel
I feel the same way with the other guy
So bad its not real
You can't make me cover it up, you know i really try
You can see by my skin
I shiver and shake and i follow him with my eyes
I'm nervous and i know it's a sin
But seein' him drives me wild inside

If it was another
Maybe not your brother
Would it be ok to let him drive me wild?
But then lookin' back
You've always turned your back
Would it be ok to listen to my smile?

Your convinced
He's so unperfect
But i'm convinced
That it's worth it

I listen to you goin on and on
Bout how you and that boy got it on
You don't have time to listen to me
I'm in love but you can't see
I don't have opinions you just talk
But with me you tell me i'm stupid to feel what i feel
I can't run away you only let me walk
Come on now girl, you ain't bein' real

I love
