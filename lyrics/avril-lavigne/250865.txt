Kiss me 
Out of the bearded barley
Nightly
Beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing
Swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress


Oh, kiss me
Beneath the milky twilight
Lead me 
Out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me

Kiss me
Down by the broken tree house
Swing me
Upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring
Bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

Oh, kiss me
Beneath the milky twilight
Lead me 
Out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me

Oh, kiss me
Beneath the milky twilight
Lead me
Out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me

So kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me
