Darlin', you're hiding in the closet once again
Start smilin'
I know you're tryin'
Real hard not to turn your head away
Pretty darlin'
Face tomorrow, tomorrow's not yesterday
Yesterday, oh, oh


Pretty, please, I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Darlin', I was there, once a while ago
I know that it's hard
To be stuck with people that you love
When nobody trusts

Pretty, please, I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that I can

And you're not the only one whose been through
I've been there alone, and now so are you
I just want you to know, want you to know
It's not your fault, it's not your fault
Your fault, your fault
It's not your fault
Your fault, your fault, your fault

Pretty, please, I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can

Pretty, please, I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that I can

Darlin', you're hiding in the closet once again
Start smilin'
