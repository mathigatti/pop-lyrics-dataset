Don't know, don't know if I can do this on my own
Why do you have to leave me?
It seems I'm losing something deep inside of me
Hold on, on to me


Now I see
Now I see

Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts
Everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La la la la la la, it's okay

It feels like nothing really matters anymore
When you're gone, I can't breathe
And I know, you never meant to make me feel this way
This can't be happening

Now I see
Now I see

Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts
Everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La la la la la la, it's okay
La la la la

So many questions, so much on my mind
So many answers I can't find
I wish I could turn back the time
I wonder why...

Everybody hurts some days
Everybody hurts some days

Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts
Everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La la la la la la, it's okay
La la la la la, it's okay

Everybody hurts somedays
But it's okay to be afraid

Everybody hurts some days
Yes, we all feel pain
Everybody feels this way
But it'll be okay
Can somebody take me away
To a better place?
Everybody feels this way
It's okay

La la la la la la, it's okay
La la la la, it's okay
La la la la la la, it's okay
La la la la, it's okay
