Boy, you get me so high
Buzzin like a bee beehive
It's just a little kiss
But when It hits my lips
I'm sippin' on sunshine
Boy, you're looking so fly
Hotter than July
I just wanna stay
Forever and today
Sippin' on sunshine


Down at the beach, you holding my hand
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand
Watching the waves crash into the shore
Baby, I want some more

Hey
What a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothin’ but a good time
Sippin’ on sunshine
No, don’t got nowhere to go
So we go with the flow
Yeah, we living the life
Sippin’ on sunshine

Sippin’ on sunshine

Boy, you blowing my mind
You got me up on cloud nine
Just a little taste
I wouldn’t wanna waste
A sip of that sunshine

We can kick it all night
Underneath the moonlight
But when the party ends
We’ll do it all again
Sippin’ on sunshine

Down at the beach, you holding my hand
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand
Watching the waves crash into the shore
Baby, I want some more

Hey
What a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothin' but a good time
Sippin’ on sunshine
No, don’t got nowhere to go
So we go with the flow
Yeah, we living the life
Sippin’ on sunshine

Sippin’ on sunshine, sippin’ on sunshine
Sippin' on sunshine, sippin’ on sunshine

Hey
What a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothin' but a good time
Sippin’ on sunshine
No, don’t got nowhere to go (no, don't)
So we go with the flow (hell yeah)
Yeah, we living the life (the life)
Sippin’ on sunshine

All day all night
Yeah, good time
Everybody just sippin' on sunshine

Woah, woah
Sippin' on sunshine
