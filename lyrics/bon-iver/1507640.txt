I am a simple man
So I sing a simple song
Never been so much in love
And never hurt so bad
At the same time


I am a simple man
And I play a simple tune
Wish that I could see you once again
Across the room
Like the first time

Just want to hold you
Don't want to hold you down
Hear what you're saying
And you're spinning my head around
And I can't make it alone

The ending of the tale
Is the singing of the song
Make me proud to be your man
Only you can make me strong
Like the last time

Just want to hold you
Don't want to hold you down
I hear what you're saying
And you're spinning my head around
I can't make it alone
