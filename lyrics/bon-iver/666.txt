6S hang in the door
What kind of shit to ignore
I've cut the cloth
(Ooh, hard line)
How to know who to write
How to know who can cull up all the questions
We know that I'm right, cause
To clean out a mind
I fell in love


I heard about it
(Bit by bit)
I heard about it
(Bit by bit)
I heard about it
(Bit by bit, bit by bit)
No

And so it's not in your clasp
Then what's the function or the task
Well, I'd stun, I'd stammer?
Help me reach the hammer
(For them what will I ask?)
That's a pair of them docks
Mooring out two separate lochs ain't some kind of quanrdry?
(Waundry)
Take me into your palms- what is left when unhungry

I learned about it
(Bit by bit, bit by bit)
I've learned about it
(Bit by bit, bit by bit)
I've learned about it
(Bit by bit, bit by bit)
No

I'm still standing in
I'm still standing in the need of prayer
The need of prayer

No, I don't know the path
What kind of pith I've amassed
Long lines of questions
Lessons, lessons, lessons

But hat do you do to concede?
And yes it's hard to believe
When em' sold for your sleeves
Just come off your kneel
Please, please, please

I can admit to conceal
No, that's not how that's sposed to feel
Oh, no
It's not for broader appeal
Fuck the fashion of it, dear

I laughed about it
(Bit by bit, bit by bit)
I laughed about it
(Bit by bit, bit by bit)
I laughed about it
(Bit by bit, bit by bit)
No
