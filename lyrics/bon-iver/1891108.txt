Armour let it through
Born the arboretic truth
You kept posing
Sat down in the suit
Fixed on up it wasn't you
By finished closing


Ramble in the roots
Had the marvel, moved the proof
Be kneeled fine's glowing
Storing up the clues
It had its sullen blue
Bruised through by showing

Settle past a patience
Where wishes and
Your will are spilling pictures
Water's running through
In the valley where we grew
To write this, this scripture

Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Not for a part
In any gamut of the dark

Doubled in the toes
Annex it, it minute closed
In the morning

Did not lose it in
The stack's stow, I'ma
Lay that call back on you

You know it won't beseech you
We're laying in an open field
I will let you grow
No need to know this

So carry on, my dear
What is clear up in the
Daylight is we're hung here
Fall is coming soon
A new year for the moon
And the Hmong here

Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
All that it seems
Bellows tracing through the streams

Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
All at its seams
Swallows swelling for the beams
