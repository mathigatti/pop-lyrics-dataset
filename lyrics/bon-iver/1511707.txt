we're safe when love would come in
we read my mind so many times
the earth is only sand
fucked up and puked up in dismay
and resolve to slowly run in circles
so slow


the fence that you sent me
rolling along the bottom
jesus
for I'm feeling sad
so many killed

their running their engine
just like you ought to be
to me, my heart
could i correct the dawn
my body
the sorry might do it
long lift one line
big red machine

that's all i've learned: to suffer. x3
