You ride in the park and youre peaking
Piss pools in your seat
Shes standing inside but you surely repeat
Oh, God, don't leave me here
I will freeze till the end
Love is loves reprieve


Winter is coming and you're stuck here
Oh, and so is she
Now when the wind blows you cover your teeth
I told you to shed away and trade in your blues
Love is loves sad news

That was Wisconsin that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
Cause every place I go I take another place with me
Love is loves mystique

Youre up on the bar and your shaking
With every grimy word
Who will love
Whats love when youve hurt
You wonder as you see the snow kissed the curb
Love is loves return

That was Wisconsin that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
Cause every place I go, I take another place with me
Love is loves critique
