Salem burns the leaves
Then she returns to cure and see
Heavy fate
After years of waitin'


'Cause abnormalities
Surely are everywhere you see
So what I think we need
Is elasticity
Empowerment and ease

So I won't lead no lie
With our hearts the only matter why
How long it's lasted
I've not received reciprocity

To speak supportively
Big guy, there's no automatic peace
But I bet you'd keep
All these in-betweens that bar my youth

Though no anorberic dream
Far as I know
I tried too hard to see
What I thought it'd be
Asking constantly
How's it gonna be?

So I'm gonna weep a while
You don't even know how hard
I've learned a lesson
Don't ask me
I've torn the banner from the line
