well move over,
i'm topped over.
and i've let out more than just a casted light.
i've busted something,
i'm broken inside.
this is where i go because you know me.


i return to you.

i'm like copper,
you're like shoeshine.
the best is yet to come, we've got a lot of time.
alligators and armadillos,
couldn't stop me from getting in through your door.

i return to you.
i return to you.

i've just been through something,
that's left me in pain.
in truth cut me deeper than even you.
now i realize,
that pain and confusion,
are much heavier than love.

so i return.
so i return.
so i return.
so i return,
to you.
