I'm lost in the woods,
I'm out of my mind,
And if I Go,
To slow down some,
I'm lost in the woods,
I'm out of my mind,
If I'm going to still,
Slow down the time,
I'm lost in the woods,
I'm down on my line,
I'm building a city,
Down the tide,
I'm lost in the world,
I'm down my whole tide,
I'm losing the city,
And im down for the time,
Down for the time say shes down for the night,
I'm never lonely no,
Down for the time,
I'm lost in the world,
I'm down for the time,
I'm new to the city,
Down for the night x3


Your my devil,your my angel
Your my heaven, your my hell,
You're my now, you're my forever,
You're my freedom, your my jail,
You're my lies your my truth,
You're my war you're my truce
Your my questions your my proof
Your my stress your mama's shoes
Mama say mama say mama gos-an
Lost in this plastic light,
Let's break out of this fake ass party,
And turn this into a classic night,
If we die in each others arms,
We'll get layed in that afterlife,
And if we die in each others arms,
We still get layed yea,
I'm lost in the woods,
Running for my life,
I'm down on my mind,
I'm new to the city,
Down for the night,
I'm lost in the world,
I'm down on my mind,
Im new to the city,
And im down for the night,
Down for the night [x3]
Ya oh wow [x5]
Who will survive in America?[x4]
I'm lost in the world,
I'm down on my mind,
I'm new to the city,
Down for the night,
I'm lost in the world,
I'm down on my mind,
Im new to the city,
And im down for the night,
Down for the night [x3]

[Drums]

Hey oh wow oh [x5]
Woahwoah [x2]

Alright I'm gonna have you do on the sideline,
And the new words held are revolution,
And people don't want to hear the preachers spill or squeal,
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey,
Youngsters who were programmed to keep fucking up,
Thinking Paul revere and mat turner as the good guys,
America stripped from bed and we had not opened up our eyes,

The signs of truth are tattooed upon our vagina,
We learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal,
2 long centuries in a rusty vault hosed down daily with gagging perfume,
America was a bastard a illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were spread around the world and a rape as known as freedom,
Democracy liberty and justice were code words, for the (bubbling x4)
In the mother countries crotch,
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife and kids,
And some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done,
Build a new route to china if they'll have you
Who will survive in America? [x5]
