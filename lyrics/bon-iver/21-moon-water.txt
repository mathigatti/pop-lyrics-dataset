The math ahead
The math behind it
It's moon water
(Imma take it in)
The math ahead
The math behind it
It's moon water
(Imma take it in)


The math ahead
The math behind it
It's moon water
(Imma take it in)

The path ahead
The path behind us
Moon water
(Moon water)
(Imma take it in)
(Imma take it in)

Remember rising on?
For moon water
(Imma take it in)

I'd hide Berlin
And run and find it
Just for moon water
(Imma take it in)
(Imma take it in)

The path ahead
The path behind it
It's moon water
(Imma take it in)
(Imma take it in)

The path ahead
The path behind it
The path ahead
The path behind it
The path ahead
The path behind it

(Imma take it in)
