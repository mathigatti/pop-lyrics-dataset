(All my life!)
(Ini was)
(Ewwww, mine was a lover of a wrong kind)
(Keepin what you tell'n me)
(I know mine)


Living in a lonesome way
Had me looking other ways
'Cause I am, I am, I am, I am lost here, again
But on a brite fall morning Im with it
I Stood a little while within it
Man you have to know
Know the way, it goes

It goes-, it goes-
I am, I am, I am, I am
Go, go
I am, I am, I am, I am

If forgiveness is a chore
What you waiting for
We been here before
And I can't ignore it anymore
You know the way it goes
How much longer then? (I show you in)
(Now I'll tell you why)

I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am

Ain't no say what I do in
Every day say they don't like it
I say: Hey don't like it
I say: Hey don't like it
I say: Hey don't like it
I say: Hey don't like it

If that ain't just the truth
I am, I am, I am, I am
I like you, I like you!
And that ain't nothing new

And if it don't happen like that
Well then it don't happen at all
Keepin' what you tell me
Now I won't lie, ai ai ai
