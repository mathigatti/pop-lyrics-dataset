Someday my pain, someday my pain
Will mark you
Harness your blame, harness your blame
And walk through


With the wild wolves around you
In the morning, I'll call you
Send it farther on

Solace my game, solace my game
It stars you
Swing wide your crane, swing wide your crane
And run me through

And the story's all over you
In the morning I'll call you
Can't you find a clue when your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue

What might have been lost -
Don't bother me
