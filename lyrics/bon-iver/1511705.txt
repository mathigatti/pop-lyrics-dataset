With the cornfields as my witness
I've run out of brain
Come on down to the place where I'm drinking
Come on down like the rain


And if you don't come quick
I'm gonna dry up in this world
I think it's all coming down
All cause of a girl

And it's coming to me
Like a baseball to a bat
I'm only hitting .118
And I'm wondering where you're at

And the oak on the bar
Is like the oak in my heart
And like the oak buried deep down in the sand
I got a water at heart...

And it goes in through my mouth
And it slides into my veins
And it takes away my head
I don't have to feel the same

And my eyes go red
And my skin goes warm
And at the end of the night
I'm just cryin' in my bed

Some call it sick
Some call it pain
Some just laugh at it
But honey, it's like the rain
It's like when thirsty
And there's none in the well

It's like bringing darkness
When darkness has already fell
It's like breaking dreams of a broken man
And nothing makes it come on down
Like the rain came...
