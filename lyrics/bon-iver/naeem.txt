All along 'em I can hear me
I go for the caste
I fall off a bass boat
And the concrete's very slow
And the concrete's very slow
All along the sideline's bigger

I'm over the dash
I'm having a bad, bad toke
But the berries still to come
All along them I can hear ya

I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying (I can hear)
I can hear cry (crying)
I can hear, I can hear (crying)
I can hear, I can hear crying
(I can hear, I can hear)

All along me I can hear you
I'd occupy that
Can't sit back long while you're forming that
Oh my mind our kids got bigger
But I'm climbing down the bastion now
You take me out to pasture now

Well I won't be angry long
Well I can't be angry long
We burnt up in my bed
Standing on the mattress, laul
Laul, can't we just patch this up?
And I cannot seem to carry it all
All along we I can hear me

I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying (I can hear)
I can hear cry (crying)
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear cry
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying

All around me I can hear 'em
So what is gonna happen now?
If you don't look away
What's there to pontificate on now?
There's someone in my head
Tell them I'll be passing on
Tell them we're young mastodons

And it can't be that it's all
And it can't be that it's all
I'm telling you that I do feel ya
It's suddenly paths, mama
It ain't about class, mama
And it won't be very long
Oh, it won't be very long

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
(I can hear)
I can hear (crying)
I can hear, I can hear (crying, crying)
I can hear
(I can hear crying)
(Crying, crying)
