Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight


I ain't got many friends left to talk to
No-one's around when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do everything for you
Stay the night - we'll keep it under cover
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

Try to stop my hands from shakin'
But somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
It's been awhile since we've been all alone
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'

As you leave me please would you close the door
and don't forget what I told you
Just 'cause you're right - that don't mean I'm wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Yeah
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Lose your love
Lose your love
Lose your love
I don't wanna
Lose your love
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose (your love tonight)
Your love (tonight)
Your love
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Lose your love (tonight)
