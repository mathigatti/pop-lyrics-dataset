To the sermon on the mount, I am listening
Tough guy's running his mouth, I am glistening in
Saviour spit is heading south, and I am getting in the way


Said 'Wait one minute son you're right, they're just listening',
Worried, sinned and lacking sight, warning christening,
Go shine this mother fucking light on all the people who can hear.

This is tougher than I thought,
Holding all the things I've bought,
And Jaycee's up for another bout, and I am ringing him out.

Some thing's got me on the corner, and I am whimpering,
Somewhere deep inside the coat, I am weathering,
Wishing somehow you were near, 'cause I am withering alone.

You arrived and ordered stout, I stared in wordlessness
I just kept noticing your mouth, and how your face just fit
Into every aching void, in what I've always missed some way.

This is tougher than I thought,
Holding you the grace I've caught,
'Cause you're made of everything I want, and I am ringing you out.

Like a morning bell, I am ringing you out.
Like the kitchen rags of God, I am ringing you out.
Like my voice across the hills, I am ringing you out.

I am water on your feet,
You are everything to me,
You are everything to me,

And I am ringing you out
