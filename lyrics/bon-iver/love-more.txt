Chained to the wall of our room
Yeah you chained me like a dog in our room
I thought that's how it was
I thought that we were fine
Then the day was night
You were high you were high when i was doomed
And dying for with no light with no light


Tied to my bed
I was younger then
I had nothing to spend but time on you
But it made me love it made me love it made me love more
It made me love it made me love it made me love more

Do what you said the words she said left out
Over unto the sky where i'll soon fly
And she took the time
To believe in to believe in what she said
And she made me love she made me love she made me love more
She made me love she made me love she made me love more
