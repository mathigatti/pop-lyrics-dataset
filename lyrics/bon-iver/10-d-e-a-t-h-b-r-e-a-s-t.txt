Fe, fever rest
Fever rest
(Wild heart, wild heart)
I cut you in
Deafening
Fever rest
(Darling didn't love right)
I've been sleeping in a stable, mate
Not gonna do you no favors
What I got is seen you trying
Or take it down the old lanes around
Fuckified
Darling don't make love
Fight it
Love, don't fight it
Love, don't fight it
Love
Well I'll wrap you up
And I take it by the touch
Darling don't a failure fright
Times the raker
And I'll rack it up
I'm unorphaned in our northern lights
Decoding every daemon
Taking in the tall grass of the mountain cable
And I cannot seem to find I'm able
Deeper water
I'll walk you up
Higher
Higher and higher
