All along I can hear ya
I'm over the dash
And I'm having a bad toke
And the concrete's very slow
All along the sideline's bigger
I go for the cast
I fall off a bass boat
And the concrete's very slow
And the concrete's very slow


All along I can hear it
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying

All along I can hear it
I'm over the dash
I'm having a bad, bad toke
And the concrete's very slow
All along the sideline's bigger
I go for the cast
I fall off a bass boat
And the concrete's very slow
And the concrete's very slow

All along I can hear it
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear
I can hear crying
I can hear crying
