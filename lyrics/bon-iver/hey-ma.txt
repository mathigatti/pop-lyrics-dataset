I waited outside
I took it remote
I wanted a bath
Tell the story or he goes
Tell the story or he goes


Full time you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time, to call your ma
Hey, ma, hey, ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well, you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light

I waited outside
I was tokin' on dope
I hoped it all won't go in a minute
With the past that you know
I wanted all that mind, sugar, I want it all mine
I had a heavy mind, sugar
It took it, it was right

Full time, you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time, to call your
Hey, ma, hey, ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well, you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light

I waited outside
Then you took me in the room
And you offered up the truth
My eyes crawling up the window to the wall
From dusk till dawn
Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk to 'em all

Full time, you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time to call your ma
Hey, ma, hey, ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well, you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light
