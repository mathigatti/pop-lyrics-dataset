His embrace, a fortress
It fuels me
And places
A skeleton of trust
Right beneath us
Bone by bone
Stone by stone
If you ask yourself patiently and carefully:


Who is it? Who is it?
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over
Handing it over
Handing it over

Who is it?
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over

He demands a closeness
We all have earned a lightness
Carry my joy on the left
Carry my pain on the right

If you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
Who is it?
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over
Handing it over
Handing it over

Who is it?
Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over
Handing it over
Handing...

Who is it that never lets you down?
Who is it that gave you back your crown?
And the ornaments are going around
Now they're handing it over
Handing it over
Handing it over
