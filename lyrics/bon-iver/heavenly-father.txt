Ever since I heard the howling wind
I didn't need to go where a bible went
But then you know your gifts seemed heaven sent
Just lead me to a choler, dad, thats the thing


I don't know how you house the sin
But you're free now
I was never sure how much of you I could let in
Am I free now
Won't you settle down baby here your love has been
Heavenly father
Itâ€™s defiantly lava
Why you don't carry other names

Heard about a day where it dropped the know
To go another day as we learn to close

Cause I'm a known coward in a coward wind
But you're free now
You turn around now and you count to 10
To see you go now
Well I know now honey that I can't pretend
Heavenly father
Is whose brought to his autumn
And love is left in end

I just been up here for God damn years
Can you see now?
Filling up hulls with God damn fears
I am free now
I know about it darling I been standing here
Heavenly father
Is all that he offers
A safety in the end
