Summer comes
to multiply,
to multiply!


summer comes
to multiply,
to multiply!

and I...
I'm the Carnival of Peace
I'll probably start a fleet
with no apologies

and the Carnival of Scenes...
it grows more and more appealing
but my woman and I...
my woman and I know what we're for

summer comes
to multiply,
to multiply!

summer comes
to multiply,
to multiply!
