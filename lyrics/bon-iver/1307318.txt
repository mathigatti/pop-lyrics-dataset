So apropos
Saw death on a sunny snow


For every life
Forgo the parable

Seek the light
My knees are cold

Running home, running home
Running home, running home

Go find another lover
To bring a, to string along

With all your lies
You're still very lovable

I toured the light so many foreign roadsÂ 
For Emma, forever ago
