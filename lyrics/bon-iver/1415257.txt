Crazy how I feel,
living without you
Inside this house that we built.
It seems like the windows
Finally open
Letting the memories out


Go on and love her
Love her forever
I will not tell her
I told you to
You'll never notice
How much I love you
Lovin's for fools
Love is for fools

Maybe you'll find me
Walking in the garden
Looking for something pure.
Roots that are growing,
Deeper and deeper
Mabey you'll pull them too.

Go on and love her
Love her forever
I will not tell her
I told you to
You'll never notice
How much I loved you
Loveins for fools
Love is for fools.
