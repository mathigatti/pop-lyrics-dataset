Rain on the bar
Clinging water mars
Any hints of what I had
Because of what I became


Rain you are me
shake the memory free
can't squelch the molten soul
cant chase away the hole

I have buried you
Every place I've been
You keep ending up
In my shaking hands

Rain, sound the alarm
The sting my broken arm
The faintest violinist buried in my gut
There are chances and choices sometimes you just have to cut

I have buried you
Every place I've been
You keep ending up
In my shaking hands

I have buried you
Every place I've been
You keep ending up
Every place I am

I have buried you
Every place I've been
You keep ending up
In my shaking hands

You keep ending up
Every place I've been
In my shaking hands
Every place I am
