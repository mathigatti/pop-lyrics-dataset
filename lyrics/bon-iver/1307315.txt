Bike down, down to the downtown
Down to the lockdown, boards, nails lie around


I crouch like a crow
Contrasting the snow
For the agony, I'd rather know
'Cause blinded, I am blindsided

Peek in, into the peer in
I'm not really like this, I'm probably plightless

I cup the window
I'm crippled and slow
For the agony, I'd rather know
'Cause blinded, I am blindsided

Would you really rush out for me now?

Taught line, down to the shoreline
The end of a blood line, the Moon is a cold light

There's a pull to the flow
My feet melt the snow
For the irony, I'd rather know
'Cause blinded, I was blindsided

'Cause blinded, I was blindsided

'Cause blinded, I was blindsided
