Please don't live in fear
We can't see from here right now
Send it off from here
And free your mind


You know it never stays the same
And they will never tell you you're all to blame

So you wanted it rearranged
(Fantastic)
And you wish it was only a shame
(At this stage)
(All we can say)
All there is really to say
Is

We are at the beginning again
But oh
How things can change
(So don't you)
(So don't you)
(So don't you)
So don't you run away!

(Think we on the wrong track somehow)
While I'm not gonna tell you that everyone's safe
I will say
There will be a better day
There will be a better day
There will be a better day

I'd be good to fall back
Think we on the wrong track somehow
I'd be good to fall back
Think we on the wrong track somehow

There's several ways to know better
Papa was a go getter

You know it never stays the same
And they will never tell you you're all to blame

Please don't live in fear
