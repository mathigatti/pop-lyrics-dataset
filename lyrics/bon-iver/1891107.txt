Iâ€™m tearing up across your face
Move dust through the light
To fide your name
It's something fane
This is not a place
Not yet awake, I'm raised to make


Still alive for you, love
Still alive for you, love
Still alive for you, love

In a mother, out a moth
Furling forests for the soft
Gotta know been lead aloft
So I'm ridding all your stories
What I know, what it is, is pouring, wire it up!

You're breaking your ground
