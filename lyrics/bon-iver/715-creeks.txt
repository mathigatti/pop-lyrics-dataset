Down along the creek
I remember something
Her, the heron hurried away
When first I breeched that last Sunday


Low moon don the yellow road
I remember something
That leaving wasn't easing
All that heaving in my vines
And as certain it is evening 'at is now is not the time
Ooh

Toiling with your blood
I remember something
In B, un-rationed kissing on a night second to last
Finding both you hands
As second sun came past the glass
And oh, I know it felt right
And I had you in my grasp

Oh then, how we gonna cry?
'Cause it once might not mean something?
Love a second glance
It is not something that we'll need
Honey, understand that I have been left here in the reeds
But all I'm trying to do is get my feet out from the crease

And I see you
Turn around, you're my A team
Turn around now, you're my A team
God damn, turn around now
You're my A team
