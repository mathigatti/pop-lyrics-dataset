Philosophize your figure
What I have and haven't held
You called and I came, stand tall through it all
Fall and fixture just the same thing


Say nothing of my fable, no
What on earth is left to come?
Who's agonized and gnawed through it all
I'm underneath your tongue
I'm standing in your street now, no
And I carry his guitar
And I can't recall it lightly at all
But I know I'm going in

Too much for me to pick up, no
Not sure what forgiveness is
We've galvanized at the squall of it all
I can leave behind the harbour

I will run all around it
Have to crawl, Still can't stop it)
Along the fires
One more time just pass me by
I'ma make it half the night
Hall night wishes

To walk aside your favor, I'm an Astuary King
I would ask you where it came
I'll keep in a cave, your comfort and all
Unburdened and becoming

I will run
(Fill it all, fill all your run, you're running)
Have to crawl
(Carry off and I shall see)
Along the fire
(Carry off your fairly on, your fairy time)
Now, Mona

Baby, I've locked up my failures
(You're on, you're on)
Here and I've been the last to see
See you laugh it off your fingers
Was it all I could find?
