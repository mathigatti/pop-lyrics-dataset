I am my mother's only one
It's enough


I wear my garment so it shows
Now you know

Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon

I am my mother on the wall, with us all
I move in water, shore to shore;
Nothing's more

Only love is all maroon
Lapping lakes like leary loons
Leaving rope burns
Reddish rouge

Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon
