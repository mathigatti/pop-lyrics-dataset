The wretched desert takes its form
The jackal proud and tight
In search of you I feel my way
Through slowest heaving night
Whatever fear invents
I swear it makes no sense
I reach out through the border fence
Come down, come talk to me


In the swirling curling storm of desire
Unuttered words hold fast
With reptile tongue, the lightning lashes
Towers built to last
Darkness creeps in like a thief
And offers no relief
Why are you shaking like a leaf?
Come on, come talk to me

Oh please talk to me
Won't you please talk to me
We can unlock this misery
Come on, come talk to me
I did not come to steal
This all is so unreal
Can't you show me how you feel?
Now come on, come talk to me
Come talk to me
Come talk to me

The earthly power sucks shadowed milk
From sleepy tears undone
From nippled skin as smooth as silk
The bugles blow as one
You lie there with your eyes half closed
Like there's no-one there at all
There's a tension pulling on your face
Come on, come talk to me

Won't you please talk to me?
If you'd just talk to me
Unblock this misery
If you'd only talk to me
Don't you ever change your mind
Now your future's so defined
And you act so deaf, so blind
Come on, come talk to me
Come talk to me
Come talk to me

I can imagine the moment
Breaking out through the silence
All the things that we both might say
And the heart, it will not be denied
'Til we're both on the same damn side
All the barriers blown away

I said please talk to me
Won't you please come talk to me?
Just like it used to be
Come on, come talk to me
I did not come to steal
This all is so unreal
Can you show me how you feel?
Now come on, come talk to me
Come talk to me
Come talk to me
