I woke up in my clothes again this morning
I don't know exactly where I am
And I should heed my doctor's warning
He does the best with me he can


He says I suffer from delusion
But I'm so confident I'm sane
It can't be an optical illusion
So how can you explain

Shadows in the rain
And if you see us on the corner
We're just dancing in the rain

I tell my friends there when I see them
Outside my window pane
Shadows in the rain
