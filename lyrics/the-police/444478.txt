Work up early this morning and I jumped out of bed 
I didn't have to wear my work clothes, I put on this shirt instead 
It's a black and white jersey, it's a thing I couldn't hide 
'Cos it's almost a religion and I wear it with some pride 


Now the streets are all empty in this little town of mine 
I was born to make this journey like the ships outside 
I've got my ticket to London, and a little bit of cash 
I've got this black and white jersey nice and clean for the match 

Now tell me, why is the whole world staring? 
Must be the shirt I'm wearing 

Black and white army 
Bringing the pride back home, we'll be 
Bringing the pride back home 
Bringing the pride back home 
Black and white army 

It's been a long hard season, been a long hard year 
And they're telling us that we're lucky, so lucky, to be here 
But if we all stand together and hold our heads up high 
We will raise up our voices and tell it to the sky 

This time they can't deny us 
This time they won't get by us 

Black and white army 
Bringing the pride back home, we'll be 
Bringing the pride back home 
Bringing the pride back home 
Black and white army 

You'll never understand us if you thought that we'd give up 
'Cos it's more than just a game, and it's more than just a cup 
'Cos we're marching the length of England and I wouldn't tell no lie 
I'll wear this black and white jersey till the day 
I die.
