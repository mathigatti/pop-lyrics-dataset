We were born
Born in the fifties
Born, born in the fifties


My mother cried
When president Kennedy died
She said it was the communists
But I knew better

Would they drop the bomb on us
While we made love on the beach
We were the class they couldn´t teach
´Cos we knew better

They screamed when the Beatles sang
And they laughed when the "king" fell down the stars
They should´ve known better

Oh we hated our Aunt we
Then we messed in our pants
Then we lost our faith
And prayed to the TV
Oh we should´ve known better

We freeze like statues
On the pages of history
Living was never like this
When we took all those GCE´s
Oh you opened the door for us
And then you turned to dust
You don´t understand us
So don´t reprimand us
We´re taking the future
We don´t need no teacher

Born, born in the fifties
We were born, born in the
Fifties...
