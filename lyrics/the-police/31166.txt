Don't think me unkind
Words are hard to find
They're only cheques I've left unsigned
From the banks of chaos in my mind
And when their eloquence escapes me
Their logic ties me up and rapes me


De do do do de da da da
Is all I want to say to you?
De do do do de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through

De do do do de da da da
Is all I want to say to you?
De do do do de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

Poets, priests and politicians
Have words to thank for their positions
Words that scream for your submission
And no-one's jamming their transmission
'Cos when their eloquence escapes you
Their logic ties you up and rapes you

De do do do de da da da
Is all I want to say to you?
De do do do de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through

De do do do de da da da
Is all I want to say to you?
De do do do de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

De do do do de da da da
Is all I want to say to you?
De do do do de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through

De do do do de da da da
Is all I want to say to you?
De do do do de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true
