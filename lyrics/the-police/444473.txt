I finally got away from home 
I got an apartment of my own 
Eccentric posing is allowed 
And I can play the music loud 
I'm gonna abuse my brand new pad 
My lousy manners are O.K. 
I finally got away from home 
I got an apartment of my own 
I entertain my rancid date 
And she can hang around 'til late 
Oh boy! 


Away from home 
O-Oh 
I got a place of my own 
O-Oh 
Away from home 
O-Oh 
I got a place of my own 
O-Oh 

And I don't have to hide the fumes 
So I don't have to clean my room 
And I don't have to hide my toys 
Won't hide my dealings Oh Boy 
I finally got away from home 
I got apartment of my own 
Not sure exactly 'bout the rent 
My weekly pay won't even dent 
Won't hide my dealings Oh boy Oh Boy!
