I've got a lump in my throat about the note you wrote
I'd come on over but i haven't got a raincoat


Have we got a contact? You and me?
Have we got touchdown? Can't we be?

I've got contacts in my book and in my eyes
My good connection on the telephone never lies

Have we got contact? You and me?
Have we got touchdown? Can't we be?

I've got a list of the people i have know
I'm never alone on the end of a phone

Have we got contact? You and me?
Have we got touchdown? Can't we be?

I've got a lump in my throat about the note you wrote
I'd come on over but i haven't got a raincoat
I'd come on over but i haven't got a raincoat

Have we got touchdown? Can't we be?
Have we got contact? You and me?
Have we got touchdown? Can't we be?
Have we got contact? You and me?
Have we got touchdown? Can't we be
