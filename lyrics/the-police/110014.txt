The bed's too big without you
A cold wind blows right through that open door
I can't sleep with your memory
Dreamin' dreams of what used to be


When she left I was cold inside
That look on my face was just pride
No regrets, no love, no tears
Livng on my own was the least of my fears

The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big
Without you

Since that day when you'd gone
Just how to carry on
I get through the day but late at night
Love to my pillow but it didn't feel right

Everyday just the same
Old rules for the same old game
All I gained was heartache
All I made was one mistake

The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big
Without you

The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big
Without you, without you
