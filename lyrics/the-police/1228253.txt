In Europe and America there's a growing feeling of hysteria 
Conditioned to respond to all the threats 
In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets 
Mister Krushchev said, 'We will bury you' 
I don't subscribe to this point of view 
It'd be such an ignorant thing to do 
If the Russians love their children too 


How can I save my little boy 
From Oppenheimer's deadly toy? 
There is no monopoly on common sense 
On either side of the political fence 
We share the same biology 
Regardless of ideology 
Believe me when I say to you 
I hope the Russians love their children too 

There is no historical precedent to put 
Words in the mouth of the president 
There's no such thing as a winnable war 
It's a lie we don't believe anymore 
Mister Reagan says 'We will protect you' 
I don't subscribe to this point of view 
Believe me when I say to you 
I hope the Russians love their children too 
We share the same biology 
Regardless of ideology 
What might save us, me and you 
Is if the Russians love their children too
