Ah, the blues. 
The ball and chain that is 'round every English musician's leg. 
In fact, EVERY musician's leg. 
Tryin' to kick it off, baby? 
No, no. 
You'll just never do it. 
And these are the blues of time, 
And the blues of a woman, 
And a man thinkin' of her 
As time goes by. 


There is nothin' I can do 
If you leave me here to cry 
There is nothin' I can do 
If you leave me here to cry 
You know, my love will follow you, baby, 
Mmm, until the day I die 

I've given you all I own; 
That is one thing you cannot deny 
Oh...I've given you all I own; 
That is one thing you cannot deny 
And my love will follow you, baby, 
Yeah, 
'Til the day this man dies 

I've got failure all around me, 
No matter how hard I try 
I've got failure; 
It's all around me, 
No matter how hard I 
Try, try 
You know, my ghost will haunt you, baby, 
Until the day you stop down and die 
Well, you better get up 
Right now, right now 

Well... 
You think that you have left me behind 
And that with your other man you're safe 
And you're away from me, baby, but uh, 
One o' these days you're gonna break down and cry 
Because there is no escape from this man 
Because this man's love is so strong, 
He's gonna haunt you 
You know, my love will follow you, 
Mmm, until the day I die 

There is just one thing I want to tell you before I go 
I'm gonna leave it 
I'm gonna leave it 
Leave it up to you 
So long, 
baby, bye-bye 
Hey, I'm gonna leave it up to you,b aby 
So long, 
baby, bye-bye 

Well, you know my love will follow you,
