There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my lifeShadow in my heart
Is tearing me apart
Or maybe it's just something
In my starsThere's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my lifeBe a happy man
I try the best I can
Or maybe I'm just looking
For too muchThere's something missing from my life
Cuts me open like a knife
It leaves me vulnerable
I have this disease
I shake like an incurable
God help me pleaseO, there's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
