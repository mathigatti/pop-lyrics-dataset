Deathwish in the fading light
Headlight pointing through the night
Never thought I'd see the day
Playing with my life this way


Gotta keep my foot right down
If I had wings I'd leave the ground
Buning in the outside lane
People think that I'm insane, insane

The day I take a bend too fast
Judgement that could be my last
I'll be wiped right off the slate
Don't wait up cause I'll be late, I'll be late
