Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby please don't go


When the man done gone
When the man done gone
When the man done gone
Down the county farm
He got the shackles on
Baby please don't go
Don't leave me

I'll be a dog
I'll be a dog
I'll be a dog
Kiss your way down here
When you walk along
Baby please don't go

Why must you leave me
Lying on my back
Going across the other side of the track
Found yourself a new man I know
So baby please don't go
Baby please don't go

Oh please, please don't leave me
I don't want to be left alone baby
Oh don't go, don't go, don't go
