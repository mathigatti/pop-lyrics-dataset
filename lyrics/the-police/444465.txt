With her smile as sweet as a warm wind in summer 
She's got me flying like a bird in a bright June sky 
And then just when she thinks that I've got her number 
Brings me down to the ground with her wintry eye 
That's my baby 
She can be all four seasons in one day 


And when the nighttime comes with no interference 
To our warm summer love with all its charms 
But like a thoroughbred horse she can turn on a sixpence 
And I find that I'm back in mistress winter's arms 
That's my baby 
She can be all four seasons in one day 

How will I know? 
How can I tell? 
Which side of the bed she takes when the day begins 
She can be kind 
She can be cruel 
She's got me guessing like a game show fool 

She can change her mind like she changes her sweaters 
From one minute to the next it's hard to tell 
She blows hot and cold just like stormy weather 
She's my gift from the lord or a fiend from hell 
That's my baby 
She can be all four seasons in one day 

Watching the weatherman's been no good at all 
Winter, spring, summer, I'm bound for a fall 
There are no long term predictions for my baby 
She can be all four seasons in one day 

How will I know? 
How can I tell? 
Which side of the bed she takes when the day begins 
She can be kind 
She can be cruel 
She's got me guessing like a game show fool 

If it's a sunny day I take my umbrella 
Just in case the raindrops start to fall 
You could say that I'm just a cautious fellow 
I don't want to be caught in a sudden squall 
That's my baby 
She can be all four seasons in one day 
That's my baby 
She can be all four seasons in one day
