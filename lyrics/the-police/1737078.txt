Took a lot of drugs, watch the tide roll out

Keyboard is a mo day la
A key word is a mo way la

Kicking a wall baby cos' I'm gay
I broke all ma wa tay lay doe

(Ahhh) People are ghosts. Ah my my! Go away.
I pissed on my wall or my door

I'll come back though threw a sonar

I pissed on my walk on my ass all day
I stumble back home passed my door

Pissed all the day

Don't know why my white car won't stay clean
I don't know for what I do?
