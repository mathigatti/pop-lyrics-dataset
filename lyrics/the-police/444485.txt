I'm 20 years old 
At the moment, no job 
My height is one eighteen 
Green eyes and blond hair... 
and sometimes I feel alone 


I love action movies 
I love racing sports 
But my hero is Elvis 

He's really my god 
Do you like my hero? 
Do you like rock n' roll? 
Maybe sometimes feel lonely 
Don't have a job 
Please let me know 

My codeword is great 
Post Box Elvis 
Five seven nine three eight 
Post Box Elvis 
Five seven nine three eight... 
Post Box Elvis 
Five seven nine three eight 
Five seven nine three eight 
Five seven nine three eight 
Five

Eight... 

I am 20 years old 
At the moment, no job 
But my hero is Elvis 
He's really my god
