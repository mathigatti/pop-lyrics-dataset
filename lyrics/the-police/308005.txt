I change my clothe ten times
Before I take you on a date
I´m in a cold sweat, I panic
And it makes me late


I knew you never asked for this I know
My shots will always miss fire
My shots will always miss

Does everyone stare this way at you?
I only look this way at you

I change my clothes ten times Before I take you on a date
I get the heebie-jeebies
And my panic makes me late

I break into a cold sweat
Reaching for the phone
I let it ring twice before
I chicken out and decide 
You´re not at home

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only look this way at you

I never noticed the size of my feet
´Till I kicked you in the shins
Will you ever forgive me
For the shape I´m in
For the shape I´m in

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

I´m gonna write you a sonnet but I don´t know where to start
I´m so used at laughing at the things in my heart
Last of all I´m sorry ´cos you never asked for this
I can see I´m not your type and my shot will always miss, always miss...

Does everyone stare the way I do
I only look this way at you
