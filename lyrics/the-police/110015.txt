My sisters and I
     Have this wish before we die.
     And it may sound strange
     As if our minds are deranged.
     Please don't ask us why
     Beneath the sheltering sky
     We have this strange obsession
     You have the means in your possession.
     We want our tea in the Sahara with you.
     We want our tea in the Sahara with you.
     The young man agreed
     He would satisfy their need
     So they danced for his pleasure
     With a joy you could not measure.
     They would wait for him here
     The same place every year.
     Beneath the sheltering sky
     Across the desert he would fly.
     Tea in the Sahara with you.
     Tea in the Sahara with you.
     The sky turned to black-
     Would he ever come back?
     They would climb a high dune
     They would pray to the moon.
     But he'd never return,
     So the sisters would burn
     As their eyes searched the land
     With their cups full of sand.
     Tea in the Sahara with you.
     Tea in the Sahara with you..........
