I don't want to spend the rest of my life
Looking at the barrel of an ArmaLite
I don't want to spend the rest of my days
Keeping out of trouble like the soldiers say
I don't want to spend my time in hell
Looking at the walls of a prison cell
I don't ever want to play the part
Of a statistic on a government chart


There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
It gives us hope when the whole day's done

It's dark all day and it glows all night
Factory smoke and acetylene light
I face the day with my head caved in
Looking like something that the cat brought in

There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
It gives us hope when the whole day's done

And they're only gonna change this place
By killing everbody in the human race
And they would kill me for a cigarette
But I dont even want to die just yet

There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be and invisible sun
It gives us hope when the whole day's done
