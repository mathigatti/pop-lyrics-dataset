Broken lady 
Tears run dry 
You lie there easy, growin' wise through it all 
Tearin' the soul 
They watched you fall 
Lady, just lately your song has grown south 


Who'll weep for the 
Withered rose? 
Who will mourn the 
Sparrow? 
Who will cry for tommorow? 

Broken lady 
They say you soul 
{Is}Clingin' to shadows of lovers long gone 
Children sing loud 
Children draw near 
Lady, just lately your song has grown south 

Who'll weep for the 
Withered rose? 
Who will mourn the 
Sparrow? 
Who will cry for tommorow? 

Tearin' the soul 
They watched you fall 
Lady, just lately your song has grown south 

Who'll weep for the 
Withered rose? 
Who will mourn the 
Sparrow? 
Who will cry for tommorow? 
Who will cry for tommorow?
