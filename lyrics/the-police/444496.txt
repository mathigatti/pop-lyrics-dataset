My daddy's boots don't fit me
'Cause I'm bigger than him
He says I make him big now
I'm bigger than him


You see there's nothing worth achieving
All your dreams are just deceiving

You've locked the doors on your good living
And you told me to wait
You've got me backed into a corner
You're making me hate

I say there's nothing worth achieving
All your dreams are just deceiving

[They say there's nothing worth achieving
All your dreams are just deceiving]

Throwing stones that are reeling
&gt;From a reasonable light
You muscle in when I have a party
Ready to fight

I say there's nothing worth achieving
All your dreams are just deceiving

Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
