Creep in through my window 
Dance upon the wall 
Come in here beside me 
Climb into my soul 
Take me to the water, 
Down into the cool 
Everlasting memory 
Everlasting pool 


Aching in the darkness 
Burning in the sun 
Calling from the water 
This life has just begun 
Strength of blood and muscle 
Life of wood and bone 
Searching for a fire 
Searching for a home... 
Home...home...home... 

Crouching in the darkness 
Hiding in the stone 
Trembling in the darkness 
This man is not alone 
Hit me by the memory 
Hurt me to the bone 
Make my fists with starlight 
Carry me back home... 
Home... 

(HOME.) 
(HOME.) Ay...yah 
(HOME.) Ay...yah 
Ay...yah 
Ay...yah 
Ay...yah 
Ay...yah (Ay-yah, ay-yah, we say "ay-yah", ay-yah) 
Ay...yah (Ay-yah, ay-yah, we say "ay-yah", ay-yah) 
Ay...yah (Ay-yah, ay-yah, we say "ay-yah", ay-yah) 
Ay...yah (Ay-yah, ay-yah, we say "ay-yah", ay-yah) 
Hear them say ay-yah... (Ay-yah, ay-yah, we say "ay-yah", ay-yah) 
Hear them say ay-yah... (Ay-yah, ay-yah, we say "ay-yah", ay-yah)
