Once upon a daydream
I fell in love with you
Once upon a moonbeam
I gave that love to you
Once upon a lifetime
I know it must be true
When the months had turned us
I'd have to marry you


Once upon a daydream
Doesn't happen anymore
Once upon a moonbeam
This is no place for tenderness

Once her daddy found out
He threw her to the floor
He killed her unborn baby
And kicked me from the door
Once upon a nightmare
I bought myself a gun
I blew her daddy's brains out
Now hell has just begun

Once upon a daydream
Doesn't happen anymore
Once upon a moonbeam
This is no place for sentiment

Once upon a lifetime
A lifetime filled with tears
The boy would pay for his crime
With all his natural years
Once upon a daydream
He'd make you his someday
Once upon a moonbeam
He'd dream his life away

Once upon a daydream
Doesn't happen anymore
Once upon a moonbeam
This is no place for miracles

Once upon a daydream
Once upon a daydream
Once upon a daydream
Once upon a day... dream
