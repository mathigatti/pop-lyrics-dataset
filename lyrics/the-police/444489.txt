Cherubims of angels 
flashing 'cross the sky 
bringing forth a warning 
Don't let your freedom die 
Hear those trumpets blasting 
down the walls of Jericho 
Stand up and be counted 
Let your masters know 
that we won't let them take away 
what we've won up until today 
Listen to the battle-cry of angels... 
Cry of angels... 
Cry of angels... 
You better listen 


Reborn proclamation 
for Woman-child and Man 
Let you conscience guide 
you to speak out once again 
Racist head of facism 
rising from the ruins 
Take a look around, 
look at what they're doing 
Don't let them trick you now 
into kneeling down to bow 
Listen to the battle-cry of angels... 
Cry of angels... 
Cry of angels... 
You better listen 

Individualism: 
A precious right to keep 
Patriots on the left and right 
will lead you on like sheep, 
take control,fence you in, 
step on you like stones, 
tell you that it's for your good, 
protect you in your home 
Voice of freedom,time to speak 
Wake up from your borrowed sleep 
Listen to the battle-cry of angels... 
Cry of angels... 
Cry of angels... 
You better listen
