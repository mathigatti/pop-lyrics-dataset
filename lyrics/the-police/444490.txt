I don't want no dead end job, I don't wanna be no number
I don't want no dead end job, I don't wanna be no number
The queue gets longer everyday, I just ain't got time to stay
I ain't gonna run away, all I wanna do is play


Don't wanna be no teacher, I don't wanna be no slave
I don't wanna work no assembly line, like my uncle Dave
The queue gets longer everyday, I just ain't got time to stay
I ain't gonna run away, all I wanna do is play

I don't want no dead end job, I don't want no dead end job
I don't want no dead end job, I don't want no dead end job

I don't want no dead end job, I don't wanna be no number
I don't want no dead end job, I don't wanna be no number
The queue gets longer everyday, all I wanna do is play
I just ain't got time to stay, but I ain't gonna run away

Don't wanna be no millionaire, don't wanna own no mint
I don't wanna be no tax exile and I don't mind being skint
The queue gets longer every day, I just ain't got time to stay
I ain't gonna run away all I wanna do is play

I don't want no dead end job, I don't want no dead end job
I don't want no dead end job, I don't want no dead end job
Oh, no

I don't want no dead end job, I don't want no dead end job
I don't want no dead end job

I don't want no dead end job, I don't wanna be no number
I don't want no dead end job, I don't wanna be no number
The queue gets longer everyday, I just ain't got time to stay
I ain't gonna run away all I want to do is play

Don't wanna be no millionaire, don't wanna own no mint
I don't wanna be no tax exile and I don't mind being skint
The queue gets longer every day, I just ain't got time to stay
All I wanna do is play, I ain't gonna run away

I don't want no dead end job, I don't want no dead end job
I don't want no dead end job, I don't want no dead end job

I don't want no dead end job, you can stop your dead end job
Stop your fuckin' dead end, you bastard, cunts
Don't want no dead end job
I'm fuckin' pissed off with this dead end job
Camarine

Oh I don't want no dead end job, I don't want no dead end job
I don't want no dead end job, I don't want no dead end job
Dead end
