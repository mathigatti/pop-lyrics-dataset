The afternoon has gently passed me by 
The evening spreads its sail against the sky 
O ye of little faith 
You follow in my step 
We crumble on the ground before you dry... 


The universe is but a question mark 
Hangs above my head there in the dark 
O ye of little hope 
I thought that I could croak 
The truth has stretched you far from me,too far... 

Oh Pilate, you speak to me so clear 
Your voice of hell has filled my soul with fear 
O ye of little blood 
You call lies in the mud 
You hands are always washing them... 

The afternoon has gently passed me by 
The evening spreads its sail against the sky 
O ye of little faith 
You follow in my step 
We crumble on the ground before you dry... 
Oh Pilate, you speak to me so clear 
Your voice of hell has filled my soul with fear 
O ye of little blood 
You call lies in the mud 
You hands are always washing them...
