When it's love you give 
(I'll be a man of good faith.) 
Then in love you live. 
(I'll make a stand. I won't break.) 
I'll be the rock you can build on, 
Be there when you're old, 
To have and to hold. 


When there's love inside 
(I swear I'll always be strong.) 
Then there's a reason why. 
(I'll prove to you we belong.) 
I'll be the wal that protects you 
From the wind and the rain, 
From the hurt and pain. 

Let's make it all for one and all for love. 
Let the one you hold be the one you want, 
The one you need, 
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all. 
When there's someone that should know 
Then just let your feelings show 
And make it all for one and all for love. 

When it's love you make 
(I'll be the fire in your night.) 
Then it's love you take. 
(I will defend, I will fight.) 
I'll be there when you need me. 
When honor's at stake, 
This vow I will make: 

That it's all for one and all for love. 
Let the one be the one you want, 
The one you need, 
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all. 
When there's someone that should know 
Then just let your feelings show 
And make it all for one and all for love. 

Don't lay our love to rest 
'Cause we could stand up to you test. 
We got everything and more than we had planned, 
More than the rivers that run the land. 
We've got it all in our hands. 

Now it's all for one and all for love. 
(It's all for love.) 
Let the one you hold be the one you want, 
The one you need, 
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all. 
(It's one for all.)
