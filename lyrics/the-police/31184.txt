There is no political solution
To our troubled evolution
Have no faith in constitution
There is no bloody revolution


(4x)
We are spirits in the material world

Our so-called leaders speak
With words they try to jail you
They subjugate the meek
But it's the rhetoric of failure

(4x)
We are spirits in the material world

Where does the answer lie?
Living from day to day
If it's something we can't buy
There must be another way

(8x)
We are spirits in the material world
