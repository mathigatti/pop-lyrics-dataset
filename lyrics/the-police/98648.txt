I can't stand it for another day
When you live so many miles away.
Nothing here is gonna make me stay,
(You) took me over, let me find a way.


I sold my house
I sold my motor, too.
All I want is to be Next To You.
I'd rob a bank
Maybe steal a plane.
You took me over,
Think I'm goin' insane.

What can I do,
All I want is to be next to you.
What can I do,
All I want is to be next to you.

I've had a thousand girls or maybe more,
But I've never felt like this before.
But I just don't know what's come over me,
You took me over, take a look at me.

What can I do,
All I want is to be next to you.
What can I do,
All I want is to be next to you.

All I want is to be next to you,
All I want is to be next to you,
All I want is to be next to you.

So many times I used to give a sign
Got this feeling, gonna lose my mind.
When all it is is just a love affair.
You took me over baby, take me there.

What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you.

All I want is to be next to you...
