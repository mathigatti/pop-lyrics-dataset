Every day that goes by, a new hungry baby starts to cry 
Born astride a painful grave, drowned in hunger's tidal wave 
Pick a child that you can save, it'd be the only one 
If Africa escapes starvation, not only food but education 
The desert grows with every minute, trapping everybody in it 
All the children look the same, they wonder why they came 


But it's hard to tell the poison from the cure 
Harder still to know the reason why, why, why 
The only thing I really know for sure 
Is that another day, another day's gone by 

Every day that goes by, a brand new missile points towards the sky 
We're survivors of a game of chance, beneath an arms race avalanche 
If you survive this winter's cold, you'd be the only one 
If we escape annihilation, not only hope but education 
The world is ruled by (?), adding to their weapon piles 
Imagine what your taxes buy, we hardly ever try 

But it's hard to tell the poison from the cure 
Harder still to know the reason why, why, why 
The only thing I really know for sure 
Is that another day, another day's gone by 

Oh that this too sullied flesh would melt and resolve into a dew 
Suffocating lassitude, drowning in my platitude 
Trapped by insecurities, I'm not the only one 
If I survive this dislocation, have to use my education 
The world is ruled by (?), adding to their weapon piles 
Imagine what your taxes buy, we hardly ever try 

But it's hard to tell the poison from the cure 
Harder still to know the reason why, why, why 
The only thing I really know for sure 
Is that another day, another day's gone by
