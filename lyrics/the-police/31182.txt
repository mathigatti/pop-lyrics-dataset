Fifty million years ago
You walked upon the planet so
God of all that you could see,
Just a little bit like me


Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps

Hey Mr. dinosaur
You really couldn't ask for more
You were God's favorite creature
But you didn't have a future

Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your foorsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your foorsteps

Hey there mighty brontosaurus,
Don't you have a lesson for us
Thought your rule would always last,
There were no lessons in your past
You were built three stories high
They say you would not hurt a fly
If we explode the atom bomb
Will they say that we were dumb

Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps

They say the meek shall inherit the earth
They say the meek shall inherit the earth

Walking in your footsteps
