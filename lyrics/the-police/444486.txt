There's a phone line, 
there's ovation 
right at the bar at the railroad station 
And there's a story, 
a kind of fable 
All the court at the corner table 


On it is a message, been there some time 
It starts off, "The coffee tasted so fine." 

It says, "One day 
this may find you. 
These few words may just remind you.
