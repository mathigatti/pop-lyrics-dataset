No one can say 
where love will go 
the change 


Don't know if I 
am here or there 
don't even really 
know my name 

Am I holding on 
am I holding on 
will it always 
be the way 

And the lips that kiss 
can also kill 
the change 

The touch of love 
can take your soul 
the change 

I walk through walls 
I am the gun
