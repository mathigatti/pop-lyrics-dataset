Yesterday, I was a young man, 
Searching for my way, 
Not knowing 
What I wanted, 
Living life 
From day to day, yeah 
'Til she came along, 
There was nothing but an empty space... 
Not a trace 


Feels like 
Colored rain 
Tastes like 
Colored rain 
Rain down colored rain... 
Rain...yeah 

I can feel those color changes 
Going through my mind, 
United 
With a feeling 
Bringing love 
Into my eye, yeah 
'Til she came along, 
There was nothing but an empty space... 
Not a trace 

Feels like 
Colored rain 
Tastes like 
Colored rain 
Rain down colored rain... 
Rain... 
Bring it on down, babe 
Spill 

I can feel those color changes 
Going through my mind, 
United 
With a feeling 
Bringing love 
Into my eye, yeah 
'Til she came along, 
There was nothing but an empty space... 
Not a trace 

Feels like 
Colored rain,baby 
Don't you know, it feels like colored rain 
Don't you know, baby, 
It's not all the time 
That the sun won't shine 
Babe 
Babe 

If you love me, 
If you want me 
To be your man - 
yeah, yeah - 
There's one thing, baby, 
Every woman should understand, mmm 
Without rain, babe, 
Our love will never grow 
And if you want my sunshine, 
You got to accept my hail, rain, snow 
That's one thing ,baby, 
That I want you to do for me, yeah 
I want you to take off all your clothes, babe 
I want you to 
Walk out of my door, yeah (yeah) 
Baby 

Dig that colored rain, yeah (yeah) 
Bring it on down, yeah (yeah) 
Bring it on down, yeah (yeah) 
Bring it on down
