He goes out at night with his big boots on
None of his friends know right from wrong
They kick a boy to death
'cause he don't belong
You've got to humanize yourself


A policeman put on his uniform
He'd like to have a gun just to keep him warm
Because violence here is a social norm
You've got to humanise yourself

Re-humanise yourself
Re-humanise yourself
Re-humanise yourself
Re-humanise yourself

I work all day at the factory
I'm building a machine that's not for me
There must be a reason that i can't see
You've got to humanise yourself

Billy's joined the national front
He always was (just) a little runt
He's got his hand in the air
With the other cunts
You've got to humanise yourself

Re-humanise yourself
Re-humanise yourself
Re-humanise yourself
Re-humanise yourself

I work all day at the factory
I'm building a machine that's not for me
There must be a reason that i can't see
You've got to humanise yourself

A policeman put on his uniform
He'd like to have a gun just to keep him warm
Because violence here is a social norm
You've got to humanise yourself

Re-humanise yourself...
