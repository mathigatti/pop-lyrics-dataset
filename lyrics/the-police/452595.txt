I never thought of leading
I've got my own machine
And I've paid my dues all along
All set for breaking 
When I missed those other people 
'Cause I knew that I was really alone


Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and guys
Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and guys

I saw my education
It was my indocrination
Just to be another parking machine
All my sense was breaking 
When I missed those other people 
'Cause I knew that I was not very clean

Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and guys
Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and guys

Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and guys
Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and guys

Fall out
