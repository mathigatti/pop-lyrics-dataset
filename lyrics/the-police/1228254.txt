I never thought of leading
I´ve got my own machine
And I´ve paid my dues all along


All set for breaking when I
Missed those other people ´cause
I knew that I was really alone

Fallout - fallout with all the leaders and guys
Fallout - fallout with all the leaders and guys

I saw my education
It was my doctrination
Just to be another parking machine

All my sense was breaking when I
Missed them other people ´cause
I knew that I was not very clean

Fallout - fallout with all the leaders and guys
Fallout - fallout with all the leaders and guys

Fallout!
