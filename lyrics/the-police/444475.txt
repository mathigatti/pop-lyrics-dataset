Be still my beating heart 
It would be better to be cool 
It's not time to be open just yet 
A lesson once learned is so hard to forget 
Be still my beating heart 
Or I'll be taken for a fool 
It's not healthy to run at this pace 
The blood runs so red to my face 
I've been to every single book I know 
To soothe the thoughts that plague me so 


I sink like a stone that's been thrown in the ocean 
My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion 
Stop before you start 
Be still my beating heart 

Restore my broken dreams 
Shattered like a falling glass 
I'm not ready to be broken just yet 
A lesson once learned is so hard to forget 

Be still my beating heart 
You must learn to stand your ground 
It's not healthy to run at this pace 
The blood runs so red to my face 
I've been to every single book I know 
To soothe the thoughts that plague me so 
Stop before you start 
Be still my beating heart 

Never to be wrong 
Never to make promises that break 
It's like singing in the wind 
Or writing on the surface of a lake 
And I wriggle like a fish caught on dry land 
Struggle to avoid any help at hand 

I sink like a stone that's been thrown in the ocean 
My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion 
Stop before you start 
Be still my beating heart
