Good friends and I'm a stranger 
So hard to circulate 
Crowded streets, I see no faces 
No place for a changing soul 
Like a ship on an angry ocean 
Ferris wheel that spins too fast 
For a dog, snarling in a corner 
Heaven never seemed so far away 


Maybe the game is someone else's 
Too tired to play along 
Go on your way takin' chances 
Your way is yours alone 
For an artist in a hungry basement 
Or a rain on a lonely man 
Or a kid, fightin' with his father 
Heaven never seemed so far away 

Good friends and I'm a stranger 
So hard to circulate 
Crowded streets, I see no faces 
No place for a changing soul 
Like a ship on an angry ocean 
Ferris wheel that spins too fast 
For a dog, snarling in a corner 
Heaven never seemed so far away
