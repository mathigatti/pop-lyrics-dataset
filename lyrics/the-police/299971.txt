Don't tell the director 
I said so
But are you safe Miss Gradenko?
We were at a policy meeting
They were planning 
New ways of cheating
I didn't want 
To rock your boat
But you sent this dangerous note
You've been letting your feelings show
Are you safe Miss Gradenko?
Miss Gradenko are you safe?
Are you safe Miss Gradenko?
Miss Gradenko are you safe?


Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody at all in here?
Nobody but us living here
Nobody but us
Is anybody alive in here?
Nobody but us

Your uniform doesn't seem to fit
You're much too alive in it
You've been letting 
Your feelings show
Are you safe Miss Gradenko?
Miss Gradenko are you safe?

Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody at all in here?
Nobody but us living here
Nobody but us

Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody at all in here?
Nobody but us living here
Nobody but us
Nobody but us living here
Nobody but us
