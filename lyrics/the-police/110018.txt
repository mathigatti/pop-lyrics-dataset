Everyone I know is lonely
And God is so far away,
And my heart belongs to no one,
So now sometimes I pray
Please take the space between us
And fill it up some way.
Take the space between us
And fill it up some way.


Oh my God you take the biscuit
Treating me this way
Expecting me to treat you well
No matter what you say.
How can I turn the other cheek
It's black and bruised and torn
I've been waiting
Since the day that I was born.

Take the space between us
And fill it up some way.
Take the space between us
And fill it up some way.

The fat man in his garden
The thin man at his gate
My God you must be sleeping
Wake up, it's much too late.

Take the space between us
And fill it up some way.
Take the space between us
And fill it up some way.

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days?
Since we first met,
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet.
