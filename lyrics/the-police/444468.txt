As their wings go dark - up against the sun 
and their shadows pass - over everyone 
and time unfolds - to a beating drum 


I throw my clothes on a burning chair 
I paint my eyes with the cold night air 
the dreamer shouts - to an empty room 

and the sun will shine 
and the rain will pour 
we radiate for evermore 
and the world will turn 

falling rain 
in the end 
there's a silence 

and the TV set doesn't show the fall 
the light is fast the world is small 
and in the end there's a silence 

and the sun will shine 
and the rain will pour 
we radiate for evermore 
and the world will turn
