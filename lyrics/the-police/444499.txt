When you were a young girl, did you 
Have a ragged dog, 
The only dog you ever owned? 
You can treat me the way you used to treat that 
Ragged dog; 
But hurry up, 'cause I'm gettin' old 
And I get older, baby, 
Day by day, 
And it get's stronger, baby, 
Let me say, 
And it goes deeper, baby, 
Than you'll ever know 
Stand back, baby, 
And watch my love grow 


And do I love you? My, oh my 
River deep, mountain high 
If I lost you, would I cry? 
Bet your life, baby! 
Baby, baby! 
Baby, baby! 
Baby, baby! 

When you were a young girl, did you 
Have a puppy 
That always followed you around? 
You can treat me the way you used to treat that 
Puppy, baby; 
I swear I'll never put you down 
No, I won't, 
And I get thankful, baby, 
In every way, 
And it gets less painful, baby, 
Let me say, 
And I'm gonna love you 
Every night and day 
Look out, baby; 
My love is comin' your way 
Yes it is 

And do I love you? My, oh my 
River deep, mountain high 
If I lost you, would I cry? 
Bet your life, baby! 
Baby, baby! 
Baby, baby! 
Baby, baby! 

I love you, baby, 
Like a flower needs a spring 
I love you, baby, 
Like Aretha Franklin needs to sing, 
And I love you, baby, 
Like a schoolboy loves his party, yeah, 
And I love you baby, 
River deep mountain high 

I want to take ya higher (higher) 
I want to take ya higher (higher) 
I want to take ya higher (higher) 
Get on with me, babe (higher) 
Give it to me, babe (higher) 
All I need is some (higher) 
Give it up, baby (higher) 
Give it up, baby (higher) 
Wow! (higher)
