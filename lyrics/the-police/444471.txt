Sad to say our mighty ruler 
Is not really in the pink 
Hopes could not be minesculer 
That he'll come back from the brink 


Not to beat around the bush he 
Looks like heading for his box 
At the risk of seeming pushy 
We must plan for future shocks 

According to the Hawk God, Horus 
Our most regal invalid 
Is not that much longer for us 
Build another pyramid ! 

Though all doctors and physicians 
Have been summoned to his bed 
It will soon be top morticians 
We'll be calling for instead 

With each wheeze the nation's humming 
Egypt shakes with every cough 
No two ways about what's coming 
No discussion - bets are off 

Soon our Pharaoh will have filled a 
Tomb just like his father did 
Summon Egypt's greatest builder 
Re: another pyramid ! 

We hate to depress the nation 
But our leader has been told 
He should scrub his next vacation * 
Even put tonight on hold 

This is where his loyal priesthood 
Has the chance to do him proud 
Holy leaders at the least should 
See him happy to his shroud 

He must have a vault that's grand by 
Any standards, floor to lid 
Put five thousand slaves on standby 
Build another pyramid !
