From the mountains on the moon to the mighty delta 
From the deserts of the West to the shining sea 
Beneath the canopy of stars flows the serpent river 
Flowing through my father's land that he left to me 


From the baker, to the priest, to the candle maker 
From the highest to the low in my father's land 
We make our offer to the sun 'fore the break of morning 
Or else everything we have will just turn to sand 

I have a lot to ask 
I have a lot that I need to say 
I have so much do 
And all I need is another day 

From the soldier, to the scribe, to the carpet maker 
All the different colored threads in a carpet loom 
A woven tapestry of life is our mighty nation 
This is the writing on the wall of my father's tomb 

We have a lot to ask 
We have a lot that we need to say 
We have so much do 
And all we need is another day 

Beneath the desert moon, I call you 
beneath the desert moon, I sing 
beneath the desert moon, so lonely 
I'm just a boy who would be king 

With just the moon to guide us 
We sometimes lose our way 
If there's a light inside us 
We'll follow it to the brightness of the day 

Every single blade of grass, every yellow flower 
Every ripple on the sea of the blue, blue Nile 
Every leaf on every tree, every single creature 
From the smallest little bird, to the crocodile 

We have a lot to ask 
We have a lot that we need to say 
We have so much do 
And all we need is another day 

Beneath the desert moon, I call you 
beneath the desert moon, we sing 
beneath the desert moon, we're waiting 
Before the coming of the king 

Beneath the desert moon that's sinking
