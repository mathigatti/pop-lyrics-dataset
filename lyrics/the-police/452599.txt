World War Three 
Suddenly... 
comes reality... 
All around, 
burning ground... 
Just how far can you see?... 


How will you feel when you live underground? 
No longer free to move on 
No longer free of the things that brought you down 
(Above ground) 

Can this be 
reality?... 
All the dreams are decayed... 
Here we stand, 
world in hand... 
We ourselves have the key... 

Open the gateway to flowers and streams 
Children are living our dreams 
Look at them playing their games, so wild and free 
(Let this be) 

World War Three 
Must it be?... 
Live and love, don't destroy... 
Ah,ah ha ha! 
Don't destroy... 
Don't destroy... 
Don't destroy... 
Please... 
Please... 
Don't destroy... 
Don't destroy... 
Ah!
