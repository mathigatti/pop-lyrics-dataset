I'm stupid for you
inner space man angel
I should have cut the crap out
but I was drinking too much


Then she said

Joan of arc was cool
but she got burned
like I'm burning after you
I'm centrifugal

I am the sun
I am the sun
I am the sun
I am

we had a minor adventure
took a ride in the car
ended up in a forest somewhere

she took my keys and threw them in the ditch
disappeared into the mud and pitch
I must have walked the world that night
until dawn, but she'd gone

and she'd said

Jesusu was my age
when he got nailed
yeah I'm coming back to you
I'm paranormal

I am the sun
I am the sun
I am the sun

Ride on, ride on it's not over
Shine on, shine on it's not over
Ride on, ride on it's not over
Shine on, shine on it's not over
