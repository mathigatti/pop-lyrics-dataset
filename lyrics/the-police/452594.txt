I asked my dog what he thought the best in man 
He said, "The love you dispense to me twice daily from a can." 
I said, "Why do you think my question funny? 
And where would you be without my money?" 
I said, "There may be some quality in us you must treasure." 
"It's despair," he said, "of which your money is the measure." 


Walk like a dog 
Like anybody can 

I said, "What about our politics, philosophy, our history?" 
He said, "If there is something admirable in these it is a mystery." 
"But there must be something in our system tell me at your leisure." 
"It's despair," he said, "of which your borders are the measure." 

Walk like a dog 
Talk like a man 
Walk like a dog 
Like anybody can 

I said, "What about technology, computers, nuclear fission?" 
"I'm terrified of radiation, hate the television." 
I said, "There must be something in our scientific treasure." 
"It's despair," he said, "of which your weapons are the measure." 

"Feed me, you can beat me. I will love you till I die. 
But don't ask for admiration and don't ever ask me why." 
I said, "Why wait till now to demonstrate displeasure?" 
"It's despair," he said, "of which my silence was the measure." 

Walk like a dog 
Talk like a man 
Walk like a dog 
Like anybody can
