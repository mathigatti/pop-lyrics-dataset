The general scratches his belly and thinks
His pay is good but his officers stink
Guerilla girl, hard and sweet
A military man would love to meet
The President looks in the mirror and speaks
His shirts are clean but his country reeks
Unpaid bills, in Afghanistan hills


Bombs away
But we're O.K.
Bombs away
In old Bombay

The general only wants to teach France to dance
His army life doesn't give him any romance
Guerilla girl, hard and sweet
A military man would love to meet
The general scratches his belly and thinks
His pay is good but his company stinks
Guerilla girl, hard and sweet
A military man would love to meet

Bombs away
But we're O.K.
Bombs away
In old Bombay
Bombs away
But we're O.K.
Bombs away
In old Bombay
Bombs away
But we're O.K.
Bombs away
In old Bombay
Bombs away
But we're O.K.
Bombs away
In old Bombay
