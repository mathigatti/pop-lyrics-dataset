Have you ever had the feeling 
That the world's gone and left you behind 
Have you ever had the feeling 
That you're that close to loosing your mind 
You look around each corner 
Hoping that she's there 
You try to play it cool perhaps 
Pretend that you don't care 
But it doesn't do a bit of good 
You got to seek 'til you find 
Or you never unwind 
Try to think 
That loves not around 
Still it's uncomfortably near 
My old heart 
Ain't gainin' no ground 
Because my angel eyes ain't here 


Angel eyes 
That old devil sent 
They glow unbearebly bright 
Need I say 
That my love's misspent 
Misspent with angel eyes tonight 

So drink up all you people 
Order anything you see 
Have fun you happy people 
You drink and the laugh's on me 

Pardon me 
But I "gotta run" 
The fact's uncommonly clear 
Gotta find 
Who's now "Number One" 
And why my angel eyes ain't here 
Tell me why my angel eyes ain't here 
Excusez-moi my angel eyes ain't here 
Excuse me while I disappear
