Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you


Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see?
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying, baby, baby, please

Oh, can't you see?
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you

(Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take)

I'll be watching you

(Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay)

I'll be watching you

(Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake)

I'll be watching you

(Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay)

I'll be watching you

(Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take)

I'll be watching you

(Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay)
