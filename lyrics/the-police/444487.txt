There were rooms of forgiveness 
In the house that we share 
But the space has been emptied 
Of whatever was there 
There were cupboards of patience 
There were shelf loads of care 
But whoever came calling 
Found nobody there 
After today, consider me gone 


Roses have thorns and shining waters mud 
And cancer lurks deep in the sweetest bud 
Clouds and eclipses stain the moon and the sun 
And history reeks of the wrongs we have done 
After today, consider me gone 

I've spent too many years at war with myself 
The doctor has told me it's no good for my health 
To search for perfection is all very well 
But to look for heaven is to live here in hell 
After today, consider me gone
