You consider me the young apprentice
Caught between the scylia and charibdes
Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger


I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they wouldn't teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turned into a shining band of gold

I'll be wrapped around your finger

Mephistopheles is not your name
But I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
And you willl see it come to its fruition

I'll be wrapped around your finger

Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Vanish in the air you'll never find me
I will turn your face to alabaster
Then you will find your servant is your master

And you'll be wrapped around my finger
