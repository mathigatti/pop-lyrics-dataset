[Drake - Chorus]
You could thank me now
uh, go 'head
Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said
but later doesn't always come so instead
it's okay,
You could thank me now
uhh, yeah, well alright, here I go


[Verse 1 - Drake]
mahalo from the hardest act to follow
lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
aloha's to women with no ties
to men that I know well
that way there are no lies
you could thank me now for all the info I give to you n-ggas
on the brink of influential
I'm here for you n-ggas I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career
for you n-ggas
I must have been hard to watch,
what a year for you n-ggas
it's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
you got resolutions, we just got reservations
living out a dream, it feels like I stayed up
and we just wanna party PAT Ron straight up
f-ck that old sh-t, I'm on new things
OVO clique, Red wing boot gang
yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
who'd thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
I could relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed
and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival
damn, I swear sports and music are so synonomous
'cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
yeah so on behalf of the demanded
and the entertainment you take for granted
you could thank me now…
and oh my goodness you're welcome
you're welcome
at this point me is who I'm trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from
but drink up because everyone here is good tonight
except the n-ggas that I came with, they good for life
yeah, thats how you know it's going down
in case another chance never comes around…

[Chorus]

[Drake - Verse 2]
Uhh, shallow n-gga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it
cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
man the good girls went silent on me
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me
and all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
that make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
but do I ever come up in discussion over double pump latte's
and low fat muffin's, do I?
Or is missing what we had outta the question
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe's who's there before it all
I guess thats how it goes
they hear about your cons or focus on your pro's
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
but those same ones from your area will grow
into women that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allow
where are they all now
I know there somewhere watching so I'm trying to make them proud
searching for the meaning
you'll find it next to me
and tell me that I'm the finest I guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas who am I to disagree
they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
it's probably why I'm in this b-tch shining
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
and the bandwagons full you can try and run behind it
I'm sorry poolside drinking
margharita rounds
shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the Black Sheep, but Chris Farley wears the crown
and I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
I'm in the World where things are taken, never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and I'm aware this could be the last time you listen
so while I'm still in this postion…

[Chorus]
