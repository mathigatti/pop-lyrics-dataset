Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin', somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin', somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone
You need to fuckin' stop watchin' me
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

Look, I want you to myself
But I know you just left someone else
I know you did, he did a number on you (I know, brrrt)
That must be why you move so, icy
Icy like 1017
Icy like there's nobody youâ€™d ever need
Better not give that up to anyone but me (yeah)
Patient as can be, but

I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything somehow
