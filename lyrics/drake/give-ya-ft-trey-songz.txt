[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor, tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO, D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again, return of the mack again
"Deceiving" was cool, I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin one of my rappa friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' you know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me... little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best decisions you've made
I'm sunnin' them all, I live in the shade
Previously mischievious behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited to degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, kinda adult shit
I am talkin all day shoppin sprees in the mall
With friends that I ball with
Hear me: Trey's girl go and get me some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise, I will kill this song til it actually dies
With military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best til the stats arrive
At all these a-list parties you fratranize
Where you can't wear hats inside only slacks and ties
Bu you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best


[Chorus:]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
There ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)

[Verse 2: Trey Songz - rap]
(It's The Prince, look here)
Yep it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exibitor
Play me I'll visit ya, lay ya in critical condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin with a fly face, slim face, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos, now we got the city froze
Somethin like my wrist be, niggas know how dis shit be
Step to the club, security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor, dey give us a couple sips free
I be on Henessy, straight no cubes
Take me where the women be, I won't lose
Drake take Patron to the face til he wasted
I'm blowin til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
All me Mister Anderson huh I'm ramblin
But at the same time, I'm spittin a flame rhyme
Baby what's you're name, hey call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's gametime
We could take a couple shots, break down ya d'z
Take it to the hole, post up on me
Let me feel the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya

[Chorus:]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
There ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya

[Verse 3:]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Fresh up on the scene
Big blunt full of green
Fitted to the back, 'Ginia be on the map
Virginia on the back of the hat while I mack
Ay shawty you phat and I love that
Big stage, and I holla "where dem thugs at? "
Fellaz hit me and they holla "where the drugs at? "
I'm a charge a nigga fifty for the a dub sack
Fuck v.I.p. cus the bithes all ova a nigga
And the weed all ova he liquor
I mean the liquor all over the weed
Shit, a nigga all ova da B
And the flames all ova da feez
And I be all ova da streets
I'm on my grind, come go with a G
Gettin money ain't nuthin to me babae
Say no, and you frontin to me
I'm a give ya what you want it to be
When I give ya what I give ya

[Chorus:]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
There ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl uz I'm bout that (oh no no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya,
