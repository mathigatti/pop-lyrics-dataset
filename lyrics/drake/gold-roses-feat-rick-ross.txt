I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, they'll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin’ love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin’ on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin’ me level
Money come and go, I’ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever (forever)
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I’ll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body’s a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (Biggest, biggest)

Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (ayy)

[Rick Ross]
Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' (stop talkin', stop talkin')

[Drake]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)
