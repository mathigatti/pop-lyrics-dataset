Look I stands out... so don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, ask apple how I get it tho
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never... I don't get bitter... I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled... hey bitches
I would never turn around... cause I just don't fit the description
But that's just me though...
But don't mind him girl... that's just freako
Please don't cuss girl... that don't suit you
His name 40 and his name future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of o.v.o.
I am not doin features now... no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I overexpressin the game
Should I hold back on addressin the lane
Because they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm tranna clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And every since I've been messing with wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was goin nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
Drake was at the club and he bald like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve... and I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it... and all you talkin ass niggas get over it
And all you people that be hating get over it... and all you women that I fucked get over it
And yea I'm turning 22 get over it... you know you gotta hear my records get over it
My whole team getting rich get over it... I got the city on my back get over it
Get over it get over it
