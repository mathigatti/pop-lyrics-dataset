Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Whats my name, whats my name


[Drake]
I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah you know word of mouth
The square root of 69 is 8 something
Cuz I've been tryna work it out, oooow
Good weed, white wine
I come alive in the night time
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Ooooh, let it play, say you gotta leave
But I know you wanna stay
You just waiting on the track to finish girl
The things we could do in twenty minutes girl
Say my name, say my name
Wear it out, its getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as I go the text you gon right is gon say…

[Rihanna]
Not everybody knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
Boy you stay up on it
You got that something that keeps me so off balance
Baby you're a challenge, lets explore your talent

[Chorus x2]
Hey boy I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you
Cause you just my type
Ooh na na na na
I need a boy to really take it over
Looking for a guy to put me work out
Oooooh, oooooh

Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Whats my name, whats my name

[Rihanna]
Baby you got me, ain't nowhere that I'd be
Then with your arms around me
Back and forth you rock me
So I surrender, to every word you whisper
Every door you enter, I will let you in

[Chorus]
Hey boy I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you
Cause you just my type
Ooh na na na na
I need a boy to really take it over
Looking for a guy to put me work out
Oooooh, oooooh

You're so amazing, you took the time to figure me out
That's why you take me, way past the point of turning me on
You bout to break me, I swear you got me losing my mind

Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name

Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Whats my name, whats my name

[Chorus x2]
Hey boy I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you
Cause you just my type
Ooh na na na na
I need a boy to really take it over
Looking for a guy to put me work out
Oooooh, oooooh
