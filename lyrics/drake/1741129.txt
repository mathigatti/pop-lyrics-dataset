Uh, I am a distraction
Comin from my spot and I don't signal as I back in.
If cash is beautiful then money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin' centerfold of maxim.
Open to my page and admire my desire,
Frequent flyer I aspire to retire,
My boy stands alone if I'm with the chior,
Got a Cannon on my hip but nigga this is not Mariah.
Na, this the record killer for hire.
I eat and sleep with the weapon, the beat is all I require,
Look I created despite the nigga that hated, every single bar gettin first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin so sedated.
The me and bitch the same were feel so related,
[? ] in stated or denniscaded[? ]
I put a thousand on it, I could prolly fuck the waitress.
So wait just take this,


One lie at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop tenneshee state shit
Drop a four winning and then appreciate The Greatness, nigga haha

Yeah,
I wrote this verse sittin in my new car,
Sometimes where you headed is too far,
It's more about where you are.
And I am, everywhere where you wish you could be
Somebody somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is a how were all ending up,
I'm at the label in the elevator,
Send them up!
