Yeah, I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Still with the dogs that I grew besides
All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me


I just called shorty on the face, dawg
Just
Way that I been livin' unconventional
I'm just tryna make it to the engine, though
Certain things just started getting tense, dawg
Thinkin' that I need it so official
I can be your man, but may [?]
I'd rather see my heart turn crystal
I can't even front it, I don't miss ya
Right now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own
Soon as I free up, I'm boutta pop up on your phone

Like, I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Still with the dogs that I grew besides
All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah

Heart still on javelin, baby
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
I was pullin' off when they knew me
Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me
When it was you and me
I felt like I loved you too much to change you
You believe in angles more than angels
