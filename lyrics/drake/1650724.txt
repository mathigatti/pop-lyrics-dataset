I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all


What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne

And this what I'ma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over…..

(the rest of the lyrics after the jump…)

Bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off, set it off, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't've drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
'Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it (Ah)

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne

And this what I'ma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over

One thing 'bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin' I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin', man?
Man, nobody's never done it like I did it (Ugh)

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne

And this what I'ma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over

Yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne

And this what I'ma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over
