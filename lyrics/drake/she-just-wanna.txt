I don't see the problem,
If she wanna party,
Put on sexy clothes and,
Go and move her body,
Shawty, my shawty she do what she please,
Nigga please, she's coming home with me,
She just wanna,


The guys want you,
The girls want me,
But what can we do,
If i just keep it honest, promise you will be too,
Cause you told me that everything i'm doings brand new,
I watch you getting dressed,
So just appreciate the view,
They ask why i let her go out alone,
I say i don't feel no pressure coz i know she's coming home,
And my,

So she's always tryna housie,
Anything she puts on her body's the perfect outfit,

I don't see the problem,
If she wanna party,
Put on sexy clothes and,
Go and move her body,
Shawty, my shawty she do what she please,
Nigga please, she's coming home with me,

But when she's coming home,
She's giving me the ride,
