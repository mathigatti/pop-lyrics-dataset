Me looking down below to yall
Is the only way you would understand me
Get it drake hit me up man yd aka young done it
Looking for a deal hit the clubs throw some hundreds ,


Maybe meets some broads who willing to let me
Get some backshots and if hella cool even get a couple
A snap shots for the road tour bus life is getting old show up
B**** go wild for wat i do no sitting up top

Just looking down below on some hunchback
Bullshyt call me quiesmodoe but really
Who could have pictured this with out a camara
Starring at celebrities feeled up with glamour sister
Dont believe that i met nickii them old lines
I used may make her not want to mess with me ,
But drake if you could give me a chance to sign under
You man i idolize yo flow and even patten yo vocals
Cant wait to be a multi millionare hoolywood molgue
But hit me up soon my mom just said its time for dinner

513 6281813 is her number dont try and spin
Just tell her you a friend from school cause
She a fan of you to and dont want her to look like a fool
A mill in the first week is what my album sells a look like
Cause im under you the beat crisspy and my hook
Nice only cause you featured not to seem modest
But you da illest out bra im just trying to be honest
But if you get to read this please make yourself a promise,
Sign yd so you can take off a couple years
Vacate with nickii maybe to the bahmamas
Cincinnati ohio darrell kinney
