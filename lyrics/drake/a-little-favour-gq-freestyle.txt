Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year it's all business
It is a shame that a couple of â€˜em are off limits
No offence to my nigga, it's just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he aint trippin'
I know I got a couple things that Lil' Wayne dipped in
Aint ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you f-ck and the ones that you wife up
Don't let them fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform, I can't let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it's lit up
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple Warhol's for my hallways
New verses crush the hood like I'm driving into something
Bitches on the kid like I'm Iverson of something
Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first
Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse
Swag!
