[alicia keys]
If you ask me i'm readyâ€¦


[drake]
Ugh, tez keeps telling me he just turned 30
Having dreams of being single forever he's getting worried
And i'm scared too because i'm in the same boat
Good women are rare too, none of them have come close
Me i have'nt changed much, you know how i play
Better safe than sorry
Instead of searching for substance at every single party
Baby being part of this life
I feel like i'm bound to end up with somebody
That's been with everybody
I need you to rescue me from my destiny
I'm trying to live right and give you whatever's left of me
Cause you know life is what we make it and a
Chance is like a picture, it'd be nice if you just take it.

Or let me take it for ya
I'm just down to ride
Or we can roll around the city until we finally decide
I got more than a thing for you, tattoo and ink for you
Right over my heart girl i do the unthinkable

[alicia keys]

Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Whose it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now
(drake: you should say it right now)

You ready?

[bridge]
You give me a feeling that i never felt before
And i deserve it, i think i deserve it
(drake: i deserve it, i think it deserve it..let it go)
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And i can't take it
(drake: i can't take it)

[chorus]
I was wondering maybe
Could i make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me i'm ready
(echo: i'm ready, i'm ready)
If you ask me i'm ready
(echo: i'm ready, i'm ready)

[verse 2: alicia keys]
I know you once said to me
"this is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be"
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually?
If we gon' do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(drake: we should do it right now)

Bay, uh

[bridge]

[chorus]

[hook]
Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away
I can't say i came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me
