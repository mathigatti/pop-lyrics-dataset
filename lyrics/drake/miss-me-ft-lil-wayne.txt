I said tell me what's really goin' on
Drizzy back up in this thang, I'm ready
What's happenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a muthafuckin Scratch 'n Win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow
night
I will have a model wife
Yo bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto
twice


"Drake you got 'em, right?"
Yea, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not
as fun
Neets got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yea, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Meliah I'm on fire,
She should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell China it'll be
worth the flight
I'll be at my table stackin' dollars to the perfect
height

Work somethin, twirk something basis
She just tryna make it
So she's right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her
But I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper
And she'll soon have met another
That's why me and Lil' Jazz bout to spaz
Can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up,
yea
Bills everywhere, trill everything
And D.R.A.K.E just stand for "Do Right And Kill
Everything"

I love Nicki Minaj
I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin'
did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious
I'm with it if you with it
'Cause yo verses turn me on and your pants are mighty
fitted, ugh

Damn, I think you caught me in the moment
Like I catch 'em stealing flows, 'cause I swear I
never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera is always
rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we
blowin'

[Chorus]
'Cause it's on
Yea, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yea I hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Can you just tell me what you down for?
Anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around
more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
(Gone, gone)

(Lil Wayne)
Oh shit
Mothafucka goddamn
Kickin' bitches out da condo like Pam
Gettin' money everyday, I'm a groundhog
'Bout 2 scoop yo girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck da brown
off

Ugh, that's nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
They buyin' cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baratone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me, that's how she learn
every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish
But I do pack bone

Uh, I'm a love machine and I won't work for nobody
but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a Coupe
It's blood gang slob, but I'm prolly with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, don't need science for proof
Turn you to a vegetable, like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I aint trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill
'em
I'm stickin' to da script like lint on denim
Momma said if the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em

Real nigga talkin', shut the fuck up, hoe
Gonna do it one time for Haiti, what up, Zoe
Weezy F, baby, and the F is for front door
'Cause that's where I bring it, So woo if you
banging, mothafucka

[Chorus]

(Drake)
Each time
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone,
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me, miss me, miss
me
Miss me a little when I'm gone,
Miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone...
