Look who I'm fucking again
I had on ice, but then
I watched the ice get thin
Now that she's sink or swim
She had an attitude in the summer, but she bein' nice again
Double my price again
Top of the charts, back in they hearts
Nigga he strikes again, woah
Some niggas bitter with life and they hate me
They wanna put knife in my ribs, woah

Way this shit set up I live like Ronaldo
But I never been in Madrid, woah
She said that that she workin', I told her come over
And we can get right at the crib, woah
She finish at six but than say she got court in the morning
To fight for her kid
I told her I'd pray for the kid

What a time this is
To be alive for this shit
President doin' us in
My window got blue in the tint, ooh
Did this shit once and I'd do it again

Look who I'm fucking again
I had on ice, but then
I watched the ice get thin
Now that she's sink or swim

Look who I'm stuck with again
I had on ice, but then

Now, does she sink or does she swim, now
'Cause she bein' nice again
Double the price again
Top of the charts, back in they hearts
Nigga he strikes again, woah
Some niggas bitter with life and they hate me
They wanna put knife in my ribs, woah

And I could put that on the twins, woah
We not together, but I get the info on you
'Cause I'm nice to your friends, woah
Woah, woah, woah

Did this shit once and I'd do it again

Look who I'm fucking again
I had on ice, but then
I watched the ice get so thin
Now, does she sink or does she swim, now
