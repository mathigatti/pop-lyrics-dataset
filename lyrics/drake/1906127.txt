Cups of the rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy


But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say: Fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches
That we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeh, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?

Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me
