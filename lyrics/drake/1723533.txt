What if I kissed you right now
How would we explain it
Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out
What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off our shoulders
Take me I'm yours
And I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions
If we were a secret how long could you keep it
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
*mumbles* away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine


What if I kissed you right now...

Would it bring us any closer
Take a weight off of our shoulders
Tell on me
I dont mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie...

...admit that I'm yours
I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions

If we were a secret
Tell me could u keep it?
Keep it your yourself dont tell nobody else
Something away
*mumbles* away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine

What if I kissed you right now
What if I kissed you right now

Just be mine (just be mine)
And u just be mine.. all mine
And u just be mine (just, just be mine)
And u just be mine.. all mine
