You got potential, I can't explain it
You're so persuasive, I made some changes
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah


Where were you this whole time?
Come and see me now, not another time
You should come see me on the regular
I don't know if we'll find a better time

I'd rather have you here instead
I gotta get outta my own head
Don't let me down, come here right now (yeah)

Grow up and face it, don't keep me waiting
You love me how you love me, then just say it
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Girl what's the hold up? Come take me over
You came the closest, we should be closer
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

I gotta get outta my own head
Don't let me down, come here right now (yeah)
Don't let me down, come here right now
