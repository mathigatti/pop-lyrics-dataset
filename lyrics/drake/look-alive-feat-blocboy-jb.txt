901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('live)
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side
Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (huh, fuck 'em)
I get racks to go outside, and I split it with the guys (outside)

I've been gone since like July, niggas actin' like I died

And I'm out here with the woo!
