Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
Uh uh nah, I know you all too well
We said that we can kiss the past goodbye
But your weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay shawty but here I go


Should I spend the weekend in vegas
I'm busy living the moment not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget
My memories never faded I can't relate to these haters
My enemies never made it
I amâ€¦ still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr sh-t
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
Yeah, I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist and thats how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous, it's happening penny lane
I said its happening penny lane
Just like you said I avoided the coke game and went with sprite instead
Uh ahh, thats word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough!

What am I afraid of
This is what dreams are supposed to made of
The people I don't have time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same sh-t

You promised me you would never change
Oh, huh huh
Oh, huh huh
Oh, huh huh

You promised me you would never change
Oh, huh huh
Oh, huh huh

Am I wrong for making light of my situation
Clap on when 40 got something for me to snap on
Now that I'm on I dont want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on
Get my f-cking buffett on
I heard they jsut moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
That I barely know at all and
Plus this women that I mess with unprotected txt us saying she wish she woulda kept it
The one I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
I couldn't tell you where the f-ck head is
I'm holding on by a thread its like I'm high right now
The guy right now and you can tell by looking at my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we having the time of our lives right now

What am I afraid of
This is what dreams are supposed to made of
The people I don't have time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same sh-t

You promised me you would never change
Oh, huh huh
Oh, huh huh
Oh, huh huh

You promised me you would never change
Oh, huh huh
Oh, huh huh

I live by some advice this girl lissa told me
The other day lissa told me she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the 2 guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause I girl I f-cking trusted set the whole sh-t up
But a fact I have'nt seen 'em since they locked big rich up
I know, the same time, I'm quick to forget
Bout to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it al burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
Cause half the itme I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammertime
Yeah, I just need some closure, aint no turning back for me
I'm in it till it's over
