Black eyed dog he called at my door
The black eyed dog he called for more


A black eyed dog he knew my name
A black eyed dog he knew my name
A black eyed dog
A black eyed dog

I'm growing old and I wanna go home, I'm growing old and I dont wanna know
I'm growing old and I wanna go home

Black eyed dog he called at my door
The balck eyed dog he called for more
