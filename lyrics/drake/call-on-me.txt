They keep askin'
She's not sure at all, she's not
They want a woman who
I thought of how to say this, but she's not here right now


Spendin' all my days on the inside of
Forgettin' who I was on the outside of
You don't need to switch another program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
See I got too much pride for my own hood right now
Waitin' on you to give in to me, love
So I can fall through like old times

I'm tired but I invited myself
Those nights when you need someone else to hold on
But you can be the one to take control
When I get to you, already know

Call on me, call on me
Call on me, Birmingham call on me, call on me
Call on me
Call on me, call on me
Call on me
Call on me, call on me
Birmingham call on me, call on me
Call on me

Cause I'll always be there for you
Birmingham call on me
Birmingham you can call on me
Birmingham you can call on me
Birmingham you can call on me
Birmingham you can call on me
Birmingham you can call on me
Birmingham you can call on me
Birmingham as long as I'm around you can call on me
Birmingham as long as I'm around you can call on me
