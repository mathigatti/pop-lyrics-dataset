[ feat. Bun B]


[Verse 1: ~Bun B~]
Now when it come to making money I'm a printing press*
When it come to being Trill I'm a litmus test
I run it like a fitness test
And when it come to making history I'm like [? ] son
A million ways to die you already chose one
A million dollars stacked it sounds like a good beginning
We on the top now go back and tell the hook we winning
And while ya there let em know we did it just for them
I made them cough the cash up and left them just the phlegm
Is that the King of the trill go tell em yes it's him
And his testosterone is up who's got the oestrogen
I like your girl and I think she like me even more
I hit her with that heave and ho and them I'm leaving bro
The dirty South's finest and dirty south's behind us
Now that's a plus on the report card not a minus
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your lighters
You got a problem with us you know it's just as hard to find us


[Chorus: ~Drake~]
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down

[Verse 2: Bun B]
They know I'm on a Port Arthur state of mind southern superstar status
I elevate the crime
My time is money so I put some money on my time
Lightening on the Breitling so exciting when you see that shine
We on that leather [? ] before it's never even thought of
I broke my bread and fed the team just like the Holy Father
I helped the blind to see and keep it G just like I oughta
The only thing that's left for us to do is walk on water
We playing all four quarters til the clock expire
So til I see the ref waving I will not retire
My flow is still official and I still got the fire
Can't take your eyes off me, like when you watch the wire
And in '0-10 we finna go in
So let the opposition know there is no win
And I am no friend so put your hand down
Tell em stand down before it's man down

[Chorus: Drake]
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down

[Verse 3: Drake]
I gotta hundred girls on each phone
Drissy Drake man, young sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Home sick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time everyday we switching zones
Drizzy Hendrix I'm just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard nigga I'm quoting more nigga
Results are in I guess you should have voted more nigga
Swimming in the money y'all just float ashore nigga
Never drowning what the fuck you think this boat is for nigga
Yeah I'm quick to take an RnB diva out
I'll bring some friends she'll bring some friends that know what we about
And when it's done I'll put some slippers on and see them out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just trying to keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler everyday I'm riding clean
Ohhh

[Chorus: Drake]
Uhhh, since your telling on me
Tell the World bout me
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it
He would have loved it
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down.
