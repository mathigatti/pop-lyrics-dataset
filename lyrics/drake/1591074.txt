[singing:]
You can't love, but I bet ya
Yo can't hine yeah


[Verse 1:]
Here we Gooo
The 1st time aroud
I left the cars at the house
And I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go it's bout the rhymein Now
I'm seeing it clearer
The season is nearer
And still I must change
I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the most
But I'm out spoken still
They not sure it'll work
But their all hopein' He'll
Emerge the victim
My words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that u heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin before ya'll
I barely get tired
I'm rarely inspired
And you accompish in a week is What I'm daily required
I'm meetin' qoutas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova,
Be in the thrown instead of being ya own
But look

[Chorus:]
Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin on the weekend
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit bout the safeway to the verse here we go

[Verse 2:]
It's like I'm makin moves in my city tho
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin to get with tho
Important and vital
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga it's the same thing
All day long
But that's the screw face
Rappers will friend you at 1st but really they two faced
Hopein u trip and slip over your own shoe lace
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you lables can not
Play me
I'll never go broke
Fuck em I'm flashin the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh

[Verse 3:]
Look... I got few days left
And I'm a make use of every single one
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... it's always been the same
It's all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a friday
Streaks by me like I took a picture in a drive way
I roll down strips and holes down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin'
Haters will say I'm adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
19 years I been pimpin since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin I am dropin a coin in plus
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We hanin fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how we're all endin up
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up
Holla!
