[ feat. Gucci Mane, Sean Garrett:]


[Gucci Mane:]
I'm so fucking dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs
There's a diamond on my dick so there's a diamond on her tongue,
I can't feel you baby cause I romantically numb,
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,
There's nothing on the God son that I haven't done,
I got a lot of problems, getting pussy just isn't one,
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,
Man they like potato chips I just can't have one,
And I might like you for a minute,
But I don't like your friends in my business,
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,
Cause you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping,


[Chorus: ~Drake~]
Uh, uh ahhhh,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you,

Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,
I'm all star team Jordan, small forward,
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,
How how [? ] fuck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go,
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for,
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree,
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me,
Wondering if I'm the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas,
Girls wanna fuck your niggas, guy don't wanna be you,
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to,
So you can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,

[Chorus]

[Sean Garrett:]
Ain't that your girl,
Ain't that your money,
Ain't you the same nigga that say she want you that you funny,
Ain't you a gangsta, yeah funny,
You gave em funny, gave you to you, fucking dummy,
Classic line, bitches run like buses,
Gucci say niggas asking why, why you with my girl,
She let me get it nigga,
She ain't stupid, go turn up your radio,
I'm the next young Lionel Richie,
I gives a fuck about doing a fucking cameo,
We don' love em, we don' love em, we don' love em, NO!
They just love us, they just love us, cause we stack them O's
Cause we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
That's gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don't go

[Drake:]
Uh UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you!
