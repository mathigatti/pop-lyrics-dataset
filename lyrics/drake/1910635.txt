[Kanye West]
You a bad girl and your friends bad too
You got the swag sause, you dripping Swagu


[Beyonce]
I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girl you can get it
Just slow it down, just let it go
So in love.. I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every day
Cause I can feel the morning light
We like to party!

Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't escape the way I feel
Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go
So in love! I don't care what they say
I don't care if they talking tomorrow
Cause tonight I'll give you everything
Cause I can feel the morning light
We like to party!

[Andre 3000]
Sexy, 3000 degrees
I ain't worrked about them punk niggas
Over there, but they worry about me
I got a homeboy named butter and another
Homeboy named cheese. Fuck with it baby
I make it milk til it drip down your knees
Spit this shit for rillo, brain rillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just
Makes me feel old..
Never thought we could become someone else's hero
Man, we run this through the moot court?
Yesterday, that's the way, every single morning
I try to pray. Nothing else really means nothing to me
I ain't trying to be - you talking to me?
Girl why you fuckin with me? Move on
There ain't nothing to see!
Always on this song, I'm the wrong
All of them will remem.. will remem..

[Hook]
So in love.. I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every day
Cause I can feel the morning light
We like to party!

[Kanye West]
You a bad girl and your friend bad too
You got the swag sauce, you dripping Swagu..
