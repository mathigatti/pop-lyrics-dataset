Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a wednesday night
Girl I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet
Girl I'm lonely


That shit ain’t my fault girl
Cause I'm lonely
Name another woman
Ain't no other woman who should come for me
When I’m lonely
Mix the remy, little bit of henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Heard you spend your summers in miami
At somebody’s house
That you didn’t buy
You’re young so have fun girl
I hope it’s worth it
Cause fuck it I’m not here to judge
Fuck it I’m not here to love
Everything you did to ball

Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell I ring
You and I got options bae
But name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should come for me when I'm lonely
When I’m lonely
Mix the remy, little bit of henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely
This shit ain’t my fault
