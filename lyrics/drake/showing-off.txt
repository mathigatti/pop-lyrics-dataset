That's a real one, in your reflection
Without a follow, without a mention
You barely know me
What they gotta be
You talkin' to these niggas honestly
You got them rubber bands
You gotta make me dance
You got some bad friends
You got a hundred bands, you got a big advance


You ain't let the thing loose in so long
You been inside, know you like to lay low
I been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Working hard girl everything paid for
Food stamps, phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone, out gotta get them angles
With your phone out snappin' like you fabo
And you showing up, but it's alright
This is your life, yuh
