I know you’re missing me, go and admit it, girl,
‘cause everything you’re doing for you, i don’t get it, girl.
So call me up late, i know you’re with it, girl,
I get a rush from annoying, you committed, girl.
Beach fond proper, these panoramic views,
You can probably catch him in atlanta with his crew.
Plus his whole vibe with candles and a pool
‘cause he hot, but you noticed that he is in his cool.
The name is drake, girl, i came here solo,
The smell is dolce, the dralls is polo,
The dj’s future, the clothes is ransome,
The custom j map, your boy is handsome.
Pay me now, nigger, cash advance.
You don’t wanna see me throw no tantrum.
We’re blowing up this year, it’s called expansion,
Now everybody get to dancing to this.


Touch your arm and make sure that you feel mine,
But you already know what it be like,
Well dressed for the evening,
Party hard like we ain’t leaving.
Now let’s have a toast to the good life,
Go ahead and keep drinks coming all night,
Show toast to the dj, now, you play me now.

If tonight you wish this make you feel
If tonight you wish this make you feel.

I lay you some money, but he’s not employed,
She seen the video, but she don’t know my story,
Owe me green sneeks, call me g i jordan,
Not another times, so we party ‘till the morning.
A male looking up to me, he about to sneeze,
And she treated me like up in new year’s eve
Counting up the seconds until she sees me
Five, four, three, one.
One time for the woman, no wonder she make you fox,
Two times for the ladies who never use photoshop
And while the girls keep solving that up,
You got a sort of je ne sais quoi.
They need to get it french up to party-ing,
Uhm, pardon me for asking,
Anything that one of us must have is
I think i have it, poof, magic!

I’m trying to make sure that you feel right,
Girl, you already know what it be like,
Well dressed for the evening,
Party hard like we ain’t leaving.
Now let’s have a toast to the good life,
Go ahead and keep drinks coming all night,
Show toast to the dj, now, you play me now.

If tonight you wish this make you feel
If tonight you wish this make you feel.

The good life to your infatuation,
I’m more than a victim to your imagination,
When i talk is no exaggeration,
You won’t find another quite like me.
Me and my everything crew,
Everything’s big, everything’s new,
Drink’s on me, so what you wanna do?
Chill right to go ahead back to the room.
Yeah, and it’s vi for life, so if you want we can fly to the vi tonight.
Sometimes i say crew, saint jean is nice,
So just let me know which one you like.
My clients now to live it up this year,
This why i shine from my neck to my wrist wear,
We all fuck in the party like we live here,
So when everybody gone, but we’re still here.

I’m trying to make sure that you feel right,
Girl, you already know what it be like,
Well dressed for the evening,
Party hard like we ain’t leaving.
Now let’s have a toast to the good life,
Go ahead and keep drinks coming all night,
Show toast to the dj, now, you play me now.

If tonight you wish this make you feel
If tonight you wish this make you feel.
