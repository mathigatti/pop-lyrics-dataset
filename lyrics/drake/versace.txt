Versace, versace, medusa head on me like I'm 'luminati
This is a gated community
Please get the fuck off the property
That must be changin' cause I'm at the top
And ain't noone on top of me
Niggas be wantin' a verse for a verse
But man that's not a swap to me
Drownin' in compliments, pool in the backyard
That look like metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week
Man I guess I'm an optimist
Born in toronto but sometimes I feel like atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, versace, versace, we stay at the mansion
When we in miami
The pillows' versace, the sheets are versace
I just won a grammy
I been so quiet, I got the world like
"What the fuck is he planning? "
Just make sure that you got a back up plan
Cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin' september
Just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food
And my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch tv at my house
I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga
Don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo, man
This for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelin's cause business is business
Its strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it
Man that's how you lead by example
Versace, versace, versace, versace, versace, versace
Word to new york cause the dykeman and heights girls
Are callin' me "papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out with me
No paparazzi
I'm tryna give halle berry a baby and no one can stop me


Versace, versace, versace, versace
Versace, versace, versace, versace
Versace, versace versace, versace versace
Versace, versace versace, versace versace

Versace, versace, medusa head on me like I'm 'luminati
I know that you like it, versace
My neck and my wrist is so sloppy
Versace, versace, I love it, versace the top of my audi
My plug, he john gotti, he give me the dozen
I know that they're mighty
Shoes and shirt versace, your bitch want in on my pockets
She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch "versace"
Cheetah print on my sleeve
But I ain't ever been in the jungle
Try to take my sack, better run with it, nigga don't fumble

Versace, versace, versace, versace
Versace, versace, versace, versace
Versace, versace versace, versace versace
Versace, versace versace, versace versace

You can do truey, I do it versace
You copped the honda, I copped the mazi
You smoke the mid, I smoke exotic
I set the trend, you niggas copy
Kick in the door like I work at hibachi
Look at the watch, blow it, hot like some taki
Come in my room, my sheet versace
Go to sleep, I dream versace
Medusa, medusa, medusa

Versace, versace, versace, versace
Versace, versace, versace, versace
Versace, versace versace, versace versace
Versace, versace versace, versace versace
