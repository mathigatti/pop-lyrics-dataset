[Chorus:]
I'm still fly (Yea) I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try and cut my wings (Uh)
I'm still pullin out the phantom
And these haters can't stand him (That's me singin by the way... in case you didint know)
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high (Yea some new shit... new shit I'm on)
And I dare anybody to try and cut my wings (I promise I got em)
I'm still shuttin coities down (Look) everytime I come around
Nigga I'm still doin my thing (Here I go) I'm still...


[Verse:]
Responsible for everything you're listenin to
I mediocre talent proceed to try and conditon you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to
Started poppin bottles cause it's ATL tradition to
Celebrate it [? ] of Soho
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin and these bitches wanna snow blow
They just give me head while the haters give me promo
And man my DJ shoulda won that
[? ] and respect man the city owe us one back
All these old hens keep they minds on one track
And me I run Toronto holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Neego party with Azuka
Shout goes out to Wonder shout goes out Future
Shout goes out to Teddy motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch jus can't seem to hold it steady
Cause I see the flame flickerin ex girls bickerin
Got these women jockin me from Heart Lake road to Pickering
I tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'll take a minute if you're listenin
Please start doin you I been doin me
And I'm a staple In my city you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotinal critics be reviewin me
But I got love for everybody even if you're suin me
My brother P Ray knows we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin at you pussy niggas all I see is rainbows
Hoppin on a jet to every single little wayne show
Me and little jazzy please do not harass me jus holla if you got me
And fuck you if you had me Shout goes out to Brian E
Shout out to photo Will shout out to Oliver and 40 man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem shout out to P plus The names I mention are crucial
You're gonna need us And life is good everything is just fine

(mumbles)
Yea Haha I swear I really fuckin does it I have these niggas trippin no luggage I'm still

[Chorus:]
I'm still fly I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin out the phantom
And these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high (Yea)
And I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
