When I pull up on a hater watch a hater fall back
I'm too good with these hands, watch a hater fall flat
If I die, all I know I'm a motherfuckin legend
It's so great for my city, I'm the realest one that's rapping


Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
When they lay me down the rest, I know I was always rapping
Oh my God, my whole life, my words been my greatest weapon
I know I. I know I, been the cos greatest blessing

They don't recognize a king when he rapping with you
You always suck, its like you always bring a vacuum with you
Solid like a man and keep it chiem plastic is you
Cause if you got a bone a pick i got imagination

Talking about me then it gotta be lies
Cause I never get a tag or a chance to reply
If you don't got the courage to mention me
Then you can fuck yourself with your phone until the battery dies
I mean you're mad at me why? Cause I had to be fly
Two albums in a year and I can't even try
tried to fill my shoes then you had to resize
I'm the king, I'm the throne, bitch it's where i reside

When I pull up on a hater watch a hater fall back
I'm too good with these hands, watch a hater fall flat
If I die, all I know I'm a motherfuckin legend
It's so great for my city, I'm the realest one that's rapping

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
When they lay me down the rest, I know I was always rapping
Oh my God, my whole life, my words been my greatest weapon
I know I. I know I, been the cos greatest blessing
