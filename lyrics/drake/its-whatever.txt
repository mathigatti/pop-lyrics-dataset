It’s whatever.
Just like the bird that sung in the trees
Here in the leaves, i’m so happy.
You’re my tree and through the storms
You stood strong with me, kept me warm as can be.
Like a candy to an apple, we go together,
You’re so sweet on me.
I can say that i do believe this is destiny,
It keeps close to me.


Now it’s me and you, you and me,
And it’s whatever, whatever you want it to be.
I’m telling you, if it’s up to me,
Whatever is whatever,
It’s whatever with you and me.

Just like a breeze in the middle of a summer’s eve
You come through, you comfort me.
And for my drink you’re my lemon squeeze,
Oh, you got flavor, you go good with me.
So boy, don’t play or tease me,
We can be together, you got what i need.
Now it’s getting late, it’s after three,
So just don’t leave, my body’s caught on you.

Now it’s me and you, you and me,
And it’s whatever, whatever you want it to be.
I’m telling you, if it’s up to me,
Whatever is whatever,
It’s whatever with you and me.

Whatever is whatever,
It’s your world and i want everything.
It’s your world, your world.
Me and you, you and me
And it’s whatever you want it to be
I’m telling you, if it’s up to me,
Whatever is whatever, whatever is whatever.
