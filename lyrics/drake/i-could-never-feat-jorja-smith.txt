Oh
Yeah


Everybody said that you let me down
Hesitation bring the "you" around
Makes no difference what you used to do

I can never be ashamed of you
I could never
I could never

Maybe you were reckless yesterday
I'm convinced you know a better way, I know it
Some would judge based
On what you've been through but

I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I, I could never (yeah, yeah)

You've told me things
Harsh truth to my face like
Been told to walk away (just know)
I could never
Things that I would choose
To do with you if I had time though
Thousand times I fucked you in my mind
Trust me, I know

Everybody said that I let you down
And let the truth but I can still be found, yeah
Lost my way and only you were there

Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Could you ever, yeah
Could you ever

Sometimes I ask how you could ever want me
How could you choose that you would ever love me
Yours were the truest eyes I'd ever seen
To be in a stare right back at me

Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah
Could you ever
Could you ever
Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah
Could you ever

Why can't you ever
