Girl, I hate the fast talking, fast walking, fast fucking, fast loving oh
Wanna move slow
Got a little liquor in my system, always been friends underestimating how far that that shit go
Leave a little room for me
Leave a little room for your imagination
You should just take time with me
Nowadays there's time but not anticipation


Oh oh oh
What is?
What is? What is? What is different about me? Oh
Tell me. What is? What is?
Can't keep you off of me

Nowadays you can't get enough of me
Loving me, loving me, loving me more
You loving me, love when you loving me
Oh yeah, yeah

What is?
What is? What is? What is different about me? Oh
Tell me. What is? What is?
Can't keep you off of me

Nowadays you can't get enought of me
Loving me, loving me, loving me more
You loving me, love when you loving me...
Oh yeah yeah
