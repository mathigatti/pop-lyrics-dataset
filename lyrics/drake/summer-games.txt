I think you're changing your mind
Starting to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise and now
I'd rather know ahead of time
You said I love you too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started and we're already done


Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see you liking someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to ending up with someone just like
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusing me
Don't have me wasting my time
Yeah, you said I love you too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started and we're already done
I kept you decent, I kept you sane
I kept it peaceful don't lie
I kept it decent, even the secrets
Kept it between you and I
Breaking my heart, tearing me apart
Breaking me down when I'm already out
Breaking my heart– breaking my heart– breaking my heart
Breaking my heart– breaking my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea
Breaking my heart, tearing me apart
Breaking me down when I'm already down
Breaking my heart– breaking my heart– breaking my heart
Breaking my heart– breaking my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea

You said I love you too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started and we're already done
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusing me
Don't have me wasting my time
You said I love you too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started and we're already done
