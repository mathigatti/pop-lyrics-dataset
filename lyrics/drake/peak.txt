Treat you like princess, rest in heaven Diana
Piquing my interest, she got peak like Montana
England breeds proper girls
Where all your good manners?
Reply with pleasantries
Honestly, I can’t stand ya


Ohh, ohh
You got’ make me turn up on you
Ohh, ohh
You got’ make me turn up on you

What you thought of me
Never had me missing a beat
That’s just a view from a cheap seat
They don’t want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap, nowadays it’s free
People only as tough as they phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I’m about to say my peace
You might not agree with me

Ohh, ohh
You got’ make me turn up on you
Ohh, ohh
You got’ make me turn up on you
