It may not mean nothing to yall
Understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting sh-t down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man


[Drake]
Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy aint nothing to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, Kimo
Drop the mixtape that sh-t sounded like an album
Whod have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcom
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah n-gga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgivness
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness
B-tches

It may not mean nothing to yall
Understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting sh-t down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man

[Kanye West]
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame, big chains
I stuck my d-ck inside this life until that b-tch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Yall seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a n-gga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin
Now superbad chicks giving me macLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband
You would think these n-ggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you f-cking wasn't
You're such a f-cking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back

It may not mean nothing to yall
Understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting sh-t down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man

[Lil Wayne]
Ok, hello it's da martian
Space jam Jordans
I want this sh-t forever wake up and smell the Garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is like a f-cking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last

It may not mean nothing to yall
Understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting sh-t down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man

[Eminem]
There they go, back in stadiums
As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia they go so balistic yo
We can make them look like bosos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
F-ck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He aint had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinnochio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This sh-t is exactly what the f-ck I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villians
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin
And spit true feelings, til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it
Payback muthaf-cka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm hannibal lecter so just in case your thinking of saving face
You aint gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake

It may not mean nothing to yall
Understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting sh-t down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
