Lets go,
Well alright, well alright,
Look,


Uh, feeling sorry for the runner up,
I'm still awake getting money while the sun is up,
and they keep saying how they need me to deliver
cos they hate it when the rookie star doesn't put the numbers up,
Man, hate is so parse, catch me anytime for a suit on draft day,
n-gga and it's just me and my money,
ya don't even get to play when ya'll leading by 20,
yeah I infiltrated the game,
i was hesitant at first and fear what it would change,
now I'm high off the success and faded off of the fame,
and still managed to keep all of my opinions the same,
I am so far gone b-tch Im outta here,

hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear,
I want it all man, I never learned how to share,
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires,
wow, I swear Im killing sh-t Im killing sh-t,
shout out to my n-ggas I just made a couple million with,
yeah from the beginning to the end,
know I'm into making history not into making friends,
muthaf-ckerâ€¦.
