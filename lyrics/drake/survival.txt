I been waitin' on this yeah
All of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces
But there's more in my possession
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love?
Well, that's sure to be in question
My mount rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a---


I've had real philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the gold and talk about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content
That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked

I am a cream of the crop, nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my mollies pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I'll tee with the stars and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to---
Man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
Rip my niggas that they caught without it

This just a intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like bernie mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie, it severed itself
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
