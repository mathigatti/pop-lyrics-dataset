Yeah, yeah


Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (a lifestyle)
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (do not make it)
Got so many chains, they call me Chaining Tatum (they do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started

Man, you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl, you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl, let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me

[Jay-Z]
They still out to get me, they don't get it
I cannot be got and that's a given

[Kanye West &amp; Jay-Z]
They like: Pablo-
Why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?
Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?
Fuck if I know
That's that Chicago (ayy)
South, south side, that's the motto (ayy)
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel
'Cause I know

We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, ayy
Throne is back up in it, ayy
In the field like Emmitt, ayy
Y'all get so offended, ayy
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'ma let you finish
But I, I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki (perfect!)
