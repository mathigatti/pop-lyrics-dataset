[PARTYNEXTDOOR]
True, you're a star in my head
You, got need to raise war with my friends
True you're so bad we don't need to pretend
But I don't want war with you or my friends


You're my bestfriend
You're my bestfriend
This the truth but we can party, yeah, yeah
Because true, you're my bestfriend

What are we 'round, I'm loyal
I got money on me and I'm loyal
I got money in my pocket, I'm loyal, ooh
Pain goes away when I'm tipsy
Pain goes away when you're with me (me)
Even when you're sure 'bout this, I'ma risk it
It's harder to control, oh woah

Shawty just don't let this go (just don't let this go)
We spent the last three summers on the road (spent the summer on the road)
Praying girl that we runnin' in any war
I just don't want any war (no war)
(No one else) But you

[Drake and PARTYNEXTDOOR]
