Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are getting intense now
I hear you talking bout we a lot, oh, you speak french now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like do you wanna hang right now?
On the east side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2am and that's asking a lot of you right now


All she talking bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

I been up for two whole days thinking what I did to keep you going
Thumbing through the voicemails that you left me telling me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no, yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't, yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

Swear these days all you say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

Why you gotta start girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standing in the field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questioning what you get out the deal
Doing things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm coming home
That way you can be prepared, maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place and how it's decorated
This thing is getting one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now

All she talking bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
