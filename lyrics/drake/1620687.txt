[drake: talking]
Uh, yea, get in my slick rick mode
N'a mean?, im a tell ya a story real quick


[verse 1: drake]
Look,
She got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus i just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would i still be witout my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Dont know if she feeling me or she be feelin what i buy her
And purses are light now
She use em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And im a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallets thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so im winnin every race that i enter and she a

[chorus:]
Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
Im in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldnt call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same

And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So i wrote you a song
Cuz i cant stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[verse 2: drake]
You're all the same
Look at vida guerrera
Theres no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet shes out meetin directors instead
And frustratrated cuz shes already been addressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and i'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl theres things to do
Other than jail time
Look this aint a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in effect he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man i wont back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you aint thandie newton, and this aint crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this aint last year
Look, i got a message, i'll say it
I got some beats still
Regina hall and garcelle and alice neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, dont be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not
My cousin who cant speak know the lyrics to tip drill

[chorus:]
Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
Im in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldnt call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So i wrote you a song
Cuz i cant stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[drake: speaking]
And i aint trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
Say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
Accept the fact that theres times that you gotta better yourself
You know as a person man. i love to see my black women strong, single,
Independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
Video you n'a mean? its a wonderful thing baby. so uh, dont hate me for
This one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? cuz its like uh,
If she beautiful and honey dances
And you always downtown making money transfers
And anything the color of braces she get excited
She always showing up at these places she get invited
She a video girl
