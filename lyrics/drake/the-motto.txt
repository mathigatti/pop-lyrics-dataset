I'm the fu---in man, you don't get it do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go uptown, new york city, b--ch
Some spanish girls love me
Like I'm on aventura
Tell uncle luke I'm out in miami too
Clubbing hard, f---ing women, ain't much to do


Wrist bling, got a condo up in biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't sh-t changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
Twenty five sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace mac dre, Imma do it for the bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holla wen ever that stop
My team good, they don't really need a mascot

I tell tune, light one, pass it like a relay
Ymcmb, you niggas, more ymca
Me, freddie, marley marl at the cribbo
Shout goes out to niko, jay and chubbo, shout to gibo
We got santa margarita by the liter
She know even if I'm fu--in with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel man?
That's really how you feel?
Cuz the pimping ice cold, all these b--ches wanna chill
I mean, maybe she won't
Then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal
Real ni--a, what's up?

(Drake - Hook)
Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once, that's the motto, ni--a yolo
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sitting on the bench, ni--a we don't really play
Every day, every day, f--k what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way
Real ni--a, what's up?

(Lil Wayne)
One, time f--k one time
I'm calling ni--as out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her p-ssy so I swam to her butt
It's eastside, we in this bi--h
Wish a ni--a would like a tree in this b--ch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that b--ch
That's my mo add a b to that sh-t

I'm f--ked up, torn down
I'm twisted, door knob
Talk stupid, off with your head
Ni--a money talks, I'm mr ed
I'm so young money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't sh-t sweet, n...s in the streets like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet, water gun
Oh my god, becky, look at her butt! tunechi

Like we sitting on the bench, ni--a we don't really play
Every day, every day, f--k what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way
Real ni--a, what's up?

(Tyga)
T raw skinny nigga big balls
Fuck around get dragged rupal
You funny little nigga duval
Out of this world total re call
Tell a bitch rah dig let her see saw
Sought of like donkey like an ass nigga, hee haw
Ha, run round in the 'rarri with the top off
While you in the window, man I'm probably on my next car
Aight, mighty dook with the ice on
Real l.a nigga truck with the gun drawn
Drawing on your face you're a clown jack in the box
Boy that's your bop, she my new poom poom star,
Stars in the back,
Then homies they don't act, acting brand new
Fuck her never call her back
Matt forte got the bitch, running back
Damn, that's the motto you don't know it's like that
