We bobbin to the music this is how we do it(all night)
Breezin down the freeway just me and my baby(in our ride)
Just me and my boss no worries at all
Listening to Aston Martin Music Music

Would have came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know(ugh but here goes nothin)

[Rick Ross]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the walls
Automatic weapons on the floor but who can you call
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
Lot of quiet time, pink bottles of Rose
Exotic red bottoms, so-bodied glittered in gold
Following fundamentals I'm following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow is on the menu
And money triple up when you get it out of state
Need a new safe cause I'm runnin out of space
Now I'm Roy Jetson I'm somewhere out of space
In my two-seater she the one that I would take

Would have came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know(ugh well here goes nothin)

[Rick Ross]
Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC DBS is in the watch
Livin fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front you take it there ain't no comin back
Top down right here is where she want to be
That's why golds unfold right in front of me
Eveytime we fuck her soul take ahold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controllin me
That thang keep callin
Fuck maintain boy I gotta keep ballin
Pink bottles keep comin
James Bond coup pop clutch 100
