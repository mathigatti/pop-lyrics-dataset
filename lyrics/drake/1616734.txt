Tell me, could it be the last time
And tell me, is it that i love you
I'll carry on and walk another way
Tell me how
Say why can't you find the right words
Is it that you're feelin' unsure
I see it through
And walk another way
Tell me how can i hide away


Baby you know
You know what i am feelin'
I can't bear it anymore
You know how i have tried
Just don't know what good it's for
It's so easy to see what's on you mind
Baby you know - the truth is hard to find

Tell me that i'll be without you
Where coldness stands against believing
The world moves on
Will show another way
Tells me how i can hide away

Baby you know ...
