[Drake]
uhh, this verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
and ya Gods fall down from a rifle to the heart
like clap clap, let em fall slow
I know you had you fears you can let them all go
and most women are motivated so I act accordingly
but this is so refreshing that it means a little more
to me
dedicating time when I really can?t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
couple stars, couple texts, couple dates
couple ?I think that we?re ready?s?, couple ?I think
we should wait?s?
couple I think that (?) couple I think we should wait
are we acting like a couple, I?m just trying to get it
straight
cause I?m over here convinced that it?s too early for
mistakes
[Jhene Aiko - Chorus]
You had to change up the game
oh the weather is not the same
now there?s only cloudy days
I cant stand the rain in July
oh July
There were fireworks exploding (exploding)
but now it?s getting colder
the leafs are turning colours
why, it?s just not our season
the one and only reason
baby oh baby oh
when summer turn into fall
[Drake - Verse 2]
Damn, where did all the magic go
I follow all the rules and told you everything you had
to know
had you over every night, every night was passion
plus you met my mother even though it was an accident
I?m confused tell me where we go wrong
I wish shorty I would be with you so long
I was planning on being something worth mentioning


energy invested in someone I saw potential in
who killed Chivalry they need to get their sentencing
meanwhile we argue and I can?t get a sentence in
and just as I predicted here we go again
they always say the hottest love has the coldest end
[Chorus]
[Jhene Aiko]
see its funny cause I never thought this would end but
then the season changed
[Drake]
You are my, you are my, you are my girl (I was your
girl)
shoulda made, shoulda made, shoulda made you my World
shoulda made you everything to make you happy baby
[Jhene Aiko]
can?t wait for, can?t wait for, can?t wait for
springtime
and I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
and I?m too fly for the sh-t
ohhh, I am Japanese if you please
[End]
