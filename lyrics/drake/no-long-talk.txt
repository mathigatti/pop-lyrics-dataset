Yeah

(Murda on tha beat so it's not nice)


That's Baka, he's a no long talka
Quick to let a motherfucking TEC slam
We don't need to hear about a next man
Youts talk down, then they get ran
Left them, get dipped from the whole ends
If Gilla call shots, no questions
G-Way 'til I'm resting
But we still got love for the West End
If it's a chit chat ting, better talk nice
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Skull gets hot, then I'm not nice
You tryna date her and she been, let me wop twice
Now you man are on a diss ting
Just know man like Chubbs
He's a fixer if I ever gotta fix tings
Just know man like Fifth, he’s a sickas, you get tammed he don’t miss tings
Just know man like me, I'm a Sixer and I oversee the whole thing
Yeah I pree the whole thing
Yeah I pree the whole thing
Prem gotta the hurt tucked, can't see the whole thing
Niggas wanna talk splits, nah we need the whole thing

Man gets duppied when we touch a button
Man catch suckers and we're touching somethin'
Man gets stuck in, yeah we're stuckin' somethin'
Man gets rappin' when we're sucking somethin'
Man gets battered with a crutch or somethin'
Man back batti then we're bucking somethin'
If man child play then we Chucky somethin'
If man start throwing then we're chucking somethin'
I'm on the best side, got the TEC lined in the whip
On the left side, on a death ride
MAC-10 and the spesh flies and the TEC slide
Nutty shit like somethin' just climbed out the X-Files
Textbook, like it's old school, like in textiles
Lighty, looking healthy and she gets smiles
Home time, grab a quick drink and she gets wild
Sexy, and I rate that and her sex style
Fuckin' somethin', yeah nigga, fuckin' somethin'
Back bent, pussy, yeah I'm fuckin' somethin'
Cognac, better grab a cup of somethin'
Glue pussy like a nigga stuck or somethin', stuck or somethin'
Like a nigga stuck or somethin'
So the monster is like a truck or somethin'
Spread the pussy out, I'm 'bout to butter somethin'
Man gone Hollywood, it's like I'm Buck or somethin'

Ya dun kno
It's Hollowman Giggs
Right now just here with the big man Drizzy
You get me?
More Life flex, you dun know
OVO and SM1 to the world
