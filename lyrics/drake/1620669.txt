Ladies and gentalmen.
We are now broadcastin live from london england


Back then it was me plus you, we us two did ever single thing that we must do,
You trust me me trust you, plus there's noone else that I see just you
Now adays I'm riding on the banwagon driver of a porche caiyan wagon,
Ice in the necklace light skinned and hectic and all these simple things got a man braggin
And bostin a little never drank much in the past but now they got the kid toastin a little
So cheers to the fact you here in the track you shoulda been shotgun his career in the back
And his two month lease expires right now knew I shoulda got me a truck with two front seats I assume it's
Done I'm lookin at my passenger side I realize that there's room for one oh

[Chorus:]
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go,
Cus I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me,
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go,
I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me,
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back

Now adays you be all cried out no more tears no more plains cus you all flyed out
Need the lord in your life on a sunday no more fashion nomore spendin your life on the runway
Deal with it you hardley can all this hype around drake whatever happend to aubrey graham
Well it's her hes needin you gotta say leave in the word but I know leavin has crossed your mind
You jealous of some autographs I often sign I try to make it to dinner never often time
But I often find myself hearin your voice you said you never fealt a touch soft as mine
I was sayin how the range and the loft is mine had to change in the planes and the porche is mine
It's a deal I was forced to sign but I never imagined that youd end up fourth in line no

[Chorus:]
Shes got a feelin lonely (feelin lonely)
Like she don't even know me (don't even know me)
I thought that she would be the one for me but now I see that
If I could turn back the hands of time she would be mine,
Your on my mind girl let's rewind it back

Look this for that girl that you use to see for anybody that want it how it use
To be all the love afection and all the cash I wanna rewind but we movin forward fast

[Chorus:]
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go,
Cus I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me,
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go,
I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me,
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back

And I adore all the pictures that everyone in the media is dyin for
Back when there was one camera to smile for
There was only couple things I could buy you compared to now where I'm kinda like heres a thou
Drop grands thru appear in style but I could still be chillin in sweat pants and a stainless ring
Without you I havnt gained a thing oh

[Chorus:]
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go,
Cus I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me,
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go,
I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me,
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
