You know a lotta girls be
Thinkin my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This ones for you


Baby you my everything you all i ever wanted.
We can do it real big.
Bigger then you ever done it.
You be up on everything.
Other h**s ain't never on it.
I want this forever, i swear i can spend whatever on it.

Cause she hold me down everytime i hit her up.
When i get right i promise that we gon live it up.
She make me beg for it till she give it up.
And i say the same thing every single time.

I say you the you the best.
You the you the best.
You the you the best.
You the you the best.
You the best i ever had.
Best i ever had.
Best i ever had.
Best i ever had.
I say you the you.

Know you got a roommate
Call me when its no one there
Put the key under the mat
And you know i'll be over there
(yup) i'll be over there
Shawty, i'll be over there
I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there
Ha. and you ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustom to the fast life
Have a n**** thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chilling with no make up on
Thats when your the prettiest
I hope that you don take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along
You know that i'm working i'll be there soon as i make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one to never get confused with cause.

Baby you my everything you all i ever wanted.
We can do it real big.
Bigger then you ever done it.
You be up on everything.
Other h**s ain't never on it.
I want this forever, i swear i can spend whatever on it.

Cause she hold me down everytime i hit her up.
When i get right i promise that we gon live it up.
She make me beg for it till she give it up.
And i say the same thing every single time.

I say you the you the best.
You the you the best.
You the you the best.
You the you the best.
You the best i ever had.
Best i ever had.
Best i ever had.
Best i ever had.
I say you the you.

Sex, love, pain
Baby i be on that tank s***
Buzz so big i could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop
B****es will buy it for the picture
And n****s will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl
But money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee
Cause i be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but i can make yo p**** whistle
Like the andy griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love
You the one i lean on
Feeling for a fix then you should really get yo pheen on
Yea just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back
And make yo f***ing bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the n****hit the jackpots

Baby you my everything you all i ever wanted.
We can do it real big.
Bigger then you ever done it.
You be up on everything.
Other h**s ain't never on it.

You the you the best.
You the you the best.
You the you the best.
You the best i ever had.
Best i ever had.
Best i ever had.
Best i ever had.
I say you the you the best
You the you the best.
You the you the best.
