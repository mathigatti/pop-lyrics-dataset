Boomin' out in south gwinnett like lou will
6 Man like lou will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm
Like I'm lou will, I just got the new deal
I am in the matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, just save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit


Like soulja, I thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like macgyver, I'm michael meyers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift

Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift
Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing
I'm old, you gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll

I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, this not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go demarcus cousins out in public
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for cnn
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift

Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift
If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or

What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me
