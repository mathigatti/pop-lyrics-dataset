I swear to Lord, same dudes use to laugh at me
See me in the CL6 with half a bead
They know that money begets money so naturally,
Me, I have to blow a couple stacks, hassle free
I'm like fuck ya'll haters on behalf of me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talkin me and two partners in that caprice
With no copies made, I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash, and c.r.e.a.m
Commode you rappers like plasticine
I have the dream, but dawg, me and success are two things you don't wanna find yo ass between
Back against the wall like plasma screens
The inside of my wallet is pastured green
And you are now hangin with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave earth, nothin left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and every night is New Years
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm comin with two spears
I'm tellin you dawg, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up makin executive calls
And with me, women be bulidin these skeptical walls
But once you've slept with one dime, man you've slept with 'em all
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression, it's forever blue
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin, stop actin like teen girls are my only market
I parallel to fly and spurk, Tony Barket
And it's cool if you spill something, it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior color only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin today, then you ain't makin records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm givin away, you feel me?
