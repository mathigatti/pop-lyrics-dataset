It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness (Mmm)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Yeah)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Dubplate special)
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness (OVO, BBK)
Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish
You don't know me, you better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie
On cloud 9, a man's extra cosy
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie
OVO, man's so unruly
South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy
Front row, jacket tailor-made
Crackhead swag with the razor blade
Red umbrella when I make it rain
My whole team winning, we don't play your game
Sound like me but they ain't the same
See them online tryna fake the fame
They wanna bust jokes, they think I'm Damon Wayans
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness (More Life)
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish (OVO, BBK)
Check my account, that's a madness (dubplate)
Check my account, that's a madness (street team)
Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish
You're nothing like me, I'm a fucking villain
Go against me, that's a tough decision
Police wish I was stuck in prison
Fish eye lens on my tunnel vision
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
So don't forget to remember me
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you telling me?
Taliban, Halloween
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine
Bust my dance at the cash machine
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream
Now it's my world, you can have the scene
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness
Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish
