These things'll fall down but you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
I know you're trying to help me


Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout taking my lane
They ain't even got on the road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit getting run through
Never chase and let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah

These things'll fall down but you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
I know, I know

And more tune for your headtop, so watch how you speak on my name, you know?
