Love is such a bloody holiday
It seems that every time that I give my heart away
It comes back to me
A little worse for wear
And who I give it to doesn't even care


I could stop myself from loving you
Ask myself what good would it do
I'd only find someone else to love me who
May as well be you

Love is such a bloody holiday
It seems that every time that I give my heart away
It comes back to me
A little worse for wear
And who I give it to doesn't even care

If I'd ever loved anyone again
Wonder what would become of me then
Love leaves my heart behind and then
Here it comes again

Love is such a bloody holiday
It seems that every time that I give my heart away
It comes back to me
A little worse for wear
And who I give it to doesn't even care

Love is such a bloody holiday
It seems that every time that I give my heart away
It comes back to me
A little worse for wear
And who I give it to doesn't even care

Love is such a bloody holiday
It seems that every time that I give my heart away
It comes back to me
A little worse for wear
And who I give it to doesn't even care
