[Drake] (Chorus)
This sh-t was all I know
You and me only
And I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out


Uhh, but I guess things change
Its funny how someone else's success brings pain
When ya no longer involved that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby
Say something baby
I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby
Say something baby

Uhh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement
To a condo downtown because its all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me

We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40-/40 getting b-tches tipsy
Killing sh-t the ever so talented Mr Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cos whats a star when its most important fan is missing?
