Goddamn
For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look


Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' on crushed leaves
They turn they back on everything we built then they must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home, the white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heat waves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shortie really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep, dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meeks like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurie to MacKenzie, when the city's empty
Yeah, early twenties but I want fifties, hunnids, not pennies
I need plenty, got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down and break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'

Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin', yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

Yeah, look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions, pyramid scheme just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, etcetera
Inspired by a few but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
Always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East attention
And out of Pine Hill funeral center
A spot we got no business enterin'
Back when Gil Scott was the apple of my afrocentric
Aight, I had to find a way to get someone's attention

Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin', yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

Now we rollin'
