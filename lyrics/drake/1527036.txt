It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see ya picture

One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'ma sip this drank until that mothafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

I don't give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow
But I do it to her

Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

Ayy, yeah
I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know
I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like, like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone
