Junior high played them
High school played them
College well, you know… played them
me and my friends use to laugh about it, how we fade'em
now cupid is aiming his arrow right there at me
no more nonchalence can I be, with you here starring at me
with the most beautiful eyes that a n*gga ever seen
you pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
you got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries.

For the first time Im in love,
and I wanna tell everybody
and I wanna tell everybody (what i'm feeling)
For the first time I feel love
and I wanna tell everybody
and I wanna tell everybody the feel…

Drizzy… Drake.

All them men before me did shit I would never do
and I know you got your guards up, but they should let him through
just keep fightin' for our lovin' baby, I'll defend it too
and if they try and tell me time is money I'd spend it with you
I spend it all
I spend it all
I charge forever, to my card
and pay it off, no interest lost
I be right here, and like your favorite wine girl,
I'm worth trying, but take it easy on me
cuz this my first time

Now baby, baaaby
You doin' things with my heart ain't never felt, it's so crazy
(?) if you gonna let it change me, I was so mistaken
your love like a billy coupe, took me out of a mercedes
Now baby, baaby
For so long I miss somebody
my heart just couldn't (?)
I went from not wanting a girlfriend to needing ya lady
I didn't think I'd ever see
me callin' to you, you voice before, got to sleep

I ain't never looked into a womans eye worth of fire
bet I'm feelin while you holdin' me begging to take you higher
for so long I wasn't faded, I couldn't admitted before
but now I see what life's about, and i'm never goin' let you go
girl I'm growin'(don't wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable)
I see us growing (? don't wanna miss out on a feeling I never had before)

Two hearts, I use to say
might make a great movie to watch on a late night
but for me it ain't the way
but baby thanks to you (I changed)
