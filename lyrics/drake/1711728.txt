[Gucci Mane:]
I'm so fucking dumb I wrote "diamonds" on my thumbs,
It's a diamond on my dick so that's a diamond on her tongue,
I can't feel you baby 'cause I'm romantically numb,
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,
There's nothing on the God's sun that I haven't done,
I got a lot of problems gettin pussy just isn't one,
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,
Now they like potato chips I just cannot have one,
And I might like you for a minute,
But I don't like your friends in my business,
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,
Cause you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping,


[Chorus]
Uh uhhhhhhh,
I know you say you love me girl,
I know you say you love me girl,
Problem is you prolly tell that shit to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you,

[Drake:]
Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,
I'm all-star team Jordan, small forward,
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,
How, How? Fuck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go,
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for,
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jae and Mack agree,
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me,
Wondering if I'm the best, Will I. Am, no Black Eyed Peas,
Girls wanna fuck ya niggas, guy don't wanna be you,
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,
I feel like I'll find a wife exactly when I need to,
You can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,

[Chorus]
Uh uhhhhhhh,
I know you say you love me girl,
I know you say you love me girl,
Problem is you prolly tell that shit to everybody,
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you
