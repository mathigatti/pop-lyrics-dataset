I've got it made that's what I'm talking about
Goin down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Goin down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can riiiide


Check
I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school
Backpack grey range black Ac'
Coulda had the stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance
Fresh jakes new pants
Back but fuck bitches get money was the new chat
It started out a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
