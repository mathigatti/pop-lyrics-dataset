Yeah
(I'm workin' on dyin')


I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep try'na get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoe

Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991

Outta town
People love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

I'm upset
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
You try'na check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess

So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like Iâ€™m possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex

SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead?
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoe

Every month
She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

I'm upset
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC

But I'm blessed, I just checked
Hate me, never met me in the flesh
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoe
