Yeah
(We got London On Da Track)


[Drake]
This is all God's doin', man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinkin' like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only 29, have some patience with us
Plus, I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga, yeah

Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts
'Cause she know that we at war, yeah

[Drake &amp; 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position (yah)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (21)
Make me call my bro (21, uh)

[21 Savage]
Baby, I'm a savage, I ain't romantic
When I come around, these rapper niggas start to panic
And they pockets goin' under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstandin'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now (hatin' now)
She was playing with me then but she waitin' now (21, 21)
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now (mansion)
I was fighting' niggas then but I'm sprayin' now (blasting)
I-I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss (nope)
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch (broke)
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit (21)
They the type to stand in line for some free shit (broke bitch)
Baby girl gon' suck it till her jaws locked (suck it up)
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block (fuckin' up)
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin' (21)
We the one droppin' niggas, we the ones (we the ones)
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come (21, 21)
You that nigga snitchin' on your people, huh? (shh)
21 Savage A.K.A. the Reaper, huh (21)
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin', huh (ya dig?)

[Drake &amp; 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (shut the fuck up)
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end (count the fuck up)
Make me call my bros for assistance (21)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (bros)
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (hol' up)
Put me in a fucked-up position (21)
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro - don't

[Drake]
I don't need love, I'm the GOAT, I just hit the beat and float
And I'm sellin' out arenas but you puttin' on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
'Cause if I don't share the wealth, then how the fuck we supposed to grow?
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need
Chain smokin' in the house, it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my Ts with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the TL, now I'm cheese
I'mma turn this TSX into a Benz soon
I'mma see a lot of blessin's for my friends soon
150-inch screen in my bedroom
6'1 " , man, a nigga need some leg room

Shit ain't been the same like before
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts
'Cause she know that we at war, yeah

Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
