[Kevin Cossom - Chorus]
I get money,
I get paper,
I get girls all different flavors,
I buy gucci, I buy prada,
I spend dolla after dolla [x2]

[Drake]
Y'all don't really like me,
I can understand,
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket of my pants,
I still fly, you can't float,
Run this shit, Usain Bolt,
I write your favorite records all you sing ghost,
20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote,
I'm getting rich while you stayin broke,
Chillin even if I'm in a goose down coat,
I cant see you through a Mosley Tribes
So i don't even flinch when you throw me high fives,
They try to measure up but there is no one my size,
Whatever 40 smoking about to lower my eyes,
Beast mode on em, I never take a night off,
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off,
Grounded as the runway pavement I take the flight off,
Baby go ahead and cut the light off,

[Chorus]

[Kevin Cossom]
I'm the rookie of the year (year)
About to get my dough on,
I'm about to take off, baby you should hold on,
But I ain't about to prolong,
Imma keep it short and tell you whats about to go on,
Bottle after bottle cos the money like so long,
Baby.. we about to put a show on,
Imma show off, like I'm supposed to,
Yeah you can get lost, i don't know you,

[Drake]
I hear my phone ringing when you call,
I ain't picking up an' entertaining them at all,
Got your girl face down banging on the wall,
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm, hmm, hmmm,
I cannot relate,
Riding with some tags that i got from outta state,
Riding with a swag that I got from outta space,
Just show me who's the hottest Imma knock em outta place,
Call me homicide drizzy about to kill your ego,
I'm about my green puffing guddi like I'm Cee-Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero,
While a Houston stripper pole dance in a Z-ro
Fantasy to you, reality to me,
And my g-pass is as valid as can be,
I'm, I'm so fresh the stylist would agree,
Waving at your girl while she smiling back at me

[Chorus]

[Kevin Cossom]
Louie too,
Yeah, Alexander McQueen,
I'm so clean
Its KC and Drizzy,
And its the remix remix,
C.O.S.S.O.M
Hehe
