I tell her, i tell her we not just any guys
I bet they go for a reason no need to empathize
I tell patron truths
I tell you henny lies
And you beleive em all i can see it in ya eyes
I take you down like, down like
Me wit out no money that don't sound right, sound right
I can put you on inside a town flight and even have a driver pick you up girl what that sound like, sound like
I gets big big money all this money i dont even know what to call this hunny
Takes so long just to get to the point when you rich and you there and its all so funny
I stunt so they can see me and therefore they should know
They call me drizzy baby
Wanna see you make it go


She can make it go
Bring it high bring it down take it low
Then make it go
She can make it go
Start off goin fast but then she take it slow, take it slow
She make it
And it sound x3
