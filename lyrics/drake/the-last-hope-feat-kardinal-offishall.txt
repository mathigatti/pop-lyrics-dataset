I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope, don't hesitate
Not even for a second, the hustlers become an obsession
I'm on the front line, so my weapon, I am the last hope


Can you imagine the last breath of Christ
The last breath of christopher wallace on that faithful night
The last step that martin lurther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot mutherfucker watch the world rape us
Great test strugglers hustler to us succeed
Cross water smugglers tussel to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the south
Niggas watchin what I say magnifin my mouth
I never take back talk I apply the force
Hand blistering for many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds it grows tougher then leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My names kardinall

I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope, don't hesitate
Not even for a second, the hustlers become an obsession
I'm on the front line, so my weapon, I am the last hope

Jealousy is suttin I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous off
I bet you do is showing my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove
I'm incredible often unforgettable but when it comes to records
I will eat it if its editable
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before a dream
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em
Cause he won't let no other niggas wright for em
And even when its quite warm the attitude coursing
Through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage mang

I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope, don't hesitate
Not even for a second, the hustlers become an obsession
I'm on the front line, so my weapon, I am the last hope
