I'm the fuckin man, you don't get it do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go uptown, new york city, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm on Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, ain't much to do


Wrist blancpain, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
Twenty five sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, Imma do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid well holla wen ever that stop
My team good, they don't really need a mascot
I tell Tune, light one, pass it like a relay
Ymcmb, more Ymca
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo
Shout goes out to Niko, Jay and Chubbo, shout to Gibo
We got Santa Margarita by the liter
She know even if I'm fuckin with her, I don't really need her, oh
That's how you feel man?
That's really how you feel?
Cuz the pimping ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean, maybe she won't
Then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal
Real nigga, what's up?

[Drake - Hook]
Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga Yolo
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sitting on the bench, nigga we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way
Real nigga, what's up?

[Lil Wayne]
One, time fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my Mo add a V to that shit
I'm fucked up, torn down
I'm twisted, door knob
Talk stupid, off with your head
Nigga money talks, I'm Mr Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet, niggas in the streets like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet, water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga Yolo
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sitting on the bench, nigga we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way
Real nigga, what's up?

What's up?, what's up?, what's up?
Real nigga, what's up?
What's up? what's up? what's up?

We bout it every day, every day, every day
