[Drake - Verse 1]
Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh-t
When I hear talkin, I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams who Im racing with
You can see Im pacin it so that Im always chasin it
Wayne put me right here, thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own, but its lookin like July 4th
But I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really goin off, fireworks


[Alicia Keys - Chorus]
When I go off like July 4th
feels like a fire, Got to go higher
Its your revelation(?) my sweet celebration
light me like a rocket, cause nothing can stop it
all I see is fireworks,
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off like fireworks

[Verse 2]
I got this one girl, you know, in my life
so I say in this song, I say
I'm just such a gentleman
you should give it up for me
look at how I'm placing al my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you f-ck with me
who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me
yeh, I kept my wits about me luckilly
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me

but I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
what an experience
you coulda been the one but it wasnt that serious
their was smoke in the air before now its me cleaing it
that felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now I see it in her eyes
Fireworks!

[Verse 3]
Everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that I still listen
and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city I let her explore
ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that's why I'm really going off, Fireworks!

[Chorus]
[End]
