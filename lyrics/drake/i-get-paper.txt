I get money
I get paper
I get girls of different flavors
I buy Gucci I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar
I get money
I get paper
I get girls of different flavors
I buy Gucci I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar


Yall don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right
Inside the pocket of my pants
I still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite
records all you sing ghost
Twenty thousand for a verse is our routine guote
I'm getting rich while you stanyin broke
Chillin even if I'm a goose down coat
I can't see you through a Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch when you throw me high
They try to measure up but there is no one my size.
What ever forty smoking about to lower my eyes
Beast mode on em
I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement i take the flight off
Baby go aheas and cut the light off

I get money
I get paper
I get girls of different flavors
I buy Gucci I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar
I get money
I get paper
I get girls of different flavors
I buy Gucci I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar

I'm the rookie of the year(year)
About to get my dough on,
I'm about to get my dough on
I'm about to take off baby you should hold on
But I a'int about to prolong
Imma keep it short and tell you whats about to go on
Bottle after bottle cause the money like so long
Baby smooth as ever, we about to put a show on
Imma ahow off, like
I'm supposed to
Yeah you can get lost, i don't know you
Hear my phone ringing when you call
I a'int picking up and entertaining them at all
Got your girl face down banging on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hand at lenox Mall
Hmm, humm, hmm
I cant not relate
Riding with some tags
That i got from outta state
Riding with a swag that I got from outta space
Just show me who's the hottest imma knock em outta place
Call me homicide drizzy abut to kill your ego
I'm about my green puffing guddi like im sea low
You can go and take a Glance at your hero
While a Houston stripper
Pole dance in a zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And my g-pass is a valid as can be
I'm I'm so fresh the stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while
She similing back at me


I get money
I get paper
I get girls of different flavors
I buy Gucci I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar
I get money
I get paper
I get girls of different flavors
I buy Gucci I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar
