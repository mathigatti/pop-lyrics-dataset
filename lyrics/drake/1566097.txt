I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you the last thing on my mind yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time


When our lives don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missin
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We wont be here forever
And ill realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else (no one else)
You don't need no one el - el - el - el else
You don't need no one else (you don't need no one else)
You don't need no one el - el - el - el oooo oooo oh
You don't need no one else (no one else x3)

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go

When our lives don't go the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missin
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We wont be here for ever
And ill realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else (no one else)
You don't need no one el - el - el - el else
You don't need no one else (you don't need no one else)
You don't need no one el - el - el - el oooo oooo oh
You don't need no one else (no one else x3)

The girl or the world
You see someone gotta lose
I thought I could have it all
Do I really gotta choose?
What good is all the cash
If it doesn't buy time
And what good is being famous
If im never on your mind
Nights falling
Lights glowing
And im just tryin ta pay the price owing
And I don't wanna feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I aint tryin ta be with out you at the right moment
Nigga nice going
Is it worth it?
That decision
Cuz hearts breaking
I aint tryin ta be in that collision
So im dust my shirt
And fix my pants cuz I better look good girl if this my chance I swear


So can you do me a favor
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We wont be here for ever
And ill realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else (no one else)
You don't need no one el - el - el - el else
You don't need no one else (you don't need no one else)
You don't need no one el - el - el - el oooo oooo oh
You don't need no one else (no one else x3)
