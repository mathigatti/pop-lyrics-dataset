Why you live off of the hype bruh?
Real T-way!


Yeah
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick
I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need some addressing
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But Iâ€™m one year older than my lil homie
'09 they were bidding on me
But I'm young money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasing women a distraction
They want to be on TV right next to me
You cannot be right here next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They gonna die out eventually
I could not give you the recipe
You know the game is so separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
Six cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
A gram, two poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer i'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they weren't hearing it
They feeling the way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They got to go, they got to go
They gotta doubt eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'mma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with my legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this there's no one to threaten me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
