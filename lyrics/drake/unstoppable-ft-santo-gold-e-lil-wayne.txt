[Verse 1] Drizzy


My name is Drizzy
And I ain't perfect
But I work hard
so i deserve it
and i belong right where you see me
i ain't on the fence about it
i ain't Mr. Feeny
Naw, i got a decent set of manners
and a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
and i fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
who dress like Sarah Jessica and
live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and
I'm no one that'll feed it
But truly you're bad enough
that you don't even really need it
You can show up at the party on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the camera man will still be snappin
candids of you and yo posse partying
drinking watch you get handed
with your virgin island tans
all lookin like you just landed
i dont really understand it
im not sure im comprehending it
but these girls are having fun with
whoevers money they spending screaming



[Chorus 2x]


I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ey,ey,ey,ey
You don't lie
Ey,ey,ey,ey
You don't lie


[Verse 2] Weezy F. Baby


My name is Weezy
I'm almost perfect
and i work harder than hardworking bizarre circus
that's when my bars surface
therefore, i act a clown
even when i'm laying on my back,
im never backing down
so overstand me
i gotta condo in Miami and
my doormat is always sandy
And i run Louisiana
but i've never pull a hammy
and i gotta condo in Atlanta
and i always wear a bandana
and when it comes down to stuntin you boys
is just buntin
i'm swinging from the fence
yo girl hanging from my dick
yo girl singing to my shit
like a la,la,lollipop
she say i get that pussy wetter than a dasani shop
she say i get that pussy better
better than her gynecologist
hoe just text me
everybody want some mo dick mo dick
old bitch
young bitch
but ill be like damnnnn
all i got is one dick


[Chorus 2x]


[Bridge] Santogold

I got the talk
The beats and bass
Give me one I'll take it
Make you lose your place,
Tell me I-I-I can play
So I speed up the pace
I break it break it you can't stop me
In this ra-race


[Chorus 2x]
