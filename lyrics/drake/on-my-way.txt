The clock that you've been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait
What kind of man does that to a girl he loves
If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands are safe
There safe
Just in a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Ohhh, think about the last time i came through
Had some more that i give for you


And i only f- you like that on your birthday
Although baby i just landed
Out to get my bags in
All i need's an address and i'm on my way
Don't fall asleep
Yes i see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Because i'm on my way
