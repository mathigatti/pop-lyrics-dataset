I take time to make
That money
Some break dimes get cake that
Flip 8 times get 8 stacks,
You cannot get jacked for free
And my proceeds and cash right,
There's no need to stash right,
Same 4 g's from last night,
You cannot take that from me,


Hey , i'm moving on up excuse em moi,
Pardon its me,
There's a new chapter to life that i'm starting to see,
And im gon make em spend money to the hardest degree,
But on the low i probably mimic every artist i see,
I need a house, a wifey, a nice watch, and a lot of cake,
I can't lie, there's certain figures i gotta make,
And for my family this a shot i gotta take,
Cos where i live there is nobody as hot as drake,
Which basically means im faking this team,
Resorting a new car briefcases with cream

Trying to find a space in the jeans
For placing the green and watch get the attention the bracelet is clean,
I'm staying in music, wifey kinda need to be a band lover,
I keep it flowing old school like your grandmother,
I'm a tanned brother that use rubber bands to keep his money intact,
If you don't like it you should ban rubber,

These days i can't really break twenty's,
Hunni, make money money
Every month the government will take money from me,
May 750 look how quickly i spent that,
Don't call me broke cos i strictly resent that,
Last month p had to flip me the rent because the tax bracket i'm in is 50% flat,
All because of ebay giving me leeway basically through the paypal i need a raise now,
Seems everytime a n-gga stopping to eat,
I end up always trying to shop and compete,
They know that a n-gga buys if they got it in his size
And he cops it in more colours than popsicle pete,
Till i bow to the top with receipts,
Stressed the stores and i don't understand less is more,
Wanna get em all to the point where they owe me,
And they gon see that drakes on his j-o-b.
