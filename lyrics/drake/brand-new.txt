[Drake:]
This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
Swear I gotta hide, what I'm feelin inside
So you still think I'm confident and dumb
Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedastal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doin brand new?


Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Brand new Brand new girl

[Lil' Wayne:]
This here is on some remix shit
It seems like everything I do, they're leaken it
And I hate hearin stories of who I'm sleepin with
That's why I gotta hide who I got in the ride
So she still think I'm confident and dumb
How long will this last? My life is on a pedastal
Am I movin too fast?
I feel like I'm in crazy competition with my past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doin brand new?

Brand new, brand new, (brand new), brand new
(Is anything I'm doin) [same time] brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Brand new girl
