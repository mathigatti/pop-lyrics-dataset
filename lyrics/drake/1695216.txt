[Verse 1: Drake]
Ive been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs, and low fades
I keep thinking how young can you die from old age
The always tell me no one is working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off man its probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
Im just here making all the music that they party too
But party on, party on, all night n-gga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night n-gga
I grow tired of these f-cking grown man liars
Story tellers, they aint even need a camp fire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This sh-t feel like when fredro star was a sunset park stunting hard in his yellow goose
Ya, and ima motherf-cking missed target
But a target none the less, and I just started
Was that directed at Moi?
Cant be, they must be talking to themselves Hov, hands free
Yeah, and im just filling up this daily planner
Getting busy cuz im a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talking in their music
And I just say I wrote it for yo girlfriends Kelsey Grammar
Yah, that's what life becomes when you doing you
Welcome to Hollywood don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwing you
Just know that she gon tell another n-gga when she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes to long
And drink it all even when it taste too strong yeah
I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me


[Chorus]
Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
OWWWWWWW, Hov turning heads like OWELSSSSS
Im the man of the hour
Triple entendre don't even ask me how
Con-Edison Flo I'm connected to a high power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion watt light bulb when im in the night club
I just landed in that G-450, caught the mayweather fight cuz his satellite was crispy
Uhh, yall can miss me with the money talk
The smart moneys on Hov, f-ck what the dummys talk
I don't do to much blogging, I just run the town, I don't do to much jogging
I aint gotta scar yet, you f-cking round with me and my dogs is far fetched
Drake, heres how they gon come at you
With silly rap feuds trying to distract you
In disguise in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors
Uhh, and ive seen it all done it all
That's why none of these dum dums could done him off
The summers ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these n-ggas im like windows 7
You let em tell it they swear that they invented you

And since no good deed go unpunished
Im not as cool with n-ggas as I once was
I once was, cool as the fonz was,
but these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry mama im promised they wouldn't change me,
but I woulda went insane, had i remain the same ME
F-ck nggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this will do

[Chorus]
[End]
