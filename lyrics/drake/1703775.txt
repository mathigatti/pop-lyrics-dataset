You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
in the bathroom flat irons and nail files
spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
in the mall steady racking up the air miles
hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
you say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
and you don't do it for the man, men never notice
you just do it for yourself you're the f-cking coldest
intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
long as they got a little class like half days
and the confidence to overlook my past ways
time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
but they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
and look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

[Chorus]
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
Nail done, hair done, every thing done
nails done, hair done, everything d…
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
you you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh

Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
from all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
they get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
guess they plan on sucking somes d-cks until some millions appear
Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car
unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
make it rain finger (check)
M3 beamer (check)
Champagne range
triple white Caddy
closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&amp;G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and Bebe
Ya don't need it greedy or easy as these other breezy's
who f-ck for balls or reason (?)

[Chorus]

Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
wave em at the b-tches hating on you with their friends
girl you got it
let em know everything big
nails done hairs done, everything big
and my NY girls let me see your hands
wave em at the b-tches hating on you with their friends
girl you got it
let em know everything big
nails done hairs done, everything big
And my LA girls
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
wave em at the b-tches hating on you with their friends
girl you got it
let em know everything big
nails done hairs done, everything big
And my TO girls
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
wave em at the b-tches hating on you with their friends
girl you got it
let em know everything big
nails done hairs done, everything big

Say go Cinderella
go Cinderella
orgasm blush
lipstick 'n conceiler
devil in a tight dress
girl you a killer and aint nobody realer
and aint nobody realer, go, go, go, go, go
go, go, go, go, go, go
showtime
go, go, go, go, go, go
As we proceed.

[Drake]
Uh, 5 and a half and boys(?)
ass is off the hook
cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
and when I find it is when I find you
and we can do hte things we never got the time to
better late than never
but never late is better
they tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever
you just lead the way
we go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
and Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
how she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
yeah, but shout out to the homeowners

the girls that got diplomas
and enough money to loan us a little something extra
should we ever need it
if it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

[Chorus]
