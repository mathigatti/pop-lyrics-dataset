Tell me girl are you for real
Everything you do is so surreal
When I'm with you it's almost like I'm in a fantasy
'Cause everything you do is so perfect to me


Sittin' on a sofa on a Sunday night
Saw you from across the room
Sat next to me, made everything alright
Hope you don't have to leave too soon

Tell me girl are you for real
Everything you do is so surreal
When I'm with you it's almost like I'm in a fantasy
'Cause everything you do is so perfect to me

Got to talk and talked for a real long time
Couldn't explain the thoughts going through my head
Thinking how I wanna make you mine
Have to go, but I'll stay instead

Tell me girl are you for real
Everything you do is so surreal
When I'm with you it's almost like I'm in a fantasy
'Cause everything you do is so perfect to me

Tell me are you for real
Tell me are you for real
Tell me are you for real
Tell me are you for real

Tell me girl are you for real
Everything you do is so surreal
When I'm with you it's almost like I'm in a fantasy
'Cause everything you do is so perfect to me

Tell me girl are you for real
Everything you do is so surreal
When I'm with you it's almost like I'm in a fantasy
'Cause everything you do is so perfect to me

Tell me are you for real
