Yeh, ah... ah
Boy wonder... Drizzy
Ah... ah... Uh


Ya'll ain't really like me
I can understand
Ma flow is sitting right inside da pocket on ma pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, you sink boat
A write your favorite records, you sing ghost
20 thousand for a verse, is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, aah, you staying broke
Chilling if even if am in a goosed down coke
I can't' see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't' even flinch if you thorw me hi fives
They try to measure up, but there's no my size
Whatever 40 smokin bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, a never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the one way pavement am taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the lights off
Cause It's about to go...

[beat plays]

I hear ma phone ringing when they call
A ain't picking up or entertaining them at all
Got your girl face down and banging on the wall
While you and all your homeboys, hatin and remain small
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmmmmm
I cannot relate
Riding with some tags that a got from out-a-state
Riding with a swag that a got from out-a-space
Just show me who's the hottest I'm a knock him out his place
Call me homeside drizzy, about to kill your ego
I'm about ma green, puffin goody like I'm celo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantacy to you, reality to me
And yeh ma g-pass is as valid as can be
I'm, I'm so fresh, a stylist with degree
Waving at your girl
While she's smiling back at me like...
