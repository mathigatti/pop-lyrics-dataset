You gon' have to step into reality
Life gon' can't be filled with that audacity
You ain't gon' fly we got gravity
You gon' have to, wait
You gon' have to
You gon' step into reality
You gon' have to show some hospitality
And you niggas better deal with yo brutality
You gon' have to
You gon' have to

Ayy, you gon' have to do your thing
They said I might have to come out with a bang
The 6 got it on down pact but they ain't with the gang
Yeah, we gon' show the world who we ain't
Not the type of people to take out the fun
With set so you this shit gon' get done
Bout' to tell the people what has begun
Cause nigga you know its the season for the scorpion
For the Matrix shit
Call up Morpheus
For the Big Racks Shit
Call up the core region
That we came from
Were we showed the whole city, uh
What we made of
Cause we do it best
We already won
Call up Offset, the flame is being passed to him, like Olympic shit nigga lord

You gon' have to step into reality
Life gon' can't be filled with that audacity
You ain't gon' fly we got gravity
You gon' have to, wait
You gon' have to
You gon' step into reality
You gon' have to show some hospitality
And you niggas better deal with yo brutality
You gon' have to
You gon' have to

You gon' have to show me we're the diamonds at (Ice)

We gon' get the show jumping like a frightened cat
Out here this were the excitements at
So fuck a bag
Leave it in back
Fuck a tag
If you ain't with it we do not do that
We gon' take it back to no complaints
Muhammad Ali (hey) and I'm rolling in a Range
Call that a Rover if you do not understand
I'll hit up Cardi and drink some Chateau Grand
I'm in command nigga
Like I'm the man nigga
The style got banned, nigga (banned)
We go on tour nigga
No Bike ridin' this ain't France nigga

And you niggas better deal with yo brutality
