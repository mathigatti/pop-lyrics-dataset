Here we go
Yeah


Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms that its not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like Billy Jean but the kid is mine
Sandy used to tell me all it takes it one time, and all it took is one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times are nothing like the new times
Now it's rough times
I'm out here on front lines just making sure I see him sometimes
It's breaking my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell them I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different cause I've been through it
But this is the hardest truth now
Fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry about who's house you live at
Or who loves you more, or who's not there
Who did what to who for you before you got here
Now, look, I'm too pride to let that come between you now
Realize I got a thing for two now, I better make it
I promise if I'm not there then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the look on their faces
Got the news in Miami that we all now got ones that we raisin'
Tell jello to bring some [?] Ros√© and Baka ride south to cheers to the next generation
But the champagne toast is short lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
He must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother growing so fast that they don't even fit
But you know, I still had to get it for my boy, you know
You haven't met your grandfather, that nigga a trip
He probably did stand up
But at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gonna be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony sake, of coure
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get 100 more
Sorry I'm vintage, tryna cover gorund
They said in two weeks you're supposed to be in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this 
Me and your mother will have come around instead of cutting each other down

God willing, I got a good feeling
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this
My G

No one to guide me
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
