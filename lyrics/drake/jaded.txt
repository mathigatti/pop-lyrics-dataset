Aye
Yeah
Yeah


Leaving me
Dippin' out on me
Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly learned yourself through me
Already gave you what you needed, I guess
I guess, yeah
That's why I'm not with nobody
'Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody
Did it over text, didn't call me
Still got love for you, mami
I know you wanna be somebody
Even if you gotta leave somebody, yeah

Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded
Most of these things, I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin'
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You tryna come back when you famous
I always want the truth, but it's dangerous
You got something real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded
Most of these things, I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin'
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You tryna come back when you famous
I always want the truth, but it's dangerous
You got something real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop (playin')

Yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Aye
Told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time, but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like comes with the inkin', you're getting under my skin
Pretty little young thing
Had a nigga coughing, got me too excited

Yeah
You played me
You played me, you played me
Low down, dirty
Shameful, crazy
I needa know how new nigga you got
Does the same thing I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pcitures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazing
That's besides the point I'm making
You're way too opinionated, have to force it, have to fake it
You have potential, I could've shaped it
You went and caved in

We could've waited
I wasn't rushing
Differences in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I must've changed it
Shifted your focus, lense lookin' jaded

Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded
Most of these things, I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin'
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You tryna come back when you famous (back around, back around)
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
You wanna get with me, stop
