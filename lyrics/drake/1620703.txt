[Intro: Trey Songs}
This goes out to the beautiful girls
Which one of yall, which one of yall
Which one of yall goin' home wit trigga


[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Sittin at the club oo shawty
Walkin past a nigga lookin all naughty
Then i sad baby wassup
Reach for that hand shake got a hug
Bottles of H got me wit a lil buzz
Up in VIP wit all my thugs niggas
U leaned over and said u want me
Girl when the vallet pull the benz up
Off to the crip shawty where we gon end up
Girl sit back relax hold up
Let me turn the radio on


[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl let me get u to the crib (let me get u to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think (x4)
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think (x4)
You gonna think I invented sex

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Put the code in the gate
Pull up to the driveway
Cause she like the way i touch her
Listenin to usher i got a confession
kno we bout to sin but your body is a blessing (Papa forgive me)
Can we take it up stairs
My bed when and there
All i want to do is
Give you all of me
And want u give me all of u
I want your body like right now (right now)
You know i live a magnum lifestyle (lifestyle)
Baby turn the lights down
And ima turn you on

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl let me get u to the crib (let me get u to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think (x4)
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think (x4)
You gonna think I invented sex
Cuz im gonna do it like i did

[Verse 3: Drake]
Its a celebration clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado
For the girl whos a student and the friend whos a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gon do it big like this
Yea and he was just practice
He aint in your world you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire can i be the one you match with
Ill give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
show me where you heads at
Maybe i can grasps it
If you ever come up wit a question you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still i can get you past it
Yea and your friends all suggest
Whats the chance of this nigga being betta than the rest
Just tell em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl let me get u to the crib (let me get u to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think (x4)
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think (x4)
You gonna think I invented sex
