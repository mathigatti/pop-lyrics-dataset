Look, i ain't never had a benzo
Nope, i pushed me an ac wit the tintzo (ac = acura)
Nosey n-ggas is peakin' in my window
Have a hard time looking
I tell you second hand that's a hard grind cooking
Cause my pop was in it so deep
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage

Took a lot of patience and action
I grind so i'm anticipating relaxing

Until the motherf-cking day that i d.i.e

I can easily make'em admit to bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at

And no this aint blu cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things that i do that well
And the way that i jack-son you think that drake new sam-el (as in samual jackson)
I've been real though (?)
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See i'm humble but i live vain
With more deals on the table than a (?)

When he says "benzo" he is talking about a benz as in the bentley cars.
And when he says "ac" he is saying he drove an acura.
