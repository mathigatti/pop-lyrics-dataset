Young Monay...

Look...
I'm like the catch of the day...so you can call me lobster
These fans call me Drizzy...but my friends call me Aubster
Me and Weezy got eachother...no bodyguards, sir
I got him like Whitney...n he like my Kevin Costner
I get plenty money *****, I don't even need a cent
And I got more lines than this motherfuckin zebra print
Ahhw
That's a shirt not a blouse, *****
Plus I come so hard I could make you say ouch niggaaaaaaaahh
Young Money in the buildin
Half of us is grown men, the other half is children
Yeah
I'm on top of the world now
I groom myself well...I could probably show your girl how
Show her how to dress right...tighten up her lacefront
Show her not to wear a tan dress with no beige pumps
Uh
Catch me in Miami
Fresh Dior slippers n a crispy white cami
Wow
Its crazy how time rushed past
Eyebrows lookin like Burt Reynold's moustache
Yeah
And I know ya girl's infatuated
Haters probably curse the day that I was ejaculated
Awwhh
Fake friends sayin we just glad you made it
And I fuck so many hoes that you can't tabulate iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit ttttttttt
That's why I respect women
I wish I could marry every girl my third leg's been in
Me n Weezy got the O.G. flow
We be ridin stallions *****, aahhck!! - no rodeo
