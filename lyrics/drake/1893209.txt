From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kickin' like they 6 months pregnant
Drinkin' Aliz√© with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn, quarter to seven
The sky's getting cold, we flyin' from the north
We're rockin' with our cities like a sold-out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'ing
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets, Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split-life livin'
Let the world listen, if a hater's caught slippin'
Then my nigga stay tight, got my back like Pippen
Fast life grippin', yeah we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get oh so rigid


All that money the money is the motive
All that money the money is the motive
All that money the money she be foldin'
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance so when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom closer to the top
The higher that I climb the harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to they credits
So I tell 'em use a debit watch they image start to lessen
I warned them like discretion
Why these niggas testin'
Always fuckin' testin'
Why these niggas testin'
Shit that I got them on straight bar hoppin'
To the music of the ambiance got shit poppin'
Zombies of the night
Niggas ain't talkin'
If they hypin' to the crew get it in like pockets
Downtown lovin' when the moon comin'
Only place to find base heads and high women

All that money the money is the motive
All that money the money is the motive
All that money the money she be foldin'
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

Better slow down she'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kinda girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga worth her holding
Ain't no nigga that she holding man her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money the money is the motive
All that money the money is the motive
All that money the money she be foldin'
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work

All that money the money is the motive
All that money the money is the motive
All that money the money she be foldin'
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work
