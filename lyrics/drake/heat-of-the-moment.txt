All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They dont read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weathers changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'


She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need when I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Everything straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

What are we even doing?

Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes lord, yes lord, yes lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes lord, yes lord, yes lord
Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "you don't how good it is to be you cause you're him"
And I say "well, goddamn"

Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need when I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
