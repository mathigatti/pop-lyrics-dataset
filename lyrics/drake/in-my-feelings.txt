This shit got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, yup


Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding? 
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

Look the real me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices they running out of options
Cause I've been going off and they don't know when it's stopping
And we came to the top and I see that you've been learning
And when I take you shopping you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it

I buy you champagne but you love some Henny
From the block like you, Jenny
I know you special girl cause I know too many

'Resha, do you love me? Are you riding? 
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
JT, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

[City Girls, Drake e Magnolia Shorty]
Two bad bitches and we kissin' in the wraith
Kissin'-kissin' in the wraith, kiss-kissin' in the wraith
I need that black card and the code to the safe
Code to the safe, code-code to the safe-safe
I show him how that neck work
Fuck that Netflix and chill, what's your net-net-net worth?

'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
(Yea, yea, yea, yea he bad)
And I'm down for you always
(Yea, yea, yea, guess who's back)
And I'm down for you always
D-down, d-down for you all
(Black biggy biggy black biggy black blake)
D-d-down for you always
I got a new boy, and that nigga trade!
