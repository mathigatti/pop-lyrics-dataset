I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazin conversation with this girl named lorraine
Who says shes from l.a.
Who keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
Ooohhhh
She could be good for me (yeaaah)
This what you text me
Tell me that you miss me
I forget about lorraine
And in fact shes right here with me
And shes starin at my face
Something had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away (yeahh)


I hate gettin messages from you (from you)
Its like you know the perfect shit to say
F-cks up my whole day
Thought that all these feelings went away

I hate gettin messages from you (from you)
Especially when you say you should've stayed
F-cks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away

I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do
But I still text you back
To say I miss you too
