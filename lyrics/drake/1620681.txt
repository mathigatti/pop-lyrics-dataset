[chorus:]
Look,
If you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background witcha asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
I ask you to have some patience
(you're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya are part of the speech coz


[verse 1: drake]
Im from the city where people be gettin lazy
Litterin in the streets
And the club district is poppin like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers
Money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams
And dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events
Bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot
So girls'll give up the ass

And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
Daffy and bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane
And she back where she was
Right back on the bus
Its ashame cuz now at his rental
She throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch
You can see thats shes colder
Cuz he doesnt hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her
That he couldnt mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, i say

[chorus:]
If you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background witcha asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
I ask you to have some patience
(you're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya are part of the speech coz

[verse 2: drake]
Now up north theres five artists deservin a listen
And im one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through
Chances are that it aint you
I singlehandedly carry out what you cant do
And see i take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, i couldnt give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in &amp; the out
[?]
Whenever im out in memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like im andreena mill
Japan and brazil, the audience acreaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, i have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

[chorus:]
If you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background witcha asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
I ask you to have some patience

Steady lightin cigars in the parties they sneak in
