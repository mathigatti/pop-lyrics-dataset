I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying


God knows it
Your mind impure, soul I possess, he knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken

I seen man turn fool for the money one too many times
I seen some girls turn their back on they best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time

I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

People change, I'm not surprised
Devil's working overtime
Voodoo spells put on my life
It won't work, they all have tried

I seen man turn fool for the money one too many times
I seen some girls turn their back on they best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time

I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
