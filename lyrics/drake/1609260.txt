Yea
Drizzy baby
You already know who it is
It the first time I'm high
It's the first time I smoked in like 3 months
I'm sorry mama, I had to do it to them
Forty I see you
O I see you homie
I stay late tonight right
You know what happen when I stay late
Yea
Boy wonder
I swear it's like this every single time
Tornoto I got you
I got us


I'm hard guy to get it long
Wit get on the song
Wit wish it be going right
Well I flip it to the wrong shit

The team I belong
To the artist I put on
We don't ever ask for nuttin cuz dem niggas got there own shit
Me and Wezzy are like a mouth of hot peppers
Black ferrari with the red seats I call it playin checkers
I'm never doing verses
I'm foreva giving letures
If you trying to meet with money
I be happy to connect ya
Life is better than it's ever been
Schedulin' million dollar mettings with the president
Someone cut the lights on
Where is Thomas Edision
Gotta a new condo
Watch me as a settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryin to zone I got a whole swisha sweet for
Rappers are liars and their women are deceitful
Add in todays substract me
I never be a equal
Last place drizzy is the nigga in the league now
Wezzy told me just write every single thing you need down
And he got it for me and I'm as happy can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off a rebounds
Yea, and I should have the most braggin' rights
Becuase the nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryn' get the swagger right
Cuz I'd came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck u pussy ass hater you should do you
You aint heard of me then you should go in get a blues clue
Oops I'm mean a red clue
Wayne's here su-woo
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I aint bangin, I aint waving no flag
I'm ATF but they aint seeing no badge
It's heartbreak drake
I hate to see him so sad
I can son you
See a little me and your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on Degrassi
I can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like jonny
Banks like ashley
Burn it like a camel light stupid hoe ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And know the game really aint shit witout me
She might have to pay me but I dick it down free
Wanna know if it's da truth then pull da zipper down and see

No homo though
