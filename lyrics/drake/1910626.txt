"I wouldn't be me if I didn't get a little nasty.."

[Trey Songz]
How about we just pull over and do it where we at?
How about you just pull your skirt up..
We could be bad
That place that ? won't stop getting on me
All that juice just keep spilling on me
Girl - giddy up! Giddy up!
Take me on a ride to ecstasy
You don't wanna bump, bump, then take a nap
You just wanna bump, bump, get it right back
I'mma get it up, get it up
I know you're tired of the usual, the usual
I could give you more than the usual, the usual
When we touch, you gonna feel something unusual..
Tell you what, let me touch, you gonna feel something
Unusual..


What if we did it when your friends was in the room?
Is that too much for you?
We can make the sex wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, baby gotta know
Got me heated up, heated up
Do you hear me girl?
Know you're tired of the usual, the usual
I could give you more than the usual, the usual
When we touch, you gonna feel something unusual..
Tell you what, let me touch, you gonna feel something
Unusual..

Mess around (check)
Set em up (check)
On the hood (check)
Of my car (check)
On the top (check)
Balcony (check)
In the Jag (check)
On the beach (check)

This that other shit - I know you asked for it
I might just save you some money, get your passport
So you can come to my city
I take it all over, and hit you on the balcony
Please don't fall over!
Send me your pictures, baby, you know I'd never leak it
I know you got something recent for someone decent
Why you laughing out loud? I'm serious!
Bring your girl if you a little bi-curious
Please don't start telling the others
I know you gonna love it
Might feel like I expected all the things you
Expected. You gonna know it when you bring your ass
To me

Know you're tired of the usual, the usual

When we touch, you gonna feel something unusual..
Tell you what, let me touch, you gonna feel something
Unusual..

All kinds of ways, in different places
Because of all the faces you're making
Can you take it?

"..thought that I was nasty last time.."
