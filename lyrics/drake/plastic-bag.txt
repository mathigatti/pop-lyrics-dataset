Oh yeah, Magic city on a Monday
Esco treat that shit like church on Sunday
Niggas look at us like ‘maybe one day’
Maybe one day, maybe one day
But for now a nigga got the ones with me
I be in the club with the bands
Like I got the keyboard and the drums with me
Maybe one day, maybe one day
You will understand how I get it though
Man, it’s everything I ever said it is
Mixin' liquor cups with the sedatives
I roll up with the bands on me
This a good night to dance on me
This a good night to dance on me
This a good night to dance on me, oh
