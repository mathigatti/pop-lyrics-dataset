I'm really the heir to the fortune of a million
Heir talkin money with me's really unfair
At the border like I swear
I have nothin to declare
I am nothin like these otha niggas comin out this year
Even if ya never met me you could tell I'm on that same shit
Loyal as a muh fucka nobody be sayin shit
Dope boys know me cause I often speak they language
So well spoken man I shoulda went to cambridge
Y o u n g hoe
Women they can be so
Motivated by money that's why they be on me fo
That's yo favorite rapper homie gauranteed that he know
If he is the one I'm the zero
Please comprehend I am a surf club general
I'm mista consistant I have never come in intervals
Ya'll don't wanna be caught in the middle like a centerfold
I'm commitin suicide if were ever identical
Click clack pow how you like a nigga now
He control of my domain they can do what I allow
And I know toronto miss me I'm a be home in a minute
That's my city and I run it you just run around in it
You see me out in person and say I ain't heard you sing yet
The world is my play ground don't fuck with my swing set
We get the picture and that's when they gets the pile in
I'm callin yo bluff don't act like you can't see me dialin
I'm in low cut louis with hard leather jeans and a bage jacket
Hands down the best in my age bracket holla back
