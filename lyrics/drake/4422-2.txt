I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up


44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew

I know I fear trust
I know I fear fear too much
On my plate, lookin' up
Outer space, Pearly Gates

I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up
