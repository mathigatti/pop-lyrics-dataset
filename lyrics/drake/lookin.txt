They say when u lov some one you dont play

But if true then you lost 2 your game
When you was stricking out erick wat at first base
But you hit home when i fill for your lies and thort you was here stay
Ya but you here but you dont lison
"fucked up with this bitch"
An now iam the one you missin
I gess now i no wat da true meaning of comor is
But ya you hadd me rap around your finger like a shoe string
I was blound to the fact that you was using me
But i ant dum deep fuckin kill on me to the end leve u
Since i lost u i been on my o.g shit t2
Thinkin dat you would pick me over y.g was just to much fo4 you to do
But whos u,
I just keep asking my self
"no body"
Lucky t2 have a bitch that would give u every thing i had
Nothing lest more then i could
But u just wish i would
But i just wish u would
See thing like i see them
Open to lik a book and tell the story like they are
No more lies cuz i ant trying to go that far
But diz iz just wat i get for fallin in love with a rebound
My cross game jump shot ant nothing for diz bitchz
But u was just a beginner facein up
To a winner and she was just a hitter
Lok for a hit and run
But i gess when shit is don it ant nothing u can do about it
But i grow up about
Never cry about
Cuz when some one ceats
The only thing u can do about is it walk up out it .


Like dam

And ima just hopeing that you with it when i tell that

I was thinking one
But you was thinking

But im with it if you with
Tell bitch to bring a kind dip
If you on go you then whos in
Cuz to night ima going off with like
