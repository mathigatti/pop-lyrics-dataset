When you wake up you do you think about me?
Bitch you think of all the fucking paper I'ma see
Yeah I bet you thinkin' bout the dough
But I'ma let you know that you never would be shit without me
You gonna be like damn, like damn, like damn, like damn,
You gonna be like damn, like damn, like damn, like damn,
You gonna be like


What you doin' Jay? Waking up dreams
Trying to be big, me and my schemes
Packing up you leave and gather my things
So I could fly out and spread my wings
You stupid motherfuckers I'm walkin' on a dream
I don't see you motherfuckers
Flying in the air, looking down from above
If you really get to know me girl I bet you fall in love
Listen baby after all the pretty faces got you say that you my favorite
Really wish that I could say it to your face but
Whenever you around I never say much
Wanna tell you no one does it quite like Jay does
But if I spill my heart out, would you even listen?
Would you even care enough to even pay attention
When you talking to your girls am I ever mentioned?
Do they ever try to tell you what you really missing?
That thunder, really shouldn't care is what she's trying to take me under
Driving me insane ... I can't really help but wonder

When you wake up you do you think about me?
Bitch you think of all the fucking paper I'ma see
Yeah I bet you thinkin' bout the dough
But I'ma let you know that you never would be shit without me
You gonna be like damn, like damn, like damn, like damn,
You gonna be like damn, like damn, like damn, like damn,
You gonna be like

Damn I wonder what he doing now
Haven't seen him in a minute, he hardly come around
The last time that I saw him should have wrote his number down
That's probably what she's thinking while I'm somewhere in the clouds
Way over the stars, where really I reside
... living in a dream, ... so bizarre
Chasing at the faith, I can see it from a far
Chasing after love, if I may believe
Can't trust them hoes, they just ... deceive
I'm trying to get the plan, without them hidden fees
Tell me what you want, don't try and riddle me
Fuck that other niggers Shawty stop trying middle me
When you know you really kinda missing me

When you wake up you do you think about me?
Bitch you think of all the fucking paper I'ma see
Yeah I bet you thinkin' bout the dough
But I'ma let you know that you never would be shit without me
You gonna be like damn, like damn, like damn, like damn,
You gonna be like damn, like damn, like damn, like damn,
You gonna be like
Thinking about me when you wake up.
