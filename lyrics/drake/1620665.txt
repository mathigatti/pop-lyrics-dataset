Are u listenin is anybody listenin
Walk into a room and u can smell the Clive Christianson
Alot of niggaz is threatened by my positioning
Thrilling bars u think I'm writing with JOhn Grisham pen
I need ros√© never mind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party no icing
No ice on big phantom no license
Fuck if your feeling me as long as yo wife is
No one in my city got a pocket like drizzy
I can rock fendi jeans cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidental
And ms. wrong sorry u ain't notice my potential
Fuck ya'll rappers and your self-proclaim status
I can only see green now happy St. Patty's
I know you waitin on a last quote
Check the soundscan and u can see that I'm the last ho


By the way I'm jewish and turnin 22
Gets depressing wen u see yo favorite rappers goin thru it
Tryna re-invent themselves showin no improvement
Gettin crushed by this lite skin youngen on sum new shit
40 just record it and we'll drop this here
Cause I'm tryin fuck meagan fox this year
And if u got a stylist ta cop u gear
U in my age bracket u not my peer
Yea fuck u really no about a eames couch
Frette sheets perfect touch 2 a clean house
Wide awake but a nigga living yo dreams out
Lookin like a photo shoot eveytime the teams out
And is the realest nigga still I
A women could love me 2 death but I'll still die
So I'm about us now
Smith and wesson flow u should tell them boys duck down
