Why do i feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And i don't have the heart to give these
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And i entertaining as if i need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing i need back
But its hard to think of them polite flows
Mr. fano poloto suits on your night clothes
And jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full
Now this shits just been light pole
Always said i'd say it all on the right track
But in this game u only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets
Showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camara
Someone gotta tape dis
I make hits and like a bitch
Just married i ain't miss
24 hours from greatness
I'm that close to
Don't ever forget the moment
You began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los angeles, cabanas or atlanta south
Watchin hov shows
Embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarased
To put my phantom out
So i park about 5 houses down
She said i shouldn't have until i have the crown
But i don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus
But yet i'm rolling round the fuckin city like your highness
Got niggas reactin without a sinus
Cause what i'm working with is timeless
And promoters trying to get me out to they club
And say i have fun but i can't imagine how
Cause i just see my ex-gurl
Standing with my next gurl
Standing with the gurl that i'm fuckin right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so i stay clear
We from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something dat these lables can't buy
Especially if they tryin to take a peice of my soul
And sylvia be tellin tez "damn drake fly"
And he just be like "silly mother fucker i know"
That was your bad
How could you pass up on him?
He just take the records
And he gas up on em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on him
Oh they did po at least they tried to
And thats what happens
When you spitting whats inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you
However they decide to naww
Before they told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause who of known me would
Mean that theres a new me
And if you think i've changed in the slightest
Could of fooled me
And to my city i'm da 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and is not because i'm lazy
I'm just not the social type
And campus life is crazy understand
I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest versus down at cabo
So if you find a blackberry with the sides scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that i know
Cause they need it much more than i ever will
I got new shit
I'm gettin better still
Little niggas put my name in their verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said cause its ye shit you better kill
And i think its got them making of a legend feel
Problem with these other niggas they
Ain't never real
Yea ... thats all i can say
