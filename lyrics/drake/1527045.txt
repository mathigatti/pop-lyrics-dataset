Hey girl,
Do you want my number?
That way you can call me
Everytime I come into town
And then I will drive up to your house
And take you out to dinner
I don't expect nothing at all



But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And it feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back
Prove you right
And all this lasts just one night
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow


Hey girl,
I'm back in Atlanta
Second dates are lovely
This time you should choose where we go
Need suggestions?
How about the movies?
Many go for ice cream
I'm not picky, you'll let me know


But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And it feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back
Prove you right
And all this lasts just one night
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow


Girl I ain't a pimp (pimp)
Girl I ain't a playa' (no)
And I ain't tryna move too fast
So I'm a just take it slow (slow, slow)
Girl I just wanna know (know, know)
What would happen if we made love?
Would we have the same feelings when we break up?
Would we still spend hours on the phone?
Wishing we was alone
Would you speak to me in a totally different tone?
I don't know but
I can guarantee two things in life
One is death and the other is I can change your whole life
With one night (one night)
Doing wrong always feels so right (so right)
He can start off with a kiss(kiss), leading to a touch
Forming a relationship based solely around lust
I'm tryna' move slow (girl)
Relax in the drift
But everytime I do, my brain's reaction is this...

But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And it feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back
Prove you right
And all this lasts just one night
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow
