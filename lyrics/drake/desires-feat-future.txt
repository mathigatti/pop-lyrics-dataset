Ayy


I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (hey)
'Cause you got desires

You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees everyday, had to talk to messiah
I'm in that '81 and this that '82, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city
You actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I shoulda moved you away from houston
Before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second thing

I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you (find you)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (hey)
'Cause you got desires

Ayy, self-control has never been your thing
Don't think it'll help if there's ring with a rock in it
Where I'm from they serve, the soda gleam (gleam, gleam, gleam)
You come from a city where there's lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap
And I see you back in turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip then you got back on your shit
I had to tell eric to go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handled it

I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (hey)
'Cause you got desires

Ooh, shortie you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? Oh
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lot of secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? (woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, shoulda stayed silent
Nice guys always finish off where they started
Deja vu, you wanted things and you got 'em
Deja vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Deja vu, deja, deja
