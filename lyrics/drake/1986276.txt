Listen, listen, woah, listen, ooooh
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas!
What you following me for?
This ain't no f-ckin sing-along
So girl, what you singing for?
Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's and the trash we going straight to the top
Rooftop close with a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta girls, first flight from Poland


Why? Cause they loving the crew, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oooooh,

Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might just do it just to do it
Like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow 50k on a vacation
For all my souljas just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say "your lyrics do shit for me"
I told my story, it made history
Tell 'em I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money
Nah, much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and XO is everything that you believe in

Why? Cause they loving the crew, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oooooh,

Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
If you broadcast swag, nigga we the news in the city
