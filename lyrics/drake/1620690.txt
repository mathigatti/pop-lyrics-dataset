[TALKING:]
I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!


[VERSE 1: Malice]

[BACKGROUND:]
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
R-E U-P G-A-N-G

[CHORUS:]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[VERSE 2:]
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now but I was here along
your vision's just been distorted
I'm so [?] I live this, you ask me what the business
and I write a sixteen and record it, uh
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
they expectations Imma exceed it uh
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here Imma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, a purchase [?]
you only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
MY pain, you can experience through the rhyming boy!

[CHORUS:]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[VERSE 3: Nickelus F]

[CHORUS:]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
