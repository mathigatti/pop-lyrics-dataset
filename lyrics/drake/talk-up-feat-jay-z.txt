Aye, aye
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah
Yeah


Ten of us, we moving as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talking about sums
Intentions are pure, they can't tell me to relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This's and that's
Can't be ignoring the stats
They gotta run to me Max, they gotta run to me Max
They gotta double the racks
They [?] said I was for real
But they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skipping through that
If I get it trippin' it's no coming back
I don't understand
These niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at
I put the 6 on the map
The shawty was bad, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell it my lap
My money is old, my problems are young
I'm bridging the gap

You know what I'm saying
Aye, aye
Yeah
You know what I'm saying

Nigga provoke, this shit ain't a joke
Man, nobody playing
He's at the top, he's at the top, but nobody staying
These niggas around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down
You know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah, you know what I'm saying
Aye, aye
Yeah
You know what I'm saying

[JAY-Z]
If you close enough to HOV smell like a kilo still
First album 26, I ain't need no deal
A radio hood legend, I don't need no shine
First Rollie flooded out, I don't see no time
Stand up niggas
We only ducking indictments
Dope boys, off-white, looking like soft white
You know what I'm saying?
We in the building, we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'
Live every word I'm rapping
Said I lost 90 bricks and it happened
You probably would everything you seeing if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys
How can you not be a HOV fan
I only shoot a Benz
I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch
Niggas would be like young
I got your President tweeting
I won't even met with him
Y'all killed X and let Zimmerman live
Streets is done

[Drake]
Yeah, you know what I'm saying
Aye, aye
Yeah
You know what I'm sayin'
