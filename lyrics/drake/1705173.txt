Who else really tryin to mess with Hollywood Cole
treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows


I'm tryin to tell you something that you probably should know
this that slum dog millionaire Bollywood flow
and ahhh, my real friends never hearing from me

fake friends write the wrong answer on the mirror for me
thats why I pick and choose, I don't get sh-t confused
I got a small circle I'm not with different crews

we walk the same path but got on different shoes
live in the same building but we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to lose
I don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's

and these days all the girls is down to roll
we hit the strip club and all them girls find a pole
tell your girl to tell her friend it's time to go
and tell me today's weather

I know they say they good but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
if their a sight to see than I am an illusion

I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion
and if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon I ain't bout to hit the ceiling

I'm about to hit the club women tell me I'm appealing
but f--k what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking these London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzee playin' driving fast but it feels slow

and ask ya man he a hater baby he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
I say this here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things I mention those barely
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary

I'm what Lebron was to St Vince and St Mary
but I ain't palying high school games
pulling McClarens through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm too fly
keep it hip hop like afu raa
girl on that McClaren you gotta lift the doors
blades chopping through the streets swords
