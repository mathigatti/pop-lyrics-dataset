[Drake]
This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And ya guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like clap clap, let em fall slow
I know you had you fears you can let them all go
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple "I think that we're ready's"
Couple "I think we should wait's"
Are we acting like a couple, I'm just trying to get it straight
Cause I'm over here convinced that it's too early for mistakes


[Chorus - Jhene Aiko]
You had to change up the game
Oh the weather is not the same
Now there's only cloudy days
I cant stand the rain in July
Oh July
There were fireworks exploding
But now it's getting colder
The leafs are turning colours
Why, it's just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh baby oh
When summer turn into fall

[Drake]
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I follow all the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident
I'm confused tell me where we go wrong
I wish shorty I would be with you so long
I was planning on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed Chivalry they need to get their sentencing
Meanwhile we argue and I can't get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end

[Chorus]

[Jhene Aiko]
See its funny cause I never
Thought this would end
But then the season changed

[Drake]
You are my, you are my, you are my girl (I was your girl)
Shoulda made, shoulda made, shoulda made you my World
Shoulda made you everything to make you happy baby

[Jhene Aiko]
Can't wait for, can't wait for, can't wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
And I'm too fly for the sh-t
Ohhh, I am Japanese if you please
