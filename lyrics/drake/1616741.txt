Well I know I should have checked in last night
But I just couldn't make my flight
The taxi cab well it took some time
Cuz the change wasn't right


Now it's plain to see
It's not right for me

Alone at the disco
Everybody saying let go
All I wanna say to you cuz its everyone to you

Why'd you leave me on the dance floor
Singing songs that I don't know
All I wanna say to you [?]

So why you [?] on me

Well I know I should have checked in last night
But I just couldn't make my flight
The taxi cab well it took some time
Cuz the change wasn't right
Now it's plain to see
Stired up on me

Alone at the disco
Everybody saying let go
All I wanna say to you cuz its everyone to yo

Why'd you leave me on the dance floor
Little warm but I want more
I just gotta need you baby
What you say my darling

You don't believe a word now
Why don't you say your sorry
Till the crowds breaks down
Till they break it up (strum this just once)

Alone at the disco
Singing songs that I don't know
I just wanna get up now, but I need to find another girl
Why'd you leave me on the dance floor
Little warm but I want more
I just wanna see you now
Gotta sit down or fall
