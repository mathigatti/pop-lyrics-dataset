Yeah
I never really talk about dick that I wanna give you
Or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, head grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like
Like evil angel, like vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kay's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hitting, soothing
Keep it right there, no moving
Make my way around the baseses
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (high)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willing and ready for the taking
Earth shattering, groundbreaking
Head scarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare, but just be prepared that
I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now
Well, what now?


Did somebody â€” who'd they say that baby look like?
Drake!

Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixing potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options but I been chosen
Deal with you the way you like
The way you like it
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it
Oh, you
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixing potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it, yeah
