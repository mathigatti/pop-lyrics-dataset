I'm tryin' to do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life, and as it stands
Everything is going as right, as it can
They tryin to shoot down my flight, before it lands, before it lands


But you can miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish ya'll would fall back
But gettin rich suppose to solve that
And these days women make office and who the hell am I to say (no, no, no)
My ex sendin late night text cause she don't know how to let (go, go, go)
She in love
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold aw yea they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see, everytime, that I'm here
But when I'm not really even here
Black surburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'm a be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in the mars yellin Tux
I don't really give a fuck and we're only getting older
So what I tend to do is think of today as the past
It's funny when you're coming in first
but you hope that you're last (you just hope that it lasts)

Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up in the air for her
Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up
