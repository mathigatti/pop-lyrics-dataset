[Omarion]
Even though your all alone
All alone when I am gone


I just wanna keep you warm
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back

Yes, I'll be there
Yes, I'll be there

Cause when I'm all alone
I think about your face
And how I wanna touch,
I'm so far away (I'm so)

All I wanna do is,
Give you all of me now
Are you ready?
Are you ready? (Yeah)

Don't go missing
Fly with me
Don't go missing
Fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing
Fly with me
Check it out, check it out
Don't go missing
Fly with me, fly with me

[Drake]
(Oooh) I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet

Promise that I won't forget
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back

Yes, I'll be there (Oooh)
Yes, I'll be there (Oooh)

About to board a flight
Sittin' at my gate

I just wanna touch you
But I'm so far away (I'm so)

All I wanna do is
Give you all of me now
Are you ready?
Are you ready? (Oooh)

Don't go missing
Fly with me
Don't go missing
Fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing
Fly with me
Check it out, check it out
Don't go missing
Fly with me, fly with me
