Side pieces
I know that you're watching this from home
I can't wait to see you on the road
Cheering from the shadows I hear you calling out
Wifey sees a text and asks what's this all about
I tell her you're just a friend
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end
I'm asking would you be mine
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2: 45
I had a rough game I took two shots I was 0 for 2
Tough day I need that one thing only you can do
Skylar this is the one thing that I'd be for you
This goes out to all my side pieces
Side pieces, side pieces
This goes out to all my side pieces
You know that you'll never be the main one
City to city I see you wearing the same one
Side pieces, side
Los Angeles I want you to make some noise
For the real king of side pieces Brian Mcknight one time


This is dedicated to all of the side pieces
I know you'll never be more
And you'll always be less
But there's comfort in knowing that
You're okay being second best
I already got a starter but I'm looking for the rest of my team
Side pieces in training go on and
Wave your hands for Drake and me
(Don't be embarrassed)
Side pieces where you at?
(Probably in the top balcony)
I know you're not down here in front of us
You got to be way back in the back
(They can't even see us)
Side pieces go on and be, side pieces yeah
Side pieces
