Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We shoulda did this already
said I gotta email today
kinda thought that you, forgot about me
but I wanna hit you back too say
just like you, I get lonelyâ€¦


[Chorus]
Baby,
I could really get to know you
take my time and show you
don't tell anybody what we do
when I get lonely

Take Me,
to another place where I'll be
face to face, just you and me
with no rules, just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
hoo ooh hoh, hoo ooh hoh
just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
hoo ooh hoh
just like you
I get lonely

Waiting for us too get it on
ain't gotta love to cost any
hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
don't wanna come off strong
cuz too many people wanna get me
but you know I do what I gotta do
just like you, I get lonely yoo

[Chorus]
Baby,
I could really get to know you
take my time and show you
don't tell anybody what we do
when I get lonely

Take Me,
to another place where I'll be
face to face, just you and me
with no rules, just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
hoo ooh hoh, hoo ooh hoh
just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
hoo ooh hoh
just like you
I get lonely

[Bridge]
Hoh ooh hoh
Hoh ooh hoh
Hoh ooh hoh
just like you
I get lonely too
Hoh ooh hoh
Hoh ooh hoh
Hoh ooh hoh

[Chorus]
Baby,
I could really get to know you
take my time and show you
don't tell anybody what we do
when I get lonely

Take Me,
to another place where I'll be
face to face, just you and me
with no rules, just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
hoo ooh hoh, hoo ooh hoh
just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
hoo ooh hoh
just like you
I get lonely

I get lonely

just like you
