I’m out of here, i’m trance, on radio and in the clubs, too,
That city making me mad, every nigger wanna have fun, too.
Hoes see he’s not i, that imitation will not fly,
I’m like rampage on the rear page,
Now i ain’t got no stop sign.


Now is there any wanna rap-by,
Rement on each other like niggers,
‘cause i’m so fresh let you try from my bitches,
If you ain’t dope then i can’t flow with you.
‘cause these niggers take your kindness for weakness to get all you have.
Faster life, they ball hard, but got intimate in the official case.
You get a melt on me, you’re like half of battle,
I spend half the time, you got half of cash.
I’ve been half as large, you’ve got half of swag.
So compared to you i’d be half as ass.

You’re standing on a comic, so everyday’s a fun.
Only whether reach my level to wish up on a fallen star.
I live my life on ass, like everyday’s a blue moon,
I got money on my clock, million bottles a time in your old boat.
He told me it’s all i get, just give it to your papa.
Whenever we go kill, tell that stuff to my mama.

I say fuck unless i’m with you,
If i take you out of the picture
I know real niggers won’t miss you, no lie, no lie, no lie.
No lie, no lie, no lie.

Real niggers say word, they never told no lie,
They never told no lie,
Real niggers say word, they never told no lie,
They never told no lie.
Real niggers say truth, they never tell no lie,
They never told no lie.
That’s the thing i don’t do,
I just do it for the niggers that just try to see a million for what they got.

2chains and champagne, you want the true, that’s true enough
Forbes list like am, my all fist is my toolbrush.
Came through, she got fooled, she got fucked, she knew us up.
She think i’m the realest out and i say damn, that makes two of us.
All that look like what’s her name? chances are that what’s her name
Chances are she was acting up and i fucked her once, never fuck her again.
She can have a grammy, i still treat her ass like a nominee,
She’s leaving on with that pussy like so one time is fine with me.
Young ass in intern, money like we’re building shit.
Street’s talking, i’ll confirm, go, i stumble, just catch that shit.
State keeping my cup full, so i’m extra charged like a state of tax.
Me and chainz go way back, we don’t talk shit, we just say the facts.

I say fuck unless i’m with you,
If i take you out of the picture
I know real niggers won’t miss you, no lie, no lie, no lie.
No lie, no lie, no lie.

Real niggers say word, they never told no lie,
They never told no lie,
Real niggers say word, they never told no lie,
They never told no lie.
Real niggers say truth, they never tell no lie,
They never told no lie.
That’s the thing i don’t do,
I just do it for the niggers that just try to see a million for what they got.

Sipping on that lean, don’t bring me no bottles, hoe
I’ll make it rain so hard, flowers grow, holly grow,
No baby mamas, no baby mama drama,
The bitch at home asleep, i go home and sleep behind her.
Shout out to my wee man, shout out to my lean man,
Sitting on these motherfucker millions like the big bang.
Fuck you, don’t judge me, drug me, then love me.
Ate me some pussy, once i got the munchees.
I’m tripping, tell pippin to bean me up scalee
Got pounds on that kush, watch me go on a diet.
That snow-like, i’m so high, you pussy ass niggers ass won’t get.
I got them yellows on next, i slipped on a banana peel.
Dropped fifty shirt, blunt up then served,
Pass that weed around like some fucking others.
Man, i’m shit faced and you’re bitch faced and she high too, fucking right.
My number one f a n, you know what that mean, fuck all night.

I say fuck unless i’m with you,
If i take you out of the picture
I know real niggers won’t miss you, no lie, no lie, no lie.
No lie, no lie, no lie.

Real niggers say word, they never told no lie,
They never told no lie,
Real niggers say word, they never told no lie,
They never told no lie.
Real niggers say truth, they never tell no lie,
They never told no lie.
That’s the thing i don’t do,
I just do it for the niggers that just try to see a million for what they got.
