Fallen too fast
Clearly rules don't apply
Can't believe that i just met you
You got me here
Watching minutes past by
Wondering when to express you
There you go
Is this a dream
Looking like every picture
That i seen of you before
I've seen it all before
Now that it's over. i shoulda known better


When you think this is real and
You could be mine
I should have known better
Slowed it down cause i feel
You needed time

But i kept thinking
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something

Maybe it's just nothing at all
But this could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something

Maybe it's just nothing at all
At all... at all...
Maybe it's just nothing at all
At all... at all...

I guess it's what we make it

I guess it's what we make it

I guess it's what we...
