Uhh uhmmm ok i got these girls queit hype
Only thing on right now like a night light
While my brother wayne rockin out like a white strip
Im'ma kill the game im the young money white night
Plus im looking for the right type
Causious of a flud so i always lay the right pipe
West put markylifelife
Plus i go hard with the women that i might wife,
I put the ring on the index finger
So if you wanna keep ur girl
Please don't bring her
I bet im the type of guy that she got a thing
For you would block me but this ain't jenga
Ya and she's someone i would work with
Thats what i could tell
From what shes showing on the surface
I ain't saying im requestin anyone as perfect
But i just need a woman
That'll make it all worth it

(chorus)(x2)
