I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost
I never turn the heat off
And still i'm so chilli willy snowflake
These silly billies really feel to act as if they know drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ x-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How i am no good so go with the next man
But dog
You don't know me
You don't know us
We go by the name of a-t-f
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and i spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out
Nigga i am not playin'
Just fall back keep on escape'in and alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what i mean
And dog
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what i am on
Nbc, mtv, viacom
And who's continental gt is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb
Ticket on the dash
It's like e'ry fuckin' summer i just switch it on they ass
And maaan i'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard
So i am what they gotta be
'cause drake's syllables is like jake gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think i should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air i'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer i did it prior
I've shattered shows
And tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and i am present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink dom
They always ask me "is that a rose?"
You mean rosÂ©?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am jeopardy asked wikipedia known
I am a.a. driven and expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
Your in need of ya own, man
