I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion
Endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion
Endlessly


'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion
Endlessly
I can't get over you
You left a mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion
Endlessly

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something (baby)
I think there's something (baby)

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home
