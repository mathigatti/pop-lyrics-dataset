Hey there, pretty girl
You know exactly what you got
And I don't blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the light's so bright
And the money's so right
And it's comin' in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in


Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlantavegas (ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlantavegas (ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go: Hey now, now, watch her go down
Oh, oh, oh

She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life
And she's scared of ending up alone

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlantavegas (ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlantavegas (ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go: Hey now, now, watch her go down
Oh, oh

We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin', all-star weekend
One hotel room that all y'all sleep in
Housekeeper knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin' right all season
But you always with me on the night y'all leavin'
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, it's prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you, although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that I'm going crazy

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlantavegas (ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlantavegas (ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go: Hey now, now, watch her go down
Oh, oh, oh
