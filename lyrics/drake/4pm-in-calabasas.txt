Yeah
All you self promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fucking game thank us
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it


And you know me as a Cris bottle sender
Check pick upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle
Too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from

All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy
They tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me
Ha-ha-ha-ha

No way out cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since No Scrubs and No Pigeons

Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&amp;B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
Mike never tried to rap like Pac
Pac never tried to sing like Mike

Those my dad's words to me
When I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child

Can't nobody hold me down, especially not right now
Certain shit just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that no love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that, damn nigga, what is that

Y'all don't hear no songs then hit my phone like you did that
And you even hit my line like where you been at
It's always on some shit like when can I get a favor
Or where my bitch at, like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped

She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, White and Red on my body cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to Party
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Ros√© and calamari

Look now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose cause in every situation
I'm the bigger artist, always gotta play it smarter

Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb shoulder
Just to hit the Kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, Drake, will you please stop smoking la la?
Chubbs, why try, I'm a thug, I'mma die high
Got the Rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance

Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime Drizzy over there, tryna make you
Make you dance to this, yeah I make you dance to this

I rode big body, widebody, Calabasas road winder
Sunshinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys I blow Keysh right in your face

Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep but I'm awake
For that one night you niggas try to reach inside my safe
Don't push me cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greasy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it

Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find
You SWV cause you weak
And I'm always always on your mind
Yeah

And we can't stop
Make you dance to this
I'mma make you One Dance to this
A ha ha ha ha
Bod breed bod bwoi
