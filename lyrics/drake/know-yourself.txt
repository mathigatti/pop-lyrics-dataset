Wallets, wallets, wallets, wallets, wallets
Y'all sleepin' in the streets
Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that oliver 40, niko shit man, 15 fort york shit ya know
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?


Yeah, yeah
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that ferrari then I swerve
I want that bugatti just to hurt

I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that
My city too turnt up I'll take the fine for that

This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named johnny bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' girbraud jeans
I had a yellow technomarine
Then kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
That's when ethan was pushin' a subaru hatchback
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags

I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go

Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up in here got p reign and chubby and tj and winnie
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as baka get back on the road
Yeah but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga jigga he whip it I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like twenty four seven, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go

She know it, it a no big
Always haffi look out an ya know if yuh head buk out
Dun know, a de unruly boss, dis man
No bomboclat, otha
And if a boy like
Ovo crew my nigga can just suck ya motha
With no apology, I cannot
Yeah girl I say we cute, if they dis we get execute
That's the truth, ovo unruly

With my woes
