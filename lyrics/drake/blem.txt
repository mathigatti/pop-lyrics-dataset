Unruly, Unruly, maddas
Who keeps bringing more, I've had too many
This Virginia done me off already
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel


Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands and get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop running back to your ex he's a wasteman
I wanna know how come we can never slash and stay friends
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

â€˜Cause I know what I like
I know how I wanna live my life
I don't need no advice
You're not here and we both know why, so
Move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I'm building up a house where they raised me
You move with me I'll go crazy

Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands and get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop running back to your ex he's a wasteman
I wanna know how come we can never slash and stay friends
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

I know we can't keep it together forever
'Cause you're crazy sometimes
And I only see you sometimes
Move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I'm building up a house where they raised me
You move with me I'll go, look

Just don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands and get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop running back to your ex he's a wasteman
I wanna know how come we can never slash and stay friends
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

Together forever
Good morning, good afternoon, goodnight
I'm here to talk about More Life
One second
