Watch out for me, I’m bound to glow
You better watch out for me, I’m bound to glow


[Kanye West &amp; Drake]
Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
‘Member doin’ shows, ain’t nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain’t nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
‘Til me and bein’ broke finally broke up
Watch out for me, I’m about to glow
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-i-ize
We go suit and tie, we gon’ touch the sky-y-y
We so certified, we so certifi-i-ied
Fuck you haters still, that’s an F-Y-I-I-I
They gon’ bang this here all summerti-i-ime
Watch out for me, I’m about to glow

[Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah
Turn me way up, my voice is really low
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

[Kanye West &amp; Drake]
(Watch out) Watch out—why, nigga?
(The cops out) Cops out
It’s all love when I ride top down
Top down (I started out way down low)
Started from the bottom, now we here now
Watch out for me, I’m about to glow
We about to get the whole nine
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time

[Drake]
Watch out for me, I’m about to glow
I just take the dreams I’ve been sold
And sell ’em for more, you already know
Watch out for me, I’m about to glow

[Kanye West]
Hope I deal with karma ‘fore my son do
‘Cause I be drivin’ round this bih with no sunroof
Man, the glow got me feelin’ like I’m gunproof

[Drake]
Watch out for me, I’m about to glow
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I’m part of
Tryin’ to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin’ the time to clear my mind
‘Cause soon as I’m able to let that go

[Kanye West]
Watch out for me, I’m bound to glow

[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We love y’all too!
We believe if there’s anything y’all wanna do in life
You need devotion
Can I hear right on? (screams)
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We live for it
Clap your hands and see me
Come on, y’all
I said it’s alright
Clap your hands and see me
Come on, y’all
