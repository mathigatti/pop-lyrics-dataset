Yeah,
I had to do this shit for my little brother Mar
Young nigga just wanna hear me talk that Toronto shit,
you know?


Uh, you see bad bitches and fall in love
I be talking arithmetic in the club
Renegotiations
Young Frank I seen all of your favorite girls naked
And mental pictures were taken
I never forget they faces
They lucky I can't draw, but still I'm artistic
Money on the way its got both of my palms itchin'
You boys in the wrong business fo real
You boys in the wrong business
All that sitting back and watching
will make you a strong witness
Testify on how I'm living, make sure it's non fiction
Don't leave out anybody that put me in this position
We couldn't of done it better
We changed the city forever
Puffing shisha
Laid back fuckin' with Fifa
What I get for them features,
I wouldn't fuck with me either, for real
Now I'm in it for the hoes and the checks
But care less about respect from niggas I never met
Champagne

I know my city going crazy right about now
Broke nigga, so I'm greedy
Break a nigga down if they don't feed me
Yo girl break her neck the same second that she see me
And I bet my last nickel that she eff with Sweet Petey
Bradley Cooper, a future is limitless
I'm infinite, take a photo of the synthesis
Grandmama got Alzheimer's but she'll remember this
Ain't no way that she won't remember
I wake up every mornin' shower, gather my belongings
But I just quit my job, but got some pussy cause I'm balling
From AM to PM, beefing with the BM
Beefing with the boss, got fired by the GM
Fuck, I lost my nigga to a goddamn murder
In his own kitchen, with his own goddamn burner
You ain't no goddamn boss
You a goddamn worker
Fuck beef when niggas dying for a goddamn burger
My nigga, all we know is this pain
Chain smoking in the city where they smoke you for chains
Jamaica house to croaker spot, riding round smokin pot
On Broad Street we all drink -- PBR and Rolling Rock
Do this to get money, that ain't enough
Do this for my city, that ain't enough
Im like Andre 3k, 16 ain't enough
I get down like Curtis Snow
Dare you to call my bluff
Bet you it won't pick up
We ride box Chevys but we built Ford tough
And I bet you that we won't give up
The pigs try to lock us down
But we broke through cuffs
