This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havn't slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our seperate ways
So I'm single...
Thinking about what we had and missing you
But I aint santa, I got something for these bad b*tches too
I mean paprazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don't hold on too long cause that's how them stories start (?)
(?) eat your muthaf*ckin heart out, it's drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can't escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this sh*t is new to me, I'm learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
But I'm good
I know that n*ggas would kill for this lifestyle
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin from where I came
And no matter where I'm headed
I promise to stay the same


[Young Jeezy]
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I'm the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest

[Chorus]
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...

[Young Jeezy]
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo' life yall say fo'ever
It's hard but it's fair I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The names young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I'm gon need a thug wife
Yeah, I'm talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah, I'm talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly in these feathers
(?) so what's the deali young done everything in the A but f*ck chillin
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for yall to meet the love of my life her names the game

[Young Jeezy]
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I'm the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest

[Chorus]
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...
