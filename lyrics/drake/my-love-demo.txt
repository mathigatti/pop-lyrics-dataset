I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
I meant every word that I said
You should have spent more time listening
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a, "Hold on"
What makes you so ready right now?
After I waited on you for so long


Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?

Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?

I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
Even when you sleep in my bed
I know you're not mine officially
And all the things I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a, "Hold on"
What makes you so ready right now?
After I waited on you for so long

Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?

You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off
And shine 'em up, and line 'em up, oh
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me up, or line me up, no
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off
And shine 'em up, and line 'em up, oh
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me up, or line me up, no

Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?

Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?
