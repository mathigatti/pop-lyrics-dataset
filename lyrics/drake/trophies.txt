Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mothafucka
Figured out this shit, it's simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga I do not want to be friends though
I told y'all motherfuckers
Man this shit is not a love song
This is a fuck a stripper on a mink rug song
This a fuck them boys forever, hold a grudge song
Pop some fuckin' champagne in the tub song
Nigga, just because song


What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

Golden dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like: I heard all your niggas stay where you stay
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch I use a walkie talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed for the Grammy
Bitch check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it
I told y'all motherfuckers
Man this shit is not a love song
This a doin' me and only God can judge song
I do not know what the fuck you thought it was song
Pop some fuckin' champagne in the tub song
Nigga, just because song
