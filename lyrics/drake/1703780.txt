[Drake Singing]
All night I've been staring
can you tell I want you
can't be too wide open
there's nothing I won't do
ohhhh
just thought you should now
cause when you start to laugh
oooo oh, oooo oh
saying I just want what I can't have
oooo oh, oooo oh
you won't even give me a chance
claiming I'm just not as serious as you
shawty if you only knew
this is serious
Uhh, I wish I wasn't famous
I wish I was still in school
so that I can have you in my dorm room
how I put it on you, crazy
thats when you start to laugh
saying I just want what I cant have
oh ooooh, oh oooooh
won't even give me a chance
claiming I'm just not as serious as you
