Thats what they doin' [?], they actin' like these singers man
I ain't goin' to the studio until I have a situation
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer
Who gonna be on the hook?
Man what is you doin?
Understood were with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!


Brand new beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, where the check go
Yeah I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold
I ain't reply, let 'em know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible

Ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes benz
Pedal doin' 90 on the bridge like
Nigga you already know
And if you don't know, now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the rows with illuminated angel
Four or five made of gold gave him [?]
My nigga [?] said the first meal gonna change you

Change for the better, hit it then dead her
Thats my vendetta, keep this shit together
God damn we ain't even got a scam
Cocaine cool, we ain't even gotta scam
Used to flip [?], now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed you can still get to work
(Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you)
(We're sorry, you have reached a number
That has been disconnected or is no longer in service)

Yeah, I remember how I went to louis v with half
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the east cause my boys are gettin' right
Man, I was on tv makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on

And they did put me on
Yeah, the did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it had to leave that shit alone man

Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing
Blowin' up, line blowin' up
They need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I do better with the writer in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on [?] when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin'
You know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin'
I smoke when I drink its tradition

Like zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm nixon
I'm mixin', I am not esco but it was written
I knew when they didn't
I been had these visions of the life I'm livin' since I was jimmy
All I just had to do was go and get it
