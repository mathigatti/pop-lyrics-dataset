Bright light, city lights downtown every night,
Never has to think twice,
Only does what she likes,
What she wants, what she needs,
She's my independent queen!


All right!
She'll be jumping up and down,
Trying to fit that ass in.
Took her half an hour just to get that...
All she wanna talk about is party and the fashion,
I don't know where she's going and I do not plan on asking at all
Cause this baby is free,
And she let's nobody else in except for me!
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree
I'm the only one she loves, there's no copy of the key...

[Chorus: x2]
Bright light, city lights downtown every night,
Never has to think twice,
Only does what she likes,
What she wants, what she needs,
She's my independent queen!
What she wants, what she needs,
She's my independent queen!

Don't forget that fendi purse that you put all your cash in,
Kinda' hard to concentrate when the cameras are flashing.
All the dudes suffocate her, I don't wanna grasp in,
Don't know where she's going, and I do not plan on asking at all!
I've never been the type to... my connection
With nigger that wanna fight over women, that's not right,
There's too many in the world, homie you could...
But I swear that was my girl, I swear it was my girl!

[Chorus: x2]
Bright light, city lights downtown every night,
Never has to think twice,
Only does what she likes,
What she wants, what she needs,
She's my independent queen!
What she wants, what she needs,
She's my independent queen!

Yeah, she works hard, but she plays even harder,
All-star weekend and she's been voted my favorite starter.
... on the back of a jersey, so you won't forget it,
But she shines bright, blind them light
So that... forget it.
Just one life to live, the kind of life I will...
And if I don't see her tonight, the rest of my life I will regret it!
She's not perfect, but she's just perfect to me,
Like it's a highway, let's ride it, you know in a second with me1

[Chorus: x2]
Bright light, city lights downtown every night,
Never has to think twice,
Only does what she likes,
What she wants, what she needs,
She's my independent queen!
What she wants, what she needs,
She's my independent queen!
