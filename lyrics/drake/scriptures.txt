Look, here we go,
The first time around,
I left the cars at the house and i put the diamonds down,
Them things come and they go its about the rhyming now,
I'm seeing it clearer the season is nearer,
And still i must change,
I'm like a broken bill,
Conservative for the most but i'm outspoken still,
They not sure of the work but they all hoping he'll,
Emerge to victor my words are pictures
And guess the colours so loud that you heard my scripture,
With 4 walls give me the right brush and i draw all,
I promise i've been thinking before ya'll,
I barely get tired im rarely inspired,
And you accomplish in a week what i'm daily required,
I meet quotas while you rappers having sleep overs,
Spending nights in the studio trying to beat hova,
Be in the throne instead of being your own,
But look,


I'm making moves in my city so,
My ex girls wanna be up in the video,
They ex girls is steady tryin to get with me though,
Important an' vital i'm caught in a cycle,
This is all i know,
And yes i know it well,
I try to explain it, my effort comes to no avail,
Im from the place where they release records and no one sells,
And still they claim king n-gga it's the same thing,
All day long,
But thats a screw face,
Rappers befriend you at first but really they two faced,
Hoping they slip and trip over your own shoelace,
Thats why i tuck em in not giving a f-ck again,
D.r.a you add a k.e
A couple mill and you labels cannot play me,
I never go broke i'm far from a flash in the pan,
I am a passionate man, plan it with cash in my hand,
Uh,

I got few days left,
But i'ma make use of every single one until every singles done,
Until every record is sold, every string is strung,
Tell me take a breather drake and everything will come,
Dog its always been the same,
It's all love like no score in a tennis game,
For the son of dennis james,
Owner of the city down town on a friday,
Streets behind me like i took a picture in the driveway,
I roll down strips and hose down whips

That when turtle wax up they would close down richmond,
With no down shifting,
Haters would say im adequate,
Think i got the type of flow that would make an addict quit,
21 years i've been pimping since being
Repurchased trap music 4 times since then,
Seemless transition im the new fresh prince
Getting pennies for my thoughts,
So i put my two cents in,
Top of the morning i am dropping the coin in,
Plus i'm changing the game,
You hear me swapping the joint in,
They put the fires out and bring the buyers out,
And try and box us all together before they buy us out,
If they profit from the events we handing flyers out,
Then we profit from the attempts to hand desires out,
But rich is how we all ending up,
Im at the label in the elevator send themâ€¦up.
