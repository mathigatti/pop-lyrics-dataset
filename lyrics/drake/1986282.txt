It's like '09 in your basement and i'm in love with nebby
And i still love her but it fell through because i wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And i sit next to you, and i lecture you 'cause those are deadly
And then you ask shit and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me i'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's "fuck you, i hate you, i'll move out in a heartbeat"
And i leave out and you call me, you tell me that your sorry
You love me, and i love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, i hate to see, it all hurt so bad
But maybe i wouldn't have worked as hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe i should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, j, and neeks, we're probably
gonna end up robbing a bank
Then wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, i come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
I almost get a grammy off of that thing
They love your son and that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And i finally send you to rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it


This shit real, should i pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, i got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that i was gonna be something
We stressed out, and you need some, i got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

It's like '06 in your backyard and i'm in love with jade
And i'm still in love, just wasn't that real, so then it doesn't fade
And my father living in memphis now he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black american dad story
Know that i'm your sister's kid but
That still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house feel like the hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shh
Made the world i knew bigger, changed the way that i viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You calm me down when i lose it
Told you i think i'm done acting, i'm more in touch with the music
You said either way i'll be a star, i could go so far
Talked to me, to you got to me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that i don't get arrested
Just another kid thats goin' through life
So worried that i won't be accepted
But i could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounce but we bounce back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And i thank you, i don't know how it'd really be without that
It worked out man
You deserve it

This shit real, should i pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, i got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that i was gonna be something
We stressed out, and you need some, i got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
