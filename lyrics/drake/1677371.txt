I'm more than just an option
Hey, Hey, Hey
refuse to be forgotten
Hey, Hey, Hey
I took a chance with my heart
Hey, Hey, Hey
And I feel it taking over


[Chrous]

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if i give all my love
then nothings gonna tear us apart

I'm more than just a number
Hey, Hey, Hey
I doubt you'll find another
Hey, Hey, Hey
so every single summer
Hey, Hey, Hey
I be the one that you remember

[Chrous]

and I better find your lovin
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin
I better find your heart
I bet if i give all my love,
then nothings gonna tear us apart

it's more than just a mission
Hey, Hey, Hey
you hear but you don't listen
Hey, Hey, Hey
You better pay attention
Hey, Hey, Hey
and get what you been missing

[Chorus]

I better find your lovin
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin
I better find your heart
I bet if i give all my love,
then nothings gonna tear us apart

too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, theres nothing left to do
but give all I have to you and
I better find your lovin
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin
I bet if I give all my love,
then nothings gonna tear us apart

I bet if I give all my love,
then nothings gonna tear us apart
