Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush this through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you


Done, sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the Outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraisin'
Most people in my position get complacent
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages
I'm quiet but I just ride with it
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
Birthed there in my first year, man, I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is any one comin'
Before I show up there and ain't no one there?"
These days
I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, get a million copies get pressed out
She tell me
"Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out"

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush this through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family goin' backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
Look, I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like "Oh well, this is life, I guess not, fuck that shit"
Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do
You gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, tellin' herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
All my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treatin' me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other
We ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
Writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush this through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Don't give up on your hopes
Don't you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted
You care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer
A believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire
Feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lying
Tell me when I'm trying
