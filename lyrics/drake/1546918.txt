This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
Swear I gotta hide, what I'm feelin inside
So you still think I'm confident and damn...
Is this gonna last? You're up on a pedastal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doin brand new?
(brand new)


Brand new(brand new), brand new(brand new),
Is anything I'm doin brand new?
(brand new)Brand new(brand new),
Brand ne-ooo ooo-w
Brand new oh oh
(Ay ay ay ay)

This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you and damn...
I can't even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
This why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doin brand new?

Brand new(brand new), brand new(brand new),
Is anything I'm doin brand new?
(brand new)Brand new(brand new),
Brand ne-ooo ooo-w
Brand new oh oh
(Ay ay ay)

Is anything I'm doing brand
New [x6]
Is everything I'm doing too
Late [x6]

Did he take off your clothes off just like this

Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date
