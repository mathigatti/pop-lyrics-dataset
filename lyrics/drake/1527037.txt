Uh, when did you get like this?
Least you could've done is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, "This just ain't my style"
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile, for me, ah


Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us

When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before?
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store

Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us

Look, leave me, leave me, I can't fucking stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we 'posed to be together 'til the world end
But, I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear every time I call, you just tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that? Do that, do that, yeah

Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
