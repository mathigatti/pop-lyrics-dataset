You're, making it feel that everything is alright
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower
In a world that's crumbling, all around us everyday
You are, all the inspiration that I need to find my way
How long I've been yearning, for the day I find my one true love
Now that you are here my darling, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)


You're, making it feel that everything is alright
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower
You're, making it feel that everything is alright
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower

Whenever you call me, I'll be there with no delay, my love
Even when I'm miles away girl, my heart will be there (I'll be right there)
Any conversation that you want to have, you'll have my ear
You can tell me all your secrets, they'll be safe my dear

You're, making it feel that everything is alright
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower
You're, making it feel that everything is alright
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower

[Drake:]
I'm not that good with words, but I'm a try my best

Look, I don't ever wanna make you mad girl
I just wanna have you see you know the things young men are hesitant to have girl
A little you a little me and someone else, good lord that's a winner right there
But we really got a story to tell, it can't finish right there
I used to wonder what my old girl doing right now
Ever since you came into my life
Everytime I think it'd be good to call her
I just think about you and it'd make me think twice, ah yeah
I know we've been through a couple things
You know a couple things, what are we to do
But you make me feel good, you love me for me and you love me for you
Come on

[Chorus:]
You're, making it feel that everything is alright (it's gon be alright)
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower
You're, making it feel that everything is alright
You're my sunflower, you're my sunflower
