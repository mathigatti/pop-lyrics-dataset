Right, my eye just changed
You just buzzed the front gate
I thank God you came
How many more days could I wait?
I made plans with you
And I won't let em fall through
I, I, I, I, I


I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Jodeci Cry For You
Do things when you want me to
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

Yeah, okay, you like it
When I get aggressive
Tell you to go slower, go faster
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla
And I'm never on a waste ting shawty
I do it how you say you want it
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they pree

Knowing I'd lie for you
Thinking I'd die for you
Jodeci Cry for you
Do things when you want me to
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

[Popcaan]
Yeah, betta (?) ya garments
And a (?) chick up in mi apartment, oh
Big gyal in (?)
Action speak louder than argument, well

[Drake]
But you can't just diss and come tell me sorry
You can't listen to me talk and go tell my story, no
It don't work like that when you love somebody
My old flex is my new flex now and we're working on it
And that's why I need all the energy that you bring to me
My last girl would tear me apart
But she'd never wanna split a thing with me
But when it comes to you, you

I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Do things when you want me to
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

And I'm never on a waste ting shawty
I do it how you say you want it
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they pree
Jeez!
