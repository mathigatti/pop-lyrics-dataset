When I get older I will be
Stronger they'll call me freedom just
Like a waving' flag


[K'naan]
Born to a throne
Older than rome
But violent prone
Poor people zone

[Nelly Furtado]
But it's my home,
All I have known

[Sam Roberts]
Where i got grown
But now its gone

[Avril Lavigne]
Out of the darkness
In came the carnage
Threatening my very survival

[Pierre Bouvier of Simple]
Fractured my streets
And broke all my dreams

[Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman]
Now feels like defeat
To wretched retreat

[All &amp; Kardinal Offishall]
(so we struggling)
Fighting to eat
(and we wondering)
If we'll be free

[Jully Black]
We cannot wait
For some faithful day
It's too far away
So right now I say

[All]
When I get older I will be

And then it goes back
And then it goes back
Wahhhoooh

Settling scores

For some other day

Stronger they'll call me freedom

[Drake]
How come when the media stops covering
And it's a little help from the government
And we forget about the people still struggling
And soon then it's really all love again
Nah see we don't have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren't involved before
It's never too late to start
You probably think that it's too far to even have to care
Well take a look at where you live
What if it happened there
You have to know the earths to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason they see their flag rise again

[Nikki Yanofski &amp; Drake]

[Justin Bieber]
When I get older
When I get older
I will be stronger
Just like a wavin flag
