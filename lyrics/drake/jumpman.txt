Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country
Them boys up to somethin', they just not just bluffin'
You don't have to call, I hit my dance like Usher, woo!
I just found my tempo like I'm DJ Mustard, woo!
I hit that Ginobili with my left hand up, like woo!
Lobster and Céline for all my babies that I miss
Chicken fingers, french fries for them hoes that wanna diss
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'
Uh, uh, uh, I think I need some Robitussin

She was tryna join the team, I told her: Wait!
Chicken wings and fries, we don't go on dates

I just threw a private dinner in L.A.
Trappin' is a hobby, that's the way for me
Money comin' fast, we never gettin' sleep

Bentley Spurs and Phantom, Jordan fadeaway

Heard they came through Magic City on a Monday
Heard they had the club wild, it was star-studded
A bunch of girls goin' wild when your chain flooded
And I had 'em, like wow, cup dirty

Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
Money on the counter, choppers on the floor
I just copped that tempo, DJ Mustard, woo!
Way too much codeine and Adderall

We just count up big racks, whoa!
I know I'mma get my bitch back, whoa!
I count all these racks that I have on me now
I'ma have you like whoa
Chanel N°9, Chanel N°5, well, you got 'em both
