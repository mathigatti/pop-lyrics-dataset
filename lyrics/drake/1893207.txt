We both wake up, staring at the sky
Don't remember how we got here but we don't wonder why
Right now we living life like there's no way we can die
But we bout to do our thing like there's no way we can die
But we bout to do our thing they couldn't stop us if they try
Keep the weapon for the haters if they try to blow us ...
How the fuck would they stop us if we by each other's side
We were meant to be together we get inside
How the hell would they kill us when we're feeling so alive
Wake up, ...
It's kinda hard not to notice me
Is ... where you wanna be
I can take you where you wanna go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Baby I can give what you want and everything you need
Put us both in a position where we can both succeed
And if it takes a sacrifice I promise I will bleed
All the blessings that I get I promise you'll receive
Fuck them other niggers all they do is deceive
Let me take away your pain, my job is to relieve
Uh girl I know you know the ...
It's kinda hard not to notice me
Is ... where you wanna be
I can take you where you wanna go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
