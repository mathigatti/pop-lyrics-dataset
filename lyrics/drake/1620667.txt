[Chorus: Voyce]
I, I see you sitting at home, nobody's calling you on the phone, your girls out making a night on the town while your sitting there all alone, I suggest you go with your Crew, Your looking for something to do, Cause I understand pain is love and that's exactly why I wrote this little song for you


It's for you [x3]
For you,
It's for you [x3]
For you,

[Drake:]
Ladies up north represent representing,
Ladies down south represent representing,
When the mic is in my hand I'm never hesitant,
My favorite jam back in the day was Eric E. for president it's evident,
She spend her summers in Jamaica and I love that,
They say that she should be a model shes above that,
She had a rapper break her heart had to open her,
So she don't even mess with rap only spoken word,
Well I'm a poet so you know it's get her to going down,
And after all this is my city I could show you round,
I understand that the shit you facing is crazy,
Let me hear your views on the situations in Haiti,
Or sit back relax,
Vibe witcha man,
Chill we could talk about Tribes in Sudan,
Cause you gotta understand if I said it then I meant it,
I understand that you Afro I'm tryna get to your centric,
That's why I got a bottle of champaign and then sent it,
Over where you sitting,
Notice pretend you didn't,
Along with the bottle was a note attached,
Heres some tickets to my show you should go to that,
And it's a shame money's something that you barely need to knock her,
I'm tryna treat her right cause she barely treated proper,
But you showed up regardless of late choices it's clear,
You really came to kick it it with Drake, and Amir like

[Chorus: Voyce]

It's for you [x3]
For you,
It's for you [x3]
For you,
Yea

You know that love is in the air, (You see that girl over there, I'm tryna make her smile you know what I mean, we gonna try and make a video later)
