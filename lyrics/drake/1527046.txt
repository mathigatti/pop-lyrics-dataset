I'm performin tonight you know that shit gon be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that it's exact
My ex girl i'll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck dat tho this about me
They say my whole fan base is missin id
What the young trend settin musician i be
Got critics givin up the recognition i de-serve
Never bring yo mrs. by me
I'm it i'm it call me mr. i-t
If i get one wish i'm a wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like mrs. irie
And i do
The realest in my age group, no shit
Soho, cosmo, bob mar blow fish
Let's make a toast, tell yo friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster



We doin it big
Look at what i done
Look at where i'm is
It's only just begun
Cause i was stayin home
When they was havin fun
So please don't be surprised when they announce that i won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, i deserve this shit, i deserve this shit
That's all i got to say, at the top is where i stay
And tell my haters never go away, the winner


Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It's about time that you made it
I was bumpin yo songs when nobody else played it
When i was up in hot beat in atlanta steady givin daps
Fetchin niggas drinks but i never got to rap?
If anybody asked though i prolly woulda snapped
But i can't sign nothin til my lawyer get the fax and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And mrs. murray look at what my talent did
And what yo business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it's not about who you know, it's just how you balance it
It's always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you comin the hardest
It's how you start actin when nobody can reach ya
My plan just hatched, happy easter

I'm doin it big
Look at what i done
Look at where i'm is
It's only just begun
Cause i was stayin home
When they was havin fun
So please don't be surprised when they announce that i won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, i deserve this shit, i deserve this shit
That's all i got to say
At the top is where i stay
And tell my haters never go away, the winner

Uhh, ok i do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If i'm in ya startin five you will never need a sub
And i'm neva lookin down so i always know wassup.
A lot of people sayin fuck me
Problem is they be tellin everybody but me
But i always got a starbucks verse bein brewed
Too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like chuck t's
And i never trust a nigga sayin trust me
Nick cannon and will neva did it this i'll
So you tell the house band don't you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never givin up
You deserve the world, now gon live it up
Thanks to uncle steve my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us
And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn't leave you out, you foreva in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of evelyn cher
I'll forever forgive anybody that neva was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel i hope heaven's prepared for wheneva you there...

Uhh, i got a revolutionary flow in every scenario comin through ya stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don't cry for me this ain't motha fuckin mario
Yeah, and polo isn't at my session
It's the anticipation keepin everybody guessin like

Look at what i done
Look at where i'm is
It's only just begun
Cause i was stayin home
When they was havin fun
So please don't be surprised when they announce that i won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, i deserve this shit, i deserve this shit
That's all i got to say
At the top is where i stay
And tell my haters never go away, the winner
