[Dirty Money]
So hard to breathe this air that we call love,
aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
when you get hurt by the one you living for,
Pain can make you wanna love no more,


[Chorus]
Loving you no more,
i just i cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself,
(x2)
Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly,
so many lonely sleepless nights,
Im going through hell to convince you love me,
but never her approval no matter how I try,
the way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
momma always told me to respect the woman,
but what am I to do when her parents do not try,
So many tears I cried,
but all for nothing I'm afraid to say,
oooooohhh

[Chorus]
I've been so dependent on your love for so long,
punishment for me is trying to let go,
give it from your heart is what you taught me,
addiction to pain is what it got me,
my life, now its changed,
my life aint the same as you are,
heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it,
if I can't have what mean most to me,
So many tears I cried,
but all for nothing I'm afraid to say,


[Chorus]

[Drake]
Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause I've drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there's pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear that's sittin in the dryer
How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that's the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I'm gone do
Since everything I'm trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh, you see the same one I'm missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure
[Chorus]
[End]
