Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be drivin', it just got so much harder
Can't even see straight, I can't even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause ni**as die a lot, and lie a lot
But I'm the truth that's right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You Girl, you right there, you look like you like this sh*t
How'd I know, how'd I know? Guess me on some psychic sh*t
I can tell lie if you asking me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Reppin' bitches, reppin' bitches bitches
And reppin' reppin' them bitches until all of us switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody as me who I was
I'm the greatest man I said def before I knew I was
That's whats important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing "walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown ni**a, ah"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately i've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Ni**a, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it


Ni**a, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Ni**a, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other ni**as)

Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these ni**as got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the sh*t that she like
So why am I a classic, this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that term-end papers they won't get me paid
If I don't nothing I'mma ball
I'm countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways
