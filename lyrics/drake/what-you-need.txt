[Intro]
Do you hold me close [4x]


[Verse 1]
I just wanna take you there
He don't got to go no where
Does he touch you here like this
Let me take this wishing from your lips

And I will love you girl
The way you need
Ain't no one gone stop us
Ain't no one gone stop us
And I will give you girl
What you fein
I'm the drug in your vein
Just fight throught the pain

[Chorus]
He's what you want [x4]
I'm what you need
What you need [x2]
I'm what you need
What you need [x2]

[Verse 2]
I got everything you want with me
I do everything he does times three
And he ain't don't got to go
I got you on the floor
Doing things you'll never thought you'll do
Baby leave those high heel shoes
'Cuz I love it when your looking down at me
And when I'm looking up at you
And I don't give damn
Shawty watch me knock your boots off

And I will love you girl
The way you need
Ain't no one gone stop us
Ain't no one gone stop us
And I will give you girl
What you fein
I'm the drug in your vein
Just fight throught the pain

[Chorus]
He's what you want [x4]
I'm what you need
What you need [x2]
I'm what you need
What you need [x2]
