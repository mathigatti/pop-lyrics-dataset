Yeah, yeah

It started off with a round of applause
Cheers to my women who ?
Who never been a heartbreaker, got a mind about it
Thought I had that, but I was wrong lemme tell ya bout it


She was like my angel from way up above,
She cried from the sky, she would shower me with love

Had her over every day, every single day I did
Started gettin careless, so next thing you know we made a kid
She was like mmm, I was like yess!
I hope we have a son, watch this nigga be the best
And right around june she took a plane &amp; it was too late
I did the math &amp; found out her due date was

In julyyyyy there were fireworks exploding,
But now it's getting colder the leaves are turning colors,
Ask me whyyyy it's just not our season
The one &amp; only reason, ahhh

Uh, this verse starts as my snipers hit they marks
And ya guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like clap, clap let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let em all go
And most women are motivated, so I act accordingly,
But this is so refreshing that it means a lil more to me
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be
I provide protection if you open the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates,
Couple "I think that were ready's", couple "I think we should waits"
Are we actin like a couple? I'm just trynna get it straight
Cause I'm over here convinced that it's too early for mistakes &amp; man

Ohh, we had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there's only cloudy days, I can't stand the rain
In julyyyyy there were fireworks exploding,
But now it's getting colder the leaves are turning colors,
Ask me whyyyy it's just not our season
The one &amp; only reason, baby oh baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

Damn, tell me where did all the magic go?
I followed the rules &amp; told ya everything ya had to know
Had ya over every night, every night was passionate
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident

Cause she was supposed to be my shawty, my baby
? this crazy

I put your life in front of mine because that's where you asked to be,
Sayin I don't treat you the same, so now you askin me
Who cares chivarly, they need to get they sentencing
Meanwhile we arguin, &amp; I can't get a sentence in
And just as I was hangin up the phone, she told me to hold on
Cause she's finally comin home in july

In julyyyyy (yes) there were fireworks exploding,
But now it's getting colder (it's getting colder) the leaves are turning colors,
Ask me whyyyy it's just not our season
The one &amp; only reason baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

See
Wassup
It's funny cause,
Yeah?
I never thought this would end
Listen baby, it's not gonna end
But then the season changed

Can we, can we bring it back though?
(You were my, you were my, you were my love
You done made, you done made, you done made my world)

Cause you are my girl, &amp; I wanted you to be my world
So I'm a do everything to make sure you happy
{Watcha say}

Keep faithful, keep faithful, keep faithful, keep faithful
Scream jullyy, then they'll turn into a butterfly
