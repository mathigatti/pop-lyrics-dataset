My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'


[Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

[Lil Wayne]
Ahem, my name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard workin'
Bizarre circus, that's when my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down
So over-stand me
I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana
And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'
And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick
Your girl singin' to my shit, like, "a-la-la-lollipop"
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I freak that pussy better
Better than her gynecologist, ho just
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick, old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damn, all I got is one dick

[Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

I got the talk, the beat and bass
Give me one, I'll take it, make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace
I break it, break it you can't stop me in this ra-race

I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
