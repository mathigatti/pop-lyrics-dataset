Yeah, woo

I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll
Told you I couldn't really draw the line
Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind


I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind to you come up
Work all winter
Shine all summer
Ride for your brother
Die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vaca to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta'
Your friends say they miss ya'
But they don't really miss ya'

Rule number one, be a boss ass bitch
Never let a clown nigga try to play you
If he play you, then rule number two
Is fuck his best friends and make 'em yes men (okay)
(Wow, that's how you feel?)

I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time and it left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with my
Mindin' my business and you show up
Up turn over, I should've seen the signs
Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try to get you off my mind

I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind to you come up
Work all winter
Shine all summer
Ride for your brother
Die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vaca to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta'
Your friends say they miss ya'
But they don't really miss ya'

What the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga? Custom down?
What the fuck, I ain't smokin' hot? Bust me down?
You the same clown nigga that was runnin' me down
Now you all up in my 'cause you wanna be down?
(Wow, that's how you feel?)
