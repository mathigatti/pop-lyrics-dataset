Wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing


You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
(What did you do to me?
Do-do-do-do)
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

What did you do to me?
(Do-do-do-do)
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
(Do to me?
Do-do-do-do)
Do, ooh, no
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
Just know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see a young nigga suffer

You, you, you, know, know, oh woah
That's not the way to get over me
That's not the way to get over
(What did you do to me?
Do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do-do)
(What did you do to me?
Do-do-do-do)
That's not the way to get over
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
(Do to me?
Do-do-do-do)
Do, ooh, no
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
