Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like
Fo real
This life shit, is everywhere you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much
You, you, you
Baby wanna take it down, throw it up
Baby wanna take it down, throw it up
I'll take it down


Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your new york condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?

Why are we rushing and forcing it, this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things
That don't even mean nothing, girl
We can we not find the time
And sit down and discuss it, girl
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw, man

Me and you are playing house, tart think that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women, cuz you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I just get lost up in the 6

And you never come to where stay
You just rather stay up in your new york condo
You don't ever come to where stay
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situation can get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw man
