I wanna see whats under there. baby


Who's that peeking in my window? (uhhh)
You should let some more skin show?
And if one of these websites get the info
We can work it out, no nintendo
I just hit alt....tab
Switchin' in-between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring em both here to the condo (yeah)
Normally, it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So i pray that we never lose the connection
'cause i remember stacy, she probably hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talked that shit, i just hit the escape key
And then she'd get mad and want to go and erase me
I remember amy, she used to aim me
She stayed up late, and used to blame me
She say i'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her 'even photoshop couldn't change me?
But you-you-you you got me open, girl, why lie?
We ain't even tryin' to settle, so why try?
End the night with a kiss and a bye-bye
No strings attached your love is so wifi



Girl girl girl girl girl girl
She's my digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
She's my digital girl


My homies never see you but i always got you right here for me (yeah)
Tucked in my louis computer bag
Wherever you are i could be
I type you a message full of x and o
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though i hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day i'll have your ass up in this kitchen
My digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
She's my digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
My digital girl


Not a day goes by shawty
Without you on my mind shawty
Donna karen underwear, baby
(i swear you have nothing to worry about.
It's easy look, lemme explain)
I wanna see what's under there, baby


When you see the picture cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the mc search till i reach third base
And when i get home imma hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date
'ye the picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend ca-cold cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
And playboy mags like stacy dash
Or kim kardash and be a lady aaaat it
You know what's the crazy thing
Some girls?ll make you wait longer than ac green
Passion of the christ, 33 year old virgin
That's disrespectful baby don't encourage him
I like them brown yellow puerto rican or persian
Dashiki kimono or turban
They say i dress white but my swag so urban
Tryin' my look
I hit her with the text said baby you up
Question mark
And she respond yes-s-s-i-r??.r?..hard?hard

Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
Oh she is my digital girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
My girl, my girl, my girl  etc?
Dream, drizzy, j foxx and yeazy
How do it feel to run the world?
Rhetorical question
