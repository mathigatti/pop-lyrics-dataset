I got money that I saved then I'm back on road...
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
(Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back...)


I'm just an East Atlanta nigga with a body on this belt
I done had a million beefs, but I ain't never call for help
I'll take a nigga's bricks and I done took a nigga reup
Put that rifle on your partner made him shit all on himself

Got your bitch so fuckin' drunk
That she done threw up on herself
'Fore I send her back to you
She gon have guwop on her breath
I'm the last real nigga left, I'm on an island by myself
I'm my only competition so I'm battling with myself

Facing prison, drug addiction
It's like I'm battling with myself
I done shook up all my demons
Now I'm back to myself
You done keep it real nigga so just keep it to yourself
Waiting on Gucci Mane to call you
Better hold your breath

I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back

These niggas faking like they happy
But they mad I'm home
I'm the 2K16 Al Capone
I slap a nigga with a strap
And then I throw him a hammer
He be like: Fuck going to trial, Man just throw me the money

Can't eat, can't sleep
Man I miss these skreets
Muhammad Ali and these skreets miss me
I went from trappin' on the block to niggas trappin' for me

I left the trappin' went to rap thought you’d be happy for me
And then your jealousy turned to hate
And you wrote a statement on me
But when they let me out the gates, my bitch was waiting on me
See I ain’t mad at you homie, we ain’t got no beef
But I ain’t got no rat for you, I know you must love cheese

I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone

(Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back)
