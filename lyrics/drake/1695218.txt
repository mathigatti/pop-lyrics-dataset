I said tell me what's really going on?
Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happening?
Gone for surgery, but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfucking scratch and win


World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothing ever changes, so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice

(Drake you got 'em right?) Yeah, I got 'em Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Nick's got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ's got my credit cards and a lot of ones

Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple sprite
Someone tell Malaya I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call her King of Diamonds and tell China it be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stacking dollars to the perfect height

Work something, let's work something basis
She just tryna make it, so she's right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her, but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another

That's why me and Lil Jazz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feeling sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for do right and kill everything

I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it
And girl I'm fucking serious, I'm with it if you with it
'Cause your verses turn me on, and your pants are mighty fitted

Uh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealing flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't no rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin'

[Chorus - Drake]
'Cause it's on, yeah girl it's on
You know what it is, when I finally make it home
I just want that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah, I hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone

[Lil Wayne]

Oh shit, motherfucker, goddamn
Kicking bitches out the condo like Pam
Getting money everyday, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball

I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy, but I ain't asthmatic

Jay's buyin' cologne, honey i put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes

Young Money Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish, but I do pack bone

Uh, I'm a love machine, and I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her because the Bugatti a coupe
It's blood gang slam but I party with Snoop

I ain't lying I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegatable like you lining soup
And when I'm in the booth, shit the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group

Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gonna kill 'em
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim
Mamma say if the rules ain't bent don't bend 'em

Real nigga talking, shut the fuck up hoe
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up Zoe?
Weezy F Baby, and the F is for Front do'
'Cause that's where I bring it, so if you bang it, motherfucker

[Chorus - Drake]
'Cause it's on, yeah girl it's on
You know what it is, when I finally make it home
I just want that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah, I hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
