Uh
Black hearts on cardigan
At the crib tellin' ya girl that we should order in
And tell g to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn, I'm so catch-trina smarter than a lot of these niggas
Swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself, suicide bars I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I'll bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Antidote, tell 'em I deserve a mazeltov
I'm rappin' like a shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can hear the critics talking over the applause
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love x and o
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck
It's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than ya dreams are
I gotcha dream girl, ridin' in ya dream car
Yah, and the visual is stunnin'
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations


So, what you want an award or somethin'?
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'
I see nothin' from afar, but I'm far from nothin'
Put on your poker face
I'll pull ya card if ya bluffin'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull ya card and find out you're a hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like weezy first week 1 point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on mars can you pick me up from jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, note it on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down
When I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never be my ass, pause
Again, damnit ya'll? Again?
Y'all, pretend that we are some men that get it on and in
I'll die before I lose, cause I was born to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game, but I won't father them
Right, uh

It's like
These days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me drake, footz named me drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nuthin' but a protégé
But if you watched the vma's there's nuthin' more to say
I got the key to happiness, and all the copies
Remember this day like ya bought a poppy
And damn how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say get it off your chest
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talking, I bet I'm what they discussion bout
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention

It's crack
A yo drizzy, you shoulda said that on the hook
You shoulda been like
Congratulations, it's crack
Yeah
It's crack (ha ha)
Congratulations
Ladies and gentlemen
