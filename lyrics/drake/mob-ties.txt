Fuck what it was
It is what is it
Whatever you did
It is what is it
And I'm so tired

I fuck with the mob and I got ties
Knock you off to pay their tithes
They want me gone but they don't know why
It's too late for all that lovey dovey shit
I'm your brother shit, all that other shit
It's too late for all that
It's too late for all that, ayy

Your bitch in the Escada (sick, sick, sick, sick)

Yeah, and they shook
Please don't let them fool ya, I don't care how they look
Heard all of the talkin', now it's quiet, now it's shush
29 is comin', they on edge when I cook
Lead the league in scorin' man, but look at my assists
[?] With Future but I like to reminisce
I do not forget a thing, I'm patient, it's a gift
Try to tell 'em they ain't got to do it, they insist
Yeah, I can tell
I just gave them two for $40 million like Chappelle
Standing over coffin with a hammer and a nail
Heard you hit up so and so, that name don't ring a bell, nah

Nah, sick of these niggas
Hire some help
Get rid of these niggas
Sick of this shit
I'm runnin' a blitz
Whatever you did
It is what is it
And I'm so tired

I fuck with the mob and I got ties
Knock you off to pay their tithes
They want me gone but they don't know why
It's too late for all that lovey dovey shit
I'm your brother shit, all that other shit
It's too late for all that
It's too late for all that, ayy
It's too late for all that lovey dovey shit
