Man, fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout to all my asian girls Dim sum
Shots came I don't know where they descend from
Probably some bad hoes I'm bout to take ya hem from


Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only the real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I'm just playing the field, nigga

Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Don't I got that shit the World wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?

Man all of your flows just bore me... paint drying
I'm never tripping over anything that ain't mine
I'm hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time

It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I didn't notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
And the kids wearing crowns over here and everything is alright

Drake killed it!
