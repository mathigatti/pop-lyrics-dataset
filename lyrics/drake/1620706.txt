Aah ahaan ahaan
look
i let the beat bang i don't claim colors,
honestly the honesty is why the game love us,
my women eat the senephones on the main covers,
stunt so hard i make these niggas hate summer,
and pray for winner but when its winner time,
i still waiting on these niggas at the finish line,
we just took our first trip to the maficos,
couple days on the beach then its adios,
killer,
just look what i done alone,
you were swear we planted trees the way the money is grown,
we been busy like some bees no honey cone,
and you could probally fill the breeze when the money is blown,
part it my towel and flip flop face,
i never be the reason that bitch got paid,
even when i am not function in a tip top shade,
i got bench as much as hip hop weighs, Drizzy


(Chorus)
Ahh imma trynna bring it home even if i gotta do it on my own,
imma mother****in killer killer killer killer,
Ahh and i am the one the blame not i am around should never be the same,
killer killer killer killer nigga

before rap
my last name was my lifestyle
and when i visualize success
it look like right now
what was once gray skies
is now white clouds
and i did it with the ones ya said was not the right crowd
follow my steps
and you see what im bout
i keep my money comin in
and never goin out
from chuck taylors on the pavement with the blammers out
then i hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
and now my face bring the cameras out
that young nigga these industry bitches yap about
you know the one the cops bunk you up and ask about
all because i took my wildest dreams and then mapped em out
i go for mine like its overtime
me and my niggaz had to struggle so we over shine
been fuck bitches
i been on my grind
cuz on a mission your worst enemy is idle time
