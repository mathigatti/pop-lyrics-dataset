People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekends here started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends
That you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing


Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
Just may already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice
Then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekends here started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too. There's things we might discover
Cause you got a path and I do too, we're perfect for each other

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
Just may already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I stevie wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last.

But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
Just may already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
