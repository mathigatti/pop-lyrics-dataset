Two door bugatti coupe
I call it katy perry
Wiz khalifa papers
Smoking my favourite berry's
S65 i call it rihanna
It got a red top but it's white like madonna
Made man you hear what i said
Having a slumber party all my bitches counting bread
Made man also known as papi chulo
And i'm running straight up in the culo
My wrist always on frio call me chilly chill
Super head and super head and i really will
Californication motivation in my pocket
Got on my blue dickie shout out my n-gga roccett
Still smoking sickie it aint no other option
Not for made n-ggas and i'm never stopping
I raised the bar i set the standards
My yayo usher raymond that b-tch just keep on dancing


[chorus]
Dollar bills on top of dollar bills
Thats all im throwing if she wont her momma will
Made n-ggas talking a lot of skrill
8 digits a n-gga tryna live
Made man you hear what i said
I got a hundred squares
If you scared called the feds
Made men i'm screaming dollar bills
Park the trunk on the porsche
There they go dollar bills

Riding round the city plastic cup of henny
Find a n-gga like me truth to be told i don't know many
I say shout my driver lauren thats 62 with curtains
Cant see shit i don't know where the f-ck i'm at for certain
When it boils down i'm just a t.o n-gga
But bitches tell me that i look just like a creole n-gga
New orleans know it's love everytime i'm in town
Shout out my n-gga 'tez thats my brother my round
Spending tomorrows money i call it maana
Off the rack just aint my style i call it designer
One of my baddest women ever i call her rihanna
But thats cause her name is rihanna!
I'm in the condo just posting watching miami kill
I might just walk to the arena and watch it for real
Ashes to ashes me rozay and khaled
Smoking bull riders shit moving slow as a ballad
Tattoo on your ass it'd be nice if you show me
I'm buying bitches furs mike tyson naomi
I've got the right to do it it's only right to do it
Love me some head and i love a woman that likes to do it
Still love my team aint no other option
Not for made n-ggas and i'm never stopping
I'm damon wayans just know that homie don't play that
You know we running my n-gga young money maybach

[chorus]

Black panorama i call it t-pain
I got my autotune that bitch insane
Got my revolver too i call it ving rhames
You still a baby boy we doing big things
Street n-ggas you hear what i said
I got some bad news jabar back in the feds
Facing twenty he just did a dime
Been out a year look like he finna ride
Genocide these people killing time
Throw you in a hole you must be penalised
Soon as you see success haters reinvest
Miami gardens drive half a million nothing less
Raised the bar i set the standards
My yayo mc hammer that bitch just keep on dancing
Michael jackson let it moonwalk
Set it on the napkin let it cool off

[chorus]
