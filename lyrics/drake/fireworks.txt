[Drake - Verse 1:]
Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin’ down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear them talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I’m slowly embracing it
Doesn’t come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who I’m racing with
And you can see I’m pacing it so that I’m always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers own, but its looking like July 4
I just wish they’d let you try it first
This time I’m really going off, fireworks


[Drake Bridge:]
Today it begins
I missed them before but won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means.

[Alicia Keys - Chorus:]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like fireworks

[Drake - Verse 2:]
I’m just such a gentleman
You should give it up for me
Look at how I’m placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn’t love I just thought you fuck with me
Who could've predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious and I’ll never forget it baby
What an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
Their was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes
Fireworks!

[Drake Bridge]

[Alicia Keys Chorus]

[Drake - Verse 3:]
Everything the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he’s still got his foot out, guilt trippin’
It’s been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city I let her explore
And now she’s sayin’ she’s more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents’ marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I’m flying back home for the heritage classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
Let’s stay together ’til we’re ghosts
I want to witness love, I’ve never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that’s why I’m really going off
Fireworks!

[Drake Bridge]
