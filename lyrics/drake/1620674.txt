It may not mean nothing to yall(yeah)
but understand nothing was done for me(the blunt is lit)

Drake:(Verse)
I am so unsigned, it would blow ones mind cus every single record I am so unkind
There are no hoes ???,
There is no love loss
Nigga this that crack and you know drugs cost
So P A Y U P, I dont think you'll ever find another nigga like me never L I E, I got everything I tell em I got
This Young nigga show boat, like Im sellin a yaut, ya heared me
Who else trying to smoke ya nigga me too
Cuz take my mind off the pressure is what weed do
Ya girl wetter than the bottom of a ski doo
And take a bitch from any nigga iwhat we do
So bite down hoe or get the right dentist
I told Wayne In goin in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots to who its meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that 10-4

Drake:(Chorus)
It may not mean nothin to yall
but understand nothin was done for me
So I dont plan on stoppin at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man
Im shuttin shit down at the mall
And tellin every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planin to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man,ever man, ever man

Kid Kid:(Verse)
Put on my O.J. gloves and go on kill this shit
Make a plumer throw his plunger, like I cant deal with this shit
Uh, they say Im throwed of I stay on pitch
Uh, the flow aint formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch Im back on my shit like a fly
Since you want to be fly, throw you off the roof fly! ha
Like a cookie take a dookies on the rapper loos leaf
And throw the trash ad out the window like mookie
To a shark your just sushi,
You aint hard your coockie
Wally oochie, soft as a new born bootie
I said the movement slow, Im just thinking fast
Look back, I aint behind
Ya, Im bout to lap your ass and nigga I dont rest, Im up till my times up
Ive been a tech shelfer, all my beef prime cut
This aint punch lines,
Nigga your punch lyin
Cuz the only punch you ever gave was Hawaiian ha

Drake:(Chorus)
It may not mean nothin to yall
but understand nothin was done for me
So I dont plan on stoppin at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man
Im shuttin shit down at the mall
And tellin every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planin to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man,ever man, ever man
