Listen to my bassman, he is lavender
His woman is his bass and he is loving her, loving her
Listen to the sounds he's giving
As he is living
True to lavender


Listen to the things my friend is saying now
A poetry of notes as he is playing now, playing now
Listen to the tales he's telling
Magic bass compelling
Lavender

Listen to my bass man, he is lavender
His fingerboard's a highway, he's a traveler, traveler
Listen to his fingers making music
Hear his soul embarking
Lavender

Listen to my bass man, he is lavender
