There are times when I see you, Baby
Looking back the way we came
Through some hard places, choices we made
You never held me to blame
But you had some dreams when you were a girl
Some ideas about the world
And you see how some things will never be the same
(And how some things never change)


And I remember how you helped me, Baby
And all the times you had my back
And how you wrapped me in your sweetness
And held my eyes with your eyes
When my train was off the track
Now I've got some things that I want to do
And I want to do them with you
If you'll just stand by me, and don't look back

And never stop coming up with all of that love for me
Never stop coming with your faith in what a love can be
Never stop coming up with all of that lovev Keep on rising above
And never stop coming up on the world love wants to see

And the world has been showing you how
It's no place for your tender heart now
In a world that keeps turning you down
Only the heart knows where the strength can be found

Never stop coming up with all of that love for me
Never stop coming with your faith in what a love can be
Never stop coming up with all of that love
Keep on rising above
And never stop coming up on the world love wants to see

Remember when you look into my eyes
I'm the one who took you by surprise
The time has come and gone and come back 'round again
And I'm still here to take you by surprise my friend

Show me your eyes, tell me again
Where you want to go
Now the night is glowing beneath your skin
And when you smile I'm the richest man I know
