I got my head down between my knees
I got my back against this bedroom wall
I hear my voice saying baby please
But I know you don't hear me call


You're staring at that far horizon
I don't even know why you stay
It's like you're already miles and miles away

We got this life so far turned around
We only talk about what happened last
We try to move ahead but we're losing ground
To the heartache and the pain of the past

Staring at that far horizon
I don't even know why I stay
You're already miles and miles away.

Miles Away
From these sad deliberations
From a life in disarray
And all these recriminations
And these stones all in your passway

You got this rage choking up your voice
And you're behaving like an orphan child
I want to be your friend but I got no choice
Than to fight when you're so mean and wild

Staring at that far horizon
I don't even know why you stay
It's like you're already miles and miles away

Miles Away
From these sad deliberations
From the innocence betrayed
The abandoned expectations
And the stones that we have laid
