In the time we've known
That we each are a part of one another
We've lost as much as we have won
And as our lives have grown
We have found that it only brings us pain
That hangs on to the things that we have done
Still I've loved the times you've come


When you went away
Taking all that I'd built my false road on
I dropped my life and couldn't find the pieces
Now you come and go
And it's hard but I feel my strength returning
We'll see how far this new road reaches
We'll see a little more each time we come

Now everybody's gonna tell you it's not worth it
Everybody's gotta show you their own thing
You might try to find your way up around it
But the need for love will still remain

Now we're lying here
So safe in the ruins of our pleasures
Laughter marks the place where we have fallen
And our lives are near
So it wouldn't occur to us to wonder
Is this the past or the future that is calling

You know I've loved these times you've come.
