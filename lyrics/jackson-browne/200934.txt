Baby, I'm around you enough to know when you're coming down
And I am there with a smile, prepared to bring you around
You're thinking that you've got me trained
I'm aware of that
But when you need your outlook changed
Baby, I'm the cat


Baby, I'm allowed to be late when I'm coming home
You know I'll be there when I want to
And you let me roam
You think you've got me figured out
I don't know about that
But when you want to twist and shout
Baby, I'm the cat

Baby, I might not be all that
Your fortune cookie promised you
But I will do
I'm the cat
Baby I . . . Baby I'm the cat
Oh yeah . . . Baby I'm the cat

Baby, I'm in love with the way you scratch my back
You've got the only thing I want
And that's a fact
And when sometimes we disagree
You take me to the mat
But when I get you spinning free
Baby I'm the cat

Baby, I might not be all that
The gypsy woman prophesized
But be advised
I'm the cat
Baby I might not be all that
Your Magic 8 Ball said I'd be
But you will see
I'm the cat
Baby I . . . Baby I'm the cat
Oh yeah . . . Baby I'm the cat
