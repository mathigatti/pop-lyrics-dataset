Well it came to me as you came,
You don't even know my name.
You'd just as soon be fucking a doornob,
You asshole you.


You'll fuck anything that moves,
And I'll tell you what that proves:
You just want meat, you don't want me,
You asshole you.

Well you wish that I was stronger,
and could last a little longer.
I get so mad that I could spit.
I don't need that kind of shit.

Well you toyed with my affection,
And you laughed at my errection,
And its lack of circumsection,
You asshole you.
