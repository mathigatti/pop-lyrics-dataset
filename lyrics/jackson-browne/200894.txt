I'm a moody and swirling pool, lost in some dark wood
Angry at a million things and more
I can do no good
Ah, but sometimes -


Sometimes i'm a growing blade of grass
Washed by the rain, bent by the wind

I'm a deeply wounded lonely tree
Lost in my own way
Brooding on the saddest things and worse
I've seen my better day

I'm an old and broken tumbleweed
Lost on faded sands
Dreaming of my yesterdays before
I watch the heat waves dance
