Sometimes i lie awake at night and wonder
Where my life will lead me
Waiting to pass under sleep's dark and silent gate


I found my love too late
Running around day after day
Looking for the time to play
While my old friends slipped away

Never should have had to try so hard
To make a love work out, i guess
I don't know what love has got to do with happiness
But the times when we were happy
Were the times we never tried

Sitting down by the highway
Looking down the road
Waiting for a ride
I don't know where i've been
Wishing i could fly away
Don't know where i'm going
Wishing i could hide
Oh god this is some shape i'm in
When the only thing that makes me cry
Is the kindness in my baby's eye

Sometimes i lie awake at night and wonder
Where the years have gone
They have all passed under
Sleep's dark and silent gate
