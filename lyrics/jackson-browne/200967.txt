As the early morning filters through
My shuttered window pane
I look about and realize
That things are still the same


These flowers in a glass
Mark the hours that have passed
As I lay sleeping

And I can hear my footsteps ringing
Down the empty morning street
And the concrete that I walk upon
Is cold beneath my feet

A single winging dove
Reminds me of the sleeping love
That I am leaving

'Cause everyone must someday do his own thing
'Cause everyone must someday do his own thing
And I have a brand new song to sing

In the morning skies the stars
Begin to sputter and to fade
As the night surrenders all its claim
On shadows it has made

A watchdog's hungry bark
Is the morning's first remark
Upon my walking

And everyone must someday do his own thing
And everyone must someday do his own thing
And I have a brand new song to sing

And I'm told that if I try
That I can do most anything
Well then I would like to sing a song
And make this morning ring

As the morning turns to day
Hear the waking city say
Who is that singing
