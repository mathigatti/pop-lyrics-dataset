I'm hanging on to my peace of mind
I just don't know
I'm hanging on to those good times, baby
Just want to let them roll
I'm gonna make it to the light and joy
I'll tell you why
I got a woman who can take me there
the apple of my eye
oh, I just don't know, no no, no, no
I love her so
Don't let me see that morning paper
cause I don't need those dues
it's just the same old murder movie
but they call it the news
I'll tell you what would be some story
and what would set me free
Is if the same thing happened to everybody
that just happened to me, oh,
I just don't know, no, no, no, no
I'll never let her go
Every time I hear somebody sneakin'
up behind whoa, I turn around
but I still hear that sound
and just when I'm about to lose my mind
Here comes my baby
singing like a nightingale
Coming my way down along that devastation
trail well tell the Lord above
she's got a brand of love
that cannot fail
I'm hanging on to my peace of mind
that's no lie
I'm hanging on to my special friend
the apple of my eye
my inspiration, too
she's got a lead on my heart and
my soul and she knows just what to do
oh, I just don't know, no ,no, no, no
No, I get so low, and my mind's about to go
but wait a minute, here comes my baby
singing like a nightingale
coming my way down along that devastation trail
Well, let the fires burn, let the
floods return
we will prevail
Hanging on to my peace of mind
I just don't know
