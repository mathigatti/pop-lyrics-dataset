As I saw you, you were looking through your window
Looking at the clouds to know which way the wind blows
You saw me - I was walking down your highway
You didn't need a cloud to know the wind was blowing my way
You didn't need a cloud to know the wind was blowing my way
And wasn't it fine
All the questions and the answers were mine


I sang you a song about my walking
A song I felt I had no right or reason to sing
But you showed me that no matter what is said in song
A singer has the right to sing as long as he can go on
A singer has the right to sing as long as he can go on
And isn't it true
Now all the questions and the answers come from you
