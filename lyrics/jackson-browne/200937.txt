In my mind
The golden silver statues turn to tin
And I find
Confidence is just a place I've been
In my mind


I was kind
When poppa's begging friendship came to me
I was blind
To think it would be easy to be free
In my time

I've not lied
I tried to save the pride I hold within
When I denied
Happiness is just a room I'm in
In my time

In my mind
The golden silver statues turn to tin
And I find
Happiness is just a place I've been
In my time
