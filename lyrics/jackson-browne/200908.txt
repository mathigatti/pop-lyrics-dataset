Lying next to you in the dark
Listening to your pounding heart
The sheets are tangled around your waist
I watch the dream moving on your face
Feel you shake, hear your cries
Running in the dark trying to open your eyes
Come on baby, wake up


I've followed you across the days and years
Been there for the thrills and the tears
Chasing you from state to state
Waking, dreaming, I try to relate
Why should I be somebody you fear
When you're asleep and I'm so near?
Don't even know why I'm in your dreams
I got control over none of these things
Morning comes, hard and bright
And I'm exhausted from running after you all night
Chasing you into the light

Yeah I've been reaching for you baby
As if I could reach you when you dream at night
But I never can quite

I ain't lying here awake by myself
You better wake up
There's something I want to talk to you about
You better wake up
I love you girl, tell the world I do
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you
I want to rescue you like you rescued me
From a life of doubt and uncertainty
That's why I'm chasing you
Chasing you into the light

Go for a walk on the pier with me baby
Now as the dawn comes over the night
Watching the stars in the sky disappear maybe
You'll find a way to let go of your fright
The sea is deep, the world is wide
Ships are leaving for the other side
This whole city will be waking soon
And in the east
Clouds are strung out behind the moon
Chasing her into the light
Wake up
