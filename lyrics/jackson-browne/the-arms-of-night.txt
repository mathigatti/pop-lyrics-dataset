The things people do
Looking for understanding
Defiantly standing
If only they knew
If love they seek is truly to be found
Into the arms of night
With the dreams of time
In the endless flight
Through the fading light


The places you go
Thinking that love may find you
And love is behind you
It's all you can do
To let the angels find their own way home
Into the arms of night
With your endless fright
With your face of light
And your prayer in sight
Into the breach
In search of the new
Though after so many times
You'll have betrayed them too

Into the arms of night
With your endless fright
With your eyes all bright
And your prayer in sight
Into the arms of somebody new
Until there's no longer soul
And you are no longer true
