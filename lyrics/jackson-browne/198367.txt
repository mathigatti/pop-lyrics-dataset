You hold a life there in your hands
You probably don't know
Somehow your dreams became my plans
Somewhere long ago
Think about the things we've done and where we've been
Your touch made me a king
I don't want to live without your love again
I'll do anything


To make you see what I'm imagining
To know the pleasure your smile can bring
To keep the light from vanishing
I'll do anything

I fly this airplane upside down
I walk out on the wing
To see you watching from the ground
I'll do anything
When I see the light upon your upturned face
I can hear the angels sing
Don't ever let another take my place
I'll do anything

To make you see what I'm imagining
To know the pleasure your smile can bring
To keep the light from vanishing
I'll do anything

I make this world a place for you and me
I make your happiness my responsibility
To make this world the world you want to see
I'll do anything

When I see the light upon your upturned face
I can hear the angels sing
To see that no one ever takes my place
I'll do anything

To make you see what I'm imagining
To know the pleasure your smile can bring
To keep the light from vanishing
I'll do anything
