Open the door, baby turn on the light
We're gonna have a party tonight
For a rocker
For a rocker


I know it's late and you're already down
You ain't ready for people around
I'm gonna tell you something i found out
Whatever you think your life is about
Whatever life may hold in store
Things will happen that you won't be ready for

I've got a shirt so unbelievably bright
I'm gonna dig it out and wear it tonight
For a rocker
For a rocker
For a rocker
For a rocker

Don't have to change, don't have to be sweet
Gonna be too many people to possibly meet
Don't have to feed 'em, they don't eat
They've got their power supplies in the soles of their feet
They exist for one thing, and one thing only
To escape living the lives of the lonely

For a friend of mine, from the neighborhood
Moving down the line, after tonight he'll be gone for good

Here comes ricky, danny, and doerge
They got petie's number and they're looking at me
Russell and bobby setting up the drums
Gonna pound on 'till the landlord comes
Don't want to argue, i don't want to fight
But there will definitely be a party tonight
For a rocker
For a rocker
For a rocker
For a rocker

'till the morning comes, 'till the car arrives
'till we kill the drums, 'till we lose our lives

Hey jenny, tell peggy sue
We're gonna do the only thing you can do
For a rocker
For a rocker
For a rocker
For a rocker
There's a party tonight!
There's a party tonight!
There's a party tonight!
There's a party tonight!
