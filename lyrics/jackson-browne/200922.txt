Everybody i talk to is ready to leave
With the light of the morning
They've seen the end coming down long enough to believe
That they've heard their last warning
Standing alone
Each has his own ticket in his hand
And as the evening descends
I sit thinking 'bout everyman


Seems like i've always been looking for some other place
To get it together
Where with a few of my friends i could give up the race
And maybe find something better
But all my fine dreams
Well thought out schemes to gain the motherland
Have all eventually come down to waiting for everyman

Waiting here for everyman-
Make it on your own if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go i understand
Waiting here for everyman-
Don't ask me if he'll show - baby i don't know

Make it on your own if you think you can
Somewhere later on you'll have to take a stand
Then you're going to need a hand

Everybody's just waiting to hear from the one
Who can give them the answers
And lead them back to that place in the warmth of the sun
Where sweet childhood still dances
Who'll come along
And hold out that strong and gentle father's hand?
Long ago i heard someone say something 'bout everyman

Waiting here for everyman-
Make it on your own if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go i understand

I'm not trying to tell you that i've seen the plan
Turn and walk away if you think i am-
But don't think too badly of one who's left holding sand
He's just another dreamer, dreaming 'bout everyman
