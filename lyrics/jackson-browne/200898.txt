Time will come when we know what happened here
Change will come in time and make it clear
We learn one thing if we learn at all
In the secret wars we call our lives
Anything can happen


We watch the days, we make our plans
We change in ways a life demands
But what ever pleasure this life may allow
I'll give you the love i have for you now
Because anything can happen

In a world so full of fear
Dreams are whispered in the dead of night
And people disappear
But you hear my heart and you know i'm still here
Although you know and i know you know
While i swear i'll never let you go
Anything can happen

Yeah, if this love can happen here
Anything can

We watch the days we make our plans
We change in ways a life demands
I'll always remember this time, this place
The hope in your voice, the light on your face
Because anything can happen

In a world so full of pain
People give their lives to making war
And we call those people sane
But i love you where your dreams remain
Though you never say it anymore
One day there'll be an end to this war
And who knows
We may see what we're here for
Anything can happen

Yeah, if this love has found us here
Anything can
Can happen
