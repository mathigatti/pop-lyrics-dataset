Here's to lights and virtues
Here's to truths yet to be known
Knowledge to light the darkness
The search for things of your own


Here's to lights and virtues
Here's to reaching higher ground
A life of hope and purpose
Here's to strength yet to be found
Honor - though it goes unrecognized
And truth - though liars abound

The pleasure of love and friendship
The courage to be alone
