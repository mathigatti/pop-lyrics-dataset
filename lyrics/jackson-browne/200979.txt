I used to lay out in a field under the milky way
With everything that i was feeling that i could not say
With every doubt and every sorrow that was in my way
Tearing around inside my head like it was there to stay


Night in my eyes, the night inside me
There where the shadows and the night could hide me
Night in my eyes
Sky full of stars turning over me
Waiting for night to set me free

I caught a ride into the city every chance i got
I wasn't sure there was a name for the life i sought
Now i'm a long way gone down the life i got
I don't know how i believed some of the things i thought

Night in my eyes, the night inside me
Here where the shadows gather to decide me
Night in my eyes
Out at the end of light and gravity
Waiting for night

It takes the night to clear all of this mess away
The obligation, the burden and the light of day
It takes the night to fall between the world i obey
And a world where i hear angels play
Maybe i should go back to spain

I walk around inside the questions of my day
I navigate the inner reaches of my disarray
I pass the altars where fools and thieves hold sway
I wait for night to come and lift this dread away

Night in my eyes, the night inside me
Here where the shadows and the light divide me
Night in my eyes
Night full of promise and uncertainty
Waiting for night to set me free
