Knock on any door
Look through any window
Baby knock on any door
Knock on any door
Is there any place you want to go
Baby who you lookin' for


Yeah, yeah, baby now you know
It's a cold world like they told you so

Knock on any door
Save your tears for some occasion
Keep your heartache to yourself
Knock on any door
It's a simple operation
Just trade your memory for your health

Knock on any door
Look through any window
Walk on
Knock on any door
Look through any window
Walk on

It's insane girl, you can't run away
It's the same world it was yesterday

Knock on any door
Look through any window
Walk on
Knock on any door
Look through any window
Walk on

Now, now, now how do you survive
With a pain so real, in a world so jive

Knock on any door
Look through any window
Peek through any shade
Knock on any door
Look through any window
Walk on
