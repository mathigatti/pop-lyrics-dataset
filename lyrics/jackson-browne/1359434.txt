I wanted to be somebody you see
When you're feeling good
I started looking for your little MG
In my neighborhood
I started feeling kind of funny and free
When you were around
And I began to cook up a plan to
Take you out of town


Not really dating, we were relating
And we were friends
It's hard to say where the relating leaves off
And where loves begins
A friend will tell you all kinds of stuff
That a lover won't
And you would think you would see love coming
But of course, you don't

I want to hold you, don't want to mold you
Into someone else
I never could have invented you
Or written you so well
I never met another woman who
Possessed your particular charms
I want to be that man who will see that
You never come to harm

Must have been you I dreamed of
Yeah that was you all right
You were the laughter I was listening to
Standing in the light
You were the lover in the sunrise who
Had begun to slip away
Though I was just a kid I must have known
You'd be real someday

I want to know you, I want to show you
That you're not alone

You've been the only thing steadyin' me
And I guess we've both known
Maybe you haven't been that ready to see
That I could take you there
Well that was then, but this is when
I need to hear you say yeah
Baby just say yeah
