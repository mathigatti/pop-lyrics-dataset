Talk with me
I believe that we can find a tomorrow
Lend to me and I will try to borrow
I can see you and me
Love is free
We can be free


Sing with me
Melodies that soar as high as a swallow
I can lead the way if you will follow
I can see you and me
Love is free
We can be free

You show me
Words of beauty that describe your love
Let me know the things that you are sure of
I can see you and me
Love is free
We can be free

You know me
I'm as reckless as a mountain stream
Careless as a could-be, someday dream
I can see you and me
Love is free
We can be free
