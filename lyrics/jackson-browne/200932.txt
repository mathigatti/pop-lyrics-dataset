I've been sitting up all night without you
Trying not to think that much about you
How do you expect me not to doubt you
I don't want to but I'm here
And I can't stop this whispering in my ear


[Chorus:]
I'll fly away without you, I'll fly away without you
I'll fly away without you, babe, without you fly away,
Without you

You know I never wanted to confine you
I always let you come and go your way
Honey, if you let that freedom blind you, you know I won't wait around
It took too long to find this love we found

I'll fly away wthout you, I'll fly away without you
I'll fly away if you don't do something to make me stay
I want to, but I can't be the only one to say I want you

When I think how easily you caught me
Well, it wasn't hard to pull me to the ground
Whether it was something that you taught me
Or just something that I found
Loving you is all that holds me down

I'll fly away without you, I'll fly away without you
I'll fly away if you don't do something to make me stay
I want to, but I can't be the only one to say I want to
And I won't have your love no other way

[Chorus]
