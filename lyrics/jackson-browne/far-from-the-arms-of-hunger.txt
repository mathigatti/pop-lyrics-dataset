Far from the arms of hunger
Far from the world disorder
Beyond the reach of warfare
Blinded by faith no longer


No longer free to plunder
No longer safe to rule
A world no longer ours alone

Where people walk in wonder
And speak to one another
And recognize as brother
The face across the border

Across a sea of differences
Across the drifting sands
The joining of our hands in time

When will we find
We can no longer look away
When will we mind
The killing in our name each day

When we decide
That all our might just weighs us down
Then will we find
The means to turn our world around

When will we find
When will we mind
When we decide
The means to turn our world around

Far from the arms of hunger
Far from the world disorder
Beyond the reach of war
There is a world where we belong
