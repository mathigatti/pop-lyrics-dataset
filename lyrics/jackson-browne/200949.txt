Maybe the hardest thing i've ever done
Was to walk away from you
Leaving behind the life that we'd begun
I split myself in two


Proud and alone, cold as a stone
Rolling down that hill into the night
I could see the surprise and the hurt in your eyes
From behind each flashing city light

Love needs a heart and i need to find
If loves needs a heart like mine

Love won't come near me, she don't even hear me
She walks past my vacancy sign
Love needs a heart, trusting and blind
I wish that heart was mine

Proud and alone, cold as a stone
I'm afraid to believe the things i feel
I can cry with the best i can laugh with the rest
But i'm never sure when it's real
And it may be the hardest thing i've ever done
But apart from all that i hope to find
Where's the heart that's been looking for mine?
I hope it finds me in time

Love needs a heart and i need to find
If love needs a heart like mine
