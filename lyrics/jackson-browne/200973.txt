It used to be there were two sets of footprints in the sand
And there were two silhouettes in the sunset hand in hand
But now here beside the sea are the footprints of three
And I can't find my own
Among the directions they're all going


Baby it's alright
Break this chain of love and madness
It's alright
Take this rain as your new address
It's alright
Take this rain
It's alright
Take this rain

'cause I've been running all over creation out of my mind
Trying to keep our hearts beating together all of the time
Going crazier every day
Watching our love slipping away
'cause you're the only home I've ever wanted
And the only light I've known

But baby it's alright
Break this chain of love and madness
It's alright
Take this rain as your new address
It's alright
Take this rain
It's alright
Take this rain
You're going to be free

Some people go through life seeing just what they want to see
Take the way I went on believing
You might still believe in me
And I still want the love I always thought our love could be
But some things can't be changed
Take this rain

You're going to hear my voice in the morning calling your name
And know my love and my desperation were one and the same
And where our footprints used to be
There'll be nothing but the sea
And the tide and the wind and the open sky
And the unbroken horizon

Baby it's alright
Break this chain of love and madness
It's alright
Take this pain and all this sadness
It's alright
Make this rain into your fortress
It's alright
Take this rain
It's alright
Take this rain
