Tumble down beside me here and now
And then inside we can be sure
That if the rain is only silver
And the sun is only gold, we won't be poor


Sing a song around me here and now
And then surround me with your eyes
If it turns out that tomorrow we can fly
I promise I won't be surprised

And surely you must know by now
That you've got me wondering how
I was fortunate to find you

Look upon me kindly here and now
And then remind me I'm alive
Let me know I need not worry
If the answers to my questions don't survive
