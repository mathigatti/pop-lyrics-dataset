How long did you blind me baby how long?
How long did you blind me baby how long?
With your little girl laugh and your siren song


Was I right about you girl or was I wrong?
Was I right about you lyin' or was I wrong?
You had another man lovin' you all along

You said "Baby I love you, I wouldn't trade you in if I could"
You said "Look at me baby, if I wanted to leave you I would"
Yeah you had me hangin' on
Every time while you were gone
I believed you were hurryin' home to me, baby
But you were never on time

How long did you lie to me baby how long?
How long did you lie to me baby how long?
With your love light shut off and your runnin' light on

You said "Baby I love you, I wouldn't trade you in if I could"
You said "Look at me baby, if I wanted to leave you I would"
Yeah you had me hangin' on
Every time while you were gone
I believed you were hurryin' home to me, baby
But you were never on time

How long did you blind me baby how long?
How long did you blind me baby how long?
With your little girl laugh and your siren song
With your little girl laugh and your siren song
