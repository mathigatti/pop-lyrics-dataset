You've been passed around from hand to hand
Cast upon the darkest sands
Now you're so confused that you can hardly stand
Forgotten, you've forgotten now you're on the run
Forgotten, you've forgotten
How to live beneath the sun
How to live beneath the sun


Before you left i thought i knew
That you would always need me too
I never thought someday, that i'd be telling you
You've forgotten, you've forgotten
The things you used to feel
Forgotten, you've forgotten
How to smile for real
How to smile for real

And for the changes you have made
Your beauty was the price you paid
All your dreams rose up and then you watched them fade.
You've forgotten, you've forgotten
You've forgotten, you've forgotten
The best is always yet to come
The best is always yet to come
The best is always yet to come
And how to live beneath the sun
