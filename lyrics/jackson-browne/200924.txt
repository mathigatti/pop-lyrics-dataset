Well it's funny you should ask me how i feel
As the scenes before my eyes begin to reel
I can't remember how long i cried
I can't remember how hard i tried
Turned my thoughts away from you
Like i had something else to do
And now i find you here


And it's funny you should want to see me now
Well i'd refuse you but i can't remember how
I can't remember how long i cried
I can't remember how hard i tried
I'd tell myself i didn't care
That i was down and you weren't there
You've been away so long

And it's funny you should want to know my plans
As the future disappears beneath my hands
I can't remember how long i cried
I can't remember how hard i tried
Now i'll cast aside my memories
And shut you out most bitterly
I'm down on my last smile
