Pretty Nova, one year over
Legal age of consent
In the flower of sweet youth
Our days of heaven were spent


Giving that heaven away
Giving that heaven away
Rock 'n' roll, and freeing your soul, and
Giving that heaven away

I'm looking 'round for that sixties' sound
Those days are gone and all us acid dropping
World stopping, be bopping
Freaks are just hanging on

Little Nova, did you have to show the
Whole world how to rebel?
Standing there with your long brown hair
Like a cool breeze blowing through hell

Giving that heaven away
Giving that heaven away
Back in those days, we all were so crazy
Giving that heaven away

Giving that heaven away
Giving that heaven away
Ooh, ooh, giving that heaven away

Seems like the whole world's at a fire sale
But I might be wrong, with all those home shopping
Bling, bling and hip hopping
Maybe it's just going strong

But, hey, now Nova, we both know
The ones who're always making it pay
Well, any fool can sell a jewel
But an angel will give it away

Giving that heaven away
Giving that heaven away
Ooh, ooh, I'm going, go down singing
And giving that heaven away

Where did the day go in that Winnebago?
The two of us, hot as a stove
Fools for pleasure, digging for treasure
Down in that Black Oak grove

Giving that heaven away
Giving that heaven away
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, giving that heaven away
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, giving that heaven away
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, giving that heaven away
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Giving that heaven away
Giving that heaven away
Ooh, ooh, giving that heaven away
Giving that heaven away
