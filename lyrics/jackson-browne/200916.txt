Downtown people gotta work a little harder working downtown
Downtown they got to think a little quicker 'cause they're downtown
Downtown the breaks are harder
Downtown the thieves are smarter


I've got this place I'm renting
It cost me next to nothing downtown
Nobody comes around telling me I gotta turn the sound down
Broadway - down on the corner
The bible screamer, the plasma donor
Buses, carhorns, ghetto blasters
The shouts and cries of the human disasters

It's all music
It's all music
Downtown
It's all music
It's all music

I feel alright when I'm downtown
My feet are light when I'm downtown
I cast my hopes on the human tide
I place my bet and let it ride
I'm open wide when I'm downtown

Downtown there's every kind of people walkin' round downtown
Downtown there's every language, every human sound downtown
Downtown the nights are longer
Downtown the sights are stronger
Downtown wandering all around downtown
It's all music

Eight blocks south of city hall
The rats run free and the winos crawl
Darkness falls on the vast machine
Where the future stalks the American dream

I feel alright when I'm downtown
My head feels light when I'm downtown
It's all in sight when I'm downtown
I feel alright when I'm downtown
