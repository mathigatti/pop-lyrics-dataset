I'm here at fourth and main
Been standing in the rain
I feel no joy, i feel no pain
I got nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'm at fourth and main


Been down at city hall
Been writing on the wall
The grass is wet and the trees are tall
I listen to the pigeons, to the raindrops fall
I'm at city hall

Been down at pershing square
I can't seem to care
If the people stop or the people stare
I don't care if i'm leaving, i'm going somewhere
I'm at pershing square
