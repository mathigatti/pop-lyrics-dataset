The days of spring have just begun
And melted snow begins to run
Aspen is a fine place where many people go
And so you're bound for Colorado


Don't send me cards from where you've been
Or tell me 'bout the friends you win
But send to me a new leaf just begun to grow
And hurry home from Colorado

You told me once that you would like to run away
&gt;From all the fears and all the tears you felt that day
You should know no matter where you go
You have your friends to lean upon
When you're not sure what's goin' on

And if you don't return by the summer I will know
You've found a home in Colorado
And you're doing fine in Colorado
