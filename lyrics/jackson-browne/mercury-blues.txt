Well if I had money
I tell you what I'd do?
I'd go downtown and buy a Mercury or two
Crazy about a Mercury
Lord I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury
And cruise it up and down the road


Well the girl I love
I stole her from a friend
He got luck, he stole her back again
She heard he had a Mercury

Lord she's crazy 'bout a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury
And cruise it up and down the road
Oh lets go

Well hey, now mama you look so fine
Riding around in your Mercury forty nine
Crazy 'bout a Mercury
Lord I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury
And cruise it up and down the road
Oh, put it higher now

Well my baby went out she didn't stay long
Bought herself a Mercury, come a cruisin' home
She's crazy 'bout a Mercury
Yea, she's crazy 'bout a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury
And cruise it up and down the road
Oh, cruise down

Well if I had money
I tell you what I'd do?
I'd go downtown and
Buy me a Mercury or two
Crazy 'bout a Mercury
Lord I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury

And cruise it up and down the road
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury
And cruise it up and down the road
Yea, I'm gonna buy me a Mercury
And cruise it up and down the road
Oh, lets go
