I hear your heart beating everywhere
When we're apart i can hear you there
I hear your heart beating everywhere
Everywhere i go


People say that i must be in love
The way i forget what we're speaking of
The way i stand there smiling straight ahead
And walk away without hearing a word they said

I hear your heart beating everywhere
When we're apart i can close my eyes and hear you there
I hear your heart beating everywhere
Everywhere i go

In the middle of the football game
At the beach in the pouring rain
Standing on a hillside staring at the sun
People hurry by the unfortunate one
With the faraway eyes and the mystery smile
Moving my body in a ragamuffin style
I can't sit down when i hear it start
I hear your heart everywhere i go

People say that i must be a fool
Cause when i'm near you i cannot be cool
I don't quite make sense when i talk to you
And when you smile i forget everything i knew

I hear your heart beating everywhere
When we're apart i can close my eyes and hear you there
I hear your heart beating everywhere
Everywhere i go

Standing in the market where i buy my bread
With a hunger in my belly and a rhythm in my head
Looking all around for something good to eat
Between the butter and the beans and the mops and the meat
Coffee from the mountain, honey from the bee
Nothing tastes as good as you taste to me
Rocking in the aisle to my inside song
People staring at me think i got a walkman on

I hear your heart beating everywhere
I hear your heart
I hear your heart beating everywhere
I hear your heart
Beating everywhere i go
