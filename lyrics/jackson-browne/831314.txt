I've been the one who has been frightened
and almost borne away by the very thoughts
that I feared yesterday
And it must be the dust or smoke that's in my eyes


How can I cry about something from someone I won't see
Oh my friends all say she had her chance
Let's go shoot some pool
Ya know a fool is just a fool
And I've tried everything that whiskey cures
But the pain endures and now I'm feeling that pain
I put my pride in my pocket
That's how I'll spend my loneliest days
and it must be dust or smoke that's in my eyes

Don't know what to do
Hold the lamp above the rafters
These smoke-filled rooms will not replace her
I've been the one who has been frightened
and almost borne away by the very thoughts
that I feared yesterday
and it must be dust or smoke that's in my eyes
