Time on my side, a stowaway in the slipstream
A time, I could glide the shifting currents of my dream
In my dream, the singing is coming from the sky
In my dream, the sunlight is falling from one side


And every blade of grass is casting its own shadow
And every little bird is singing its own song

Time in my mind, the past of least resistance
The future almost blind, both in need of assistance
In my mind, the question, sunrise or sunset?
In my mind I'm certain, nothing's certain yet

And every grain of sand casting its own shadow
And every ray of the sun, flashing on the sea

Time may heal all wounds but time will steal you blind
Time, the wheel, time, the conqueror

Time to decide what kind of world I believe in
The world open wide or the world about to stop breathing
In my world, I'm standing just inside the door
In my world, I'm speaking into the ocean's roar

And every thought of you, casts its own little shadow
And everything I wanted, subject to review

Time may heal all wounds but time will steal you blind
Time, the wheel, time, the conqueror

Every thought of you casts its own little shadow
(Time may heal all wounds, time will steal you blind)
Everything I wanted is subject to review
(Time, the wheel)

(Every grain of sand)
Time in my side
(Time may heal all wounds)
(Every little bird)
The past of least resistance
(Time may heal all wounds but time will steal)

Every thought of you
(Time, the wheel)
Everything I wanted
(Time, the conqueror)

Everything we need
(Time will heal)
Is subject to review
(Time will steal you blind)
Time will heal
