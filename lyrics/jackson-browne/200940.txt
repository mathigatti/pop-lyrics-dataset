They shot a man into the sky
The moon and stars became his bed
He saw the sun rise seven times
And when he came back down he said


It is one, it is one
One world spinning 'round the sun
Wherever it is you call home
Whatever country you come from
It is one, it is one, it is one, it is one

They shot a man if Africa
At a time of rivalry and war
He had some dreams of a good life
But dreams aren't what they killed him for

Now people stand themselves next to the righteous
And they believe the things they say are true
They speak in terms of what divides us
To justify the violence they do

But it is one, it is one
One world spinning 'round the sun
Wherever it is you call home
Whatever country you come from
It is one, it is one, it is one, it is one
One - the deep blue ocean
One - the endless sky
One - the purple mountains
One - you and I

It's not a world of our own choosing
We don't decide where we are born
This life is a battleground between right and wrong
One way or other we are torn

And people stand themselves next to the righteous
And they believe the things they say are true
And speak in terms of what divides us
To justify the violence they do

But it is one, it is one
One world spinning 'round the sun
Wherever it is you call home
Whatever country you come from
It is one, it is one, it is one, it is one
It is one, it is one, it is one, it is one
One - the deep blue ocean
One - the endless sky
One - the purple mountains
One - you and I
