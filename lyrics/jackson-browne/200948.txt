Lovely, lovely, did you see me
Just as i was crying
Love me lovely, make it easy
What i say is hard but i am trying


Lovely, lovely, can you hear me
Listen to my singing
Love me lovely, while you're near me
Try and understand the thought i'm bringing

Last night i was sleeping
But i did not know if i'd awaken today
Lie in my keeping, only know
That i can't stay after today
I'm on my way - love me lovely
Love me lovely

Lovely, lovely, you can't fool me
I know that you need me
Love me, lovely, now and truly
Knowing that your love can only speed me

Don't say how it could be
Or i'll know that you'll be crying today
Just how it should be i don't know
So this i'll say
I'm on my way - love me lovely
Love me lovely

Last night i was sleeping
But i did not know if i'd awaken today
Lie in my keeping, only know
That i can't stay after today
I'm on my way - love me lovely
Love me lovely
