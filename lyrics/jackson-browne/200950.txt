Marianne, Marianne
With your voice like silver strings ringing
And sounds of laughter and singing
Keep repeating, Marianne, Marianne


Marianne, Marianne
Oh I can tell better than anyone else could
That there's more to you than just bad or good
There's a teardrop or a shaft of light for your heart

Marianne, oh, Marianne
The dawn will be breaking soon
And my voice will fade with the moon
And the sunlight will remind me of you
