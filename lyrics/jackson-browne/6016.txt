In the still of the night
Lying in the darkness
I listen to my heart
Say it isn't true
In the dark and the quiet
The movements of our love
And the breathing of our children
Say it isn't true


In the streets and the buildings
People in their lives
And the jobs they do for livings
Say it isn't true
And when you think of all the people
In the cities of our worlds
Who could vanish in a moment
Say it isn't true

Say it isn't true
That there always has been and always will be war
Say it isn't true
And apart from all the finer things that men have struggled for
Say it isn't true
There always has been and always will be war
Say it isn't true

I'm alive in the city
In a country of the world
And I wanna go on living
I wanna see my life unfold
You know it's hard to go on looking
At the stories of our days
And the dangers we are facing
Growing worse in every way

And you would think with all of the genius
And the brilliance of our times
We might find a higher purpose
And a better use of mind

Say it isn't true
That there always has been and always will be war
Say it isn't true
And apart from all the finer things that men have struggled for
Say it isn't true
There always has been and always will be war
