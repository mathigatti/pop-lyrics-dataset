Can you hear me? Wake up!
Where's the voice of America?
Somebody help me, we gotta stop a crime
I been betrayed by my own kind
I been quiet, too quiet
While across the borderline
We die


Can you hear me? Wake up!
Where's the voice of America?
I know that we knew right from wrong once upon a time
Everything we stood for has been compromised
I been quiet, too quiet
While across our borderline
My people lie

Can you hear me? Wake up!
Where's the voice of America?
You're quiet, too quiet
Are you still alive
Inside

Can you hear me? Wake up!
We're the voice of America
We're the voice of America
We're the voice of America
We're the voice of America
