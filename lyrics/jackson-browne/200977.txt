Oh the light from your smile
Can be seen for a mile
By travellers dark in their sorrow
If you want me to stay
Throw a smile my way
And I'll stay by your side 'till tomorrow


Woooah...

'Cause all my battered dreams are shattered now
And I need all your beauty to warm me

In the time that I've known you
I've always shown you
That I could be captured in kindness
Now a storm's blowin'
Tomorrow I'm goin'
Well the sun takes away my blindness

Woooah...

Cause all my tattered hopes are shattered now
I wait for the future to touch me

Oh the morning is nearing
The clouds disappearing
The sun will be coming to guide me
Wherever I go
I want you to know
That I carry your smile beside me

Woooah...

The slowly shifting fog is lifting now
And I see the road I'll be taking
