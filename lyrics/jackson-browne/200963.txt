I meant to call her name
I meant to take her hand
I meant to be the same and understand
Just what was happening in the evening
Between the princess and the prince


I can't be bothered now
And I can't eat or drink
I can't remember how I used to think
What was the song she sang before the morning rang
Bringing the princess to the prince

It's a crystal ringing way
She has about her in the day
But she's a laughing dappled shadow
She's a laughing dappled shadow in my night

If I could hear her voice
If I could see her face
If I could have my choice I'd be in the place
Where I saw her last on the evening past
Of the princess and the prince

It's a crystal ringing way
She has about her in the day
But she's a laughing dappled shadow
She's a laughing dappled shadow in my night
