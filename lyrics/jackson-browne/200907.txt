Once I was on my own
And falling
Once I was all alone
And calling
For someone, anyone today
To help me just a little on my way


And then I took a look around
And I saw the love that surrounded me
I knew that it was up to me
To cast off all the fears that bound me

You'll find you can't go on
Demanding
On ways to help you in
Defending
Your reason for being who you are
And asking for the lightest brightest star

I found that all I had to do
Was believe in the things that are true to me
And that'll happen naturally
And cast off all the fears that bound me

Yes, people let me say that
I took a look around
And I saw the love that surrounded me
I knew that it was up to me
Cast off all the fears that bound me
I had to cast off all the fears that bound me
