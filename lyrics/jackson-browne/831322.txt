Striking out?
Well count me in
I'm gonna stand right by your side through thick or thin
Ain't no doubt
Gonna win
A walk through hell ain't bad compared to where we've been


Oh you can depend on me
Over and over... over and over
Know that i intend to be
The one who who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die

Years may come and go
Here's one thing i know
All my life
You're a friend of mine

That argument
I can't forget
We fought so hard i don't think i've recovered yet
The girls we knew
Who thought you were cool
I never introduced my favorite ones to you

Oh you can depend on me
Over and over... over and over
Know that i intend to be
The one who who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die

Years may come and go
Here's one thing i know
All my life
You're a friend of mine

Oh you can depend on me
Over and over... over and over
Know that i intend to be
The one who who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die

Years may come and go
Here's one thing i know
All my life
You're a friend of mine

Oh you can depend on me
I'll be fine
Cause you're a friend of mine
Yeeaah
I'll be fine
Cause you're a friend of mine
