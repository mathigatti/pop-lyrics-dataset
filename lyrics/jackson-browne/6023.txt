All the words had all been spoken
And somehow the feeling still wasnt right
And still we continued through the night
Tracing our steps from the beginning
Until they vanished into the end
Trying to understand how our lives had led us there


Looking hard into your eyes
There was nobody I'd ever known
Such an empty surprise
To feel so alone

Now for me some words come easy
But I know that they dont mean that much
Unheard with the things that we said in other's touch
You never knew what I loved in you
I don't know what you loved in me
Maybe the picture of somebody hoping I might be

Awake again I can't pretend
And I know I'm alone and close to the end
Of the feeling we've known

How long have I been sleeping
How long have I been drifting along throught the night
How long have I been dreaming I could make it right
If I closed my eyes and tried with all my might
To be the the one you need

How long have I been sleeping
How long have I been drifting along throught the night
How long have I been longing for that morning fight
Throught thte whispered promises and the changing light
In the bed where we both lie
Late for the sky
