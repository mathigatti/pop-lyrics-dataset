Gather your deeds and your possessions,
Whatever certainty you've known,
Forget your heroes,
You don't really need those last few lessons.


Stand in the open;
The next voice you hear will be your own.

Well alright, they knew how they could hurt you,
And you let them cut you to the bone.
But God forbid,
you allow them to rid you of your virtue!

Forget their laughter;
The next voice you hear will be your own.

The next voice you hear...
The next voice you hear...
The next voice you hear...
The next voice you hear...
The next voice you hear...
The next voice you hear will be your own.

Throw down your truth and check your weapons.
Don't look to see if you're alone,
Just stand your ground,
And don't turn around - whatever happens.
Don't ask directions;
The next voice you hear will be your own.

The next voice you hear...
The next voice you hear...
The next voice you hear...
The next voice you hear...
The next voice you hear...
The next voice you hear will be your own.
