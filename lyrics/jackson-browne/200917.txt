You used to stand on the tables
You used to shoot out the lights
You used to stop trucks on I-19
In your blue leopard tights
You got the vote of your high school
Most likely to exceed
But not likely to ever get enough
Enough of what you need


Enough of the night
Enough of the night

And now the carnival lights come down
The sounds of laughter recede
You sit and drink in this cardboard town
The fast lane gone to seed
You used to laugh about the damage done
But there was no way to know
How little distance you had actually come
And how far you'd have to go

It's tough to do baby
It's tough to make it
When the heart is naked
It's tough for you baby
It's tough for me too
Without all this pain to see through

Now
I want to see you smile
You know how
It's just been awhile
Don't allow
Another night to close on your empty cup
You've had enough of those

Enough of the night
Enough of the night

You used to count on the miracles
The old shot in the dark
You used to wait for the setting sun
To help you hit your mark
You used to stand on the tables
You used to shoot out the lights
You dressed right out of the fables
Like the Arabian Nights

But you were never the princess
More like the queen of the thieves
And my heart was never more than one of the many
A queen receives

It's tough to do baby
It's tough to make it
When the heart is naked
It's tough for you baby it's tough for me too
Without this disdain to see through

Now
I want to see you smile
You know how
It's just been awhile-acap
