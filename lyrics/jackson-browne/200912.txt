Cut it away
Somebody cut away this desperate heart
Cut it away
And help me find my way back to the start
Yeah, before I knew what I was looking for
Yeah, when we were lovers and nothing more


I wanted you
And I did everything that I could do
To capture you
I let you see
The part of me
You'd want to see
A fantasy
I'm finding now
I don't know how
To make it good
I wish I could

Cut it away
This crazy longing for something more
Cut it away
The question I don't have an answer for
Why I hunger
For something I can't see
Cut it away
The dream I wanted life to be

I know
I've got to let you go
I know
You should have left a long time ago

Protected by the night
Two cities lay
Two hearts, two lives
Connected by our sight
Worlds away
Two hearts, two lives
Inspected by the light
Two hearts, two cities in decay
Two lives
Repair them as we might
Two hearts
Just go on crumbling
Now come on

Cut it away
I want to cut away this thing inside
Cut it away
This thing that hid from you and schemed and lied

I know
I've got to let you go
I know
You should have left a long time ago

Cut it away
Somebody cut away this desperate heart
Cut it away
Before it tears my whole life apart
I love you
I love you still
I do
I always will
