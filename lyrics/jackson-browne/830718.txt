I've been up all night
I've been writing this letter
And I think I might have found a better way
To tell you all the things I've got to say
I put it in writing and you'll get it in the mail today


Well I don't know but I can't help feeling
That you got to stop your double-dealin' ways
Cheatin' on me is a crime that never pays
And that's all in the letter and you'll get it in the mail today

Well I would tell you to your face
But you'd just lie to me
Put you in your place
But you'd just try to defy me

Been up all night
Pencil and a paper
And I think I might have found a safer way
Say goodbye without much more delay
Well it's all in the letter and you'll get it in the mail today
I don't mean tomorrow
It's all in the letter and you'll get it in the mail today
I don't mean no Western Union
It's all in the letter and you'll get it in the mail today
