Sing my songs to me
Sing them to me softly
Sing me sunlight and shadows
Orange groves and meadows
Let your voice ring back my memories
Sing my songs to me


Bring my dreams to me
Bring them from the darkness
Let the minutes and hours
Show my mind strange new flowers
But i'd like to know where they go
When the morning comes
Bring my dreams to me

Because it seems to me that there may never be
A better chance to see who i am
Come timelessly dancing
Through my dreams to me
