You really need someone on your side
But you run away and hide
Whenever somebody's going to get through
You've got this wall in front of you


You put your arm around me and smile
But you're thinking all the while
Yeah, your friends only go so far
However close friends think they are

On the day
On the day you fall in love
Gonna pray
You're gonna pray that your love is enough

You've had the world in the palm of your hand
Since you turned from child to man
No one can tell you a thing you don't know
You see your life as a one man show

But you're not whole
There are things you don't control
You're going to know what I'm talking about
On the day love finds you out

On the day
On the day you fall in love
Gonna pray
You better pray!

It's your life, you try to know
Which way the answers lie, which way to go
'Cause you survive, don't mean you grow
Open your eyes, look out below
Look out!

On the day
On the day you fall in love
Gonna pray
You better pray

On the day
On the day you fall in love
Gonna pray
You better pray
