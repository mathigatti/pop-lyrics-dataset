Melissa, I knew I just had to kiss ya
Heaven knows what I had in mind
When my eyes went blind
And you had to take me home
Because I could not find my way


Mimi, you make my glasses steamy
Heaven knows that I'll take a chance
On a girl from France
Just so long as we don't have to dance 'till dawn

Maybe baby I'm not so smart
But I know I'm not your brother
And the way you affect me
You needn't suspect me
Of falling in love with another

Daisy, your old man thinks I'm crazy
Heaven knows I used to go insane
When I heard your name
I knew what I was doin'
When I had my brain removed

Maybe baby I'm not so smart
I never claimed to be a thinker
But you gotta respect me
Cause the way you affect me
I'll never have to be a drinker

Bessie, my dreams of you are messy
Heaven knows I used to lie awake
And try to make my hea
