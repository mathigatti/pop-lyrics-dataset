I bless the day i found you,
I want to stay around you
And so i beg you, let it be me.


Don't take this heaven from one,
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me.

Each time we meet, love,
I find complete love.
Without your sweet love
What would life be?

So never leave me lonely,
Tell me you'll love me only
And that you'll always let it be me.

If for each bit of gladness
Someone must taste of sadness
I'll bear the sorrow, let it be me.

No matter what the price is
I'll make no sacrifices.
Through each tomorrow let it be me.

To you i'm praying,
Hear what i'm saying.
Please, let your heart beat
For me, just me.

And never leave me lonely,
Tell me you'll love me only
And that you'll always let it be me,
Let it be me.
