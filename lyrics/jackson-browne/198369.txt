Jackson:
When I was a young man I'd never been kissed;
I got to thinking about what I had missed.
I found a girl. I kissed her and then...
Oh Lord, I kissed her again.


Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.

Bonnie:
He asked me to marry and be his sweet wife;
We would be happy -- all of our life.
He begged and he pleaded like a natural man, and then...
Oh Lord, I gave him my hand.

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...

Jackson:
I worked mighty hard and so did my wife;
Working hand in hand to make a good life.
Corn in the field and wheat in the bins, and then...
Oh Lord, I was the father of twins.

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...

Bonnie:
Our children numbered just about four
And they all had sweethearts knocking on the door.
They all got married and they didn't wait, I was...
Oh Lord! A grandmother of eight!

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...

Jackson:
Now we are old and ready to go
Thinking about what happened a long time ago.

Bonnie:
We had lots of kids and trouble and pain, but...
Oh Lord, we'd do it again.

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...
