Every day I walk out in this torn up world
And I fight to survive
I'm laughing when I make it to the Saturday
And I'm alive
Carrying your smile with me
Carrying your smile with me


Everywhere I look I see this world slippin' down
That low road, day by day
And I just go on working for the things I need
And making my own way
Carrying your smile with me, oh yea
Carrying your smile with me

Take a walk on the troubled side of this old town
Take a walk on the broken streets and the buildings falling down
Look at all these kids with nothing but trouble in their eyes
Trouble in their future, trouble in their lives

Some bridges are falling down
Some bridges are still around

Take a walk on the shaded uptown avenue
Some people are doing well no matter how they do
And I know there's more to life than what you own
But I see so many good things, things I've never known

Some bridges are falling down
Some bridges are still around

Every night I listen to the sound of the street
Lying in my bed
I love to see the dreams that are dancing there
In the light above your head
And sometimes I get so weary
And when hope is caving in
You fill me with your love and your laughter, baby
Until I get back up again

Carrying your smile with me
(Take a walk on the streets of this divided town)
Carrying your smile with me
(Take a walk on the smoking edge of the battleground)
Carrying your smile with me
(Take a look at the situation, the poverty and the desperation)
(Take the time for the realization)
Everyday I'm carrying your smile with me
(Take a walk in the daylight)
Carrying your smile with me
(Some bridges are falling down)
Carrying your smile with me
(Some bridges are still around)
