Now that it's time
Now that the hour hand has landed at the end
Now that it's real
Now that the dreams have given all they had to lend
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go
And maybe try another time
And do I really have a hand in my forgetting


Now that I've tried
Now that I've finally found that this is not the way
Now that I turn
Now that I feel it's time to spend the night away
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go
And maybe finally split the rind
And do I really understand the undernetting

Yes and the morning has me looking in your eyes and seeing mine
Warning me to read the signs carefully

Now that it's love
Now that the candle's falling smaller in my mind
Now that it's here
Now that I'm almost not so very far behind
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go
And maybe fall another side
And do I really have a sound that I can ride on

Now that I can
Now that it's easy ever easy all around
Now that I'm near
Now that I'm falling to the sunlights and to song
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go
And do I have to do just one
And can I choose again if I should lose the reason

Yes and the morning has me looking in your eyes and seeing mine
Warning me to read the signs oh carefully

Now that I smile
Now that I'm laughing even deeper in the side
Now that I see
Now that I finally found the one thing I denied
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go
And it is finally I decide
That I'll be leaving in the fairest of the seasons
