Give us twenty minutes and we'll give you the world
We bring good things to life
The news you need from people you can count on
Doing what we do best


The heartbeat of America
Your true voice
You're in good hands
Now more than ever before

And in the flickering light and the comforting glow
You get the world every night as a TV show
The latest spin on the shit we're in, blow by blow
And the more you watch, the less you know

Beyond the hundred million darkened living rooms
Out where the human ocean roars
Into the failing light, the generations go
Heading for the information wars

Do people really spend millions upon millions
To make us think we care about the planet
At the same time polluting and looting the only world we've got
So they can maximize their profit?
People do.

The heartbeat of America
Your true voice
For the life of your business
It's everywhere you want to be

And there's a front row seat for the precious few
The latest war as a pay-per-view
Famine and disaster right in front of you
And the more you watch, the less you do

Beyond the hundred million darkened living rooms
Out where the human ocean roars
Into the failing light, the generations go
Heading for the information wars
