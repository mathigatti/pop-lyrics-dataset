Love and learn
Take your turn
Somewhere there's a feather
Falling slowly from the sky
You need not know the reason why


Stand apart
Hear your heart
Someday there will be another lover to the end
You need not hold your breath 'til then

Don't ask me to explain to you
There's nothing to remain but what we see

Fall and climb
Take your time
Somehow you must live up to the precedents you've set
You need not hope for answers yet

Don't ask me how I know it now
The future does not show itself to me

So love and learn
Take your turn
Somewhere there's a feather
Falling slowly from the sky
You need not know the reason why
