Baby I guess you know my story
Baby I guess you know my side
It seems I've traded love for glory
But I'm still not satisfied


Given all the years
All the cries and cheers
Don't amount to much more than pride
Take my love for you
Take tomorrow too
There's not much left inside

How we laughed when we first knew love
Singing dum-de-lum-de-lie
I taught you how to see life through love
Then I taught you how to cry
And though I must have known
How easily love is thrown
I took some chances, I don't know why
There's not much you can do
You wish that I'd been true
Darlin' so do I

Now you better hold out
Go on and hold out
Go ahead and hold out
For what you know love can be
Move on and hold out
Don't let your love be sold out
If there's anyone who knows about it
Baby that's me

Ahh you're right
You can't forget the way I lied
Time has seen you grow,
To lead your life alone
Though you tried and tried
Cried and cried

Baby I guess you know my story
Maybe there's not much left to say
You know the more we take the more we
Turn each other's hearts away
Now I'll be leaving in the morning
Leaving half of me behind
To find the pieces life's been torn in
And take whatever love I find

But you better hold out
Go on and hold out
Just walk away and hold out
For what you know love can be
Move on and hold out
Don't let your love be sold out
It's starting to be cold out
For people who live like me
Move on and hold out
And somewhere later no doubt
You'll find another hold out
Someone just like you baby, wait and see..
