Just like a leaf that's just been rained on
Something of a cloud above, a soon-awaking sun
And i see the day has just begun
Feeling windblown, reeling
I have grown out of my time


And like a circle casting shadows
Rolling over growing clover fields so far below
And i see i've just begun to grow
Climbing, spinning, rhyming
I am pinning down my time

And like a river flowing seaward
Bounding down, surrounding things that have puzzled me before
And i see the ever-open door
Flirting pure love, certainly
I'm sure of what i know

Just like a leaf that's just been rained on
Something of a cloud above, a soon-awaking sun
And i see the day has just begun
Feeling windblown, reeling
I have grown out of my time
