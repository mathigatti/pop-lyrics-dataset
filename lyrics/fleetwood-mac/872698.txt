Baby, please stop messin' round
You're messin' round all the time
Baby, please stop messin' round
You're messin' round all the time
Now, if you don't stop messin' round
You'll be somebody's baby 'stead of mine, yeah


break:

I want you to squeeze a me, baby, 'til my face turns cherry red
You roll me so hard, baby, I'm fallin' out of bed, now
Please stop messin' round,
Messin' round all the time
And if you don't stop messin' round
Be somebody's baby instead of mine
