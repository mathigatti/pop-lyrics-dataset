Well, I need a sugar daddy
He could be my friend
And if I needed money
I know he would lend me a hand


But when it comes to loving
He'd better leave me alone
'Cause I've got you, baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes you give me all the love I need

And when I get a little hungry
He could give me all I could eat
And if I needed whisky
He could serve it to me neat

But when it comes to loving
He'd better leave me alone
'Cause I've got you, baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes you give me all the love I need

All that I want is someone to take care of me
I'm not asking for love
Just a little sympathy

And he could pick me up
In a big fancy car
Then I could pretend
I was a big movie star

But when it comes to loving
He'd better leave me alone
'Cause I've got you baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes you give me all the love I need

All that I want is someone to take care of me
I'm not asking for love
Just a little sympathy

I'm not asking for love

I'm not asking for love
