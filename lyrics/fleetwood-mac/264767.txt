Well now look for me baby
Cause you know I'm coming home
Well now look for me baby
Cause you know I'm coming home
Well I really outn't love you darlin'
You know you done me wrong


Well I'm coming home to you baby
And I ain't gonna leave no more
Well I'm coming home to you baby and I ain't gonna leave no more
Well I know I done you wrong darlin'
Like I'm a knockin' at your door

I want to tell you baby
Just before I leave this town
I wanna tell you baby
Just before I leave this town
Well I'm coming home to you baby
And won't stand no pushin' around
