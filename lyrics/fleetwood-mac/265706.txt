Go and do what you want
I know that you have the need
You know that I'll wait, as long as it takes
So go and do what you want
You'll never make me
You'll never make me
You'll never make me cry


I may not mean everything
But I'm happy to have your love
So don't worry baby, I'll be alright
And I'll never make you
I'll never make you
I'll never make you cry.
