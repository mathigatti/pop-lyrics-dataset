Let me retell
A story of old
About a man named Moses
Who lived long ago
He prophicied good
He prophicied bad
And now that prophecy's
Coming to pass


Let all your sons, and your daughters
Of the golden calf
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

A whole lot of people, including myself
Thought the story of Moses was just a tall tale
But all of the things that we see going on
Are just what Moses set down

Let all your sons, and your daughters
Of the golden-yeah
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

Let me retell
A story I know
About a man named Moses
Who lived long ago
He prophicied good
He prophicied bad
And now that prophecy's
Coming to pass

Let all your sons, and your daughters
Of the golden-yeah
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
I just can't imagine a reason for sorrow
Just can't imagine the hurt
You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down
I said lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay down your burden of sorrow
There's just no reason to hurt 
You've got to lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
I said
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth
