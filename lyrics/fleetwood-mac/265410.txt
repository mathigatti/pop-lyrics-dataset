We see no change in sight
Watching her decline
She gets on a midnight plane
She's done it a thousand times 


When love starts out in the darkness
It doesn't do well in the light
Affairs of the heart
Start out in the dark
Usually stay with the night 

I know you don't agree
(everyday you tell me)
I know you don't agree 

I know he loves me
Everyday he calls me
He says he adores me
What can I say 

You can't love him
You can't have him
I do have him, most of the time 

Anywhere we can
Anytime we can 
Get away... get away 

Maybe it's just something else
That you can't tell me
Maybe it's in the way that you 
Look away from me 

It's not like any words 
Need to be said
Well you always know when something's wrong 
My friend 

I know you don't agree 
(everyday you tell me)
I know you don't agree 

I know he loves me
Everyday he calls me
He says he adores me
What can I say 

We see no change in sight..
Watching her decline..
She gets on a midnight plane
She's done it a thousand times 

When love starts out in the darkness
It doesn't do well in the light
Affairs of the heart 
Start out in the dark
Usually stay with the night 

When nobody sees them
At least, not together
She rarely goes out
She spends every day
Waiting for the day 

When everybody finds out
Don't you know.... don't you know...
