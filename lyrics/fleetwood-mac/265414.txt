I'm gonna catch the first train home
I don't know what I come here for
Yeah, first train home
I don't know what I come here for
'Cause for nine long years I couldn't even walk out of my door

break:

I'm gonna catch the first train home
I don't know what I come here for
The first train, the first train home
I don't know what I come here for
'Cause for nine long years, I couldn't even walk out of my door
