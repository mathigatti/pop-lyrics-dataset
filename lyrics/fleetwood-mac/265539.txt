Oh...
Pretty baby
This feeling I just can't hide
You got me mystified


Oh...
Pretty darling
This feeling is deep inside
You got me mystified

The light that shines around you
It blinds my eyes
There's a magic surrounds you
Tell me where your secret lies

Oh...
Pretty darling
This feeling is deep inside
You got me mystified

Oh...
Pretty baby
This feeling I just can't hide
You got me mystified

You got me mystified
Mystified
Mystified
Mystified
Mystified
