So I'm back to the velvet underground
Back to the floor that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was to the gypsy that I was


And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does, well
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
Oh, and it lights up the night
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy

To the gypsy that remains
She faces freedom
With a little fear
Well, I have no fear
I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love

She is dancing away from you now
She was just a wish she was just a wish
And her memory is all that is left for you now
You see your gypsy (oh)
You see your gypsy
oh, oh, oh (lightning strikes maybe once maybe twice)

Oh, oh, oh
And it all comes down to you
(Lightning strikes maybe once maybe twice)
It all comes down to you
Oh, oh, oh
I still see you
Bright eyes
Bright eyes
Oh, bright eyes (lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice)
