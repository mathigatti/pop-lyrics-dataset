You could be my silver spring 
Blue-green colors flashing 
I would be your only dream 
Your shining over ocean crashing 


Don't say that she's pretty 
And did you say that she loved you 
Baby I don't want to know 

So I begin not to love you 
Turn 'round, see me running 
I say I loved you years ago 
But tell myself you never loved me no 

And don't say that she's pretty 
And did you say that she loved you 
Baby I don't want to know 

Oh no 
And can you tell me was it worth it 
Baby I don't want to know 

Time cast a spell on you 
But you won't forget me 
I know I could have loved you 
But you would not let me 

Time cast a spell on you 
But you won't forget me 
I know I could have loved you 
But you would not let me 

I follow you down 'till the sound 
Of my voice will haunt you 
(Give me just a chance) 
You'll never get away from the sound 
Of the woman who loves you 
(Was I just a fool) 

I follow you down 'till the sound 
Of my voice will haunt you 
(Give me just a chance) 
You'll never get away from the sound 
Of the woman who loves you 
(Was I just a fool)
