Beautiful child 
Beautiful child 
You are a beautiful child 
And I am a fool once more 


You fell in love when I was only ten 
The years disappeared 
Much has gone by since then 
I bite my lip, can you send me away 
You touch 
I have no choice 
I have to stay 
I had to stay 

Sleepless child 
There is so little time 
Your eyes say yes 
But you don't say yes 
I wish that you were mine 

You say it will be harder in the morning 
I wait for you to say, just go 
Your hands, held mine so few hours 
And I'm not a child anymore 

I'm not a child anymore 
I'm tall enough 
To reach for the stars 
I'm old enough 
To love you from afar 
To trusting... yes? 
But then women usually are 

I'm not a child anymore 
No, I'm not a child, oh no 
Tall enough to reach for the stars 
I will do 
As I'm told 
Even if I never hold you again 
I never hold you again
