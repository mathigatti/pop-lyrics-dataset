I've got a long grey mare, but she won't let me ride
I got a long grey mare, but she won't let me ride
She makes me brush her in the morning
And put her to bed every night


Long grey mare, why can't we be just like before
Long grey mare, why can't we be just like before
We used to ride so hard
Until we just couldn't ride no more

break:

Look at me grey mare, don't I feed you everyday?
Look at me grey mare, don't I feed you everyday?
But when I dig you with my spurs
You turn around the other way
