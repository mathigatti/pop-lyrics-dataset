Well you say you'll be fine
When you walk out that door
Oh will it be that easy
To see me no more?


Well, will you be fine?
Are you complete?
Say you'll survive
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street

Well say you'll be fine
When you walk out that door
Oh, will it be that easy
To see me no more?

Will you survive?
Are you complete?
Say you'll be fine
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street

Will you be fine?
Are you complete?
Say you'll survive
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street
