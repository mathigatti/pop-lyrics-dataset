Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies


And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

Chains keeps us together
Running in the shadows
