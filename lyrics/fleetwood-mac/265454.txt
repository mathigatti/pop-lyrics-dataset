Now, when I leave this town 
Won't be - back no more
Yes, when I leave this town, mama
Won't be back no more
I've got the blues so bad
Standing 'round my door


Yes, I got the blues so bad
Why won't you let me be
I have the blues so bad, mama
Why won't you let me be
Now, when I go to Chicago
Blues don't you follow me

break:

I'm asking mama, mama
Please don't cry no tears
Yes, I say mama, mama
Please don't cry no tears
Because I'll always love you
Through all my days and years
