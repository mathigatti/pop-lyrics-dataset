Do you always trust your first initial feeling
Special knowledge holds true, bears believing
I turned around and the water was closing all around
Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me


Then I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like a clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet, to the sea
To the sea
To the sea, yeah

How the faces of love change, turning the pages
And I have changed, oh but you, you remain ageless
I turned around and the water was closing all around
Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me

Then I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like a clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet, to the sea
To the sea
To the sea, yeah
To the sea, yeah
