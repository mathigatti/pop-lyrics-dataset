What can I say this time
Which card shall I play
The dream is not over,
The dream is just away
And you will fly
like some little wing
straight back to the sun
The dream was never over
The dream has just begun
The dream has just begun



Fingers find the ivory keys
And a song begins to begin
Like a wolf on the run
And you will find
while in the wind
something that you lost
The dream was never over, no
The dream was only lost


(hours and hours of waiting for you,
so strong and so fleeting)
The dream has just begun
(and hours of waiting for you
in hopes of meeting)
The dream has just begun
(this way)
Well, the dream has just begun


She remembers how good it can be
He remembers a melody
Ah, in the shadow of my shadow
in a gleam
He remembers how good it can be
She remembers a melody
Well, in the shadow of my shadow
in a gleam
(hours and hours of waiting for you
so strong and so fleeting)
The dream has just begun
(hours and hours of waiting this way
meeting, me)
Hours of waiting for you
(so strong and so fleeting)
The dream has just begun...
(meeting this way)
Straight back now
(hours and hours of waiting
so strong and so fleeting)
Hours and hours waiting this way
Hours and hours of waiting this way
Straight back
Straight back
Straight back...yeah!


He remembers a melody
He remembers how good it can be
