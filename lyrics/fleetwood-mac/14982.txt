Once again she steals away
Then she reaches out to kiss me
And how she takes my breath away
Pretending that she won't miss me



Oohh I would bleed to love her
Bleed to love her
Oohh I would bleed to love her


And once again she calls to me
Then she vanishes in thin air
And how she takes my breath away
Pretending that she's not there


Oohh I would bleed to love her
Bleed to love her
Oohh I would bleed to love her


Somebody's got to see this through
All the world is laughing at you
Somebody's got to sacrifice
If this whole thing's going to turn out right


Oohh I would bleed to love her
Bleed to love her
Oohh I would bleed to love her
