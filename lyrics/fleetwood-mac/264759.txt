Well, I wanna go out without tearing my bed, now
I'se so scared my baby quit 'n'
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
And loose that girl of mine


Well she spend my money - buying me clothes
She's done cheapest woman I ever did know 'n'
So, I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
And loose that girl of mine

break:

I got a good friend from Alabam
He tried to steal my chick I don't know how many time
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it, ah
I can't afford to do it
And loose that girl of mine, ah

I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
I can't afford to do it
And loose that girl of mine, um
