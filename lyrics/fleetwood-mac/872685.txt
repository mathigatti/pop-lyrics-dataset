Now the wind
That's blowing out of the southwest
Is telling me, boy you better beware
Here she comes, and they call her the sweet Omega
And you'll come to know the meaning of her stare


Cause the only road that you'll ever need to ride
Is the one that's rolling out, beyond her eyes
And although she'll bring you joy
Don't you know she can destroy
Oh lord she's changing me

When you're down
And you're headed for a bad night
And you're seeing shapes of trouble in the stars
She'll take your hand, cause they call her the sweet Omega
Then she'll take away the sadness in your heart
Cause the only road that you'll ever need to ride
Is the one that's rolling out, beyond her eyes
And although she'll bring you joy
Don't you know she can destroy
Oh lord she's changing me

The only road you'll ever need to ride
The only road you'll ever need to ride
The only road you'll ever need to ride
Oh, lord she's changing me...
