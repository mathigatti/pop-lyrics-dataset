When the sun goes down and the moon shines bright
Honey if you call my name, I will take away your pain
I will take good care of you tonight


Somebody broke your heart, tore your world apart
But that's all over, it's a brave new day
Somebody made you cry, took away your pride
But that's all over, let's be on our way

When the sun goes down and the moon shines bright
In my arms it's safe and warm, I give you shelter from the storm
I will take good care of you tonight

Somebody made you sad, treated you so bad
But that's all over- I won't let you down
Well he was just a fool, wonder why so cruel
But you'll forget him, when I come around

When the sun goes down and the moon rises high
Honey open up your door and you won't have to hurt no more
I will take good care of you tonight

Well step out of the shadows, let the night begin
When you hear me knockin', let me in

When the sun goes down and the moon shines bright
Honey if you call my name, I will take away your pain
I will take good care of you tonight

When the sun goes down and the moon rises high
In my arms it's safe and warm, I give you shelter from the storm
I will take good care of you tonight
Hurry, open up your door and you won't have to hurt no more
I will take good care of you tonight
