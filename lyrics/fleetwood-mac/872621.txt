There's no use in crying, it's all over
But I know there'll always be another day
Well my heart will rise up with the morning sun
And the hurt I feel will simply melt away


You make me feel, I just can't carry on
But I know I won't always be that way
'Cos my heart will rise up with the morning sun
And the hurt I feel will simply melt away

You don't have to give up
Why is it all wrong
Why don't you love me
Why won't you just be strong
