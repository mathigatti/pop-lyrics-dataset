You like a man with a future
You like a woman with a past
Well, do you really believe that?
She said to faces in the crowd


(Yesterday I was facinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else

And even if you did miss me
You never let me know
You prefer to be just a little bit
In and out of love with me
And not to scream and shout
You prefer to be just a little bit
In and out of agony

(Yesterday I was facinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else

Come on now, let the sad winds blow down
As the rain came, she refused to wear her coat
But deep in her heart she knew that the song must go on

He says: Well, I have forgotten you
And your beautiful eyes
We were off the wall
We were mirrors of our former selves

Well, you could have said no
You could have said: Well, I just can't
Whoa, we were off the wall
We were mirrors of each other
Passing by

(Yesterday I was facinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else

Well, I was your paper doll
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Paper doll
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Well, I was you paper doll
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Paper doll

And it doesn't even matter
(I was fascinated by somebody else)
It was a real clear answer
(I was fascinated by somebody else)
I was fascinated by somebody else
(I was fascinated by somebody else)
