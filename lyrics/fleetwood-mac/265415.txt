I'd give you everything and more and that's for sure
I'd bring you diamond rings and things right to your door
To thrill you with delight
I'd bring you diamonds bright
Everything that will excite
Make you dream of me at night


For your love, for your love
I would give you stars above

I'd give the stars if they were mine to give
I'd give the moon every day that I live
To thrill you with delight
I'd bring you diamonds bright
Everything that will excite
Make you dream of me at night

For your love, for your love
I would give you stars above
