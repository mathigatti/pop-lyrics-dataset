Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Ain't got no crystal ball
But the future ain't hard to tell


break:

I love the woman
I just can't stand to leave her be
I love the woman
I just can't stand to leave her be
Now we got to get married 
An' might even raise a whole family

Watch out for me, woman, an'
And don't mind nobody else
Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Ain't got no crystal ball
But the future - ain't hard to tell
