You know life can be so sad
Sometimes you just sit right down and cry
You know life can be so sad
Sometimes you just sit right down, and you cry


Sometime your luck it gets so bad
Maybe you'd be better off if you should die
Yes I've tried so hard not to remember
And people I've tried so hard to forget
I've tried so hard not to remember
And people I've tried so hard to forget

But I can't stop my mind wandering
Back to the days I was just a down trodden kid
Some folks have such a good life
You know they just get on that big train, and you ride
You know some folks have such a good life
They just get on that big train, and you ride

I would spend most of my days
Running and hiding from the world outside
If I ever get to heaven 
You know, that sure would ease my worried mind
Yes, if I ever get to heaven
That sure would ease my worried life
You know when I find that place in the sky
People I'm gonna leave this old world behind
