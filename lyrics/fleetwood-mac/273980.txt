Oh baby,
Don't you want a man like me
Oh baby,
Don't you want a man like me
I could give you so much lovin'
More than one woman ever seen


Oh baby,
Make some love tonight
Oh baby,
We're gonna make some love tonight
Well be rollin' out the blankets
I'm gonna make you feel alright

I'm your rollin' man
I've got all the love you need
Rollin' man
Got all the love you need
I've got so much lovin'
More than you've ever seen
