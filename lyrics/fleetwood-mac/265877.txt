No matter what goes wrong
You'll never be alone, baby
Just lay down beside me
And let your love hide me, oh baby


Seems that things
Don't mean a thing
When I
I mean nothing without you

And if you're ever feelin' down
I'll come down and hang around you, baby
Cuz I hold the winning hand
Just to get to stand beside you baby

See cuz things
Don't mean a thing
When I
I mean nothing without you

Oh I'm just gonna do whatever
keeps us together, oh baby
Cuz I love you more then love
And I put nothing above you, oh baby

And things they ain't gonna mean a thing
And I mean, I mean nothing
No nothing without you...

Oh I mean nothing without you...
