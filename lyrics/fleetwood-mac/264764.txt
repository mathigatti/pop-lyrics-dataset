It was a cold black night and the rain was falling down
Cold black night and the rain was fallin' down
I went out lookin' for my girl,
I knew she wasn't nowhere around


She left me early that morning, with a suitcase in her hand
She left me early that morning, yes, with a suitcase in her hand
And she took off on a train this mornin'
and she was meetin' some other man, yes

She used to treat me real good and I wonder why I
didn't treat her right
Yes, ah, you know I wonder why I didn't treat her right
And now all I can do, is walk those streets both day and night
