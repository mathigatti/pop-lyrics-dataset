Little child of mine
You'll be lovin' like your little Mother did
Heard it somewhere before
I won't leave you no not like my Father did


Heavy country blues keep a rockin'
K-k-k-keep that soulbeat a-sockin'
Heavy country blues keep a rockin'
K-k-k-keep that soulbeat a-sockin'

I miss you again
I let the sunlight through my eyes
I won't cry
I miss you again
I let the sunlight through my eyes
I won't cry
Little child of mine
You'll be lovin' like your little Mother did
Heard it somewhere before,
I won't leave you, no not like my Father did
Heavy country blues keep a rockin'
K-k-k-keep that soulbeat a-sockin'
Heavy country blues keep a rockin'
K-k-k-keep that soulbeat a-sockin'

I miss you again
I let the sunlight through my eyes
I won't cry

I miss you again
I let the sunlight through my eyes
I won't cry

I miss you again
I let the sunlight through my eyes
I won't cry

I miss you again
I let the sunlight through my eyes
I won't cry
