Meet me down by the railway station
I've been waiting
And I'm through waiting for you
The train sings the same kind of blues


Well I don't know why I always trusted
Sometimes I think I must have
I must have been crazy
Crazy to wait on you, baby

Well I turned around and got pushed down, baby
Now I decided yesterday that I would leave you
I'm alright

Please, I've been takin' my time
You know, it's been on my mind
I hope you find a love
Your own designs of love
That's alright
That's alright

I believe, I believe that I know you
'Cause we've been a long time
Now I've got to show you, that I
Well, I never did beleive in time
You know, changin' anybody's mind

Now, I can't define love like it should be
That's alright
That's alright

Please, I've been takin' my time
You know, it's been on my mind
I hope you find a love
Your own designs of love
That's alright, yes
That's alright
