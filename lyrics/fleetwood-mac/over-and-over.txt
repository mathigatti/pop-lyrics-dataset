Could you ever need me
And would you know how
Don't waste our time
Tell me now
All you have to do
Is speak out my name,
And I would come running, anyway


And I said
Could it be me, could it really really be?
Over and over

Don't turn me away
And don't let me down
What can I do
To keep you around

Over and over
Over and over.
