Baby I've been your shadow
I'm on your heels both night and day
Baby I'm getting warmer
I'm getting closer, inches away
I've been watching every move you make
And I've got feelings overdue


I got it in for you
(I got it in for you)
I got it in for you
(I got it in for you)

I've been runnin' under cover
In the darkness of the night
So if you're looking over your shoulder
You will see me out of sight
Now I'm moving into your light
I think it's high time you knew

(I got it in for you)
I'm not gonna give up
(I got it in for you)
Don't want to do without
(I got it in for you)
I'll win you over
(I got it in for you)
Over and over
I got it in for you
(I got it in for you)
I got it in for you
(I got it in for you)

Baby don't you worry
You won't be lonely anymore
Baby I've been planning
All the romance you're looking for
And it's right outside your door
And tonight I'm comin' through

I got it in for you
(I got it in for you)
I got it in for you
(I got it in for you)
