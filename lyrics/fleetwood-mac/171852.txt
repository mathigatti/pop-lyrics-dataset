And he says, What do you love to do? 
Outside your world, 
Who spends timewith you? 
Whom do you love when you're not working? 


Sweet Girl.... 
Where would you go, 
If you had the time? 
Crossing some crazy State-line somewhere? 
To whom do you cry? 
People are unkind, 
Sweet Girl... 

But I chose to dance across the stages of the world. 
Everyone said I'd never learn... 
And I still hear your words, 
Well, I waited all my life for you.... 
Sweet Girl... 

I did try to come back and listen... 
you never knew it... 
I didn't wish it... 
And I did hear every answer of every question... 
It's all about protection.... 
Still through the sunlighted days I wait... 
Track a ghost through the fog.... 

The sun is burning me... 
And you come runnin' out... 
In the wind with me... 
The ocean is your blanket... 
But I chose to dance across the stages of the world... 
Everyone said I'd never learn... 
I still hear your words, 
Well, I waited all my life for you... 
I watched you fly through the world. 
In a golden ball... 
Many are the cities that I never saw at all... 
Sometimes I feel like I was always on-call 
Sometimes even I am allowed to fall... 
He says, Come down here for a minute... 
Well, come down here for a minute.... 
He says, Come down here for a minute, 
Sweet Girl... Sweet Girl...
