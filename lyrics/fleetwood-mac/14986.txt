Can't help about the shape I'm in
I can't sing, I aint pretty and my legs are thin
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to


Oh well

Now when I talk to God
I know he understands
He said "sit by me and I'll be your guiding hand"
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to

Oh well
