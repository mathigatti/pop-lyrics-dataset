My love is like a rock
Nothing moves it away from you
And I can't feel the shock
You won't break it up
No matter what you do


When it all comes down
Stand on the rock
When you come back around
Stand on the rock

Your love is like the sea
Waves crashing against my heart
Changing constantly
But you won't change the love
Too strong to fall apart

When it all comes down
Stand on the rock
When you come back around
Stand on the rock

Sooner or later you'll see
Nothing's gonna change tthis love in me
Stand on the rock, 'cause it's all right
Stand on the rock
Oh you play so rough, so rough
But my love's too tough
Ya might as well give it up

Sooner or later you'll see
Nothing's gonna change tthis love in me
Stand on the rock, stand on the rock
Stand on the rock, stand on the rock

When it all comes down
Stand on the rock
When you come back around
Stand on the rock

When it all comes down
Stand on the rock
When you come back around
Stand on the rock
Stand on the rock
Stand on the rock
Stand on the rock
Stand on the rock
Stand on the rock
