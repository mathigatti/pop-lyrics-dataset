Everytime that you make me smile it's the same old way it used to be
And that's enough for me
Everytime that sleep don't come it's the same old pain that used to be


And that's enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm, ah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm, ah, oh
Everytime that sleep don't come it's the same old pain it used to be

And that's enough for me
And that's enough for me
And that's enough for me
