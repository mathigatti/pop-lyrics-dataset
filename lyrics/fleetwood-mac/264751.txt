Well goodbye world
It's sad but true
Got a date with the hangman
I have to leave you
I shot my Darlin'
Three times of more
The reason I'm goin'
Is blood on the floor


The nights are so lonely
The days are so long
I'm in the jailhouse
Cause they say I've done wrong
I don't say I'm sorry
I just say I'm sore
The reason I'm goin'
Is blood on the floor (blood on the floor)

Well I came home one night
She were lyin',
With her legs around
Another mans bod
She saw me, stared laughin'
But she cried, when she saw my gun

Goodbye world
I guess we must part
They're taking my life
Cause I shot my sweetheart
I don't say I'm sorry
I just say I'm sore
The reason I'm goin'
Is blood on the floor
Oh the reason I'm goin'
Is blood on the floor
Oh the reason I'm goin'
Is the blood on the floor
