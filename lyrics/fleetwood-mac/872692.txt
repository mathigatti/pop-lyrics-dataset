I thought I'd let you go
In my heart and in my mind
And look towards the future
Leaving the past behind


Well maybe it's the season
That season of the year
Defying all my reason
I just want you to be here
I want you to be here

Sooner or later
Sooner or later I'll forget
I want you to be here
Sooner or later
Sooner or later I'll forget

And though it's not the first time
I've thought of you this way
The darkness of the winter
Keeps my happiness at bay

It's easy to forget you
In the summer, in the light
With the days of lazy laughter
And sweet, sweet dreams in the night
Sweet dreams in the night

Sooner or later
Sooner or later I'll forget
Sweet dreams in the night
Sooner or later
Sooner or later I'll forget

S all I really mean is
When all is said and all is done
It's all because of you babe
That I'm the lucky one
I am the lucky one

Sooner or later
Sooner or later I'll forget
I am the lucky one
Sooner or later
Sooner or later I'll forget

I am the lucky one

Sooner or later
Sooner or later I'll forget
I am the lucky one
Sooner or later
