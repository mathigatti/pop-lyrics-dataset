It's not that funny is it
When you don't know what it is
But you can't get enough of it
If's not that funny is it?
Don't blame me!
Please, please, please!
I didn't wanna bleed so
I didn't wanna be this late
So don't make me wait!


It's not that funny is it
No one to turn you on
All your hope is gone
It's not that funny is it?
Don't blame me!
Please, please, please!
You're here cause I say so
Didn't wanna be this late
So don't make me
Don't make me wait!

Here comes the nightime looking for a little more
Waiting on the right time somebody outside the door.
