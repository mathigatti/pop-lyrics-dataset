When I see you again
Will it be the same
When I see you again
Will it be over
When I see you again
Will your great eyes still say


What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby, baby, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby, baby

So she walks slowly down the hall
There are many doors in the hallway
And she stares at the stairs
Ooh there are many things to stare at these days
If she sees him again
Will your very best friend
Will your very best friend
Oh, have been replaced by some other

What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby, baby, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby, baby

And the dream says I want you
And the dream is gone
So she stays up nights on the end
Well at least there is a dream left

If I see you again
Will it be over
If I see you again
Will it be the same
If I see you again
Will it be over
Again and again
Over and over
