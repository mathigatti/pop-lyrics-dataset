Go on, save yourself
Leave the key here
You love someone else,
I shouldn't be here
Don't ask me why
You know the answer
She's so willing, little one
There was no chance there


I have come to know
This world of changing faces
I can't fight the world,
I can't change it
So be true to me
My walls are flamin'
If she's so willing, little one
I won't be staying

Ah, ah...
(Turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can... just as fast as I can)
Ah, ah...
(I should've turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can... just as fast as I can)

I am older now,
But I still remember
I took the greatest fall
I can't accept her
So be true to me
My walls are flamin'
If she's so willing, little one
I won't be staying

Ah, ah...
(Turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can... just as fast as I can)
Ah, ah...
(I should've turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can... just as fast as I can)

Ah, ah...
(Turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can... just as fast as I can)
Ah, ah...
(I should've turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can... just as fast as I can)

What you did not need
Was a woman who was stronger
You needed someone
To depend on you
I could not be her,
I did not want to
My first mistake
Was to smile at you
Smile at you...

Go on, save yourself
Leave the key here
You love someone else
I shouldn't be here
Don't ask me why,
You know the answer
If she's so willing, little one
There was no chance there

Ah, ah...
(Turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can... just as fast as I can)
Ah, ah...
(I should've turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can... just as fast as I can)

Ah, ah...
(Turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can... just as fast as I can)
Ah, ah...
(I should've turned away and ran, I should've turned away and ran)
Ah, ah
(Fast as I can... just as fast as I can)

Go on, save yourself
Leave the key here
You love someone else
I shouldn't be here
Go on, save yourself
Go on, save yourself
I shouldn't be here
I shouldn't be here...
I shouldn't be here...
