I'm crazy for my baby
But my baby she don't love me
I'm so lonely babe
I'm so lonely babe
No I can't live without you babe
I'm so lonely babe


I woke up last night
Found she was gone
I woke up last night
Found she was gone
I'm so lonely babe
I'm so lonely babe
No I can't live without you babe
I'm so lonely babe

I woke up last night
Found she was gone
I woke up last night
Found she was gone
I'm so lonely babe
I'm so lonely babe
No I can't live without you babe
I'm so lonely babe
