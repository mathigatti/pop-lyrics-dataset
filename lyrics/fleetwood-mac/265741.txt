Well there will be times
When the memories fade
There will be words we've said
We just can't take away
I'm only saying
That as time goes sailing on
Nothing is forgotten baby
Nothing is really gone


I remember the nights in Estoril
A kiss and oh the never ending thrill
And I remember the coming storm
Oh and you my ove, how you kept me warm

Well there will be times
When we can't agree
We can't help but see things
A little differantly
I'm only saying
That as time goes sailing on
How can something so right
Ever be wrong

I remember the nights in Estoril
A kiss and oh the never ending thrill
And I remember the coming storm
Oh and you my love, how you kept me warm

Your hand reaching out to me
Dark clouds gathering in their wake
I've seen it all before
But I've never felt it more
This time there is no mistake
Oh I remember

And I remember the coming storm
Oh and you my love, how you kept me warm

I remember the nights in Estoril
A kiss and oh the never ending thrill
And I remember the coming storm
Oh and you my ove, how you kept me warm

I remember
Remember...
