The way you walk - it drives me mad
Now, the way you talk - it  makes me glad
Love that woman - yes, you're everything to me
Whoa, 'cause you're a friend and lover 
Whoa, just as sweet as a woman should be


She knows how to work - and she knows how to play
She knows how to keep me happy - everyday
Love that woman, yes, I need you by my side
Whoa, 'cause you got a way baby
Whoa, a way that keeps me satisfied

When a no good man - tries to give her a line
She tells him quick - whoa, she's all mine.  
Love that woman, yes, your everything to me
Whoa, 'cause you're a friend and lover
Just as sweet as good as a woman should be

I love you baby
I love you baby
I love that woman
I love that woman
I love that woman
I love that woman
