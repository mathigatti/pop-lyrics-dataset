What's the world coming to?
What's the world coming to?
Everyone's gone to the moon
What's the world coming to?


Every night, every day
In this house filled with shame
I can say I care
But there's no one there

There's no truth in my life
There's no light in my eyes
And it's all I guess
That I'll ever miss

What's the world coming to?
What's the world coming to?
Everyone's gone to the moon
What's the world coming to?

I can jump right off and fall right into the ocean
I can come right out and think just what I say
But if I don't call for a reservation
They'll just turn me down
Turn me inside out

I don't say what they want
I don't do what they say
So I'm on their list
So I'm gone, I guess

What's the world coming to?
What's the world coming to?
Everyone's gone to the moon
What's the world coming to?

What's the world coming to?
What's the world coming to?
Everyone's gone to the moon
What's the world coming to?
