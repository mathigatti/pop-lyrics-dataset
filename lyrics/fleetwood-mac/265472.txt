Would you love me tomorrow
Like you say you love me now?
Would you love me, would you love me tomorrow
Like you say you love me now?
When the flames of our flesh have stopped burning
And the fire of our love has cooled down


Too many times I've given too much
Baby, give me your love to me in return
Too many times I've given too much
Baby, give me your love in return
Give me your mind and your heart
But please don't leave me with a love that burns

And don't use me as your fool
'Cause my heart can't stand another lie
Please don't use me, don't use me as your fool
Baby, 'cause my heart can't stand another lie
And if you can't love me tomorrow
Please leave me now in my room to cry
