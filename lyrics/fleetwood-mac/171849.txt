you can take me to paradise 
and then again you can be cold as ice 
i'm over my head 
but it sure feels nice 


you can take me anytime you like 
i'll be around if you think you might 
love me baby 
and hold me tight 

your mood is like a circus wheel 
you're changin' all the time 
sometimes i can't help but feel 
that i'm wastin' all of my time.... 

think i'm lookin' on the dark side 
but everyday you hurt my pride 
i'm over my head 
but it sure feels nice 
i'm over my head 
but it sure feels nice
