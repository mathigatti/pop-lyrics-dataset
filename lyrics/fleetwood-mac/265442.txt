I'm waiting this mornin'
I'm waiting for my baby to come back home
I'm waiting this mornin'
I'm waiting for my baby to come back home
You know she left me this mornin'
And I don't know where she gone


She said she wasn't gonna leave me
She said she always gonna stay by my side
She said she wasn't gonna leave me
She said she always gonna stay by my side
This time she mistreated me
And I don't know how many times she lied

Well I love my baby
And I'll tell the world I do
I love my baby
I'll tell the world I do
But now I've lost my baby
I don't know what in the world I'm gonna do-yeah
