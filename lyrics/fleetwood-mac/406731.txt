Have mercy, baby on a poor girl like me,
You know I'm falling, falling, falling, at your feet,
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes,
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go.


'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
Then you woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Have pity baby,
Just when I thought it was over,
Now you got me running, running, running for cover.
I'm begging you for a little sympathy,
'Cause if you use me again it'll be the end of me.

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
Then you woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Baby, Baby, hope you're going to stay away,
'Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker, everyday,
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be,
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me.

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
Then you woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Fallin' Fallin' Fallin'
Fallin' Fallin' Fallin'
