I'm worried 
Worried as a man can be
I'm worried 
Worried as a man can be
I'm worried 'bout my baby
She going/gone away from me


Well I'm worried about my baby
And I wonder where she gone
Well I'm worried about my baby
And I wonder where she gone
I hope some day
My baby love will return

Well I hope some day
My baby love will return
I hope some day
My baby love will return
If she don't come back to me
My whole life will go to ruin

I'm worried 
Worried as a man can be
I'm worried 
Worried as a man can be
I'm worried 'bout my baby
She going/gone away from me
