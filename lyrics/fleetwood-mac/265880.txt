Help me baby
Help me take my blues away
Help me baby
Help me take my blues away
Wake up one morning
Feel good one sunny day


Times I've wondered
Why it is a lonesome day
Times I've wondered
Why it is a lonesome day
I see you walking
See you walking away

All I want from you
Is more then I can do
There's one thing that I know
I'll never let you go
Although the people say
I shouldn't treat you this way

Help me baby
Help me take my blues away
Wake up one morning
Feel good one sunny day

All I want from you
Is more then I can do
There's one thing that I know
I'll never let you go
Although the people say
I shouldn't treat you this way

Help me baby
Help me take my blues away
Wake up one morning
Feel good one sunny day
