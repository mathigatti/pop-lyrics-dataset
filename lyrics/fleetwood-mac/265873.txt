How many more year - have you got to wreck my life
How many more year - have you got to wreck my life
Well, the way you done me, gonna wreck my life


How many more time - you gonna treat me like you do
How many more time - you gonna treat me like you do
You spend all my money, all my lovin' too

Now I'm old and grey - Got no place to go
Now I'm old and grey - Got no place to go
You got yourself a youngster, you can't stand me no more
