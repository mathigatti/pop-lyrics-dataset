My heart is hanging on every word you say
Right now all logic's stripped away
It doesn't analyze your sincerity
It only listens and believes
Don't whisper
I love you
Unless you know it's true


Be careful what you're saying
You're talkin' to my heart
Oh be careful what you're saying
You're talkin' to my heart

Sometimes you want someone so bad you fantasize
Sometimes the heat of passion lies
It's only human to give in to what you feel
That doesn't always mean it's real
Don't mislead
Don't misread
The magic of the night

Be careful what you're saying
You're talkin' to my heart
Oh be careful what you're saying
You're talkin' to my heart

Think about it
Sometimes it's wise to wait
Think about it
Once spoken it's too late
Don't whisper
I love you
Unless you know it's true

Be careful what you're saying
You're talkin' to my heart
Oh be careful what you're saying
You're talkin' to my heart
