You got to believe
I'm gonna be with you baby
In everything you've done
Even though you've stopped the sun from shining
Well I've tried my best, but it may not be enough
And times have been so tough, that I can't tell you
What can you say to accuse me
When you know I'm not to blame
You know you're gonna use me
I guess I'll always feel the same
Oh, when will we be together
In this crazy world we're in
Is it really such a sin to love you
Well I've tried my best, but it may not be enough
And times have been so tough that I can't tell you
