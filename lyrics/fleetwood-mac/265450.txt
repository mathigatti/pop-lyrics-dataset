For a little peace in any season 
I'd give up anything but your love 
I don't want to trade, tryin' to be happy
That's only playin' anyway
But if I dream about it, it makes me wonder
For every good thing, must you get bad
But I won't worry, and if I'm living on borrowed time
I'm gonna keep on the way I'm going


For every crime, there's retribution
And every vally has a mountainside
No, I don't like to trade just to be happy
That kind of deal won't turn out right
See it ain't good to stare inside yourself too long
For every true thing theree's one more lie
But I won't worry 'cause if I'm living on borrowed time
I'll just try to keep on the way I'm going
