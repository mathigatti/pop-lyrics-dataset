Take everything easy
Show me a smile
It doesn't take much to please me
My little child


Shine me a light from your eyes dear
Don't let me see a single tear
Take everything easy
Show me a smile
Soon you'll be a man
My little one
So have fun while you can
Or there'll be none

Everything's going fast around you
There will be things to astound you
You'll be a man in no time
My little one

So take everything easy
Show me a smile
It doesn't take much to please me
My little child

Shine me a light from your eyes dear
Don't let me see a single tear
Take everything easy
Show me a smile
Ooooohhhh...
Ooooohhhh...
Ooooohhhh...
Ooooohhhh...

Take everything easy
Show me a smile
It doesn't take much to please me
My little child

Shine me a light from your eyes dear
Don't let me see a single tear
Take everything easy
Show me a smile
Soon you'll be a man
My little one
So have fun while you can
Or there'll be none

Everything's going fast around you
There will be things to astound you
You'll be a man in no time
My little one

So take everything easy
Show me a smile
It doesn't take much to please me
My little child

Shine me a light from your eyes dear
Don't let me see a single tear
Take everything easy
Show me a smile
Ooooohhhh...
Ooooohhhh...
Ooooohhhh...
Ooooohhhh...
