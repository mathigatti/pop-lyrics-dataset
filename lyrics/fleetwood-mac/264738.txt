Yes, I've packed up my clothes
     I'm moving away from your door
Lord, I've packed up my clothes
     Said, I'm moving away from your door
I've been your fool for so long
     Babe, I won't play that fool no more


I gave you all my money
     I work as hard as I can
I came home early one morning
     I found you with another man
Babe, I've packed up my clothes
     I'm moving away from your door
Said, I've been your fool for so long
     And Lord,  I won't play that fool no more

So good-bye baby
     you don't even care
Yes, I had a love so strong for you
     but you treat me so unfair
Said, I've packed up my clothes
     I'm moving away from your door
You know, I've been your fool for so long
     And babe, I won't play that fool no more
