Blue blue days, and long black nights
Lonesome tears you're gonna cry for me
And little baby
You'd better start baby
And leave


Think it over before you leave
I got the love - that kind you need
And little baby
You'd better start baby
And leave

I'll rave on with the things you say
You say you're gonna leave but that'll be the day
Maybe baby, you don't know
I left Peggy Sue, a long time ago

She's the girl on my mind
Everyday through all the time
And little baby
You'd better start baby
And leave

solo

I'll rave on with those things you say
You say you're gonna leave but that'll be the day
Maybe baby, you don't know
I left Peggy Sue, a long time ago

She's the girl on my mind
Everyday through all the time
And little baby
You'd better start baby
And leave

And little baby
You'd better start baby
And leave
