It's not home
And it's not Tara
If fact do I know you
Have I been here before
This is a dream, right
Deja Vu
Did I come here on my own
Oh I see
Welcome to the room Sara for Scarlett
Welcome to the choir, sir


Ooooh
Missionary
Well I will be different
When I get back
And you can take all of the credit
You say everything's fine, baby
But sometimes at night
Where the first cut is the deepest one of all
And the second one
Well it's a worthless thing, so take it all the way back home
Take it home

Ooh, downstairs where the big old house is mine
Ohh, upstairs where the stars laugh and shine
Oh, oh well I thought that you were mine
Well I thought that you were mine

Welcome to the room Sara, Sara (for Scarlett)
Welcome to the choir, sir
Well of course it was a problem (for Scarlett)
Front line baby
Well you held her prisoner
And after all these years
Well as well as you knew her
In the never forgotten words of another one of your friends
In the never forgotten words of another one of your friends, baby
When you hang up that phone
Well you cease to exist
Welcome to the room Sara
Welcome
Welcome to the room everyone
