So many nights I lay awake
Can't sleep
I lay here thinkin' 'bout a woman
I used to love
Can't sleep but no good to count sheep
I'll just count the worries
That I've got plenty of


And how many times
Must I be the fool
Before I can make it
Oh Make it on home
I've got to find a place to sing my words
Is there nobody listening to my song?

You talk about a life
Been searching for the key
But can't find an answer
To comfort me
I ask myself about love
Can't even find the door
To take me to a place
I've never seen before

But how many times
Must I be the fool
Before I can make it
Oh make it on home
I've got to find a place to sing my words
Is there nobody listening to my song?
