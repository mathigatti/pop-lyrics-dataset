So cool, calm and collected
You had a style, a rakish style
Well my poor heart never connected
You'd stay so long on my mind.


Well, isn't it midnight on the other side of the world
Do you remember t
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl

Looking back so long ago
You had a knack, a knack of making women know
Ooh there wasn't the time
And I knew you'd nver be mine

Well, isn't it midnight on the other side of the world
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl

Isn't it midnight on the other side of the world
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
