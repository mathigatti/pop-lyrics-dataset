New York, open your eyes to me
Let me be what I want to be
Tell me, tell me it's not too late


Big Apple, takin' a bite of me
Whole world movin' below my feet
Not like, not like we do in L.A.

New York, make me a part of you
Straight, straight through the heart of you
Tell me, tell me it's not too late

Flying high on the empire state
Flying high on the empire state

New York, watch me burn ya down
Straight, straight through the heart of town
Tell me, tell me I'm not too late

Big Apple, takin' a bite of me
Whole world movin' below my feet
Not like, not like we do in L.A.

Flying high on the empire state
Flying high on the empire state
