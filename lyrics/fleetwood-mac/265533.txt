Say you love me
Say those three words and
I will give my love to you


My love is higher than a mission bell (how deep?)
Deeper than a wishing well (how strong?)
Stronger than a magic spell
My love, for you
It's wider than the widest sea (how long?)
Longer than a memory (How sweet?)
Sweeter than a honey tree
My love, uhmmm, for you

Give me your heart of gold
Your heavenly magic touch
To cherish have and hold
I need your love so much

Say you love me
Say those three words and
I will give my love to you

My love is warmer than a day in spring (how bright?)
Brighter than a diamond ring (how great?)
Greater than a mighty king
My love, for you
Is taller than the tallest tree (how soft?)
Softer than a summer breeze
Oh I ask you please
Give your love, your love
Sweet love to me

how high (ummm)
how deep (ummm)
how strong (ummm)
how wide (ummm)
how long (ummm)
