All I know is the way that i feel
Whenever you're around
You've got a way of lifting me up
Instead of bringing me down
(Instead of bringing me down)


I can't fight it anymore
Since you've been around
We've got love in store

You're the only one I ever felt
Could be special to me
You look at me and I just melt
I'm scared of feeling that way

I can't fight it anymore
Since you've been around
We've got love in store

Never take your love away
Beggin' you baby
Never take your love away
Oh darlin'
Never take your love away
Beggin' you baby
Never take your love away

Repeat
