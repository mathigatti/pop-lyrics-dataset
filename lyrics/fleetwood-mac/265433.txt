I just talked to my baby - on the telephone
She said, stop what your doing and - come on home
I can't hold out, I can't hold out to long
I get a real good feeling - talking to you on the phone


She said, daddy you know I love you your my hearts desire, um
Stay right here with you till the day I die
I can't hold out, I can't hold out to long
I get a real good feeling - talking to you on the phone
Oh yeah

break:

She daddy you can run, walk or fly
Stay right here with you 'til the day I die
I can't hold out, I can't hold out to long
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone

Whoa yeah, talk a to me baby
Talk a to me baby
Talk to me baby
Talk a to me baby
I get a real good feeling - talking to you on the phone
