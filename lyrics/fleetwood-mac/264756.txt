Don't let waters of caution remove you
Don't let the fire of saints compel you
Don't let the lack of their spirit blind your life
Cause soon it's all over, you're gonna come through alive


Well I've been all over the world five times or more
And I've seen the future burn blue before my eyes
And all through the dust and the green magnesium fire
Don't let the violence blind you, you're gonna come through alive

And the roses that are offing
They are real as evening wind
They are washed by love and suffering
Cause my love has colored them
Colored them
oooooh oooohh-nothing but roses

Don't dam the river that's running through you
Stop saving up for time that may never become
I've seen the future come true in twenty days
But don't let is scare you, stop thinking about yesterday

I've had my share of blue revelations
And I know that time is a region to be passed
So all through the dust and green magnesium fire
I can rest easy now, and watch the carnival rolling by

Cause a rose that will be growing
In the place where I have hidden
It is washed by love and suffering
That my love has colored in

Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses grow
Look where the rooooooooses
Iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiaaaaahhhh
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses grow
Look where the rooooooooses
Iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiaaaaahhhh
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses grow
Look where the rooooooooses
Iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiaaaaahhhh
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses grow
Look where the rooooooooses
Iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiaaaaahhhh
