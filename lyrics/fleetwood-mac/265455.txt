She's got so much blues
Her best friend can't help her
Her best friends a woman
How can a woman help her
Woman's got the blues


She just feels like crying
She just feels like dying
Woman's got the blues

She just feels like dying
She just feels like dying
Woman's got the blues

Womans got the blues
