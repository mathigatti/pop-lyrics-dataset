When I see him, I feel him
There's an intensness
In him, In his eyes
He wants me to be with him
He wants me with him now


She just seems to be missing
How could that happen anyhow

So how can you say
Well I don't know what love is
You haven't and you have no time for it
You feel completely different
You feel pushed up against the wall
And then one day it just almost goes away
You spend lots of time alone and
Sometimes you spend years
And you just miss those arms that used to go around you

Night after night
No questions asked and
Who cares, the cold wind of it all, everytime
Well it's hard to be civil and it's
Real hard to be nice
But you did it my love everytime

So how can you say well I can't see you
Not now, not tomorrow, not until it's right
Not until
None of us is pushed up against the wall
I don't know, the cold wind doesn't get you anymore

So today she says well I've changed my mind
That's a womans right they say
Well I'm frightened and I'm lost and I
Can't give you up, not now I need you now
I'm broken-hearted, broke down
Like a little girl
Well I need you now, well I'm broken hearted
Well I broke down, like a little girl

(I need you now no questions asked)
Well I broke down like a little girl
(I need you now no questions asked)
I broke down like a little girl
(Need you now no questions asked)
Well I broke down like a little girl
like a little girl
(Need you now no questions asked)
Like a little girl
