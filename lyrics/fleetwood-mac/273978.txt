He had all the rivers, under his power
He had all the mountains, under his command
You know that he had all the cities, in his own two hands
Yes and he had control of the four winds
And of the hunger of starving man
And now we're passing on the reins
Cause in my heart I can feel the change
You know the lord of light is laughing
Cause things don't stay the same, revelation
Revelation


He controlled the brimstone, and eternal fire
Surrounds himself with downers, in the king of cold
You know that he had all the princes kissing his diamond ring
And I heard that he walled up, the door to summer
And cut the heart out of mister spring
And now we're passing on the reins
And in your heart you can feel a change
You know the lord of light is laughing
Cause things don't stay the same, revelation
Revelation

Dream on, keep your eyes wide open...

On a Sunday morning, with a voice that's cold
The future gives a warning of the fire that burns below
He puts his hands together, cause his faith is strong
And that's what you've been needing
Oh but it don't seem to last too long
Cause now we're passing on the reins
And in your heart you can feel a change
You know the lord of light is laughing
Cause things don't stay the same, revelation
Revelation
