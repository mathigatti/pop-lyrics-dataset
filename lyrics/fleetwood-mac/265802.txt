How can my heart be filled with doubts of you
When you can fill me with a love that's true
But I can't help but sigh, 
And sometimes wonder why
What can I do
I want to see you more and more each day
I really need you, you're my only way
You say it's alright now
But still I wonder how, what can I say


I've dreamed a thousand dreams
And cried so many tears
Cause when you're not in my heart it seems
Like I've wasted all my years

Someday together we will fly to the sun
And then we'll think of all the things we've done
Everyone will smile, happy all the while
Now that we're one

I've dreamed a thousand dreams
And cried so many tears
When you're not in my heart it seems
Like I've wasted all my years

Someday together we will fly to the sun
And then we'll think of all the things we've done
Everyone will smile, happy all the while
Now that we're one
