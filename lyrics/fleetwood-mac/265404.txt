There's a place
I sometimes see you there
It's a place that I visit
Most every night


And I see your face
Your eyes tell me you still care
But it's suddenly over
With morning's first light

As the day begins
This feeling is going strong
Sometimes the only thing
That keeps me going on
And until you find
Your own way back to me
I'll be forever
Dreamin' the dream

As the day begins
This feeling is going strong
Sometimes the only thing
That keeps me going on
And until you find
Your own way back to me
I'll be forever
Dreamin' the dream
