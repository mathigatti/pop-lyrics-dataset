Although the sun is shining
     high above
There's one thing on my mind
     you my love


I see a weeping willow
     in the park
Like this there's sadness growing
     in my heart

When we're together 
We will never part
And if you leave me
It'll break, it'll break my heart

break:

When we're together 
We will never part
And if you leave me
It'll break, it'll break my heart

Although the sun is shining
     high above
There's one thing on my mind
     you my love
