Shall I tell you about my life
They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls


I guess I've got everything I need
I would't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
But I just wish that I'd never been born

break:

     And I need a good woman
     to make me feel like a good man should
     I don't say I'm a good man
     Oh, but I would be if I could

I could tell you about my life
And keep you amused I'm sure
About all the times I've cried
And how I don't want to be sad anymore
And how I wish I was in love
