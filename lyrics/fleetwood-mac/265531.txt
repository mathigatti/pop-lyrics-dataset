The swamp is getting deeper all the time
And the faces that I see don't seem to shine
Now there's too much Warhol hanging off the wall
And the mystery that there used to be is gone


Let me go
Miles away
Let me ride
Just miles away
Don't wanna know
I'm not gonna miss it much
Gonna be drivin' once again

Don Juan goes up in a cloud of smoke
And all those Hare Krishnas turned out to be a joke
And it's restless, restless, restless all the time
Slidin' up and down the surface of this life
Now I know that I can't say what's black and white
But if I could fly I think I'd try tonight
