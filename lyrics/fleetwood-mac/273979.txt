Ricky can you hear me cry
Didn't even say goodbye
No one looks and no one sees
Ricky won't you tell me please


Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oohhh Ricky won't you come out tonight
Oooh tell me.....
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oohhh Ricky won't you come out tonight

Oh, how I miss you so
Never gonna let you go
No one looks and no one sees
Ricky won't you tell me please

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oohhh Ricky won't you come out tonight
Oooh tell me....
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oohhh Ricky won't you come out tonight

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oohhh Ricky won't you come out tonight
Oooh tell me....
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oohhh Ricky won't you come out tonight
