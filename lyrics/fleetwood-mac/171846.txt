I been alone
All the years
So many ways to count the tears
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel


Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and fall and I die

I been alone
Always down
No one cared to stay around
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and fall and I die
