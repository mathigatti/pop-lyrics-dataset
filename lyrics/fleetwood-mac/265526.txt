You babes talk about your madison shoes
We've got a thing we call the madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues, baby
Rock away your blues


Now I knew a gal her name is Lindsey-loo
She told me she loved me but I know it aint true
Put on your Madison shoes
Put on your Madison blues shoes
I've got the Madison blues
Now put on your Madison blues shoes

You cats talk about your Madison shoes
We're doing a thing we call the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues, baby
Rock away your blues

You babes are talking about your Madison shoes
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues, baby
Rock away your blues
