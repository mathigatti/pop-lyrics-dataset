Whoa, treat me sweet mama 'low me one more show
Treat me sweet mama 'low me one more show
I swear to the lord I won't do wrong no more


I don't love no woman - if she got easy ways
I don't love no woman if she got easy ways
I'm crazy about my little girl she's always been my crave

break:

I woke up this morning, just before the brake of day
I woke up this morning, just before the brake of day
I looked at the pillow where my good girl used to lay

I hung my head boys, I - cried just like a child
I hung my head boys, I - cried just like a child
I said the way I'm treated, mama, sure ain't satisfied

I've got the blues so bad, little girl - my poor ol' heart is sore
I've got the blues so bad, mama - poor ol' heart is sore
I just can't rest - mama know where I go
