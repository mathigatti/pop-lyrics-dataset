Moonshine time
Thoughts of you
Spinning round
As thoughts do
I just wondered if
Your eyes still shine
As they did
When you were mine


I can see
In a dream
Thougts so clear
And jewels that gleam
Would your eyes
Still sparkle then
If we were, once again

Jewel eyed Judy please come home
Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone
Jewel eyed Judy please come home
Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone

Lovely Judy
Can you see
Where it is
You're meant to be
Where you lay
Your head tonight
May the stars
Find your light
So am I
Sitting here
Moonlight glistens
On my tears
Is this all
That we could find
Chains of memories
Left behind

Jewel eyed Judy please come home
Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone
Jewel eyed Judy please come home
Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone
