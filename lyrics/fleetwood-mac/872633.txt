This is the rock
We've been talking about
Yeah this is the rock
Makes you jump and shout


This is the rock
That knocks you right out

It makes you lose
All your troubles and cares
You'll lose your blues
They ain't going nowhere

This is the rock
That hits you right there

Well you can get back on the roof
And shout it all around
Get up on your seats about
What I'm putting down
Get em all a hoping to that crazy beat
Get up all a boppin' and a tappin' their feet

Cause it's the rock
Moves you all day long
Yeah it's the rock
Gettin' everyone
This is the rock
That really turns you on

Whooooooo!
