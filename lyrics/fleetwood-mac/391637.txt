Every night that goes between
I feel a little less
As you slowly go away from me
This is only another test


Every day you do not come
Your softness fades away
Did i ever really care that much
Is there anything left to say

Chorus
Every hour of fear i spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly call inside

I haven't felt this way i feel
Since many a year ago
But in those years and the lifetimes past
I did not deal with the road

And i did not deal with you i know
Tho the love has always been
So i search to find an answer there
So i can truly win

Chorus

So i try to say
Goodbye my friend
I'd like to leave you with something warm
But never have i been a blue calm sea
I have always been a storm

We were frail
She said
"everynight he will break your heart"
I should have known from the first
I'd be the broken hearted
But i loved you from the start
Save us...
And not all the prayers in the world -- could save us
