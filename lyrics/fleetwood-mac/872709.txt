Oh I slept in a derelict
And I ate off the floor
I was wrapped in a blanket
As a knock came on the door
You can get out of here
Said a man in a raincoat
So I moved in with you and you loved me


Took a trip down the highway
And I spoke with my folks
It's a serious business
And there's no time for jokes
You can get out of here
Said a middle aged lady
So I moved in with you, and you loved me

Yes you loved, you loved me
There was so much at stake
Too much confusion
I'd had all I could take
No more get out of heres
From a man in a raincoat
Cause I moved in with you, and you loved me
