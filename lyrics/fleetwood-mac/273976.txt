Why do you come around?
So very much
You know it just brings you down 
It's just something you can touch


You don't belong here 
I guess you never did 
Whisper "Look up" in your ear 
You just keep it so well hid

Anyone at all 
Could see what was missing 
Could see you were dying
But no one was crying

And I did hear what you said
Now I can go home
All my days are blue
All my days are bright

Red Rover, Red Rover, Red Rover
We come, we come, we come, we come
To take you over
Take you over
Red rover
Take you over

One of the quiet ones
One of the few
Now fall down onto your knees
Show us all what you can do

We came around here
To see if you were well
And there's nothing for you to fear
In Heaven or in Hell

Anyone at all 
Could see what was missing 
Could see you were dying 
But no one was crying

And I did hear what you said 
Now time to drive home
All my days are blue
All my days are bright

Red Rover, Red Rover, Red Rover 
We come, we come, we come, we come 
To take you over 
Take you over
Red rover
Take you over
Red rover
Take you over
Red rover
Take you over
