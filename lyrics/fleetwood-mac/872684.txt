Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
You got to shake your moneymaker, yeah
Shake your moneymaker
You got to shake your moneymaker
And then...


I got a gal that lives up on a hill
I got a gal that lives up on a hill
Says she'll let me roll her
But I don't believe she will

She won't shake her moneymaker
Won't shake her moneymaker
I want to roll her I keep beggin'
She won't shake her moneymaker
Won't shake her money maker
She won't...

break:

I got a girl, but she just won't be true
I got a girl, but she just won't be true
Won't let me do the one good thing I tell her to

She won't shake her moneymaker
Won't shake her moneymaker
Won't shake her moneymaker
She won't shake her moneymaker
Won't shake her moneymaker
She won't...
