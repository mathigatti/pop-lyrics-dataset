You've got to move, you can't stay here no more
You've got to move, you can't stay here no more, oh yes
You're my baby, I love you so, 
but, still you've got to go - away from here


You won't cook, you won't wash
You won't iron, you won't sew
Oh, no, you won't even scrub the floor
You're my baby, I love you so, 
but, still you've got to go - away from here

Well, I'd rather be dead and in my grave
Then to see another man here to take my place
Oh, yes, you've got to move, yeah
You're my baby, I love you so, 
but still you've got to go away from here

break:

Well, I'd rather be dead and in my grave
Then to see another man here to take my place
Umm, yes, you've got to move, yeah
You're my baby, I love you so, 
but still you've got to go away from here

You got to move, away from here
Oh, yes, you got to move, away from here
You're my baby, I love you so
But still you've got to go away from here

Let's bring it out now
