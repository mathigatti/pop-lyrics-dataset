Now you know the world's all in a tangle man
Everybody begin to sing this song
The Reds are just over yonder boys
And we ain't gonna be here long


That's why I'm gonna build myself a cave
Move down in the ground
When I go into the army babe
Won't be no more Reds around

Now you know I got my personary man [note: best translation]
I've got my class cattoo [note: best translation]
I begin to feel so worried
I just don't know what to do

That's why I'm gonna build myself a cave
Move down in the ground
When I go into the army babe
Won't be no more Reds around me

Now you know the world's all in a tangle man
Everybody begin to sing this song
The Reds are just over yonder boys
And we ain't gonna be here long

That's why I'm gonna build myself a cave
Move down in the ground
When I go into the army babe
Won't be no more Reds around me
