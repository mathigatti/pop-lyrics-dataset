When the white flame in us is gone
And we that lost the world's delight
Stiffen in darkness.
Left alone
To crumble in our separate light
When your swift hair is quiet in death
And through the lips corruption thrust to still the labor of my breath


When we are dust, when we are dust
When we are dust, when we are dust

When your swift hair is quiet in death
And through the lips corruption thrust to still the labor of my breath

When we are dust, when we are dust
When we are dust, when we are dust

When the white flame in us is gone
And we that lost the world's delight
Stiffen in darkness
Left alone
To crumble in our separate light
When your swift hair is quiet in death
And through the lips corruption thrust to still the labor of my breath

When we are dust, when we are dust
When we are dust, when we are dust
