I'm gettin' up soon in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gettin' up soon in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I quit the best I'm lovin'
Now my friends can get in my room


I'm gonna write a letter, telephone every town I know
I'm gonna write a letter, telephone every town I know
If I don't find her in mississippi
She be in East Monroe I know

I don't want no woman
Who wants every downtown man she meets
I don't want no woman
Who wants every downtown man she meets
Man cause no good darlin'
They shouldn't lie her on the street yeah

I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I ain't gonna leave my baby
And break up my happy home
