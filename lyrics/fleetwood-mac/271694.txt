I'm a ramblin' pony
Rollin' from town to town
I'm a ramblin' pony
Rollin' from town to town
I'm a looking for a sweet woman - make my love come down


She's a marriied woman, yeah
Only nine years old
She's a marriied woman, yeah
Only nine years old
I got a woman I'm loving - keeps me fishin' all day long

Now, I'm, thinking this old feeling
Crossing this countryside
Now, I'm, thinking this old feeling
Crossing the countryside
I've got a lover now - she won't let old Greeny ride

Now, I'm leaving this morning won't be back no more
Now, I'm leaving this morning won't be back no more
There ain't a rider in the city - keep me inside the door
