It's hard
When a love goes wrong
Picking up the pieces to go on
Our dreams
Are scattered in the wind
I won't let it take me under
Even though you tried...and...


I wonder why
Things go the way they do
Why people lie, and break a heart in two
I wonder why
Things go the way they do

It's strange
Strange the way I feel
Time is all I need to make me heal
You're gone
And now I'm all alone (now you're all alone)
I'll reclaim the thunder
Dry the tears I'be cried...still...

I wonder why
Things go the way they do
Why people lie, and break a heart in two
I wonder why
Things go the way they do

Now I'm turning my back on confusion
I won't live in a world of illusion
Well the river stopped running through me
You did'nt see what you did to me
I've got to try to find, some kind of peace of mind
You're just a mystery to me

I'll reclaim the thunder
Dry the tears I've cried...still...

I wonder why
Things go the way they do
Why people lie, and break a heart in two
I wonder why
Things go the way they do
