String-a-long, string-a-long, that's what I am 
String-a-long, string-a-long, that's what I am 


String-a-long - that's all I am is just your
string-a-long someone that you just seem to
bring along, whenever you are all alone 
and need some company you always turn to me

String-a-long - that's all I do is sort of 
string-a-long you never seem to notice 
I'm along although I hope and pray that
you will need me someday

All I ever do - is tag along with you 
no matter where you chance to roam
I'm just satisfied - to be by your side 
here - there - near - far - I wanna be anywhere you are

Treat me wrong and maybe soon you'll lose your 
string-a-long, someone may come and bring a 
love that's strong and wanna string-a-long with me

I'll find somebody new - won't treat me like you do
I'll find somebody new - won't treat me like you do
