So you face yesterday
Thinking on the days of old
And the price that we paid
For a love we couldn't hold


I let you slip away
There was nothing I could do
That was so long ago, yeah
Still I often think of you

I fall down, I get up
And I've always had to fight
Everything that was wrong
For the things that were right

Now I finally found my way
Now I know just what to do
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you

It's so hard to find your way
When the lies come around
Still it happens everyday
So don't let it get you down

Just a time within a time
Just a scheme within a scheme
A little world within a world
Yes, a dream, just a dream

Now I finally found my way
Now I know just what to do
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you

Now I best be on my way
Before the night turns blue
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
And now I say goodbye to you
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you
