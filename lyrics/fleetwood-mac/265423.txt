Oh I have seen
Such madness in the air
Just like a dream
It makes no sense anywhere


Hopes have shattered
Shattered like broken glass
I believed it was just too good to last
(It seemed to me it was too good to last)

So now you're saying you've been wrong
And you want to come back home
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart of stone

And now you want to change your song
You're tired of living alone
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart made of stone

But don't you remember
Those days of cold delight
We could make it all right

It seems so long ago
Oh maybe it was yesterday
Where did the time go
I guess it just slipped away
(Seemed like the time was slipping away)

So now you're saying you've been wrong
And you want to come back home
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart of stone

And now you want to change your song
You're tired of living alone
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart made of stone

You're never too old to learn
You're never too young to pray
It's never too late to learn
And hope for better days

You're never too old to learn
You're never too young to pray
It's never too late to learn
And hope for better days

So now you're saying you've been wrong
And you want to come back home
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart of stone

And now you want to change your song
You're tired of living alone
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart made of stone

So now you're saying you've been wrong
And you want to come back home
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart of stone
