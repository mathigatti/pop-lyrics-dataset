Standin' in the shadows
The man I used to be
I wanna go back 
(Can't go back, can't go back)
Melodies awaken
Sorrows from their sleep
I wanna go back 
(Can't go back, can't go back)


She was just a dream maker,
Dreamer of sighs
Shadow on the one who used to cry
A face as soft as a tear in a clown's eye
I wanna go back 
(Can't go back, can't go back)

She was just a dream maker,
Dreamer of sighs
Shadow on the one who used to cry
A face as soft as a tear in a clown's eye
I wanna go back 
(Can't go back, can't go back)
