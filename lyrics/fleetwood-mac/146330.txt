I took my love,and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around


And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
'Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail thru the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

Uh-uh I don't know
Uh-uh

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older too

I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older too
I'm getting older too

Oh, take this love, take it down
Oh, if you climb a mountain and turn around
If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down down

And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well maybe the landslide will bring it down
