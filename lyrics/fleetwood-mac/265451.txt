Last Night
I lost the best friend I ever had
Last Night
I lost the best friend I ever had
You know she gone, she gone and left me
That made me feel, feel so bad


Now it's early in the morning
And my love is comin' down for you
Early in the morning
And my love is comin' down for you
I want you to tell me, tell me, tell me baby, now
What in the world are we gonna do

If she don't come back
I don't know what I'm gonna just do
If she don't never come back
I don't know what in the world I'm gonna do
æ…ause she's gone and left me
Left me to see the whole night through
