Clear as the morning rain
Seeing it very plain
We've got to start again


What's that you do
What's that you say
There's no use complaining
It's the only way
There's no use feeling dissatisfied
Cause how can you know until you've tried

Clear as the morning rain
Seeing it very plain
We've got to start again

Everthings going around in my head
The futures new and the past is dead
Pull out the stops, turn on the light
Cause away from the darkness everything seems bright

Clear as the morning rain
Seeing it very plain
We've got to start again

Do do do do do 
do do do do do do do
Do do do do do
do do do do do do do
Do do do do do 
do do do do do do do
Do do do do do 
do do do do do do do...
