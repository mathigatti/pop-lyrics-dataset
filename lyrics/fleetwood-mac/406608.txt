All it took was a special look
And I felt I knew you before
Didn't mean to love you
Didn't think it would work out
But I knew we would be together
And I couldn't wait for more
But what can they say
It's not against the law
Chorus
I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me.
I believe that you really want me
But it's not easy, just to give in
So let yourself go, and let love begin.
