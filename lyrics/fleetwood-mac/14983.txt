Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say


I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud
And I can't get the words out

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere)

Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly

Come on baby
We'd better make a start
You'd better make it soon
Before you break my heart

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere)

Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say

Come along baby
We'd better make a start
You'd better make it soon
Before you break my heart

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere)
