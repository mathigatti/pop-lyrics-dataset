If I've been acting a little strange
And you have noticed it too
It's 'cos my life has been rearranged
With the presence of you
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
How can we fail
Can you give me one reason why
You'd ever let me down
I won't believe it baby, but I'll try
The truth's goin' to come around
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
How can we fail
The sky is the limit
Oh, the sky is the limit
How can we fail
Sooner or later
I'll keep the promise
I made you
Sooner or later
It will be greater
Than we ever knew
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
The sky is the limit now
We can hit it on the nail
And when we do
I'll think about you
How can we fail
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Oh, the sky is the limit
How can we fail
The sky is the limit
Oh, the sky is the limit
How can we fail
