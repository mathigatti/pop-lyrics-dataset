To be the last to leave
The last to be gone
Stolen from the ones
Who held onto it
To be the last in line
Oh the ones that live on
Silhouette of a dream
Treasured by the ones
Who hung on to it


Almost a breakdown
Of our love affair
The stiletto cuts quick
Like a whip through the air
Long distance winners
Will we survive the flight
Not one of us runs
From the fire light

I would love to believe
I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
Oh no there is no easy way
No one ever leaves
Everyone stays close 'till the fire fades

I would love to believe
I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
For us there is no easy way
No one ever leaves
Everyone stays close 'till the fire fades

To be the last to leave
What caused the fearsome
Divorce in the night
There was no competition
Well to survive do it right
And you believe in the five
To survive the distance
Everyone fights
Everyone fights
And the fire flies

What happened to my feelings
When heartbreak comes in the night
Some call it my nightmare
My five fireflies
Well like a sailing ship
On one of love's rocks

No one

Of our love affair
Like a whip through the air
I would love to believe
I believe what you say

(Guitar interlude)

Fireflies....
