Once in everyone's life
You know a feeling has to grow
And you may be having a bad time
And you really shouldn't let it show
You're taking a risk, but it doesn't matter
'Cos you know, you know that it's real
I can't conceal the way that I feel
I can't conceal the way, the way that I feel
How many times have I told you
Oh, I adore you
And if it meant anything at all
I'd do anything for you
But it's too late and I know I'm making
A fool, a fool of myself
But I can't conceal the way that I feel
I can't conceal the way, the way that I feel
