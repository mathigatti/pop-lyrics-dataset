Well you thought you had a hold on me
But it's different now
Everything you done before has fell upon you now


Are you just a bad loser
But you never let go
(and you're gonna go down)
Yes you'll go down, but you'll never let it show

All the strings and strokes in the ocean
Won't buy you peice of mind
All because you did what you did
You're not the peaceful kind

You're just a bad loser
And you'll never let go
(and you're gonna go down)
Yes you'll go down, but you'll never, never let it show

I think you really know what I mean
But I'll tell you one more time
Oh cause it's the truth and you know it
That you're no friend of mine

You're just a bad loser
And you'll never let go
(and you're gonna go down)
Yes you'll go down, but you'll never let it show
