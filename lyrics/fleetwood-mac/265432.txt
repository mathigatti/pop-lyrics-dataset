I'm gettin' up soon in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gettin' up soon in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
I quit the best gal I'm loving, ah
Now my friends can get in my room


I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone every town I know
I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone every town I know
If I don't find her in Mississippi
She'll be in East Monroe I know

I don't want no woman
Want every downtown man she meet
No, I don't want no woman
Want every downtown man she meet
Man, she a no good darling
They'll shouldn't allow her on the street, yeah

break:

I believe
I believe my time ain't long
I believe
I believe my time ain't long
I ain't gonna leave my baby
and break up my happy home
