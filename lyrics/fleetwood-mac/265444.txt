Illume says the candle that I burn
A reflection in the window
All the way to Point Dune
Illume like it dances
I am a cliff dweller
From the old school 


I like the coastal cities
I like the lights
I like the way the ocean bends
Into the city at night
It's like living on a working river
This coastline is glittering
Like a diamond snake 
In a black sky 

I am alone now
With my thoughts
how we could make it
how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger 

I will not take you for granted
I wouldn't trade it for jade
Or for diamonds
Not for one minute
Not for anything
I need you to be there
Just remember when I am haunted
That I was just so scared 

I am alone now... 

What I saw on this journey
I saw history go down
I cannot pretend
That the heartache falls away
It's just like a river
Ooh, it's never ending
I cannot pretend
That the heartache falls away 

Because I
It's just like a river
It's never ending
It's just like a river
It's never ending 

I am alone now...
What I saw on this journey...
I am alone now....
What I saw on this journey...
