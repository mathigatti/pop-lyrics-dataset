Got a black magic woman 
I got a black magic woman 
Yes, I got a black magic woman 
Got me so blind I can't see 
But she's a black magic woman 
And she's tryin' to make a devil out of me 


Don't turn your back on me baby 
Don't turn your back on me baby 
Yes, don't turn your back on me baby 
You're messin' around with your tricks 
Don't turn your back on me baby 
'Cause you might just break up my magic stick 

You got your spell on me baby 
You got your spell on me baby 
Yes, you got your spell on me baby 
You're turning my heart into stone 
I need you so bad, magic woman, I can't leave you alone 

Yes, I need you so bad 
Well, I need you darling 
Yeah, I need you darling 
Yes, I want you love me 
I want you love me 
Whoa, I want you love me, ah 
Whoh, yeah 
Oh, whoa, baby 
Yes, I need your love 
Oh, I need your love so bad 
I want you love me
