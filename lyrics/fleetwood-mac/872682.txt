Don't know why I have to work
Don't know why I can't play
Turn me off turn me out
But don't turn me away
Save me a place
I'll come running if you love me today


Don't know why I have to go
Don't know why I can't stay
Guess I want to be alone
And I guess I need to be amazed
Save me a place
I'll come running if you love me today
I'll come running if you love me today.
