Honey, honey, honey
Who could be sweeter than you
Honey, honey, honey
Bitter sweet, but what can I do


Lord, it's good to talk to you
Even sweeter than wine
Don't take the love light away
'Cause I'm far away from home

Daddy, all I'm trying to tell you
Lord, I really love you, love you, love you
Honey, honey, honey hi
Honey, honey, honey hi
Honey, honey, honey hi.
