I like the way the light falls today
Slow, too lazy for anything
I see boats that go sailin' past me (But not too fast)
You know, I wish this day could keep on goin' and last forever


Please don't fool around with my happiness
I like the way the light falls today
Please just let it stay that way
Slow, easy, forever
