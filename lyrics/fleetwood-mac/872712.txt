Now, when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
The night is so black that the darkness cooks
Don't you come creepin' around - makin' me do things I don't want to


Can't believe that you need my love so bad
Come sneakin' around tryin' to drive me mad
Bustin' in on my dreams - making me see things I don't wanna see

break:

'Cause you're da Green Manalishi with the two prong crown
All my tryin' is up - all your bringin' is down
Just taking my love then slippin' away 
Leavin' me here just tryin' to keep from following you
