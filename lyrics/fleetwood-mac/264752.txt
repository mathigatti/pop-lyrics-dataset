It's always something
Or it ain't nothing at all
It's feast or famine
Too hot or out in the cold
So here we stand
Alone together
Our backs against the wall
If my heart wasn't in it
I wouldn't be here at all


Blow by blow
Well it's blow by blow
And here we go again
(Here we go again)
Well it's blow by blow

Coming off the ropes
And fighting for the hope in us all
Are you in my corner
Or playing both sides of the wall
So make a stand
It's now or never
Cause life is much too short
And if your heart isn't in it
You shouldn't be here at all

Blow by blow
Well it's blow by blow
And here we go again
(Here we go again)
Well it's blow by blow

Blow by blow
Well it's blow by blow
I'm back on my feet again
(I'm back on my feet again)
Well it's blow by blow

I can almost see through the tears
And I've got my pride
The dreams that I've hidden for years
Just won't be denied

So here we stand
Alone together
Our backs against the wall
If my heart wasn't in it
I wouldn't be here at all

Blow by blow
Well it's blow by blow
And here we go again
(Here we go again)
Well it's blow by blow

Blow by blow
Well it's blow by blow
I'm back on my feet again
(I'm back on my feet again)
Well it's blow by blow
