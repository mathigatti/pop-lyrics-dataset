Oh they call me doctor brown
They call me that lovin' man
Oh, they call me doctor brown
They call me that lovin' man
And if you got some trouble
Come around and see what you can


You don't have no prescription
You don't have to take no pills
You don't have no prescription
And baby don't have to take no pills
If you come to see me
Doctor brown will cure your ills

Oh ask any woman in my neighborhood
You just ask any woman in my neighborhood

You just ask any woman
In my neighborhood
You just ask any woman
In my neighborhood
If doctor brown don't cure you
Nobody can do you no good

Yes, you don't have no prescription
And baby you don't have to take no pills
You don't have no prescription
And baby you don't have to take no pills
You just come around to see me
And doctor brown will cure your ills
