If you be my baby, tell you what I'll do
I'll give you so much lovin', you gotta love me too
If you be my baby
If you be my baby
If you be my baby
I'm gonna keep you satisfied


Now listen to me baby, just what I'm talkin' 'bout
You got something woman, makes a dumb man scream and shout
If you be my baby
If you be my baby
If you be my baby
I'm gonna keep you satisfied

Lookin' for a woman, never done no wrong
Cook my meals in the day time and love me all night long
If you be my baby
If you be my baby
If you be my baby
I'm gonna keep you satisfied

If you be my baby, tell you what I'll do
I'll give you so much lovin', you gotta love me too
If you be my baby
If you be my baby
If you be my baby
I'm gonna keep you satisfied
