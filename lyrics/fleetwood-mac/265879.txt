One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone


You may come home one morning
And find she's not sleeping alone
Oh, then baby you'll see
Oh yes, you should have stayed at home
Because

One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone
Just one more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight

If you want her, better get her now
Or she'll be running away somehow
Oh, it's not for me to say
If she'll be happy some other way
Because

One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone
Oh, One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight
Don't be a fool

Just one more lonely night
Oh, One lonely night
Wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight
Don't be a fool

Just one more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight
