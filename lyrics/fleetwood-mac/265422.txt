Now I'm supposed to understand
Don't you think you're asking too much
What kind of fool do you think I am
Don't you think you've hurt me enough
Still you want to be friends
But I don't want to be just friends


So before you start with your sympathy
Just turn around and go
And if he breaks your heart, don't come crying to me
I won't be there anymore
Go ahead and cry your tears
'Cause I'm not gonna dry your tears

I've got hard feelings
When it comes to you and me
And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be
These hard feelings run deep
These hard feelings run deep

I'll be alright, don't you worry about me
I'll take care of myself
The first thing I need is you out of my life
The last thing I need is your help
Sorry I met you
Sorry I met you
I will forget you, someday

I've got hard feelings
When it comes to you and me
And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be
These hard feelings run deep
These hard feelings run deep

I've got hard feelings
When it comes to you and me
And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be
These hard feelings run deep
These hard feelings

Hard feelings
When it comes to you and me
And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be
These hard feelings run deep
These hard feelings run deep

Hard feelings
Just won't let me be
Hard feelings
Hard feelings
