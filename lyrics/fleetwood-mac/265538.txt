My little demon, comin'on down.
My little demon's turnin' me around.
all of my friends keep on tellin'me
that I just ain't the man I used to be.
I really don't like it...ain't nothing I can do.
I really don't like it...I'm leaving it to you.
My little demon, making me choose.
Making me an offer I can't refuse.
Hard as a rock,dry as a bone...
Big or little,know that I will take you home.
I really don't like it...ain't nothin'I can do.
I really don't like it...I'm leaving it to you.
Why try to hide it?
Fight it...fight it!
I really don't like it...ain't nothin'I can do.
I really don't like it...I'm leaving it to you.
My little demon is coming after me.
My little demon...
It's all that I can do to keep that little demon...
To keep that little demon...
Just to keep that little demon away from you!
