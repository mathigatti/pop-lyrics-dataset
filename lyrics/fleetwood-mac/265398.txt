Why baby why are you still so sad
When you know how much I need you
I hate to see you feel so bad
When I try so hard to please you
You know I'd do anything
Just to see you smile againg
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to take away a little pain


You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)

My home is yours and I want you to know
That I need you to depend on
Any everything you feel I'm feeling too
And I just hope you haven't forgotten
How can I make the sunshine through
So we can be happy again
Oh baby there's got to be a way
Just to take away a little pain

You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)

Please don't say you don't love me anymore
Cause I couldn't ease up on you
You're the only reason for all my joy
And without you what would I do
Cause I'd do anything
Just to see you smile againg
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to take away a little pain

You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)
