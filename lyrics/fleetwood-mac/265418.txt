I did a thing last night
You know those future games
I turned off all the lights
Oh, the future came
You were by my side
Will you explain-oh yeah
Real rhyme or reason for those future games


Now you were there last night
And oh were you afraid
Of things we'd come upon
While playing future games
But baby it's alright and so have faith
Oh yeah, you invent the future that you want to face

How many people sit home at night
Wondering if they will be here tonight
Wondering if children will he bring to the light
Inherit the world, or inherit the night
Wondering if neighbors are thinking the same
All of the wild things tomorrow will tame
Talking of journeys that happen in vain

Well I know I'm not the only one
To ever spend my life sitting playing future games

You better take your time
You know there's no escape
The future sends a sign
Of things we will create
Baby it's alright
And so have faith
Oh yeah, you invent the future that you want to face

How many people sit home at night
Wondering if they will be here tonight
Wondering if children will he bring to the light
Inherit the world, or inherit the night
Wondering if neighbors are thinking the same
All of the wild things tomorrow will tame
Talking of journeys that happen in vain

And I know I'm not the only one
To ever spend my life sitting playing future games

Future games...
Future games...
Future games...
Future games...

I know I'm not the only one...
I know I'm not the only one...
I know I'm not the only one...
I know I'm not the only one...
I know I'm not the only one...
I know I'm not the only one...
I know I'm not the only one...
I know I'm not the only one...
