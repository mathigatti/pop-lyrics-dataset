I have to laugh
I have to laugh
When I think
Of the fool I used to be


I use to love a girl
A did all I could
To make her
Love me

I once heard a song
Called appeared the fool
I believe that song
Was written for me
Because that song
Reminds me
Of the fool
I use to be

Was she use to make
Me stand, at the tension
Standing
Till she said "I ease"
And I can't see how
She made me
For long I've bent
The knees

Now it's over
All over
And I'm so glad
To be free
I have to laugh
Cause is so funny
Cause now she's air to me
