The magic of a blackened night
Can go so far, but not seem right


Although my love, will drive away the sunshine
The magic of, a blackened night
And before you go show me
All the words of love

And the falling sands of time
Blow my wind and drifted by
To and frow the trees still bend
Wondering what the host will send
We will go right down to the sea
Bathing in light we will be free to wander

And the falling sands of time
Blow my wind and drifted by
To and frow the trees still bend
Wondering what the host will send
We will go right down to the sea
Bathing in light we will be free to wander

And the falling sands of time
Blow my wind and drifted by
To and frow the trees still bend
Wondering what the host will send
We will go right down to the sea
Bathing in light we will be free to wander

The magic of a blackened night
Can go so far, but not seem right

Although my love, will drive away the sunshine
The magic of, a blackened night
