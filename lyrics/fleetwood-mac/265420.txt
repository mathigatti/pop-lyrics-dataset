Don't take me to the tower
And take my child away
It was I who was the hourglass
And the sands of time like shattering glass went past me
Like a tunnel to the sea 


And I who went to sleep as two
Woke up as one now only you remain
You'll close your eyes and travel back
To the time when the light went fading fast
And the words you'll never, never forget, oh no
As you slipped away 

Goodbye baby
I hope your heart's not broken
Don't forget me
Yes I was outspoken
You were with me all the time
I'll be with you one day 

And I who went to sleep in tears
Woke up in tears
For all of the years
And I who never, never said goodbye
As I slipped away 

Goodbye baby
