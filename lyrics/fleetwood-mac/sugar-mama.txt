Now then tell me sugar mama
Now where in the world did you get your sugar from?
Now then tell me sugar mama
Now where in the world did you get your sugar from?
Was it back in Philadelphia woman?
Back from the place where you come from


You know they're braggin' about your sugar
Yes I said they're braggin' about it all over town
Yes I said they're braggin' about your sugar
Whoa I said they're braggin' about it all over town
Everyplace I go
Sugar Mama, sure can here your name

I like my coffee sweet in the morning baby
Yes you know I'm crazy about my tea at night
Yes I said I like my coffee sweet in the morning
Baby you know I'm just crazy about my tea at night
Don't get my sugar three times a day
Baby you know you and me just can't get along right
