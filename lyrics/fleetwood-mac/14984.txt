Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon
And dig your grave


Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I'll pray

Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud

Did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now, do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale
In your shadow

Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale

Did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now, do you know how?
Pickup the pieces and go home

Oh, pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Oh, pale shadow of a woman
Oh, black widow
Oh, pale shadow, sheâ€™s a dragon
Gold dust woman
Woman, woman
