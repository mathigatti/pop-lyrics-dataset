Oh my mind is made up about you
Now and always
Though the seasons come and they go
Nothing will ever change


Well I took a little chance
And I laid my heart down
I thought you'd be the one
Who would always stick around

I took a little time
Though I knew it would be
That we had a date with destiny

Well out of the darkness
And out of the long black night
You have given me heart, yes
And you showed me the light
And I do, I do
I love you for what you are

Well this heart of mine
I know it so well
There are so many strange stories
That I could tell
Many is a time
I went out on a limb
You reached out for me baby
And you brought me back again

A lot of stormy nights
I've seen many a full moon, but darling
This is love in the afternoon

Well out of the darkness
And out of the long black night
You have given me heart, yes
And you showed me the light
And I do, I do
I love you for what you are

So out of the darkness
And out of the long black night
You have given me heart, yes
And you showed me the light
And I do, I do
I love you for what you are

Yes I love you for what you are

I love you for what you are
I do love you for what you are
Yes I do love you for what you are...
