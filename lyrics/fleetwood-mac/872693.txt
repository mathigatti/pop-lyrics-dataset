Why not lie here in my arms
And listen to the night
You must know you have certain charm
And I feel the time is right


So spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (of your love)
Spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (of your love)

Now I know that I feel much more
Oh in every single way
And it's not the same as before
It gets stronger everyday

So spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (of your love)
Spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (of your love)

Now I know how the sun must feel
Every time it shines
And now I know this is real
And I want you to be mine

So spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (of your love)
Spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little (just a little bit)
Spare me a little of your love (of your love)

Just a little bit
