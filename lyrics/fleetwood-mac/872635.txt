I've seen so many things that made me wonder
But sometimes it's hard to tell
I said
"Take your time"
But no one was listening
I walk a thin line


They told me that I never would recover
Still some say they knew me well
I said
"Stay by my side"
But no one said nothin'
I walk a thin line

I said
"Please toe the line"
But no one was listening
I walk a thin line

I said
"Fate takes time"
But no one was listening
I walk a thin line.
