Sleep easy by my side
Into gentle slumber you can hide
I, I'm waiting for the Sun, to come up
I can't sleep, with your warm ways


Forever
Forever love
Together
Together love

You made me a woman tonight
Dream until the morning light
I, I'm waiting for the Sun, to come up
I can't sleep, with your warm way

Forever
Forever love
Together
Together love
