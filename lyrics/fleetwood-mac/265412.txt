Walk down this road
When the road gets rough
I fall down
I get up


I am what I am...
A family man
I am what I am...
A family man
Mother... father... brother...
Mother... father... brother...

Walk down this road
In the cool of the night
Don't know what's wrong
But I do know what's right

I am what I am...
A family man
I am what I am...
A family man
Mother... father... brother...
Mother... father... brother...

I am what I am...
A family man
I am what I am...
A family man
Mother... father... brother...
Mother... father... brother...
