Goodbye Angel 
I'm going down but I'm not going 'round the bend 
I'm giving out but I'm not giving in 


Love turned to hate 
Touch turned to pull 
What could I do 
My cup was full 
Goodbye angel 

Goodbye Angel 
I'm giving out, but I'm not giving in 
'Cause yesterday is not like today my friend 

Love turned to hate 
Touch turned to pull 
What could I do 
My cup was full 
Goodbye angel 

Goodbye angel 
(Just let it go) 
(Keeping on pulling) 
(Just let it go) 
Goodbye angel 
(Keeping on pulling) 
(Just let it go)
