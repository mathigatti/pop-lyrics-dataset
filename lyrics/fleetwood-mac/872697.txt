Station Man
I've been waiting
Can you tell me
When we're leaving


Midnight train
Now is leaving

Engine screaming

ah, ah
ah, ah
ah, ah
ah, ah

Where I'm going I don't know
But you tell me I must go
When we're leaving I don't know
But you tell me now

I see it's coming
And bringing something
This train of lovin'
I see it's comin'
I feel it's runnin'
This train of lovin'
From ages past

Station Man
I've been waiting
Can you tell me
When we're leaving
