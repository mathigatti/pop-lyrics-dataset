These strange times I think of a friend
They said was a man of the world
When all the time he was in a fight
Between the dark and the light
Yes I too, my friend, find the devil
Trying to make me do things I don't want to do
Now I find myself crying out
God is nowhere, God is nowhere


These strange times I look in my heart
And see the dark not the light
And how I'm sad and wished I was in love
And look to the sky and cry out
God is nowhere, God is nowhere
And this is hell
Being caught between the dark and the light
Daddy, daddy, hold on
God is now here, God is now here

These strange times I too have dreams
Things that make me wonder
If to walk a thin line is like dying alone
And I'm trying to find my way home
To where God is now here and the dark is now light
Yes I'm crying out, God is now here
God is now here and that was hell
Being caught between the dark and the light
Between the dark and the light

These strange times I look in my heart
And how I'm sad and wished I was in love
And I look to the sky and cry out
God is now here, God is now here
God is now here, God is now here
My friend I do wish that I was in love
I wished I was in love
I love you, I love you
