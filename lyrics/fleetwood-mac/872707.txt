The big boat is at the landing
And my baby is waitin' to step on board
The big boat is at the landing


And my baby is waitin' to step on board
Yes, I know the little girl is leavin'
Oh but the reason why I just don't know

I was standin' at the landing
Crying sweet thing please don't go
I was standin' at the landing
Crying baby doll please don't go
Well, because you know I love you
Yes, I love you, woman
I love you with all my heart and soul

You know I got to find my baby
If it takes a lifetime to track her down
I got to find my baby
If it take a lifetime to track her down
I'm gonna stay on the trail of my little sweet thing
Keep her just like an old bloodhound
