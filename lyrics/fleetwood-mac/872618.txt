Push too hard, I'll pack my bags, I'm going
Ahh, got to learn to let the river flow
Move too fast, You'll end up never knowing
What's inside my heart, give it time to grow


I need just a little space
Then I won't be afraid

When it comes to love, got to treat it special
When it comes to love, shouldn't be no pressure
When it comes to love, got to take it easy
You can't be too careful, when it comes to love

In your eyes I see a fire burning
Never seen it ever burn so bright
Beneath my feet I feel the earth start turning
Long enough to take my breath away and I

Need to know, what you feel
Got to show, it's for real

When it comes to love, got to treat it special
When it comes to love, shouldn't be no pressure
When it comes to love, got to take it easy
You can't be too careful, when it comes to love

When it comes to love
Take It Easy
Got to learn to take it slow
When it comes to love
Keep believin'
When it comes to love
Give it time, and just let it grow

I need to know, what you feel
Got to show, it's for real

When it comes to love, got to treat it special
When it comes to love, shouldn't be no pressure
When it comes to love, got to take it easy
You can't be too careful, when it comes to love

When it comes to love, got to treat it special
When it comes to love, shouldn't be no pressure
When it comes to love, got to take it easy
You can't be too careful, when it comes to love

When it comes to love, it's special
When it comes to love, shouldn't be no pressure
When it comes to love, got to take it easy
You can't be too careful, when it comes to love
When it comes to love, it's special
