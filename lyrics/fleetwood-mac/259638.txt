My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself
My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself
I loved another woman - I lost my best gal


She was a real good woman - she didn't me no harm
She was a real good woman - she wouldn't do me no harm
But I loved another woman - now she's up and she's gone

break:

Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong
Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong
I loved another woman - now, I won't do that no more
