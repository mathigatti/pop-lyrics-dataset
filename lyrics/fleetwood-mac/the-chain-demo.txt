Slipped into the denseness of my emptiness
I let teardrops fall, I let him go
Stepped into the canyons of my loneliness
And I went about as far as I could go


And even as I searched for you, I knew
That even if I found you, you’d be so cold
Even when I found you now, baby I knew
That I had gone about as far as I could go

And if you don’t love me now
You'll never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
I can still hear you saying
That if you don’t love me now
You won’t love me again

I don’t mean to beg
But I don’t know what else to say
If you meant what you said
You’d have been here yesterday
I won’t watch you go, no
And I won’t even try
There you go down the road
But don’t look to me to say goodbye

And if you don’t love me now
You'll never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
And if don’t love me now
You won’t love me again
You won’t love me again
You won’t love me again

Why don’t you love me?
I’m down on my knees
Begging you to please
Baby, don’t leave me
Baby, don’t leave me
Baby, please
Baby, please
Baby, don’t leave me
Baby, don’t leave me
Baby, don’t leave me
