I went down to the station 
I leaned up against the door
Yeah, I went down to the station 
I leaned up against the door
I said good-bye to my sweet, ride on
I said now, she couldn't use me no more


It was a mean old fireman
And a cruel old engineer
He was a mean old fireman
And a cruel old engineer
Yes, takin' way my sweet woman
And left me standing here

break:

I used to roll my baby
Till she - was forced to jump and shout
I used to roll my sweet baby
Till she was forced to jump and shout
Now that train pulls in boys
And I'll come walkin out

I heard the fireman blow the whistle
And the engineer ring the bell
I heard the fireman blow the whistle
And engineer ring the bell
I knew it was time boys 
To - bid my baby farewell
um
