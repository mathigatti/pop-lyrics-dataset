Enchanted you thought you saw something in my eyes
Enchanted it's a shame that you wanted me
You didn't try


Why the face oh darling
Was it my darkness shadow light
I mean to cause no trouble for you
That is the story of my life

Enchanted you thought you saw something in my eyes
Enchanted it's a shame that you wanted me
You didn't try
Enchanted wo it's just a voice thru the night
Enchanted well I hope you make it

You were gone you were gone from me
When I remember someone I remember their dreams
In those dreams that no one knows of
My destiny says that I'm destined to run

Enchanted Ooo you thought you saw something in my eyes
Enchanted it's a shame that you wanted me
You didn't try
Enchanted well it's just a voice thru the night
Enchanted well I hope you make it

Enchanted well I hope you make it
Wo wo wo
I hope you make it
