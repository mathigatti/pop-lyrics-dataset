When I first met you baby, I didn't even know your name
Yes, when I first met you babe, I didn't even know your name
I was feeling so low on the ground
Bad luck and evil women was to blame


I never realized just how sweet and kind one woman can be
Yes, I never realized, people, just how sweet and kind one woman can be
Yes, but when I looked in your eyes
Yeah, I knew true love had come to me
Yeah

break:

Take my hand, baby, now, you hold it tight and don't let go
Take my hand, now, hold it tight and don't let go
Yes, 'cause our love is like a merry go round
And 'round forever it's gonna go
