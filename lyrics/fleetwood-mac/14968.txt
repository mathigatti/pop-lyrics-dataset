Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her
She takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover


All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless

All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Would you ever win?
Will you ever win

Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

She rings like a bell through night
And wouldn't you love to love her
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover

All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win
Will you ever win

Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

Taken by, taken by the Sky

Taken by, taken by the sky

Taken by, taken by the sky

Dreams Unwind
Love's a state of mind
