Hold on
Until the ghost appears
That day is gonna last for years
Strange wind, is gonna blow through town
Lightnin' is gonna strike us down
Blue hills, are lookin' good to me
I go there, when I'm fast asleep
Ghost town, and the desert wind
Strange sounds, at the worlds end


And then the winds start to blow
And the fire comes scorching down (yeah)
And then the sky dissapears
In the cloud with an awfull sound (yeah)
And when you can't hold out
Then you run to the underground

Just a blue star
Hanging out in space
Earth town is a lovely place
Strange winds coming from the sky
Lovers gotta say goodbye

And then the winds start to blow
And the fire comes scorching down (yeah)
And then the sky dissapears
In the cloud with an awfull sound (yeah)
And when you can't hold out
Then you run to the underground

Look out before the ghost appears
Look out before the ghost appears
Strange winds
