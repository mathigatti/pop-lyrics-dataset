Do you know
All there is to know about love
And if you do
Then let me know
If I have learned enough
To make it without you


Can I learn
All about love
I don't know enough to make it alone
Well I can leave it just the way it was
I can try
I'm gonna try

And if I fall
If I ever fall in love again
I hope I will feel the same

Can I learn
All about love
I don't know enough to make it alone
Well I can leave it just the way it was
I can try
Do you know a
All about love
Do you know enough to make it alone
Can you just leave it the way it was
Can you try

Can I learn
All about love
I don't know enough to make it alone
Well I can leave it just the way it was
I can try

Do you know a
All about love
Do you know enough to make it alone
Can you just leave it the way it was
Can you try

Well I can leave it just the way it was
Let me try
Well I can leave it just the way it was
Let me try
Well I can leave it just the way it was
