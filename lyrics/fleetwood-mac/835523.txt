He fell for her again, she watched it happen
Every day - day by day
But more important - night by night
She watched it all come into play
He held her hands, she listened to what he had to say


Thrown down, like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together

You've shaken your faith in me, no
You've shaken my faith in everything else
A decision no one makes, and now you're going home
Faith is a hard thing to hold on to
Something inside you says I don't have to
You're not like other people, you do what you want to
You're not like other people, you do what you want to

Thrown down... Like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together

You say you're sorry
Now you should walk away
But it's so overwhelming
You have nothing left to say
You can sit outside his door and wait
Well, you can dedicate your pain to him

Oh, thrown down... Like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together
About just how much he never really told her
Thrown down
About how difficult it had been to be without her
Thrown down
