The bright lights of the city
Are starting to wear me down
And when I need you
You just can't be found


Loud days, endless nights
Are starting to make me crazy
And now you're gone
There's nothing left for me

(Hollywood)
I don't care for sunny weather
(Ain't that good)
I like the change of seasons better
(Knock On Wood)
I love the feel of rain upon my face
(For Hollywood)
(Hollywood)
No and I don't care if the snow comes down
(Ain't that good)
Kick the falling leaves around
(Knock on wood)
Got to move to some other kind of town
(For Hollywood)

Wonderful to know you
Great to know you cared
As I look back
At the crazy things we've shared

I was dazzled by the moonlight
Blinded by neon nights
And as I look back
It never could be right

(Hollywood)
I don't care for sunny weather
(Ain't that good)
I like the change of seasons better
(Knock On Wood)
I love the feel of rain upon my face
(For Hollywood)
(Hollywood)
No and I don't care if the snow comes down
(Ain't that good)
Kick the falling leaves around
(Knock on wood)
Got to move to some other kind of town
(For Hollywood)

Well I was dazzled by the moonlight
Blinded by neon nights
And now I see
It never could be right

(Hollywood)
I don't care for sunny weather
(Ain't that good)
I like the change of seasons better
(Knock On Wood)
I love the feel of rain upon my face
(For Hollywood)
(Hollywood)
No and I don't care if the snow comes down
(Ain't that good)
Kick the falling leaves around
(Knock on wood)
Got to move to some other kind of town
(For Hollywood)

Some other kind of town...
