She came in like a hurricane
Wearing boots and diamond rings
With a fox fur on her shoulder
She set wondering
And I could tell she was feeling abandoned
Because she flashed a look across my way
She said hop for a ride
You'll never ask me but I'll tell you anyway


She took me out on the blackboard jungle
Put me straight in a hurricane
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
If I could sing like Paul McCartney, or get funky like Etta James
I'd never change, I'd never change, I'd never change silver heeled ways

She came in and her flags were flying
She was a sailboat of sweet perfume
And I could see that her eyes were smiling
From across the room
Well I couldn't think of conversation
I was busy looking at her furs
She said Hey, you'll never ask me
So I guess I'll say the word

She took me out on the blackboard jungle
Put me straight in a hurricane
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
If I could sing like Paul McCartney, and funky like Etta James
I'd never change, I'd never change, No I'd never change silver heeled ways

(silver, silver heels) that's what I mean
(silver) whoo talking bout silver (silver heels)
(silver) alright (silver heels)
I'm talkin' bout silver (silver) silver heels (silver)
She took me out on the blackboard jungle
Put me straight in a hurricane
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
If I could sing like Paul McCartney, and funky like Etta James
I'd never change, No I'd never change her, I'd never change silver heeled ways

(silver) Oooh silver heels
(silver) talkin' bout silver heels
(silver) silver heels
(silver) that's what I mean...
