Gonna stay out of New York
There's something there that drives me crazy
Gonna stay out of New York
There's something there that bleeds me dry
It gets so bad that I stop breathin'
And then the sun don't wanna shine


There's something wrong with New York
It's a prison without walls
No I won't go back there
I just don't like that place at all
You might call it sophistication
But I say time is runnin' out

I won't go back to New York
There's a darkness all around
No, I just can't handle it
You know that place is gettin' me down
You can say it's sophistication
But I say time is runnin' out
