You're gonna change your mind
You're not the loving kind
Cause everywhere I go
Seems that you never show
All you do is keep on
To talk and try to all night


I'm gonna change my mind
I'm just the loving kind
Cause everywhere I go
Feels that you never show
All you do is keep on
To talk and try to all night

Gonna change your mind
You're not the loving kind
Cause everywhere I go
Feels that you never show
Only to keep on
To talk and try to all night
All you do is keep on 
To talk and try to all night
