I woke up one morning
Waking with the rising sun
Woke up one morning
Awakin' with the rising sun, ahh
Thought about my baby
Did I just do what she done


Well, I shoulda loved you more
I know I didn't treat her right
Oh, yes, I shoulda loved you more
I know I didn't treat her right
I know that a woman needs 
Rollin' every day and night
Oh, yeah

break:

Well, my heart beat like a hammer
My eyes plumb full of tears
Yes, my heart beat like a hammer
My eyes plumb full of tears
She's been gone about an hour
But it seems like a thousand years

Don't ever dog your woman
You know you're gonna ruin yourself
Don't ever dog your woman
You know you're gonna ruin yourself
Know that a woman she'll
Run off with somebody else
Oh, yeah
