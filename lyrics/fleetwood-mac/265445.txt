Well I try and I try
You can't forget her
Can't run, can't hide
When you remember
Nights that won't fade away
Yea fade away


Well I still go crazy
When you hear her name
Feels like you just left today
And it drives you insane
But you keep holding on
Yea holding on

In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play
In the back of my mind

When I close my eyes
You can still touch her
And I fantasize
She's still your lover
When I wake up I see
The only place you'll be
I know where you'll be

In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play
In the back of my mind

I remember your eyes burning bright
Like we touched the summer sun
I can see your shadow standing there
On the streets where we used to run

Remember

In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play
In the back of my mind

In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
