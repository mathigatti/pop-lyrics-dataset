Baby, baby don't treat me so bad
I'm the best boy that you ever had
You wanna leave now and find a new start
It's gonna kill me if you break my heart 


Ooh, once you let me down again 
Ooh, you're just bound to see the end 

Baby, baby don't treat me this way
I'm gonna make it again someday
There's just one thing I'd like you to know 
I got no more to lose if you go 

Ooh, once you let me down again 
Ooh, you're just bound to see the end
