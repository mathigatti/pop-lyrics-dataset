What makes you think you're the one
Who can laugh without cryin'?
What makes you think you're the one
Who can live without dyin'?
Every little bit
Is there
To see
Every little bit
Of you
And me
What makes you think I'm the one
Who'll be there when you're callin'?
What makes you think I'm the one
Who will catch you when you're fallin'?
Every little bit
Is there
To see
Every little bit
Of you
And me
What makes you think I'm the one
Who will love you forever?
Everything you do has been done
And this won't last forever
Every little bit
Is there
To see
Every little bit
Of you
And me
