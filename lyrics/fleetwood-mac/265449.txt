You've got a sweet, sweet way
You know you'll always be the only one
And if you'll let me say
You'll never be a lonely one
Well you've just got something
Makes a girl start feeling crazy
And I'll do anything if you'll let me be your baby


Even when everybody tells me
I'm just being a fool
Something inside says I've got to have you
And I can't play by the rules

Ooh baby baby tell me there's a chance for me
'Cos I'm crazy about you and I know this is love for me
Well you just got something
Makes a girl start feeling crazy
And I'll do anything if you'll let me be your baby
