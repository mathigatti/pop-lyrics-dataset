Countin' on my fingers
Countin' on my toes
Slippin' thru your fingers
Watchin' how it grows
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you what it's really all about
Do you ever wonder
Do you ever hate
Six feet under
Someone who can wait
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you
Oughta tell you what it's really all about
You're never gonna make it baby
Oohh you're never gonna
Make it babe

Countin' on my fingers
Countin' on my toes
Slippin' thru the ringer
Watchin' how it goes
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you what it's really all about
Buy another fixture
Tell another lie
Paint another picture
See who's surprised
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta
Someone oughta tell you what it's reallly all about
You're never gonna make it baby
Oohh you're never gonna make it baby
