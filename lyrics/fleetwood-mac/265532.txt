At the end of the day
The end of the light
She remains of all of her foes
Miranda is dying with all of her might
She never comes
She always goes


She sticks the camera right into her arm
Anything to forget what the trouble's about
It causes her pain
That's part of the charm
She's down for the count
And finally out

Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

She sees her face in another magazine
And the walls all close in 
As the fancy takes flight
Can't stand to be loved
But she loves to be seen
She slips headlong into the night

Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

And then all at once 
The sun starts to rise
She sees her father holding her down
All the daylight is poison to her eyes
She slips down the shade
And lets herself drown

Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

The lights shot down in the arena
All across the safety zone
Loneliness follows Miranda
And Miranda is always alone
Miranda is always alone
Miranda is always alone
