Money, who needs it
Let me live my life free and easy
Put a toothbrush in my hand
And let me be a travellin' man
Cause I'm a road runner baby


I'm a road runner baby
Can't stay in one place too long
I'm a road runner baby
One look at me and I'll be gone

Well you can love me if you wanna
But I do declare
When I get restless, I've got to move somewhere
Cause I'm a road runner baby
Anywhere is my home

And I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love
A road runner baby

Don't want no woman
To tie me down
Got to be free baby
To roam around

All my life I've been like this
And if you love me it's your own risk
Cause when the dust hits my shoes
I've got the urge to move
Yes I'm a road runner baby
Got to keep movin' on

Hey, and I live the life I love
And I love the life I live
I'm a road runner baby

Road, road runner...
Road, road runner...
Road, road runner...

Don't want no woman
To tie me down
Got to be free baby
To roam around

All my life I've been like this
And if you love me it's your own risk
Cause when the dust hits my shoes
I've got the urge to move
Yes I'm a road runner baby
Got to keep movin' on

Hey, and I live the life I love
And I love the life I live
I'm a road runner baby

Road, road runner...
Road, road runner...
Road, road runner...
Road, road runner...
Road, road runner...
Road, road runner...
Road, road runner...
