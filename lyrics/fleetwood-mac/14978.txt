Monday morning you show look fine
Friday I got travelin on my mind
First you love me, then you fade away
I can't go on believin' this way
I got nothing but love for you
So tell me what you really wanna do
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I dont mind
I dont mind
Ill be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind


Monday morning you show look fine
Friday I got travelin on my mind
First you love me then you say its wrong
You know I cant go on believing for long
But you know its true
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I dont mind
I dont mind
Ill be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind
