Think of me, sweet darlin'
When everything is going bad
Think of me, sweet darlin'
Every time you're feeling sad
Think of me, sweet darlin'
Every time you don't come
Can you feel the fever?


Think of me, sweet darlin'
Every time things get rough
Think of me, sweet darlin'
When the best just isn't enough
Think of me, sweet darlin'
Every time you don't come
Can you feel the fever?

Cause nobody else is doing it oh
Nobody else is doing it oh no
Thought our harmony was the new harmony
Lord, it was a little too strange
And the band played on

Said I was going to put God away
She's been here a while
Living in the guest room
I guess she goes in style
I said I was going to put God away
But I just can't make her go
Can you feel the fever?

Now I lay me down to sleep
In this enemy bed
Tomorrow morning I will wake up
Hurtin' from the things we said
One thing leads to another
But I guess you know about that
Can you feel the fever?

Cause nobody else is doing it, oh
Nobody else is doing it, oh, no
Thought our harmony was the new harmony
Lord, it was a little too strange
And the band played on

Think of me, sweet darlin'
Every time you don't come
