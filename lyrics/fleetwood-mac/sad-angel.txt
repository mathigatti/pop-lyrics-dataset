My eyes were consumed
By the silence in the room
Your dreams would not wake
From the words that we break


Hello, hello, sad angel
Have you come to fight the war
The drums, a fire, a calling
My soul marches out the door
We fall to earth together
The crowd calling out for more
Hello, hello, sad angel
Have you come to fight the war

My eyes saw the words
With a prayer and a curse
Your pain had to sleep
With a sword that it keeps

Hello, hello, sad angel
Have you come to fight the war
The drums, a fire, a calling
My soul marches out the door
We fall to earth together
The crowd calling out for more
Hello, hello, sad angel
Have you come to fight the war

Hello, hello, sad angel
Have you come to fight the war
The drums, a fire, a calling
My soul marches out the door
We fall to earth together
The crowd calling out for more
Hello hello, sad angel
Have you come to fight the war
Come to fight the war
Come to fight the war

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
