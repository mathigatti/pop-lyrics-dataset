Go on, you know you're only one
Set me free
You take me up and turn around
But let me in
Take this shadow from my eyes
And tell me everything
Take the desert from my soul
And lift me up from down below
Let me take some pride in your creation


Cause I have lived alone in castles that were lonely
And I have cursed the dawn and wondered why I do
Well I have wondered why I live
Now I know you must forgive
Let me stand inside your magic shadow

The night is coming faster
And you're feeling all unchained
In the north there is a jungle
Where rockets are aflame
And I hope that in the desert
There are ships and there is noise
And above the greatest city
There will shine a magic shadow
And a voice

It's taking long but I'm getting strong as I grow old
Please believe me let the magic reach me and I will unfold
I'll step aboard with you onday
And see my dust just melt away
And then I'll step inside your magic shadow
dreamers...

ooooh...ooooooh...ooooooohhhhhhh
magic shadows

ooooh...ooooooh...ooooooohhhhhhhh

Have you seen, have you seen
Have you seen, have you seen
Have you seen, have you seen
Have you seen, have you seen magic shadows
Have you seen, have you seen magic shadows
Have you seen, have you seen magic shadows
Have you seen, have you seen magic shadows...
ooooh...ooooooh...ooooooohhhhhhhh
ooooh...ooooooh...ooooooohhhhhhhh
ooooh...ooooooh...ooooooohhhhhhhh
ooooh...ooooooh...ooooooohhhhhhhh
ooooh...ooooooh...ooooooohhhhhhhh
ooooh...ooooooh...ooooooohhhhhhhh...
