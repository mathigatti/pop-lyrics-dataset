She was a silver girl
Lost in a high tech world
She was a golden girl
Immersed in a hard core world
She would have preferred
The last generation
But that's all right
She's on her way


She had the Midas touch
She was Lady Luck
She's got a million bucks
And she looks like it
She's had a few hard times
Sometimes it blows her mind
Those papers she never signed
Sometimes she remembers...

Sometimes she was just an actress
But you'll never really know
A shadow moves across her face
You cannot see her soul
Unless she lets you...
See her soul

She was a girlie girl
Caught in a man's world
And as her world turns
She feels so alone
Still she's a danger girl
Insane far beyond her years
On some things she's very clear
She's a wild adventurer

Sometimes she was just an actress
But you'll never really know
A shadow moves across her face
You cannot see her soul

Sometimes she was just an actress
But you'll never really know
A shadow moves across her face
You cannot see her soul

You cannot see her soul
You cannot see her soul
You cannot see her soul unless she lets you
See her soul...
See her soul, if she lets you
See her soul

Sometimes... she's an actress
You'll never really know
Shadows move across her face
You cannot see her soul
You cannot see her soul
