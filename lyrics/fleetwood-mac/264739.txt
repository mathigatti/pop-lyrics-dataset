One set of doors was the color of honey
One set of doors was pink and grey
Well I wonder which set is mine, said she
As she walked down the long hallway


Well I wonder which set of rooms are mine
For in these rooms she would live and die

Well it's better to have loved and lost
(Ah but it's better not to lose)
Then to never have loved at all
(Never have loved, never have loved at all)
Well it's better to have loved and lost
(Ah but it's better not to lose)
Then to always be alone
(Always be alone)
In your heart

I thought that there was more involved
Through all that time and all these months
I stopped many times to question you
Well I told you that it was the right thing to do

Well it's better to have loved and lost
(Ah but it's better not to lose)
Then to never have loved at all
(Never have loved, never have loved at all)
Well it's better to have loved and lost
(Ah but it's better not to lose)
Then to always be alone
(Always be alone)
In your heart

But I knew that this was just for now
And the time would take its toll upon us all
Well it would break our hearts
Tear it apart
But no one understood
The affairs of the heart

Well it's better to have loved and lost
Then to never have loved at all
(Never have loved, never have loved at all)
Well it'll break your heart
Tear it apart
But no one understands
(No one understands)
The affairs of the heart
