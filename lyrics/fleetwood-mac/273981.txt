Until she herself
Became the deadliest poison
As she grew older
Ohh until she herself
Became just as fatal
As was her garden


And so you run towards
What you know is wrong
There are too many flowers to cut down
For the love I have for your life
For the love I have for your life
Turn around

Never did I mean to
Imprison you
Here in my garden
Like I am in prison
For the love I have for your life
For the love I have for your life
Turn around

Until she herself
Understood her garden
Leaving her heart broken
No future at all
Until she herself
Became the toxic garden
Always frightened
No future at all

And so you run towards
What you know is wrong
There are too many flowers to cut down
For the love I have for your life
For the love I have for your life
Turn around

Never did I mean to
Imprison you
Here in my garden
Like I am in prison
For the love I have for your life
For the love I have for your life
Turn around

So you run towards
What you know is wrong
But there are too many flowers to cut down
For the love I have for your life
For the love I have for your life
Turn around

Running through the garden
	(Running through the garden)
I'm running in brilliant colors
	(Brilliant colors)
I'm running straight towards
Straight towards
What you know is really wrong
	(really wrong)
Too many flowers
	(too many flowers)
Here to cut down
For the love I have for your life
Turn around
