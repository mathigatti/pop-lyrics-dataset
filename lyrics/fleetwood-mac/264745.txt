Bare trees, grey light
Oh yeah it was a cold night
Bare trees, grey light


I was alone in the cold of a winters day
You were alone and so snug in your bed
I was alone in the cold of a winters day
You were alone and so snug in your bed

Bah do dah, do dah da do da do
Bah do dah, do dah da do da do
Bah do dah, do dah da do da do
Bah do dah, do dah da do da do

Bare trees, grey light
Oh yeah it was a cold night
Bare trees, grey light

I was alone in the cold of a winters day
You were alone and so snug in your bed
I was alone in the cold of a winters day
You were alone and so snug in your bed

Bah do dah, do dah da do da do
Bah do dah, do dah da do da do
Bah do dah, do dah da do da do
Bah do dah, do dah da do da do
