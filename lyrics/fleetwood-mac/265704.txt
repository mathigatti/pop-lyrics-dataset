Oh baby, I'll buy you a diamond ring
Oh baby, I'll buy you a diamond ring
If you let me darling
I'll give you almost anything


Well it's early in the morning
And my baby can't be found
Well it's early in the morning
And my baby can't be found
I looking working for my baby
But she ain't nowhere around

Oh baby, I need your love tonight
Oh baby, you know I need your love tonight
I want to make love to you darling
While the moon is shining bright

Well it's high up in the morning
And I'm looking for my babe
Yes I been up in the morning
And i'm looking for my babe
If she don't come back to me
I'll put her six feet in her grave

I said baby, I need your love tonight
oh baby, I need your love tonight
I want to make love to you baby
While the moon is shining bright
