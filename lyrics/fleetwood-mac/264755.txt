Well I'm a born enchanter
That's what the ladies see
Yes I'm a born enchanter
Down in the city of dreams
Lord do right by me and let me go
Down in my city of dreams where I need to go


Well I'm a born enchanter, well...

Well I'm a born enchanter
Followin' the sabbath cross
Oh I'm a born enchanter
Looking for the faith I lost
Lord do right by me and let me go
Down in my city of dreams, where I need to go

Yeah...
Cause I'm a born enchanter
