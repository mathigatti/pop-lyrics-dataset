Make me a mask
That I can wear
'Till day is done


The wind in the trees
The falling leaves
The world's spinning

Make me a mask
So I can laugh
'Till night time comes

No more can I stay
How long must I play
This game of winning

If I had known this was only a dream
I would have awakened from this sleep

Make me a mask
So I can last
'Till the right time comes

A tear in my eye
To light I fly
An end is beginning
