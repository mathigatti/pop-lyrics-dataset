Isn't just that we cause each other such pain 
Everywhere we go now, at home or at play 
It hurts my self esteem, it hurts my everything 
I am reeling... oh, it hurts my feelings 
Sometimes it was heavenly (Sometimes it was heavenly) 
Sometimes it was too heavy (Sometimes it was too heavy)
Sometimes it's just too much for me (Sometimes it's just too much for me) 
Well I want to run away (Oh, well I want to run away) 


Then there are the things, cast this doubt away 
Those things that made me stay for so long 
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now 
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now 
I didn't understand then, but I understand now 

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times 
And they both rushed by, like a thief in the night 
Taking no prisoners, just like the first time 
Adventures in paradise 
Just like the first time 

Then there are the things, cast this doubt away 
Those things that made me stay for so long 
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now 
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now 
I didn't understand then, but I understand now 

Then there are the things, cast this doubt away 
Those things that made me stay for so long 
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now 
It's not make believe then, I'm not make believe now 
I didn't understand then, but I understand now
