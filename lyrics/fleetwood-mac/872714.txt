Was it in my mind
Or was it true
That woman used to Hollywood living
Do you remember how
The angels sang
And your sorrows left you there
Right before the lights came up
Do you remember
You took my hand
Do you remember, my friend
Did you feel like it was
The second time with you,
That feeling of a vivid memory
Well it had to do
With a dream come true
And someone that you loved
And would always love
The second time around
For us
She never looked back
Someone that you loved
And would always love
The second time around, for us
She never looked back
She could never look back
