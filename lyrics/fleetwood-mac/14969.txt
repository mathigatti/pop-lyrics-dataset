Wait a minute baby
Stay with me a while
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me about the fire


Drownin', in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone, it doesn't matter what for
When you build your house, then you call me home

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh )
And it was just like a great dark wind
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singin'
And undoing
And undoing
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
The laces
Undoing the laces

Said: Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, never stop
But now it's gone, it doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house, then call me home

Hold on, the night is comin'
And the starling flew for days
I'd stay home at night all the time
I go anywhere, anywhere, anyway

Ask me and I'm there, yeah
Ask me and I'm there, 'cause I care
In the sea of love, where every woman would love to drown
But now it's gone, they say it doesn't matter anymore
If you build your house, then please call me home

Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, and don't you ever stop
But now it's gone, no, it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house, I'll come by

(Ah, Sara, ah)
(Ah, Sara, ah)
(Ah, Sara, ah)

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, Sara, baby
There was a heartbeat and it never really died
Yes it never really died
Oh will you swallow your pride?
All I ever wanted was to know that you were dreaming)
