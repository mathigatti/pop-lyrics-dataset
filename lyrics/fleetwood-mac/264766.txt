Heroes Are Hard To Find


I'm dancing, to the music
Of a simple melody
And I wonder are you thinking
Of a single memory
And I know when I see them swaying
I can hear myself say

Come a little bit closer
(come a little bit closer)
Cause I remember the time
When you held me in your arms
(come a little bit closer)
And you wanted to be mine
Everything good, everything gold
And now all that's left is a sweet memory

If you love me, let me know
Why don't you show me which way to go
Please don't leave me all alone
Cause I can't make it on my own
And I know when I see them swaying
I can hear myself say

Come a little bit closer 
(come a little bit closer)
Cause I remember the time
When you held me in your arms
(come a little bit closer)
And you wanted to be mine
I might but wrong but that's where I belong
Why are you just a sweet memory

Come a little bit closer 
(come a little bit closer)
Cause I remember the time
When you held me in your arms
(come a little bit closer)
And you wanted to be mine
Everything good, everything gold
Why are you just a sweet memory

(Come a little bit closer)
(Come a little bit closer)
(Come a little closer)
(Come a little closer)
