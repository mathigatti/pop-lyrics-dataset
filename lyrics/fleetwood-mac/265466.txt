Oh there's a stranger
Standing in the shadows of love
Oh the danger
Demands what you're needing of


Be careful what you love
Be careful what you need
Be careful what you say
Be careful who you please, careful who you please

Love love love
Love is dangerous
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Love is dangerous

Oh there's no warning
That takes you to the promised land
Hearts made of crystal
Crumble like castles of sand

Echoes of emothion
And the visions of a fool
Echoes of forbidden ground
And it's too good to be true, too good to be true

Love love love
Love is dangerous
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Love is dangerous

Standing at the crossroads
Ooh yeah this is wild
Maybe it's my crossraods
Maybe this is mine
Maybe this is mine, oooh

Love love love
Love is dangerous
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Love is dangerous
Don't be a fool

Love love love
Love is dangerous
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Love is dangerous
