You could be my silver springs
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining on an ocean crashing


And did you say she was pretty
And did you say that she loves you
Baby I don't want to know

I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me no

And did you say she was pretty
And did you say that she loves you
Baby I don't want to know

Oh no

And can you tell me was it worth it
Really, I don't want to know

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

I'll follow you down 'till the sound 
Of my voice will haunt you

You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loves you


I'll follow you down 'till the sound 
Of my voice will haunt you
(was i just a fool)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loves you
(Was I just a fool)
I'll follow you down till the sound of my voice will haunt you 
(give me just a chance)
you'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you
(never get away never get away never get away)
You could be my silver springs my blue green colors flashing
