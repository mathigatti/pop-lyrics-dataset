I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you


People think I'm crazy
But they don't know
Thought love had failed me
But now, they're watching it grow

Angel, please don't go
I miss you when you're gone
They say I'm a silly girl
But I'm not a fool

People say they know me
But they don't see
My heart's your future,
Your future is me

Angel, please don't go
I miss you when you're gone
They say I'm a silly girl
But I'm not a fool

I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you

I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you
