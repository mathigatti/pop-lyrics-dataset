Better love me baby
Love me all the time
Better love me baby
Let me know your mine
Don't care what you say
You're gonna like it this way


Give me all your love now
Because I know you need
Give me all your love now
Because I know you need
A little bit of that holdin'
A little bit of that squeeze

You better love me baby
Love me all the time
Better love me baby
Let me know your mine
Don't care what you say
You're gonna like it this way
