Sometimes I get to thinking
About the times we used to have
But now you've gone away and left me-so alone


(La di da, la di da da, la di da)

Although my back is aching
I'll work the whole day through
Although you hear that I've been wasting
All my time

Taking the sun from the sky
Lifting our hearts to the day
Thinking of new revelations
Talking with nothing to say

Sometimes I get to thinking
About the times we used to have
But now you've gone away and left me-so alone

(La di da, la di da da, la di da)

Although my back is aching
I'll work the whole day through
Although you hear that I've been wasting
All my time

Taking the sun from the sky
Lifting our hearts to the day
Thinking of new revelations
Talking with nothing to say
