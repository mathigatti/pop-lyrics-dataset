If I could turn the page
The time that I'd be arranged
Is today to
(Close my, close my, close my eyes)
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
(Tell me, tell me, tell me lies)


(Chorus)
Tell Me Lies, tell me sweet little lies
(Tell Me Lies, Tell me tell me lies)
Oh no no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no you can't disguise)
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies

And though I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
(Close your, close your eyes)
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
(Tell me, tell me lies)

(Repeat Chorus)

If I could turn the page
The time that I'd be arranged
Is today to
(Close my, close my, close my eyes)
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
(Tell me, tell me, tell me lies)

(Repeat Chorus)
