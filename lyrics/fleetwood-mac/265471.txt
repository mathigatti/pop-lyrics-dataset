You've got a sweet heart
Never will you be replaced
And it's so hard
The memory can't be erased


Love shines when I think of you
You make it happen 
You make it true
(love shines)
Love shines there can be no doubt
What this feeling is all about

Oh baby your
Love shines, love shines so bright
(so bright)
Did you know your
Love shines, love shines so bright
(on and on and on)
On and on it will always be
Rhythm, rhyme, and harmony
Yeah, baby your
Love shines, love shines tonight
(tonight)

You cast a spell
A magical revelation
And I see so well
My ultimate destination

Love shines when I think of you
You make it happen 
You make it true
(love shines)
Love shines there can be no doubt
What this feeling is all about

Oh baby your
Love shines, love shines so bright
(so bright)
Did you know your
Love shines, love shines so bright
(on and on and on)
On and on it will always be
Rhythm, rhyme, and harmony
Yes, baby your
Love shines, love shines tonight
(tonight)

After all the reckoning
After all the promises
All the darkness in my heart
Has gone away
Gone away


(on and on and on)
So on and on it will always be
Rhythm, rhyme, and harmony
Yes, baby your
Love shines, love shines tonight
Oh don't you know your
Love shines, love shines so bright
Oh baby your
Love shines, love shines so bright
