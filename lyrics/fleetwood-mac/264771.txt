Ohh you're a dream
Hide your head in the sand
You're far away, when I want you around
And you leave me lonely when I'm feeling down


Do your ever wonder, or worry about me
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me
Do your ever wonder, or worry about me
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me

Why is it baby, our love just won't grow
You made me happy but time has gone by
Please leave me softly, I won't say goodbye
So all I wanted slips through my hands
You're far away when I want you around
And you leave me lonely when I'm feeling down

Do your ever wonder, or worry about me
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me
Do your ever wonder, or worry about me
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me
