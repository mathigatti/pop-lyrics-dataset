Where are you darlin', when my
Moon is risin', and your
Sun is shinin' down


What are you doin', are you
Missin' me
The way that I'm missin' you now

CHORUS:
The river goes on and on, and the
Sea that divides us is a
Temporary one, and the
Bridge will bring us back together

What are you doin', goin'
Down in to Soho as I
Get my rest tonight

What are you doin', are you
Busy with your world
Well I wish you were busy with mine

(repeat chorus four times)
