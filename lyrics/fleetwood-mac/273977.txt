All you have to do
Is look at me that way
You don't have to say
What's going on in your heart
And deep in the night
When I think you won't drive me crazy
I'm just hoping that maybe
You're feeling the same way to


I want you and I need you
I don't know what else to say
(Don't you) don't you think it's time (don't you) don't you think it's time (don't you)
Don't you think it's time that you remember me

So I'm begging you
Not to leave me up in the air
It just wouldn't be fair
Cause you know the way
I feel about you
It may not be love
Or an everlasting feeling
But you sending me reeling
With the very mention of your name

I want you and I need you
I don't know what else to say
(Don't you) don't you think it's time (don't you) don't you think it's time (don't you)
Don't you think it's time that you remember me

Remember me
