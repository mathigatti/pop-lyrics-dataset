Ow ow ow ow ow
This is the story of a man
He had a problem with gambling
He liked AA, he was a real big fan
But that didn't help and he just kept rambling
ow ow ow ow ow
He visited this casino in Las Vegas
He was hoping to gamble less
But it just didn't work, he couldn't hack it
He was just too addicted to Black Jack
ow ow-ow ow ow ow
He is the black jack man
He has the black jack blues
He's the number one fan
ow ow ow whoo hoo
He didn't know what to do
His wife had already left him, that beautiful Maggie Sue
He had nothing left to live for
Those black jack blues were killing him more and more
ow ow-ow ow ow ow
He is the black jack man
He has the black jack blues
He's the number one fan
ow ow ow whoo hoo
whoa oh oh whoo hoo
