Tonight there's thunder in the sky
Just like the night you said good-bye
And what's left of a heartache
Runs like rain from my eyes


The winds of change
Gonna blow it all away
Ain't it strange
How you won't matter
The winds of change
Gonna blow it all away

I stood like a rock against the storm
And you never knew, did you, how I was torn
And if your memory finally leaves me too
Well I won't sit and mourn

The winds of change
Gonna blow it all away
Ain't it strange
How you won't matter
The winds of change
Gonna blow it all away

I shoulda known better than to love you
I shoulda known that you were the hurting kind
Now I'm so tired of thinking of you
I just wanna forget that you were ever mine

Tonight there's shadows on my face
Every one tells a story of your disgrace
But soon the dawn will come
And I'll be gone without a trace

The winds of change
Gonna blow it all away
Ain't it strange
How you won't matter
The winds of change
Gonna blow it all away

Ain't it strange
How you won't matter...
