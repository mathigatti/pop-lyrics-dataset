I want to sit at home in my rockin' chair
I don't want to travel the world
As far as I'm concerned I've had my share
But times more precious than gold
I don't wanna see another airplane seat
Or another hotel room
The home life to me seems really neat
I just wanna unpack for good


Buy me a ticket homeward bound (homeward bound)
Buy me a ticket homeward bound (oh homeward bound

Well it all seems the same when you've done it before
There's no difference in the style
There's no end insight or my own front door
I'll be a stay at home for awhile
So I'll have another drink and a cigarette
Just to console myself some how
It's not too bad if you can forget
I've just got to find a way somehow

Buy me a ticket homeward bound (homeward bound)
Buy me a ticket homeward bound (oh homeward bound

Buy me a ticket homeward bound (homeward bound)
