All alone we go on day after day
All alone we suffer
Oh, to steal your heart away


It's the same old thing in the same old way
All alone we suffer
Oh, to steal your heart away

And the lie was creeping
Down, down, down
While we were sleeping
Suddenly we hit the ground

So come on, let's go, let's run away
If that's all, all there is
Oh, to steal your heart away

Ooh... steal your heart away
Ooh... steal your heart away

The lie was creeping
Down, down, down
While we were sleeping
Suddenly we hit the ground

So come on, let's go, let's run away
If that's all there is
Oh, to steal your heart away
Oh, to steal your heart away

Suffer...
The lonely suffer
Steal your heart away
Suffer....
The lonely suffer
All to steal your heart away
Suffer...
Steal your heart away
The lonely suffer
To steal your heart away
Suffer...
If that's all there is....
The lonely suffer
Steal your heart away
