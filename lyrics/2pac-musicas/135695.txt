Ay Trusty Trusty, what you want man? 
Aww nigga let me get one of them ciggarettes, damn! 


Shit, come on bastard, get the phone for a nigga 
Use the phone, aww nigga get the phone for me man 
What's the number? 323-6545, tell her it's Pac 
Chorus: repeat 2X 
When I get free, 

motherfuckers better watch they ass 
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash 
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street 
There'll be trouble when they see me 

I heard a snicker a laugh, I take a look at the evening news 
And see a nigga gettin cuffed by the boys in blue 
Is it a, frame up, tryin to keep me out the game, stuck 
These motherfuckers tryin to dirty up my name, but 
I slip as quick as the wind, it's me again, fuck friends 

My foes be on a mission, tryin to do me in 
Fuck em I'm out to get out, they all thought 
I blow up like gauge, and in a rage blow they balls off 
Why are you niggaz tryin to test me trick? 
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch 
Maintain with a nigga meal ticket only if you with the real 

The nigga will kick it, I'll enforce it with the steel 
These are lessons that I learned in jail 
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell 
Now I'm workin with connects that I got in the pen 
In no time I'll be clockin again 

Chorus 

Heyyy, still sittin in my cell as I dwell on my past 
Tryin to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash 
Quick call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side 

My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died 
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin maybe 
me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze 
Cause she keep on callin me baby, to a young 
motherfucker facin eighty that's enough to make me 
crazy 

Now how long will it take, to get a hook 
Got her watchin me liftin weights, sneakin looks 
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives 
but man, ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man 
If we make it then I'm takin it to Hell 

all them niggaz that was frontin while I sat up in a cell 
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned, in misery 
The nigga you don't wanna see 

Chorus 3X 

When I get free, believe that shit 
Yeah nigga fuck your cigarette, fuck that phone call motherfucker 
I'll be out this motherfucker in a few days 

I'll pay these bitches back in spades 
Punk ass bastards, long as my AK flexes 
we gonna play these bitches 
That's how we do this shit 
Fuck that I'm out, C.O. turn the fuckin lights out!
