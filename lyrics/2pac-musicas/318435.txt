Straight out the motherf**king bay
Here we go


[2Pac]
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherf**ker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another ni**a waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock 'til his a*s get shot
Like a motherf**king thug disease
Craving beats like they motherf**king drugs to me, hey
What's up with bi**hes trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my glock I'm a plotting a*s rotten motherf**ker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life ni**a when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherf**king breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it

[Chorus]
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
[ X4 ]

[Big Syke]
I'm going crazy, ni**as can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya f**king grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling whooped tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So f**k a bi**h f**k a hoe and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a f**k
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the ni**as is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy s**t don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six ni**as carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, ni**a, I'm losing it

[Chorus]

[Spice 1]
s**t was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherf**ker he's a lier
I talked to me 3-80 like a bi**h on a stroll
When my ni**as try to ????
ni**a, I can't get f**ked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some ni**as a*s
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millometer
He's one of my best friends bi**h a*s ni**a eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bi**h she like to get it funked
And spitting motherf**kers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherf**ker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the f**k up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
s**t was talking to me

[Chorus] to fade
