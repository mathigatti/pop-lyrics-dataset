Shit, you motha fuckin right.
I'm the bitch that's keepin it live
and keepin it hype
when you punk ass niggas don't
Nigga, west side. What!!
Bring it on.


Look for me.  Lost in the whirlwind 96.
Bonnie and Clyde.
Me and my girlfriend doin' 85 when we ride,
Trapped in this world of sin.
Born as a ghetto child.
Raised in this whirlwind.
Our childhood years recall the tears.
Heart laced with venom.
Smokin Shern, drinkin malt liquor.
Father forgive her.
Me and my girlfriend
must have fell in love with the struggle.
Hands on the steering wheel.
Bust! Watch me bail out and bust em.
Fuck em all. Watch em fall. Screamin.
Automatic gunfire exorcisin all demons.
My posse off on the side.
My complication high,
ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back.
Niggas united.
Our first date.
Can't wait to see you naked.
Touch you in every secret place.
I can hardly wait to bust freely.
Got you red hot.
You so happy to see me.
Made the frontpage, primetime live on TV.
Nigga, my girlfriend
may be 45 but she still live.
One shot makin niggas heart beats stop.

What!!
I'm bustin on you punk ass niggas.
Run, nigga, run. I'm on your ass nigga.
Run, nigga, duck and hide.
I'm bustin on all you bitches.
Run, nigga, yeah.
West side, bitch.
Die,bitch, die.

My girlfriend blacker than the darkest night.
When niggas act bitch bang,
she got the heart to fight.
Nigga, my girlfriend.
Though we separated at times,
I know deep inside baby girl'll always be mine.
Picked you up when you was nine.
Started out my life of crime wit you.
Bought you some shells when you turned 22.
It's true.
Nothing compares to the satisfaction
that I feel when we out mashin.
Me and my girlfriend.

Chorus:
All I need in this life of sin,
Is me and my girlfriend.
Down to ride to the bloody end.
Just me and my girlfriend.

I was too immature to understand your ways.
Inexperienced back in the days.
Caused so many arguments and strays.
Now I realize how to treat cha.
The secret to keep ya.
Bein faitful cuz now cheating's lethal.
We closer than the hands of time.
Deeper than the drive of mankind.I trust you dearly,
I shoot blind.
In time I clock figures.
Droppin niggas as we rise.
We all souljas and God eyes.
Now it's time for war.
Never leave me baby.
I'm paranoid.
Sleepin with you loaded by my bedside, crazy.
Jealous when you hang wit the fellas.
I wait patiently alone
anticipatin' for the moment you come home.
I'm waitin by the phone.
This is true love, I can feel it.
I've had a lot of women in my bed
But you the realest.
If you ever need me, call.
I'll be there.
Through it all.
You're the reason I can stand tall.
Me and my girlfriend.

Chorus

I love finger fuckin you.
All of a sudden I hearin thunder
when you bust a nut.
Niggas be duckin.
Or takin numbers.
Love to watch you at a block party
beggin for drama.
While unleashin on the old timas.
That's on my mama.
I would trade my life for yours.
Behind closed door,
the only girl that I adore.
Everything I'm askin for.
Talkin to me,
beggin me to just take you around.
17, like Brandy, you just wanna be down.
Talkin loud.
When I tell you be quiet, you move a crowd.
Bustin rounds, activatin a riot.
That's why I love you.
So no control, down to roll.
Unleash. After I hit, you break apart.
Then back to one piece.
Much love to my one and only girlfriend.
The world is ours.
Just hold me down.
Baby, witness the power.
Never leave a nigga alone.
I love you, black or chrome.

Turn this house into a happy home.
Me and my girlfriend.

Chorus

Lost in the whirlwind 96. Bonnie and Clyde.
Me and my girlfriend doin 85 when we ride,
Trapped in this world of sin.
Born as a ghetto child.
Raised in this whirlwind.
Look for me.
