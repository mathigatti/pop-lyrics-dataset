westside, how you do it 
I went from nothing to something 
now they all see me fall 
and the playahaters hate to see a thug hit the ballers 

they say we hate the eastcoast 
but thats funny 
got a lot of love for any niggas getting money 
I made a song about my enemies and niggas trip 
it was hip-hop until 2pac fucked Biggie's bitch 

you'll niggas need to get your bitch made 
either love me or hate me 
but real thug niggas get paid 
have me catching cases all across the nation 
I went to jail to bail to barely on probation 
and got a playa facing three 

strikes and we right 
just balst God bless the child that can get cash 
but all these niggas turning and never learning 
got a long line of niggas playa hating me 
but getting bird

but you trick and trash 
like the mac making a fall back 
and stick your ass for back staping 
Never thought it would come 
use to have love for me 

now they turning on me 
why me. why you'll niggas tripping 
use to have love for me

gave you the keys to the jeep 
or my home is a open door
