Ahhh shit hahaha


When i enter the first zone
Worst known mic holder
My hummer roll up
Evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy
Manifestin' military styles
Casually try da g
When niggas battle me
My prophesied prediction
Switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch
And watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin' still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin'
Hell or prison
My ammunition varies
My voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world
Me and the mob gettin' married
It seems all the fine screams pierce the dark
This is expected
A trick bitch where is your heart
You mark
Watch niggas fall when i call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til its none left
Don't sleep

[chorus (2x)]
We gon' ride
Keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when i ride (when i ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine
Always hustlin' on the grind
Cause i gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep

[nutso]
Dumpin' on motherfuckers at random
Rapidly
Wit' accuracy
They shouldn't talk bad to me
It had to be
A motherfuckin' murder
I'm glad to be
A nigga that did the murder
So sad to see
Another motherfucker floatin'
In plastic reef
Sleep wit' his head wide open (head smokin')
Rapid release
Keep the police coastin'
Casualties
Warrant in deep east oakland (doors wide open)
Yolk the nigga off the asphalt
Drove off to the hills
Positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the lex ruger
Death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullets fly
Kill and execute 'em

[yaki kadafi]
I blast first 'til they body me
Like my guns in variety
Runnin' wit' the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front
Doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hand on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Addicted to my nine
Movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples
Nigga nothin' simple 'bout mine
Etch-a-sketchin'
Dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out
Ain't no easy way outs or easy exits
Don't sleep

[chorus (2x)]

[lil' scrappy]
G's up
A-town

When i hit the street
All i can see is the grind
Blood sweat and tears when i bust my rhyme
Yeah i un- for my folk like i load my nine
And when i let loose
Then no crew standin' but mine
I gives a damn 'bout lame nigga actin' schiesty
Same one knew i was in jail and didn't write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
What eva you do shawty you betta think wisely
You might see me wit' a stack in the trap (aye)
I use my thoughts and pen
Similar to a saran wrap
A lil' lame nigga i'll neva be
Yeah i'ma keep it g
I'm from the three and scrap will neva sleep
Aye

[chorus (2x)]

Don't sleep

Don't sleep
