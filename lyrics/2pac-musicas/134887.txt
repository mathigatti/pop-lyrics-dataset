Major! Hell motherfuckin yeah 
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Coolin, hell yeah 
Mama raised a hellrazor... born thuggin 
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen 
On the scene watchin fiends buggin 
Kickin up dust with the older G's 
Soakin up the game that was told to me 
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot, I learned 
not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes, was taught lessons 
A young nigga askin questions while other suckers was guessin 
I was ganked for sexin 
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it 
I'm headed for the penitentiary, I'm cuttin class 
and I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin 
Mobbin through the overpass laughin 
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt 
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord 
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger in the trigger 
Cause some nigga tried to kill me 
and mama raised a hellraizor, everyday gettin paid 
Police on my pager, straight stressin 
A fugitive my occupation is under question 
Wanted for investigation, and even though 
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark til I lose my breath 
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper 
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin richer 
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap 
And they wonder why it's hard bein black 
Dear Lord can ya feel me, gettin major, unhh 
Chorus: Stretch 
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major 
Lord be my savior, unnh 
(Repeat 4X) 
Mama raised a hellrazor 
[2Pac] Dear Lord can ya feel me 
Stress gettin major, unnh 
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major 
Tell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign 
Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin 
Mama raised a hellrazor, can't figure 
Why you let the police beat down niggaz 
I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe 
While the po' babies restin in the early graves 
God come save the youth 
Ain't nothin else to do but have faith in you 
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand 
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand 
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic 
crooked cop killin Glock, tell me Lord 
Can ya feel me? Show a way 
I'm prayin but my enemies won't go away 
And everywhere I turn I see niggaz burn 
Every nigga that I know's on death row 
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price 
Little young motherfucker doin triple life 
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin better 
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof 
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama 
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin blunts 
Gettin drunk off that Tanqueray gin 
Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin pen 
Mama raised a hellrazor, uhh, yeah 
C'mon, uhh, mama raised a hellrazor 
Uhh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin major 
(Lord be my savior, unnh) 
Chorus: Stretch 
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major 
Lord be my savior, unhh 
(repeat 2X) 
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major 
Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me 
A young nigga tryin to make it on these rough streets 
I'm on my knees beggin please come and SAVE ME 
THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy! 
I got my three-five-seven can't control it 
Screamin die motherfucker and he's loaded 
Everybody run for cover, I cause shit 
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick 
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me 
Cause do or die gettin high til the bury me 
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why 
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die 
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot 
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped 
And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin 'Tasha 
Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end 
it's my friends, that flip-flop 
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop 
Thug Life motherfucker I lick shots 
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops 
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die 
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high 
with my hands on the trugger, Thug nigga 
Stressin like a motherfuckin drug dealer 
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life 
I got the heart to fight now 
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry 
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die
