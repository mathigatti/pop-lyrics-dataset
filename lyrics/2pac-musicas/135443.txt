Throw them thangs X3 

The quicker the nigga can go on 
The faster the nigga can get his dough on 
Then I can hit my flow and get my ho on 


Them niggas don't know what goes on 
They trying to fuck with all they clothes on 
Then act up when all the hoes gone 

Are you ready for my flow? hit me (Hoooooooo!) X3 
Stop fronting motherfucker let them thangs go 

I'm quick to kill a nigga any nigga feel me nigga 
You can't fade me I'm way to fucking real nigga 
2Pacalypse Now still down with the Underground 

Niggas get clowned when I come around 
Boom boom motherfucker and it don't stop 
Fuck a cop pass the glock and it won't stop 
If ya ready for my flow hit me (Hoooooooo!) X3 

Stop fronting motherfucker let them thangs go 
If ya wondering the thunder and the trouble 

Is coming from the rebel as I hit ya from the lower level 
Hit me once fucking D M and two times 

Popping like two nines hitting 'em with new rhymes 
I can make you love me 
Best to chill with the nigga 'cause ya sure can't punch me 

If ya feel me let me hear ya say (Rock that shit) X3 
'Cause ain't a nigga alive that can stop the hit
