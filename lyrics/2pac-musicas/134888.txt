High 'Til I Die 
Loced 'Til they smoke me 
The Shit don't stop 
Til my casket drop 
I'm High 'Til I Die 
Loced 'Til they smoke me 
The Shit don't stop 
Til my casket drop 
I'm High 'Til I Die 
Loced 'Til they smoke me 
Shit don't stop 
The shit don't stop 
Game rules 
Ain't got time for fools 
Money on my mind 
So my nine rules 
Time to make wieght 
Niggas gettin' crazy paid 
Hate bitches for the games they play 
So nigga 
Pull quick 
But better be quicker 
Than the next mutha fucka 
On the trigger 
Cause I'm static 
Startin' to be a fuckin' habit 
Gotta keep my automatic 
Or get my ass kicked 
When I'm travelin' 
It's kind of puffin' 
I drive a bucket 
Little Thug Life nigga 
Screaming Fuck It 
I love to throw my middle finger to the police 
And no bucks, no justice, no peace 
I'm smoking blunts 'til I pass out 
[coughing] 
Yah nigga getting assed out 
Rollin' and my niggas 
Glass out 
Drving fast 
Talking to bitches 
Whipping cash out 
I'm with my niggas 
So fuck the suckas 
I'm bucking brothas 
Smokin' chronic mutha fuckas 
Causing ruckus 
It's the last of the drank 
Pull over 
Can't hear a damn thang 
Sober 
High 'Til I Die 
Loced 'Til they smoke me 
The Shit don't stop 
Til my casket drop 
I'm High 'Til I Die 
Loced 'Til they smoke me 
The Shit don't stop 
Til my casket drop 
High 'Til I Die 
Loced 'Til they smoke me 
The Shit don't stop 
Til my casket drop 
I'm High 'Til I Die 
Loced 'Til they smoke me 
Shit don't stop 
The shit don't stop 
Lord help me save me 
Mama keep praying for a young mutha fucker 
Trying to duck an early grave 
In the city where you can't tell the fakes 
From the snakes 
Enemies from phonies 
Friends from your homies 
Around the corner theres another nigga waiting to jack 
He don't know I got a glock 
Till his ass get shot 
Like a mutha fuckin' Thug disease 
Claiming Peace 
Like they mutha fuckin' trustin' me 
Hey, what's up with bitches trying to screw me 
Do me cause I did a movie 
Throw the pussy to me 
But before they never knew me 
Rather die then let yah 
Play me for like a Busta 
And with my glock 
I'm a plotin' ass rotten mutha fucka 
Hey don't let that movie fool yah 
Let me school yah 
Screaming Thug Life nigga 
When I do yah 
It's the last of the drank 
Pull over 
Can't hear a damn thang 
Sober 
[Till the end of song] 
High 'Til I Die 
Loced 'Til they smoke me 
The Shit don't stop 
Til my casket drop
