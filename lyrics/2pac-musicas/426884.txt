[Tupac] I don't want to be her man...
I want to be her nigga, you feel me

[Richie Rich] Well let'em know...

(Tupac)
You fuckin wit' niggas thats insecure watered down
my shit is pure
write down my number but don't call me till you sure
I ain't beggin' just tryin' to relocate between ya legs
Drippin' wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me
And know you straight beggin to sex me
got you undressing to test me and uhh...

(Richie Rich)
Shoot me down if ya want
and miss tha chance ta do it live
When I stroll by I see that look in yo eye
You wants a nigga
but think that you can't have a nigga
don't cheat ya'self, instead treat ya'self
if you scared go to church
I know it hurts
to find out me and ya man be sharin' skirts


(Tupac)
I hopin' you don't take this the wrong way
but cha body is bangin' got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of tryin' to make my songs pay
Makin' love all day against the wall in the hallway
Ya fantasies come alive
ya heart rate shall increase when we meet up
In this dark place
Ya might think ya happy with him
but that's a lie...
so give this thug a try

Chorus
I'd ratha be ya N-I-G-G-A
so we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
it don't matta if you lonely baby
you need a thug in ya life
cuz bustas ain't lovin ya right


Chorus
I'd ratha be ya N-I-G-G-A
so we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
it don't matta if you lonely baby
you need a thug in ya life
cuz bustas ain't lovin ya right

(Tupac)
Now you was sprung from tha introduction
My conversations full of game get laced with seductions
I see ya blushin' like ya want somethin'
come get a taste of Amerikaz most wanted
and lets get into some touchin'
my erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
have no intentions of bustin' until ya learn ya lesson
Now many questionz are often asked
A drop top,
500 benz and plenty cash to help a nigga get that ass

(Richie Rich)
You can ride a smoke ho
to get ya lobster and crab
cuz all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
I'm a listen when it hurts
I'm a hang out but never stay
smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to SuperDave
I'll be ya nigga
as long as we can understand
that I's the nigga
smoke coke and be the man
he winein' and dinin'
but me and you we wine and grind
and when I'm on the field keep him on the sidelines

Chorus
It's time ta be ya N-I-G-G-A
so we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
it don't matta if you lonely baby
you need a thug in ya life
cuz bustas ain't lovin ya right

It's time ta be ya N-I-G-G-A
so we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
it don't matta if you lonely baby
you need a thug in ya life
cuz bustas ain't lovin ya right

(Tupac)
Now, it's time
for the moment of truth
i got cha naked
totally sweatin'
let's see how hot I can make it
tongue kissin' till yah head swang
I'm so into you
Witness the nigga that make the bed bang
if its all mine
then let me know
now scream my name out
Do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow
Not to mention
The multiple postions, I'm invent
A boss playa freakymutha fucka get a dick

(Richie Rich)
UHH
It's only popin'
now you see what i was seein'
why yo eyez rollin'
loosin' up girl
I ain't goin' nowhere
Let's let that sucka stay out there
While he stress out and I
I stretch out tha cock
hold tha boots and let tha nigga execute
and though you got it right
I'm going home tonight

(Tupac)
You say you don't need a man but I don't care
you in tha presence of a playa

Chorus
It's time ta be ya N-I-G-G-A
so we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
it don't matta if you lonely baby
you need a thug in ya life
cuz bustas ain't lovin ya right

I'd ratha be ya N-I-G-G-A
so we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
it don't matta if you lonely baby
you need a thug in ya life
cuz bustas ain't lovin ya right
