[Eat a dick up] 
["Stick up, stick up, stick up kids... 
still don't nothin move but the money" -- Rakim] 
Verse One: Live Squad 
Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man 


Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man 
Cops step off, you know the flavor 
They fear the ruffneck niggaz with the lunatic behavior 
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet 

Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin streets 
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy 
I rhyme and do crimes, cuz either way pays me 
A little rough with a hardcore... theme 
Couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams 

Mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip 
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse 
Representing YG'z yo 
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino 
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags 
Stickin up spots and jumpin in Jags 

Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin 
And always keep a hand on the gat 
Cuz a niggaz straight strugglin 
Verse Two: Live Squad 
I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin 
I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin 
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker 

But I'd rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker, so bust it 
Look as I cut the records hard to eject 
A quick clip threw my body down uhh! it's another hit 
I got energy to blast now you want the task here 
Cuz of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up 

But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin 
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in 
Eye on the Mac cause the dogg got it goin on 
If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick 
So you better chill, cause I got too much money to get 

A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin 
Get drunk but I don't think 
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch 
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch 
Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch 

You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame 
Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game 
I'm strugglin 
Verse Three: 2Pac 
Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang 
Ain't nothin changed set it off I let the brains hang 
Guess who's back, to put niggaz on they back 

Till I call back, niggaz runnin free better fall back 
I'm fifty niggaz deep beat sleep 
with a Mossberg wrapped in my seats 
three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz 
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come 

Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal 
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo 
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind 
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine 
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom 
Blowin motherfuckers to the moon 

Niggaz need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin 
See me on the block, strugglin 
And rollin with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed 
I get in niggaz ass, blast 
Straight strugglin
