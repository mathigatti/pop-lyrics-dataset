I'm lying wide awake
My head spinning over you
Afraid to close my eyes
Cause I don't wanna miss a moment of you
I'm lying wide awake
My head spinning over you
Dark of night, no stars inside
You are dreaming next to me
Afraid to close my eyes,
'Cause I don't wanna miss a moment of you


Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the mornin'
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screamin'
Cause they seein' destruction before they a see human bein'

So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke an' why do ghetto birds die?
Before we learn to fly, somebody else's child caught in guns
Smokin' weed can all make a change
So I'm told but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hopin' please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die

I'm lying wide awake
My head spinning over you
Dark of night, no stars inside
You are dreaming next to me
Afraid to close my eyes,
'Cause I don't wanna miss a moment of you

Eternally thug nigga
Hilfiger, made by Tommy
So when I speak hope to reach
My biunique mammies
Oh come to poppy
I love it when it's wet and sloppy
In and out the mouth piece
Until I cum no one can stop me
My bump and grind'll do ya' every time
Come get a blast of this thug passion
It'll blow ya' mind
Hey

Throw up your legs, rap them shits around my back
It's a westside thing fucking hoes around the map
Walking down 125 while I'm peeping out hotties
And they
Seduce my jimmie I'll be screaming give me body
Make 'em all scream my name out
Give me my props and don't you

Love how this thug nigga beat up the cock
I'm at the weekend parade
I'm watching caramel bitches play
Get with real niggas bull shit will never get you paid
This is the dream of a young black teen
I fiend for hoes cross country like a dirty crack fiend
Now come on

I'm lying wide awake
My head spinning over you
Dark of night, no stars inside
You are dreaming next to me
Afraid to close my eyes,
'Cause I don't wanna miss a moment of you

Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens, rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers be wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies
We can only learn to take our anger an' our hate

I'm lying wide awake
My head spinning over you
Dark of night, no stars inside
You are dreaming next to me
Afraid to close my eyes,
'Cause I don't wanna miss a moment of you
