[Featuring Treach, Riddler] 

[2Pac] 
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me? 


I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me 
Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these narcs 
be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart 

Now picture me scared of the penitentiary 
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary 

Now tell me what you need when you see me 
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me 

I got some killas on my payroll, and they know 
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low 
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up 

I'm gettin paid, pullin raises on niggas when they runnin up 

The first to pull a strap when there's drama 
Busta, you ain't heard? 
I've been slicin motherfuckerss since I lost my momma 

There ain't a cop that can stop me 
My posse is cocked, G, and they don't quit until they drop me 

I'm loyal to the game 

*Chorus* 

[Treach] 
Without no doubt I ain't no slouch and it ain't time to back down 
So I jumps in and try to stop-a and watch-a 

Slap you cock-eyed like Popeye fucks spinach 
Forgotten more shit than most crews ever know, or ever knew 

Was born with 7 flows and only heaven knew 
For beat the boot sex, the news breaks, the you shakes 
Worse, they heard we got more nerve than a 2-fake 

Yoo-hoo to you crew and you too so you knew 
I'm from Jersey and I'm a teen so your block more than you do 

Whose the new crew? 
Show me your neck brotha, and here's another 
Smack your mother's mamma's mother 

In the first mob of all those other crack lovers 
Back was bitch-ass, trick ass, cluk-clow-cluk-clow 

How ya like me then, how ya like me, hey-ho, how ya like me now? 

Ow, pow, hurt, don't it? Bow, bow, don't run up on it 
The same thing minus "P" hangin possies like an exponent 

Oh yes, rock in slums, ya gots to run it 
It makes no sense to smell like shit 
If old ass George could be Washing-tons 

*Chorus* 

[Riddler] 
Now I be loyal to my niggas on the blocks, just buckin the shots 
And packin the glocks 
and dodgin the cops, and takin over niggas spots 

Poppin after poppin the fools be droppin, the hoes be hoppin 
On my thing cause it hangs like the nets from Above the Rim 

You lookin grim, is it me or him or him 
Or be with me, we be together 
So what's up? We can do whatever 

Cause real niggas stick together 
Till they make it up to heaven 

Through the stress, through the hell, through the 1-8-7 
The shorter the nigga, the bigga the trigga 

The deeper they dig the ditch-a 
The Naughty the Treach 
then through to the Pac I brings the glock I wets up 

You fuckin body, Im like, Oh my Gody 
Did I really shoot him? Yo I shot him 

So got him, now I puts the crime behind me 
And finds me, a place to lays my head low 

I lives doin my rap, but I dies for my hood row 
So all you fuckin fools 

better recognize, and know my fuckin name 
I be Riddler to my niggas and Im loyal to the game 

[Chorus]
