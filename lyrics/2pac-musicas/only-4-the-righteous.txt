Him? That's 'Rock'
He's my microphone companion
Lyrics, full of the knowledge wisdom truth and understandin
Hobbies? Rappin, is my only recreation
(Microphone check one two)
Retire? What? You must be on some kind of medication
(You better get that head checked)
Why? Because I never loosen up my mic grip
(My mic grip, my mic grip)
Drugs? Never, cause I'm livin on the right tip
(On the right tip)
Sex? Only with my man cause I love him
(I love you baby)
Babies? Maybe one day I'll have them
(hmm, just not now)
Bored? Rarely cause I keep myself busy
(I got things to do)
Scratch? Nah, I leave the cuttin up to Dizzy
(chigga chigga chigga chigga)
Dizzy who's that? He's my DJ, he's the greatest
Word nah, he just pays me to say this
(Yo where's my money)
The mind, is something that I cultivate and treasure
Thanks (you're welcome) you're welcome, besides it was my pleasure

This is only for the righteous
Too hot too hot too hot too hot..

Yo c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
