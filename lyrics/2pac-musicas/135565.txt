[Featuring Wycked] 
Daddy's Home... 


[Tupac speaking] 
So...you say that like it means somethin to me 
You've been gone a mighty long muthafuckin time 
for you to be comin home talkin that 'daddy's home' shit 

We been getting along fine just without you 
Me, my brother, and my mother 
So if you don't mind, you can step the fuck off, pops 
Fuck you! 

(Tupac) 
Had to play catch by myself 
what a sorry sight 
A pitiful plight 
so I pray for a starry night 
Please send me a pops before puberty 
the things I would do to see a piece of family unity 
Moms always work, I barely see her 

I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her 
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today 
so when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way 
And I hope that he answers me 

I heard, guns unlike people 
take a look at my family 
a different father every weekend 
before we get to meet him they breakup before the week ends 
I'm gettin sick of all the friendships 

As soon as we kick it he done split and then [uhh] shit ends quick 
How can I be a man if there's no role model 
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle 
I'm so sorry... 

(Chorus) 
I'm so sorry 
for all this time 
for all this time 
for all this time 

(Wycked) 
Moms had to entertain many men 
didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again 
I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother 
moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father 

Shall I stay or run away 
tell me tha answer 
moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer 
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff 

moms was tough cause it's poppa wasn't man enough 
couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities 
instead of takin care of me 
he'd rather live lavishly 
That's why I'll never be a father 

unless you got the time 
it's a crime 
don't even bother 
That's when I started hatin the phony smiles 
said I was an only child 

[look at mama's lonely smile] 
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry 
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys 

(Chorus x2) 
I'm so sorry 
for all this time 
for all this time 
for all this time 

(Tupac) 
Man child in the promised land 
could afford many ??? 
moms was there only when pops was a no-show 
and Oh 

I guess ya didn't know that I would grow to be so strong 
lookin kinda pale was it the ale that pops was wrong 
Where was the money that you sent you would send me 
talked on the phone and ya sounded so friendly 

Ask about school and my welfare 
but it's clear, you ain't sincere 
hey, who the hell cares 
You think I'm blind but this time I see ya comin, Jack 

You grabbed your coat, leathers broke 
now ain't no runnin back 
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start 
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart 

So don't even start with 
that 'wanna be your father' shit 
don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it 
I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G 
Now that that I finally found you, 
stay the Fuck away from me 
I'm so sorry... 

(Chorus x2) 
I'm so sorry 
for all this time 
for all this time 
for all this time 
(Tupac voiceover) 

I never meant to leave but I was wanted 
lost too many people every house ?of which was haunted? 
had to watch the strangers 

every brother was in danger 
If I was to keep you breathin had to have you out of range 
Had to move one to lost my name to beat the number 
maybe watch my back I had no happy home to run to 

Maybe it's my fault for being a father living fast 
But livin slow, we'd have no dough ???? 
??? showed me it was wrong all along 
I wanted to make some dough so you could grow to be so strong 
It took a little longer than I thought 

I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts 
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand 
all I ever wanted was for you to be a man 
and grow to be the type you was meant to be 
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me 
I'm so sorry... 

(Chorus repeated till end) 
I'm so sorry 
for all this time 
for all this time 
for all this time
