Hey yo assasin...gimme one of them tracks I can just ride on
motherfuckers 
with...
mobb deep...
niggaz talkin bout we can't rap? Niggaz must nota' never heard
no motherfuckin 
track offa death row nigga...
DEATH ROW...WESTSIDE...
Let's get it on...daylight or fuckin nightbreak...
MOB...
Go into these niggaz...to the motherfuckin death...


Come hell or high water,
Down to slaughter opposers,
Just another lost soul stuck callin jehova,
Outlaw till it's over,
Brandish my strap back like a cobra,
I stay drunk, cause I'm a MADMAN, whenever sober,
On a one man mission, my ambitions to hold up, the rap game,
While I pluck holes in niggaz like donuts and still, down to die
for all my 
souljas,
Like hillbillies, they don't feel me so refuse, bringin war to
the city,
With each breath,  death before dishonor,
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor,
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb,
With a squad of trusted killers,
Quick to move shit, heavily armed, I'm similar to Sadam,
Sometime's I question Hussein,
Like fiends frantic for that last vein,
Stuck in the game,
I hit the scene like sandstorms,
then transform watch me,
I take the figure of dirty niggas,
Who all got me,
While bitches wonderin, who shot me?
No love, keep a grudge, shootin slugs like my Muammar Quadaffi,
Murder my friends, built a new posse,
We takin shots on paparazzi,
Gonna fly now,nigga like Rocky,
You got a lotta nerve to play me,
Another gay rapper,
Bustin caps in jay-z, and still avoid capture,
While y'all caught up in the rapture,
Still after me I'm in Jamaica sippin' daqueries,
No doubt,
We used to havin nothin,
Then grabbin somethin and bustin,
Wanted to be the thug nigga, That my old man wasn't,
I came from total fear to catchin cases,
Litigation, niggaz, playahatin', got me crooked in all fifty
states,
I'm screamin DEATH ROW, throw 'em a WESTSIDE, ain't no thing,
We was raised off driveby's, brought up to bang,
We claim mob, MOB, if you be specific,
We control ALL cash, from the Atlantic, Pacific,
And get this, I'm hard to kill,
When I'm billed, with this live spot,
Father, how the hell did I survive, these five shots?
Live it up or give it up and like demons, late night, hear 'em
screamin, we 
goin all out...

With money clutchin, bail, come muder man, po's rushin,
Cat tilted to the side on the lean out the ride bustin',
Outlaws enforce the secrets of war, but won't abuse 'em,
Burnt, bury my burners with my dead buddies when I use it,
Give a fuck about later, shots warm through the equator,
Death to you traitors, shots bitin' through your bones like
alligator,
Payin my dues, lookin for miscellaneous infamous grooves,
Old ladies the blues, leave them smokin from they shoes...

Now with my every wakin' moment,
I'm gonna quest to be better, yeah,
Precision myself to prosper state, prepared for whatever,
But at times, I slip slightly, shit I ain't afraid to admit it,
To gone, off that novacaine, like in too hard to live it,
And I'm just a __________ past my teenage years, into adulthood,
Now I ride with G's finally, knowin myself good,
And it felt good, when I was young but playtime's over,
EDI here take this gun nigga...it's over...

I piss cold blood, shit hot liquor out my liver,
Smoke like a tail pipe, and write when I'm bitter,
All my life I been considered a downright, dirty nigga,
From when daddy knocked mama' s twat popped the last dropped
from the litter,
Tell me in world hell,
Bustin hell I give 'em mo',
And I bail outta jail,
Screamin fuck the Po' Po',
When I run to take that enough, from a simple fuck, to
multi-million dollar 
luck,

Plus I think it's time to grab all pistols, wave them shits in
the air,
Celebrate Outlaw livin nigga, I wouldn't be here,
To you devil's losin,  and to me this shit's a family reuinion,
And to hell wit a peace treaty, never call it, cause it wouldn't
free me,
My wallet,bein empty as the day I got started,
Twelve shots in my pocket left my niggaz departed,
It's a shame that these slave vultures niggaz coldhearted,
In a dirty world where old God know yo death and can call it...

We thugged out, low cut, Outlawz rush and royal flush,
Bomb first kickin dust, out in cali,
But I ain't in so much, make 'em pay state to state, NJ to CA,
Them cowards felt the weight, and turned femenin like _______
Niggaz change they whole style, when the outlawz comin,
A million miles and thuggin,
Ya'll know I keep 'em buzzin,
While the rapture, capture this fuckin style that I master,
Bringin criminal disaster, HIT YOU UP when I pass nigga...
