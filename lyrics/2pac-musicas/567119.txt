[Sonia Sanchez] 
When your heart turns cold 
I say, when your heart turns cold 
it causes your soul to freeze 
It spreads, throughout yo' spirit 
like a, ruthless, feeling disease 
The walls, the walls that once were down 
now stand firm and tall, safe from hate love pain joy 
until you feel nothing at all 
When, your heart turns cold 
I say, when your heart turns cold 
A baby's cry, means nothing 
A dead corpose is tri-vial 
Mother's neglecting children is daily 
Loneliness, becomes your routine friend 
Death death death seems like tranquility 
Sleeping is never pleasant 
if you even sleep at all all all 
You forget ideals and, turn off the reason 
to make sure the product gets sold 
You don't UNDERSTAND how I behave, just wait 
I say just WAIT WAIT WAIT til your heart 
I say til your hearts turns COLD! 
HA HA! Cold! Cold, cold, cold.. collllld..
