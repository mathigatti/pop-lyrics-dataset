It's just me against tha World
Ooohhhhh ooohhhhh
Just me against tha world baby
Ohhhhhh ohhhhhh


I got nothin' ta lose
It's just me against tha world
Ohhhhh

Stuck in tha game
Me against tha world baby
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in tha city
Tha cops is hot for me
Tha projects is full of bullets

Tha bodies is droppin'
There ain't no stoppin me
Constantly moven while maken millions

Witnessin' killins
Leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Caries tha children
Cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin'

And the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin
But will they last or be blasted

Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket
Tha aftermath
More bodies being buried
I'm losen my homies in a hurry

They're relocating to tha cemetery
Got me worried
Stressin'

My visions blurred
Tha question is will I live
No one in tha world loves me
I'm headed for danger

Don't trust strangers
Put one in tha chamber
Whatever I'm feelin' is anger
Don't wanna make excuses
Cause this is how it is
What's tha use

Unless we're shootin'
No one notices tha youth
It's Just Me against tha World baby

Ooohhhhh
Me against tha world
It's Just me against tha World
Ooohhhhh
It's Just Me Against tha World

Me Against tha World
Cause it's just me against tha world baby
Me against tha World
Ooohhhh yeeah

I got nothin' ta lose
It's Just me against tha world baby
I got nothin' ta lose

Could somebody help me?
I'm out here all by myself
Seeing ladies in stores
Baby capones
Livin wealthy

Pictures of my birth
On this earth is what I'm dreamin'

Seein' daddy semen
Full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin'
I guess them nightmares as a child

Had me scared
But left me prepared
For awhile
Is there another route?

For crooked outlaws
That are in a villain of young thugs
Everyday is more death

And plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein more reasons
For me

To proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming
And leave they peeps grievin'

Cause ain't no bucks ta stack up
My nuts is backed up
I'm about ta act up
Go load tha Mac up
Now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts

But yo it ain't workin
And evils lurken
I can see him smirken
When I gets to pervin
So what

Go put some work in
And make my mail
Makin' sells
Risken 25 with a 'L'
But oh well

Me Against tha World
With nothin' ta lose
It's just me against tha world
Ooohhhh

It's just Me Against tha World baby
Me Against tha world
I got nothin' ta lose

It's just Me Against tha World
Heeeyyy
It's just Me Against tha

World baby
With nothin ta lose
It's just me against tha

World baby
Me against tha world
Me against tha world
I got nothin' ta lose

It's just me against tha World baby
Heeeyyy

With all this extra stressin'
Tha question I wonder is after death

I feel my last breath
When will I finally get to rest from this suppression

They punish tha people that's askin' questions
And those that possess

Steal from tha ones without possessions
Tha message I stress

To make it stop
Study your lessons
Don't settle for less

Even tha genius asks questions
Be grateful for blessings

Don't ever change
Keep your essence
Tha powers in tha people and

Tha politics we address
Always do your best
Don't let this pressure make ya panic

And when ya get stranded
And things don't go tha way ya planed it

Dreaming of riches
In a position of makin' a difference
Politics and hypocrites

They don't wanna listen
If i'm insane
It's the fame made a brother
Change

It wasn't nothin' like tha game
It's just me Against tha World

Me against tha World
Nothin ta lose
It's just Me Against tha
World baby

Me Against tha World
Got me stuck in tha game
It's just Me Against tha World
Ooohhhh

I'd be ashamed to lose
It's just me against tha world baby
Hahaha
Me against tha World
That's right...

I know it seem hard sometimes, but uh...
Remember one thing
Through every dark night

There's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick ya chest out
Keep ya head up
And handle it

Me against tha World
Me against tha world
Me against tha world
Fades...
