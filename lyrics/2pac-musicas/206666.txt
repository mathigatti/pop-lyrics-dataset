Intro: 
Yeah nigga, 
(Yo Pac,) 
That's right. 
(Yo, I heard you got beat up by the police,) 
(Got a big fat law-suit and everything.) 
Yeah 
(Niggaz just wanna know if you still gon' be on some crooked ass nigga shit.) 


Verse 1: 
Please tell me what's a nigga to do 
And it's true, ain't nothin' new, 
so I do, what I can to get through. 
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed. 
I love you reckon that fourty-seven layin on my hips, so don't trip 
A motherfucker from the underground. 
And Big Stretch buckin' niggaz if they fuck around. 
Yo, why ya got beef with police? 
Ain't that a bitch? That motherfucker gotta beef with me. 
They make it hard for me to sleep, I wake up at the slightest peep. 
And my sheets are three feet deep. I guess it's hard for you to see, 
But now I'm pointing the finger at police, instead of the motherfuckers blamin' me. 
I got the right to bear pistol. And when the punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too. 
And maybe then you see the truth. But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too. 

Chorus: 
It's all up to you 
But until then I gotta do what I do 
And stay a crooked nigga too 
And maybe then you see the truth (aah) 
But until then I gotta do what I do 
And stay a crooked nigga too 
It's all up to you 
But until then I gotta do what I do 
And stay a crooked nigga too 
And maybe then you see the truth (aah) 
Ooh, you can't fuck with the crew 
A crooked nigga too 

Verse 2: 
You know you really can't say that you blame niggaz. 
Fuck being tame, set a flame, time to aim triggers. 
Tupac will spark a revolution, fuck the constitution. 
I wan't my bucks on restitution. This time you got a bigger problem. 
Time to face the niggaz in South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem 
And we ain't shootin' at each other, that's a motherfuckin' brother 
So they too, run for cover. And other bitches from the clan. 
Come feel the wrath of a black man. That doesn't smoke crack 
And I don't drink Saint Ides, (fuck that) 
Genuine Draft, Ganja Ganja and my fucking tech nine. 
They know they scared to see us sober (aah) cobra. 
And niggaz 'll take the world over. It's all up to you. 
Blame the korean (uhh fuck that) I'll be a crooked nigga too. 

Chorus: 
It's all up to you 
But until then I gotta do what I do 
And stay a crooked nigga too 
And maybe then you see the truth (aah) 
But until then I gotta do what I do 
And stay a crooked nigga too 
It's all up to you 
But until then I gotta do what I do 
And stay a crooked nigga too 
And maybe then you see the truth (aah) 
Ooh, you can't fuck with the crew 
A crooked nigga too 

Verse 3: 
Pardon me. â€¦ try me. 
I'll be damned if I die, come and look at the ways in my eyes G. 
They got my homeys in the jail cell, now it's the rebel and the devil 
And one of us is going to hell. I got the whole placed covered. 
With lope out brothers, and nothin' but love for each other. 
So motherfucker make a motion, I'll give a fuck, slice you up, and throw you're ass in the ocean. 
Temperature's droppin', see it's cool to shoot a nigga, but they hate it when we pop the cops. 
That's when they gettin' petrol. You'll better watch your step or you'll be left on death row. 
But I learned to look ahead of me, stay strapped, watch your back, keep your eyez on the enemy. 
We blowin' up precincts and ooh you can't fuck with the crew. A crooked nigga too. 

Chorus: 
It's all up to you 
But until then I gotta do what I do 
And stay a crooked nigga too 
And maybe then you see the truth 
But until then I gotta do what I do 
And stay a crooked nigga too 
It's all up to you 
But until then I gotta do what I do 
And stay a crooked nigga too 
And maybe then you see the truth 
Ooh, you can't fuck with the crew 
A crooked nigga too
