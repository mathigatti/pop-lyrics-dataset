It'z 'Pac, Makaveli 
I'm in tha studio drunk in a motherfucker 
Ready 2 freestyle this shit, do it wild 
Live 
4 all my dogs 


4 all my dogs out there raised in hell 
Let me see them young niggaz raised tha bail 
Stepped out on tha streetz rushed from jail 
All tha police wanna rag and tell 
Not knowin' that I stashed my mail, uh 
All these niggaz wanna see me fail, uh 
That'z just tha intro 
As I sit back and rock this instrumental, uh 

After tha fire comes tha rain 
After pleasure iz pain 
Even though we broke 4 tha moment 
Ballin' tha game 
Time 2 make your, my military be prepared 4 tha bustas 
I'ma let your, bitches 2 scary 2 near me 2 rushin' 
Visions of over packed prisons 
Fingers of niggaz thug livin' 
Precious, Big Stretch, hopin' don't tell us 
They pull tha heater 
Ammunition in grace 
Shh, without a cell 
As we slidin' down 
Pistols in place 
They got me feintin' 4 currency 
And money be callin' me 
It'z like I'm dreamin' 
Seeing seasons 2 ballin' 
Officiated, and this fuckin' his behavior 
Got tha Glock 4-5 snatchin' niggaz pagers 
Label tha marks 
Soon as we start 
It was hard 2 quit 
Started out drinkin' forties through tha hardest shit 
G*ddamn, now I'ma grown man 
A follower man 
Nigga got my own plan 
In my hand got tha 45 
I kick it live 2 sur5 
Make these niggaz die 
While gettin' high 
Though we cry when these thugz bug 
Niggaz'll leave in their caskets 
That'z what ya get 4 being playahatin' bastards 
Me and my clique's all legit 
We keep a 50 on these niggaz know 
You can't touch us 
When they get 2 come against us 
These niggaz'll be defenseless 
It's senseless 
Knockin' niggaz back on tha fences 
My whole clique be sick 
And though we rip whole crews 
Niggaz knew 
We came trough 
Drinkin' 22's of brew 
And though we drink Hennessey 
We provide our enemies with mo' shit 
Tha art o' war's all legit 
I read, my name out, Makaveli 
With tha Thug Life chattered on tha bottom of my belly 
Can these niggaz understand this 
My whole family is sick is though scandalous 
Let my introduce my clique

Niggaz run and hide 
Napoleon will provide

And take from tha greedy

In a bucket or BMW

When they try to infiltrate my crew 
We never high, we ride 
And die, together 
And when you see my clique we always ride 4 ever 
Me, my whole clique is sick 
We smoke sense a me 
Can you convince a G 
That they can come against me 
You can see me on TV 
Or live 
Niggaz die when they try 2 come against me 
Never high 
In my own zone, in my own done 
In my mind I'ma don
