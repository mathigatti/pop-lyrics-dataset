(Are you scared to die?)
Is reincarnation
(Are you afraid to die?)
Reach the whole nation
Me murderer?
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Uh


My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole Nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition be my prophecy I hope it's heard

Hard words is spoken, many promises broken as if it's
Useless to hope, they got me constantly smoking
My role model was a cold bottle of O.E
Surrounded by my closest homies but nobody knows me
I pray to God it ain't easy
Half the cops in California got a hard on to squeeze me
Running through the backstreets, hopping over fences tryna shake the
Fucking K-9s, running around senseless
I'll probably be a mystery to many, but a legend to some
I've been a man for many women, but a husband for none
In case you see me out in traffic, looking nervous and high
My hands, holding my pistols will they serve us or die?
May God forgive me for my crooked ways, I didn't mean it
Knew I'd fall in love with money the first day that I seen it
Maybe now they can understand, my occupation
It's clear that my only fear of death is reincarnation

I keep my shit on safety
I've been shooting rocks lately
Everybody dies, they nickel plates don't penetrate me
I was suppose' to be the murder first to go
Them niggas missed, grazed my wrist, I took it personal
Kato told me that I was slipping
Got his strap and started tripping
Slipped two clips on the
Table, twist an L and said "Fatal listen"
Everybody don't be missing keep your vest on baby
And you know that shit that happens to the Teflon, crazy
You ain't gotta pack a gat I got your back just keep your front line
Or we can stall that, from the Cadillac we buck the gun shots
But we locked down, don't have your back in the casket
All he thought about was plastic and murdering bastards

I spend my days and nights
Not knowing if a stray's in flight
They'll probably catch me
Leaving my foes hella' happy
Cause look, at any moment
The game could be my main opponent
Niggas be swimming where the sharks are and man they don't even know it
But I stay focused, concentrate on my surroundings
Cause if I'm slipping, well that's when niggas will get to clowning
And I can't have it, I got a mission to complete
Raise my kids upright, make sure they got something to eat
And my daily ritual is, protect my physical biz
I just can't see now, I choose death before the penal
Cause what good am I? To that little Nigga with them big eyes
If I'm incarcerated, feel me now, I gots to make it
And If I don't, Re-reincarnation ain't an option
Leave my ass dead until it's really poppin'

How can y'all call us murderers and shit and
Blame all the problems of the world on us young thugs, Thug Niggas from the streets, ain't that a bitch
Tell me y'all ain't giving a fuck about us when we was broke and poor
How come when we get a little money, motherfuckers wanna stop us and block us
What part of the game is that? Who should we love, who should we believe in when the motherfuckers that's supposed to be our role models, supposed to be the people we look up to is tryna snatch us out of the game
What type of shit is that? Fuck 'em all

I still whizz for the top Dolla'
Just a true thug, with a comma
High power, small drama, made niggas
Top Drazed with a mean way to play 'em
These days, Homie I'm saying though, They tryna play me
I gots to get them, hit em and lay low
I told you before, my, only fear of death is momma, crying for help and papa tryin' to help
When I know we ain't got it but shit I gots to handle it, it's hard
They hand it to me, snitches, suspicious bitch niggas who ain't insanity
Never worry
Apparently, I think I never buried but if so I gotta go, my nigga's will always love me
Thug family ties, I know they want me to die but ima survive, see the look in my eyes

And this Lemika and I'd like to give a shoutout to all the tray-whizz kids out And I'm appreciating how I'm chilling up in the studio with 2Pac and Cocoa G And uh -laughs- Okay I'm out, I'm done, I went out, Oh Shit, put this back
