I hate it when you say everything behind my back
And i dont even understand what the heck your trying to do
And even if i knew and what you put me through
This song is really easy so i named it after you


Everytime you look at me i think why cant we just agree
On something that we'll both ignore
I'll turn around you'll hit the floor
But maybe kids will turn around
And everything will get along
So let me tell you here and now
Cuz all i wanna know is how

Why did you have to complicate it
Everything was great we made it
In the end we all blamed you
But we all know your easy to

I dont wanna turn my head to your back
Looks like we got off track again
Now that your gone i guess its time we both went on

Why did you have to complicate it
Everything was great we made it
In the end we all blamed you
But all of this will stop
