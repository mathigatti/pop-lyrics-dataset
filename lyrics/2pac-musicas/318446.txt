Ninety miles outside Chicago
Can't stop driving, I don't know why
So many questions, I need an answer
Two years later you're still on my mind
Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart?
Who holds the stars up in the sky?
Is true love just once in a lifetime?
Did the captain of the Titanic cry?
Someday We'll Know
If love can move a mountain
Someday We'll Know
Why the sky is blue
Someday We'll Know
Why I wasn't meant for you
Does anybody know the way to Atlantis?
Or what the wind says when she cries?
I'm speeding for the place that I met you
For the ninety-seventh time... tonight
Someday We'll Know
If love can move a mountain
Someday We'll Know
Why the sky is blue
Someday We'll Know
Why I wasn't meant for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Someday We'll Know
Why Samson loved Delilah
One Day I'll go
Dancin on the moon
Someday You'll Know
That I was the one for you
I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow
Watched the stars crash in the sea
If I could ask God just one question...
Why aren't you here with me?...tonight
Someday We'll Know
If love can move a mountain
Someday We'll Know
Why the sky is blue
Someday We'll Know
Why I wasn't meant for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Someday We'll Know
Why Samson loved Delilah
One Day I'll go
Dancin on the moon
Someday You'll Know
That I was the one for you
