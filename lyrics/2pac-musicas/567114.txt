You try to plant somethin in the conrete, y'knowhatImean? 
If it GROW, and the and the rose petal got all kind of 
scratches and marks, you not gon' say, "Damn, look at 
all the scratches and marks on the rose that grew from concrete" 
You gon' be like, "Damn! A rose grew from the concrete?!" 
Same thing with me, y'knahmean? I grew out of all of this 
Instead of sayin, "Damn, he did this, he did this," 
just be like, "DAMN! He grew out of that? He came out of that?" 
That's what they should say, y'knowhatImean? 
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty 
y'knowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me 
I'm just tryin to make somethin..

The rose it grew from concrete 
Keepin all these dreams 
Provin nature's laws wrong 
It learned how to walk without havin feet 
It came from concrete

Provin nature's laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet

You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete 
had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its 
tenacity. We would all love it's will to reach the sun. 
Well, we are the rose - this is the concrete - and these are 
my damaged petals. Don't ask me why, thank God nigga, ask me how! 
Hahahaha..
