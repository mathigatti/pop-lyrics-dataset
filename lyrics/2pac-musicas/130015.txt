[Makaveli]
It's not about East or West
It's about niggaz and bitches, power and money, riders andpunks.
Which side are you on?


*gun cocked, six shots, bullets hit ground*

These niggaz is still fuckin talkin?
You nigga still breathin? Fuckin roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid on you

All day
You punk mutha-fuckas
The shit nigga
Killuminati Style
Makaveli the Don
Solo shit

Bring It

Allow me to introduce first
Makaveli the Don
Sprits, Spurting, Spiritual, Lyrics
Like the Holy Koran
Niggas get Shook Like 5-0
My 4-5 gun is next to me when we ride
Plus Survival
Money Making plans
Pistol Closing hands
Swollen Pockets
Let me introduce the topic
Then we drop it
Expose Snakes cuz they breath freely
See me ride
Located world wide
Like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tuffer than any
My attitude is shitty
Born in the dope fiends titty
And every city you'll find me
Looking for trouble
Right behind me
My outlaw Niggas
Down to die for me

(Naw what I mean)

I hit the scene
Niggas ducking for my Guillotine Stare
I'm right there
My every word
A fucking night mare
Getting high
Let me see the sun rise and fall
This is for my dogs
Down to die for yours
Extreme Venom
No mercy
When we all up in 'em
Cut em Down
To hell is where we send them
My whole team
Trying to explode
Rather die
Murder mutha-fuckas lyrically
And I'm not gonna cry

Me

A born leader
Never leave the block
without my heater
Two big pitts
I call them Mobb Bitch
Nigga eaters
And I won't whimper till I'm gone
Thug Life
Running through my veins
So I'm strong

Ha ha ha

Bye Bye bye
Lets get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas
But I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killa
Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep
Nigga when I find you
Weak mutha-fuckas don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me

Yeah Yeah

West Coast Ridaz
Comin right behind ya
Should've never fucked wit me
I want money hoes sex and weed
I wont rest till my Row Doggs free
Bomb First

Chorus X2

We Bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We didn't even come to (hurt nobody)X1) fightX2 tonight
But it's my life or your life
And I'm a bomb first

E.D.I. (Idi Amin)

For so many days and some many ways
We've been duckin strays
Hate to live us
But we still some Badboy Killas
Got nothin to lose, got no where to go
I only got one home see me stranded on Deathrow
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli, be the general
and I be a soldier on a mission, suptitude
but you'll never do
That's ride for the cause
Yes I'll die for the cause
Ya best believe if I leave this bitch I'm dyin with choice
Kamikaze sicker than a mothafuckin Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made Poparazi
Tell me if you ain't in this rap game
For the mothafuckin cash man
Then what is ya mothafuckin purpose
None for service
Idi Amin born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first bitch

Young Noble

Yer style wack as ever
Like you was rocket patent leather
Cause a massive terror
Ya'll niggas lack, you ain't terrel
Half rapper half drug kingpen
Yer tellin fairy tales son
Kickin New York like you the mothafuckin one
But I'm from Jers we don't play that shit
From the Claire down to North Bricks
All my niggas flippin chips
Gettin rich
Even though it's hard
Tryin to creep through these halls abroad without scar by ????
With no warning signs cause yo my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the nine
ready to put in my time

Shoot first, look at there head Burst Bleedin'
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, Believe me

X2

We Bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
G's and Thug niggas on tha rise
Plan-plot-strategize
And bomb first
