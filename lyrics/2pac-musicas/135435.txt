[Featuring Shock G] 

[2PAC] 
Back to get wrecked 
All respect to those who break they neck to keep they hoes in check 


Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly 
And I dont know why, your girl keeps pagin me 

To tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me 
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady, take it easy 

Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me 
I dont want it if its that easy 

Hey, yo, bust it, baby got a problem sayin bye-bye 
Just another hazard of a fly guy 

You ask why, dont matter, my pockets got fatter 
Now everybodys lookin for the, ladder 

And aint no need in bein greedy, you wanna see me 
Dial that beeper number, baby, when you need me 
And Ill be there in a, jiffy 

Dont be picky, just be happy 
with this, quickie 
When will you learn, you cant tie me down 
Baby doll, check it out, I Get Around 

Chorus: 
I Get Around 
2Pacalypse Now dont stop for hoes 
I Get Around 

[2PAC] 
--Why aint I call you, please-- 
Fingertips on the hips as I tip, gotta get a tight grip 
Dont slip, loose lips sank ships 

Its a trip, I love it when she licks her lips, see me jockin 
Put a little twist in her hips, cause Im watchin 

Conversations on the phone till the break of dawn 
Now we all alone, why the lights on? 

Turn em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft 
Somethins on your mind, let it off 

You dont know me, you just met me, you wont let me 
Well if I couldnt have it, silly rabbit, why you sweat me? 

Its a lot a real Gs doin time 
Cause a groupie bit the truth and told a lie 

You picked the wrong guy, baby if your too fly 
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy 

Cause I only got one night in 
town, break out, or be clowned 
Baby doll, are you down? I Get Around 

Chorus: 
I Get Around 
The Underground just dont stop for hoes 
I Get Around 
Still down with the Underground 
I Get Around 
--Hey, yo Shock, let them hoes know-- 

[Shock G] 
Now you can see from my everyday fits, I aint rich 
So cease and assist with them tricks 

Im just another black man, caught up in the mix 
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents 

Just cause Im a freak, dont mean that we could hit the sheets 

Baby, I can see, that you dont recognize me 
Im Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties 
Never knew a hooker that could share me 
I Get Around 

[2PAC] 
Round and round, the town we go 
But the Underground just dont stop for hoes 
What do you know, another young bro makin dough 

But the po-po wont let me go 
Tryin to do my show, but other young bros wanna throw 
Time to hit the door, grab a hoe 

Dont forget my dough, and if the promo say no 
Let him meet my 4-4, Im from the O 
And yo, I Get Around 

[Chorus]
