When I say to you that theres nothing else to do in my room
and when you say to me that theres really nothing else to do
then I'll get up and freakin walk around and try not to blink
then I'll get out of here and say that theres nothing to do


Cuz when you tell me that we're gonna go out tonight
I dont think that everything will be alright
between everybody, between everything
between you and me and people that have nothing to do

I'll take a look inside that everything will be beside me
and I'll wonder why everyone is trying to hide me
like I'm not around and everything fell outta bounds
I'm sick of all the stupid sounds that sit around and try to annoy me

Cuz when you tell me that we're gonna go out tonight
I dont think that everything will be alright
between everybody, between everything
between you and me and people that have nothing to do

Well I guess this is the end
you know I cant comprehend
with everything that your trying to tell me
I dont think I can tolerate
any more of you today
this is all I have to say
cuz theres nothing to do

people that have nothing to do
people that have nothing to do
people that have nothing to do
people that have nothing to do
