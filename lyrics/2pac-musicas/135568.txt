Yeah, clear enough for ya.
Why niggas look mad.
y'all supposed to be happy I'm free.
Y'all look like you wanted me to stay in jail


Old busters.
Picture me rollin' in my 500 benz.
I got no love for these niggas,
There's no need to be friends.
They got me under surveillance.
That's what somebody be tellin' me.
Knowin this dope be sold.
but I ain't the one sellin'.
Don't want to be another number.

I got a fuckin' gang of weed to keep from goin under.
The federales wanna see me dead.
Niggas put prices on my head.
Now I got 2 rottwillers by my bed.
I feed em lead.
Now on release.
How will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did?
To feed kids.

One life to live.
It's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin at your crib.
Mama, I'm still thuggin'
The world is a war zone.
My homies is inmates
And most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man
Just sceamin on ways to put some green inside the palms
Of my empty hands.

Just picture me rollin'.
Flossin a benz on rims that isn't stolen.
My dreams is censored.
My hopes are gone.
I'm like a fiend that finally see when all the dope is gone.
My nerves is wrecked.
Heart beatin' and my hands is swollen.
Thinkin of the G's I'll be holdin.
Picture me rollin.
Can you see me now

Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Pictue me rollin.
Yeah nigga
Eh, but picture how my nigga Syke duke do it.
Guess who's back?
I got ki's comin from overseas.
Cost a nigga 200 G's.
I'm a street comando.
Nino for example.

This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle.
So I got to floss cuz I'm rollin like a boss playa.
Thug branded to be a women layer
So many playa haters, imitaters steady swangin.
Make me wanna start back bangin.
So I'm caught up in the game.
Dress code changed.
Packin 40 glocks.
Contain'em or rearrange.

All that jealousy and envy comin from my enemies
While I'm sippin on re-mi
In front of black lexus, chevy is on the roam.
96 big bodies sittin on chrome
As we head up out the zone,
Stone facing is on.
You can admire, but don't look too long.

I'm livin a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin.
It's hard to imagine.
Picture me rollin.
I gots to get the fuck up in.
Goin to lay a caper.
Cuz a nigga straight sufferin from lack of havin paper.
My bitch fin to have a bastard, see?
So I need to hit a lick, drastically.

I see some bald head ass niggas and they slippin in my spot
And, uh, diggin in the pots.
Check in the park, Pac.
We caught em sleepin.
We didn't think you niggas creepin.
This how we do it every weekend
And I dump for madness(?)
It's time to count the profit.

CPO, we got the bomb spot.
Nigga, time to clock it.
I get the liquor and you could get the females.
This crooked shit can reinflict and get the street sales.
Move smooth as a mother fucker, me and my 9.
I'm cool as a mother fucker, I'm a get mine.

Now we satisfied.
Got the pockets on swollen.
Boss hog and this Pac nigga.
Picture us rollin.
Heh, heh, heh.
