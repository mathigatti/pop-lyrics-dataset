[Verse 1 - Tupac]
Now you been acting like you want it for a long time
All up in a nigga face, giving me them strong vibes
Look in my eyes and you'll find peace
A Gemini so you really blow my mind freak
C'mon
I got my clothes off, hard as a nigga in jail
Skinny niggaz throw the dick well
Everybody get they condoms, rubber cause it's time to fuck
Hurry up and put it on nigga time is up
What's next? Got my mind on some group sex
Where you going baby I ain't even through yet
Do it like a true vet, love it how I threw it to ya
In and out make it good to ya
Remember me?
I love fucking slow with the lights low
Black, Puerto Rican, even white hoes
Felice Amor, Que Linda, Dame Veso (Spanish: Sweet love, your a cutie, give me a kiss)
Got my bed soaked

Fuckin' till the shit is sloppy (sloppy)
If you really want it

C'Mon

Rock ya, body body x7

[Verse 2 - SKG]
Daddy rock a playa body till I tell you to stop
Hit the right spot, if not, leave some money and kick rocks
I'm a thug hoe, I need a thug nigga up inside me
A playa that can ride me, a cat that can buy me
Make a jazzy hoe like me, bust a sweat
Hit it from the back, grab me by my neck
Demand your respect
I'm not an on my back hoe
I rock a dick and hit it to the core
Bustin', twisting nuts (censored), hit em up
I'm a Sagittarius freak
My real hoes feel me
Legs open wide, nigga dick inside
I barely ride tonight's the night for you to hit it doggy style
Lay me on my stomach while I'm counting out hundreds
Fake bitches front like they don't wanna keep it real
But you know you want a thug nigga just to see how it feel
Hoes wanna rock Gabbana, Dolce and Versace
Let me rock your body mouth on my (censored) call you papi

[Chorus]
Rock ya, body body
Rock ya, body

[Verse 3 - Tupac]
See, it all started simple
Turning me licking your nipples
Fucking you doggy style to this instrumental
Hands up
All up inside your head
I could stand you
Eyes open
I don't plan to bust, just hold on
Let me zone in
What do you mean, can you scream, let it go, biatch
How does it feel?
Gotta nigga like steel in ya
To keep going on, fucking like I'm killing ya
Lets go another round
Baby is you down really
Two shots of esctasy
Lick a nigga down silly
Your body next to me
I can touch you inside, and you'll cry
So good when a nigga leave, you'll die
My mama told baby be a man put it on a hit
On bitches like switches coming around the corner
I wanna let me get my ride on
It's your dick baby but it's my song
If you really want it

[Chorus]
Rock ya, body body
Rock ya, body
Rock ya, body body
If you really want it
If you really want it

[Tupac talking]
Gotta send this out to all the freaky bitches
Definitely all the Scorpio's and the Gemini's, and the Virgo's
You know I know the truth about you Scorpio's and you Virgo's
No doubt gotta give it to the Capricorns
They some freaks too on the down down
The Libra's, they like it even but they still like fucking.
No doubt.
Aquarius's, Libra's, that said though
Leos, they some freaks
Leos is freaks, they always wanna run shit in bed
Sagittarius, Taurus, Cancers
All you freaky fucks
I'm a Zodiac fucker I do you all one at a time and all down the line
Lets get busy
