Im smokin these niggas like they endo 
Breakin em like they windows 
And still they riff till they get a whiff Of the shit that I kick 
And if they ever had a notion to stop me 


Shoot ya best shot and get dropped wit ya posse 
Nigga I got the motz Im takin em out alot I got 
More than you can hock Im rockin the spot 
So now they jock Loc'em and get dropped 

Tupac aint tryin to hear it 
Im swingin at your knot Im swingin at your knot so hot 
Static is the last thing ya need when ya see me 
Better have a bat or a gat to defeat me 
Nigga Im a whole posse rolled into one shot 

Takin all ya got as your girl gets hot 
And rocks the spot 
Bringin' the funky flavor with the gift that only God gave 
Point me to my grave, Id rather die than be a slave 
Slaves come as dopedealers Some come as addicts 
Some try to run while the others call STATIC
