I shall fear no man, but God
though I walk through tha valley of death
I shed so many tears
Please God walk with me...


back in Elementary, I thrived on misery
left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
as my mind couldn't find a place ta rest
untill I got that Thug Life Planted on my chest
tell me can ya feel me ?
I'm not liven in tha Past, Ya wanna last
Be tha first ta blast, remember Kato
no longer with us he's deseased
call on tha sirens, I seem him murdered in tha streets
now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a 'G' ?
remember me, so many homies in tha cemetary
shed so many tears



Chorus
Lord
I suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers, shed so many tears

Now that i'm strugglin' in this business
by any means, label me greedy gettin green
but seldom seen
and fuck tha world cuz i'm cursed
I'm havin visions of leaven here in a hurse
God can ya feel me ?
take me away from all tha pressure and all tha pain
show me some happiness again
i'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is hell, where did I fail ?
my life is in denial
and when I Die, babtised in Eternal Fire
shed so many tears...


Chorus
Lord
I suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers, shed so many tears

Now i'm lost and i'm weary
so many tears, i'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
my every move is a calculated step
ta bring me closer 
to embrace an early death now there's nothing left
there was no mercy on tha streets
I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screaming peace
and though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of deamons tryin' ta break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
in my brain like a match, such a dirty game
no memories, just misery
painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
will I survive till' tha morning ta see tha sun
please lord forgive me for my sins
cause here I come...



Chorus
Lord
I suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers, shed so many tears

Lord knows i've tried, been a witness ta homicide
drive-bys taken lives, little kids die
wonder why as I walk by
Broken hearted as I glance at tha chaulk line, gettin' high
this ain't tha life for me
I wanna change
but ain't no future right for me
i'm stuck in tha game
i'm trapped inside a maze
see this Tangaray influenced me ta gettin crazy
disillusioned lately
i've been really wanting babies
so I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
don't trust my lady
cause she's a product of this poison, i'm hearen noises
think she's fucken with my boys, can't take no more
i'm fallin' to tha floor
beggin' for tha Lord ta let me in ta Heavens door
I shed so many tears...



Chorus
Lord
I lost so many peers
and shed so many tears
I lost so many peers, shed so many tears
fades...
I suffered through tha years and shed so many tears
