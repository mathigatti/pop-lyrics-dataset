Just one more chance
It's all that I took to realize
That I was wrong and all those words we said were lies
And I won't run, no
I won't hide
Please, don't go, I want you by my side
I fell deep and all that I did was


Ever since I met ya I could peep the pressure
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't 'bout no sucking and touching, just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations -- would that be ok?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love making, got you shaking when I'm standing near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's gettin' clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me can u get away?
(Can u get away? C'mon let's go, can u get away? Can u get away)

Just one more chance
It's all that I took to realize
That I was wrong and all those words we said were lies
And I won't run, no
I won't hide
Please, don't go, I want you by my side
I fell deep and all that I did was

Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
Ain't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony
But you was different -- I got no need to be suspicious
Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin' here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
When he ain't lookin', now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Come on, me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Tell me can u get away?
(Let's go, can u get away? Can u get away?)

Just one more chance
It's all that I took to realize
That I was wrong and all those words we said were lies
And I won't run, no
I won't hide
Please, don't go, I want you by my side
I fell deep and all that I did was

I sit here reminiscin' and I hope you listenin'
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to this sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
Stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can u get away?

You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man, ya know what I'm sayin'?
