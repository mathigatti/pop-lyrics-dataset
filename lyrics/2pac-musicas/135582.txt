(laughter echoed) 

I've changed... 
You mothafuckas kill me 
I've changed... 
It ain't that i've changed 
But it's strange how you mothafuckas rearrange 
When I found fame 
Point ya finger at tha bad guy 


You know what my momma usta tell me 
If ya can't find something ta live 4 
Then you BEST, find something ta die 4 
(eazy saying 'if there's hell below, we're all gonna 
go'--this is all through out tha interlude) 

Deep deep 
La'tasha Hardings 
Remember that name... 
Cause a bottle of juice... 
Ain't something 2 die 4 
Young Quaid 
Remember that name... 
Cause all you mothafuckas 
That go to your grave with that name on your brain 

Cause jelousy and recklousness 
Is NOT, something 2 die 4 
All you Niggas out there 
(echoed laughter) 
Got a crack that crumbles 
When I say all you Niggas (all you niggas) 

Unite 
One nigga, teach 2 niggas 
4 niggas teach more niggas 
All tha poor niggas 
Tha penn niggas 
Tha rich niggas 
Tha strong niggas 
UNITE 

There's more of us than there is of them 
Look around... 
Check your strip 
Deep deep 
That's something 2 die 4 
Black 
That's something 2 live 4 
What do I know?
