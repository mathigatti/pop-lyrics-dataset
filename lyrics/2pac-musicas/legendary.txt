Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?
Used to love niggas, now I plug niggas, and slug niggas
Am I wrong? Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I bust, then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin' back to brighten up the sky, how many die?
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me
Look, bitch: I'll cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie
Then, we watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow
Bam! Set my plan in mo'
Time to exterminate my foes; I can't stand you hoes
Uh, now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride on our enemies


You can still see my prophecy
Legendary live eternally
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me
Legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces, 'cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace
'Cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take them to places, stake they face
Then erase 'em and brake 'em
Murder motherfuckers
Legendary live eternally
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
We Outlaws
Legendary live eternally
Bitch-made niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
Outlaws
Legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces, 'cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace
'Cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take them to places, stake they face
Then erase 'em and brake 'em
Murder motherfuckers
Legendary live eternally

You crossed the game, don't explain
Nigga, time to die; say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
So right before you die, you bow before a bigger nigga
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit
Pay attention, here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you, then I run a train on Mobb Deep
Don't fuck with me!
Nigga, you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well
Hell, how many niggas wanna be involved?
See, I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill all of y'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant every motherfuckin' word
When we ride on our enemies

You can still see my prophecy
Legendary live eternally
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me
Legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces, 'cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace

I think niggas is tryin' to kill me
Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points 'til they drill me
Keepin' it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin' steel
See, niggas is false, sittin' in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryin' to be strong, they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
Bitches be warned: Word is bond, you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Giuliani, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave, picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This thug life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me and have
A hundred motherfuckers at yo' do' with fo'-fo's!
