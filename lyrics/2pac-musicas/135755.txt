Why must you be unfaithful?
For women.....
Men, you shouldn't listen to your selfish heart


It doesn't really have a brain
besides keepin you alive, its existence is in vain
and how could I be so mean, and say your heart has no place?

because mortal men fall in love again
as fast as they change their fate

I may be cruel, but think awhile about the hearts that you have broken, and match that with the empty vows and broken promises that you have spoken. 

Now I'm not saying females are perfect
cuz we all know its not true
but why must you be unfaithful 
if her heart is true to you??
