I make money like a mothafucka
It ain't no thang to me
Short Dawg in the house
Spittin' game for free
Ain't no buzz partner?
That's the dirt weed
I'ma pimp these hoes
You can't work me
How the hell d'you think I get to ride a B-12
Mobile phone, t.v. hit it with green smell
I went from up into Atlanta with the top down
Short Dawg...
My shit is nationwide now
You can ask Breed and Pac it don't stop
I ain't bullshittin' make a mill' when I rock
Three playas in the game and it's major
Bitch... wanna get me better hit me on my pager
Today I'm on the West Coast
Tomorrow I'm in Texas
Flipped the Benz and the Ferrari sold the Lexus
Shorty drop the bass in the mix you know what's next bietch

I be a thuggin' ass outlaw 'til my fuckin' casket drops
They fuck around and make me blast on these bastard cops 

This is for the hustlers... 

Believe me!
Comin' strapped with a gat when you see me
Label me a threat to society
But I ain't quittin'
Thug Life mothafucka ain't no bullshittin'
Born in these Projects
Destined to fail
Collectin' mail on these po' bitches
Slangin' that yey-oh
Now shit done changed it ain't the same
I ain't lyin'
Niggas is dyin'
Three strikes
Half you mothafuckas is fryin'
In the penitetiary or... in the cemetary
Gettin' high... no need to worry
And last year
Niggas was knockin' up the block
And in between shots
Bumpin' tapes from that nigga Breed n' Pac
And this year bringin' you the bricks
Includin' air bass in the mix
Now we sure to get rich
Do you feel me nigga?... 

This is for the hustlers... 

It's so hard...
