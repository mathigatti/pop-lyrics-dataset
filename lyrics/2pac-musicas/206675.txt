Between you and biggie was like who gon who gon who rules the the entertainment industry basically i was like this is like a fuckin
Ellection you know what im sayin
(2pac talking) it is it is that me and biggie situation was smaller than that me and biggie situation was like



(chorus)
Why am i fighting to live if i 'm just living to fight?
Why am i trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am i trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am i dying to live if i'm just living to die?

(b.i.g verse 1)
Check it, i grew up a fucking screw up
Got introdused to the game got an ounce and fucking blew up
Choping rocks over night
The nigga biggie smalls trying to turn into black frank white
We had a codedress to change our description
Two cops is on the milkbox missing
Showed they codes know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of teflon
Run from the police picture that
Nigga im too fat
I fuck around and catch an asthma attack
Thats why i bust back and dont face me
When he drop take his glock and im swayze
Celebrate my escape
Sold a glock
Bust some weight
Lay back i got some money to make
Madafucka

(chorus)
Why am i fighting to live if i 'm just living to fight?
Why am i trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am i trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am i dying to live if i'm just living to die?


(2pac verse 2)
It's on me
But still im having memories of high speed
When the cops crash
As i laugh pushing the gas
While my glock blast
We was young and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what i had
And plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches they still continue to purse me
A couple movies now the hole worlds trying to screw me
Even the cops trying to sue
So what can i do
But stay true
Sippin twenty two's of brew
And now the media is trying to test me
Got the prest asking question
Trying to stress me
Missery is all i see
That my mind state
My history with the police's shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes
Slip got arrested and flipped
He sreamed thug life and empty a clip
Got shot runnin from the police


(chorus)
Why am i fighting to live if i 'm just living to fight?
Why am i trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am i trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am i dying to live if i'm just living to die?

(biggie talking)
I was
Shocked at everything
But i wans't more shocked of
Him dieing
I was more shocked at him
Pac is a strong dude you know
I know dude know what im sayin
He real strong so when they was like he got shot
I was more like again
Huh you know what sayin
He always gettin shot or shot at
He gon' pull through this one again
Make a few records about it
And it's goin to be over
You know what im sayin
But he when he died i was like whoa!
You know what im sayin
But even though we was going thru our drama
I will never wish death on nobody
You know
Cause they be coming back from dearth (fade out)
