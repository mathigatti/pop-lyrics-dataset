(Tupac Talking)

[Big Syke,Newt, Payne, Bogard, Big Serv]
Y'all know how this shit go (you know)


All Eyez On Me

Motherfuckin' O.G
Roll up in the club and shit

All Eyez On Me
All Eyez On Me

But you know what

[Tupac]

I bet you got it twisted
you don't know who to trust
So many playa hating niggas trying to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they know it
Straight to the depths of hell is were those cowards goin'
Well are you still down nigga, Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry, but they finally freed me
I got a cariban of niggas, every time we ride (every time we
ride)
Hitting mutha-fuckas up when we pass by (when we pass by)
Until I die Live the life of a Boss playa, cuz even when I'm
high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyez
Cuz all I want is cash and thangs,
A five-double-oh Benz flauntin' flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream,
been know to disappear before your eyez, just like a dope fiend,
it seems
My main thang was to be major paid
The game sharper than a mutha-fuckin razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One niggas getting jealous, and muthafuckas died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They my homies for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas, and low riders, and ski masks
screaming Thug Life every time they pass
All Eyez on Me

Live my life as a Thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa (All eyez on me)
cuz we be getting high
All Eyez on me
Live my life as a Thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa (All eyez on me)
cuz we be getting high

(Syke talking)

Heeyyy, to my nigga Pac

(Syke)

So much trouble in the world, nigga
can't nobody feel your pain
The world changing everyday
times moving faaast
My girl said I need to raise up, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my women, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as we dip
I'm lost in the land, with no plan, living life flawless
Crime Boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm taking off on the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tek
Devoted to serving this, Moet and paaayyy checks
Like a kite sailin' nigga I'm forever Ballin'
It ain't right, pair this ice triggas and fleas crawlin'
Sucka duck and get busted, no emotion
nine and four shit is handling my business nigga keep on
coastin'
where yah goin' I been there came back as lonely homie
steady flaunting against the grain nigga still don't know me
It's about the money, and the rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggas don't even know how to act shit
what can I do, what can I say, is there another way ?
Blunts and Gin twenty-four parlay
My little homie G, can't you see, I'm busta free
niggas can't stand me
All Eyez on Me

Chorus -- Tupac
Live my life as a Thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa (All eyez on me)
cuz we be getting high
All Eyez on me
Live my life as a Thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa (All eyez on me)
cuz we be getting high

(Tupac)

The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
will I survive, will I die, come on lets picture the
possibilities
Giving me charges, lawyers making a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and thats why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, alone, as a teenager, on the mobile
calling big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers, Fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, balllin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the morning, never stopped until the cash came
I live my life as a Thug nigga
untill the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa
cuz we be getting high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down now its time to floss my shit
Keep your head up nigga, make these muthafuckas suffer
Up in the Benz burning rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is fully strapped
Cuz the criminal lifestyle equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the Meal ticket
Get your money muthafucka Lets get rich and we'll kick it
All eyez on Me

Chorus -- Tupac
Live my life as a Thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa (All eyez on me)
cuz we be getting high
All Eyez on me
Live my life as a Thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa (All eyez on me)
cuz we be getting high

All eyez on me
