Little do you know
How I’m breaking while you fall asleep
Little do you know
I’m still haunted by the memory
Little do you know
I’m trying to pick myself from piece by piece
Little do you know
I need a little more time


I love the way you
Activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a brother wantin' it so bad, I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you
And I can't even lie about it, baby
Just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club
Your hips have got me fiendin'
Body talkin' quick to me
But I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me
Then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway
Catch me if you can
Forgive me
I'm a rider
Still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money plus the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International
Player with the passport
Just like aladdin, twitch
Get you anything you ask for
Either him or me
The champagne, hennessey, favorite of my
Homies when we floss, on our enemies
Witness as we
Creep to a low speed, peep, what my foes need
Make some more g's, funk
Ya don't need
Approachin' women with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love the way you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, sugar, now tell me how you want it

Little do you know
I know you’re hurt while I'm sound asleep
Little do you know
All my mistakes are solely drowning me
Little do you know
I’m trying to make it better piece by piece
Little do you know
I, I love you till the sun dies

Tell me, baby
Is it cool to touch?
Tell a man that you can trust
I'm just a fool in lust
Comin' to get you on the bus
It's so ironic
Exotic, on the verge of erotic
I'm hittin' switches on misses like I been fixed with hydraulics
Ma, up and down like a roller coaster
Can I come inside ya
I ain't stoppin' til the show is over
Cause I'm a rider
In and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these
Nights full of alize
A livin' legend
You ain't heard about them players livin' cali days
Delores tucker, you a faith in me
Instead of tryin' to help a brother, wanna take his g's
Mistaken me for
Bill clinton, mr. Bob dole
You're too old
To understand the way the game is told
You're lame, so I gotta
Hit you with the hot tracks
Want some on lease?
I'm makin' millions, tryin' to top that
They wanna censor me
They'd rather see me in a cell
Just live in hell
Only a few of us'll live to tell
Heh heh
Now everybody talkin' bout us, I ain't givin' up
The very one that taught us all to cuss
Come on, tell me how you want it

Little do you know
I know you’re hurt while I'm sound asleep
Little do you know
All my mistakes are solely drowning me
Little do you know
I’m trying to make it better piece by piece
Little do you know
I, I love you till the sun dies

I was raised as a youth
Tell the truth, I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof
Suckers bustin' off the roof
And when I was a teenager
Mobile phone, skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries
Is gettin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetary
They wonder if my lifestyle's changed
And am I through with all the pain
Survivin' in this game
And still the same
Honey, just meet me at the strip club, bring a thong
Look how they shakin' for that cash
Once again, it's on
I have no sympathy for those who afraid of mystery
Come get with me, I promise passion and ecstacy
I'm alone, can I come over
There tonight?
Depend on me, the one to handle it and get it right
Your body is bangin', baby, I love the way you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, sugar, now tell me how you want it

Little do you know
I know you’re hurt while I'm sound asleep
Little do you know
All my mistakes are solely drowning me
Little do you know
I’m trying to make it better piece by piece
Little do you know
I, I love you till the sun dies
Little do you know
I know you’re hurt while I'm sound asleep
Little do you know
All my mistakes are solely drowning me
Little do you know
I’m trying to make it better piece by piece
Little do you know
I, I love you till the sun dies
Little do you know
I, I love you till the sun dies
