[2Pac] 
Perhaps I was addicted to tha dark side 
Some where inside my childhood witnessed my heart die 
And even though we both came from the same places 


The money and the fame made us all change places 
How could it be through the misery 
That can't get past the hard times 

Made a true friend afraid to ask, for currency 
But you could run to me when you need me, I'll never leave 
I just needed someone to believe in, as you can see 
It's a small thang through and true 

What could I do? Real homies help ya get through, 
And coming new, he'd do tha same thang if he could 
Cuz in the hood true homies make you feel good 
And happy times we be acting up call tha cops 

Bringing the cease to tha peace that was on my block 
It never stop, when my mama ask me will I change 
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be tha same 
Until the end of time 

[Chorus: RL] 
So take, these broken wings 
Use your hands to come and heal me once again 

(Until the end of time) 
So I can fly away, until the end of time 
Until the end of time 
Until the end of time 

[2Pac] 
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin 
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids 

So you know I don't hang around tha house much 
Diss all night money making got me outta touch, shit 
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while 
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs 

My attitude got me walking solo 
Ride out alone in my low-low 
Watching the whole world move in slow-mo 
For quiet times disappear to the ocean 
Smoking Ports think my thoughts 

Then it's back to coasting 
Who can I trust in this cold world 
My phony homey had a baby by my own girl 
But I ain't trippin I'm a player 

I ain't sweating him 
I sex his sister, had her mo' good like a Mexican 
His next of kin 
No remorse it was meant to happen 
Besides rapping the only thing I did good was scrapping 
Until the end of time

[Chorus x2]

[2Pac] 
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong? 
To live my life as an outlaw all along 
Remain strong in this planet full of playa haters 

They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators 
And in tha end drinking henessy made all my enemies envy me 
So cold when I flow eliminating easily 

Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breath 
While beggin me to keep the peace (haha) 
Well I can see close into achieve 
In times of danger don't freeze time to be a g 

Follow my lead I supply everything you need 
An ounce of game and the trainin to make a g 
Remember me, as an outcast outlaw 

Another album out that's what I'm about, more 
Gettin raw till the day I see my casket 
Buried as a g while tha whole world remembers me 
Until the end of time 

[Chorus]
