Daddy's home

So you say that like it means something to me
You've been gone a mighty long muthafucking time
For you to be coming home talking that 'daddy's home' shit
We been getting along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the fuck off, pops
Fuck you


Had to play catch by myself
What a sorry sight
A pitiful plight
So I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I would do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to beat her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard, god don't like ugly
Take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they breakup before the week ends
I'm gettin sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it, he done split
And then the whole trip ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model
I'm striving to save my soul I stay cold drinking a forty bottle
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time

Moms had to entertain many men
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin a bit older and I'm starting to be a bother
Moms can't stand me 'cause I'm looking like my father
Shall I stay or run away, tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause it's poppa wasn't man enough
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of taking care of me
He'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father
Unless you got the time it's a crime
Don't even bother
That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child
(Look at mama's lonely smile)
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys

I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time

Man child in the promised land
Couldn't form many heroes
Moms was there only when pops was a no-show
And, oh
I guess ya didn't know that I would grow to be so strong
Looking kinda pale was it the ale that pops was wrong
Where was the money that you sent you would send me
Talked on the phone and ya sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere
Hey, who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see ya coming, Jack
You left up broke, grabbed your coat
Now ain't no running back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that 'wanna be your father' shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G
Now that that I finally found you,
Stay the fuck away from me
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time

I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time

I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house ran to was haunted
Had to watch for strangers
Every brother was in danger
If I wanted keep you breathin
Had to be out of range, then
Had to move one, lost my name and picked a number
Baby watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father living fast
But livin slow, we'd have no dough, low to kissing ass
In hiensight showed me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you could grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doing time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the type you was meant to be
Keep the war fighting by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time

(Chorus repeated till end)
