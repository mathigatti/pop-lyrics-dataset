They say
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Preoccupied with my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'
That's right, that's right boy, start that shit off


I heard a rumor I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage, you know mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Where I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watchin' for thievin', I'm cautious, it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin' a bullet in motherfuckers, give me da reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me, now homicide's my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G?
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California, 'cause we ain't hard to find

Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Preoccupied with my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
Motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

I got my locs on, hard hat, goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch 'em pause as I pull my strap out my draws
And get to dumpin' on they ass like the last outlaw
Rich, 2Pac and The Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

I'm fully automatic, full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van, fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shotgun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, and weed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker, I ain't hard to find

Some may call me bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
'Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'

Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Preoccupied with my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

C-Bo, D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
Da Bay, beitch!

Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal weapons they carry, can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is a proof without the trauma plate?
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for if you gon' hesitate?
Best shake and bake all them I-was-finst-to-ass niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him, have at him

(Check this out)
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double agent for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgmental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleedin' and you needin'
More than twenty stitches, you behave like them bitches
Sideways to the next
Heavy in the game
Check the president, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

Hell nah we ain't hard to find
The whole Clickalation fool
Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch
Why them niggas actin' like they can't find us? 
Like they can't see us 
and like we don't be at the same spots they be at?
It's the same congregation. Young Pac is back
 You know what I mean?
 Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit
 It's a celebration
 Motherfuckers better understand this shit
 Young 'Pac is back
 Ay D-Shot, nigga, can we get paid man?
 Oh my goodness, we got C-Bo in this muthafucka...
 Can we just go there and sock this shit up, please?
 Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find
 Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some Hurricane and some Thug passion
 A motherfucker's gonna get his marbles regardless, playboy
 A check this out, you supposed to
 Believe in that shit
Sideways to the next light, and to the next coast, 
poppin' the muthafuckin' most, you understand what I'm sayin'
 Money over bitches, nigga, M.O.B., M.O.B
