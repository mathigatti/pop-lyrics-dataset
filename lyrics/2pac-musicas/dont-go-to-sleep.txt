(Makaveli talking) x2

Don't go 2 sleep,
You can get your cash on nigga if you peak,
Other niggaz close there eyes seeing DREAMS in they sleep
But don't fall 2 sleep


Quit staring at me like a infra-red nigga

(Verse 1: Makaveli)

Pictures of plenty
Sippin my glass full of henny
Hands on my semi -
- Automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact
Cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire
Niggaz die with open eyes
Scared to take a nap
It's a trap
A long maze
Dreaming of getting stacks
Making scratch the wrong way
What song says
We murder mother fucker's daily
Black out
Blow the the track out
My lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed
Then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like Yay Yo
Niggaz pull out
When I say so
Commence to poppin'
Mother fuckers copy and fail
Efficiently I release and flee
The art of war living sucka free
Get with me

Chorus: (Makaveli) x2

Don't go 2 sleep,
You can get your cash on nigga if you peak,
Other niggaz close there eyes seeing DREAMS in they sleep
But don't fall 2 sleep

(Verse 2: Kurupt)

I envisioned my self
In a pistol populated area
In a distance and a width with a glock
And about ten of the homeboyz on smash
Get to smashin'
First mother fucker moves
Nigga we blastin'
I'm a gangsta ass nigga
D-P till the fool's bangin' on the white hoes beat they fuckin eyes closed
In the midst with my eyes half open
The homie with the scope and
About fifteen others postin'
Nigga
The gangsta's run this mother fucker
Constantly smokin' we murder everything in this bitch eyes wide open
The homie pac says bray em'
End of discussion
He didn't save you for nothing
Niggz started bustin'
I'm a gangsta nigga
Just remember nigga
Don't sleep nigga
Don't trip or tweak nigga

Chorus: (Makaveli) x2

Don't go 2 sleep,
You can get your cash on nigga if you peak,
Other niggaz close there eyes seeing DREAMS in they sleep
But don't fall 2 sleep

(Verse 3: Daz Dillinger)

Animated of it all in juvenated my dawgs
Fuckin' up these niggas for the wrong or right cause
Breakin' laws
Breakin' jaws
Just fuckin' all y'all
Seeing is believing now its time to break down the wall
Barricaded
Faded
Except for just one blast
Let em' know don't fuck around wit Kurupt, Pac and Daz
Created for gunshots to vacate the block
After its all done nigga
What do i got?
Hoo bangin on niggas for more than 15 figures
Put a hex on they ass
And watch they ass die quicker
Daz hit like a killa, make em all remember
The deadly wrath, I can make they family shiver
Control it and hold it down
Won't renounce the crown
Servin' and lay these mothafuckas down
Drop the bomb
Prepare for war
Lets even the score
Bringin it to you niggas like you can't afford

Chorus: (Makaveli repeated until the end)

Don't go 2 sleep,
You can get your cash on nigga if you peak,
Other niggaz close there eyes seeing DREAMS in they sleep
But don't fall 2 sleep
