Never 

You ain't never had a friend like me 

Believe dat 

Cause you ain't never had a friend like me 

See at night I watch the sky 

I take another breath 

I smoke my new joint to the bud 

Like it's the last muthafucker left 

Just me and you evading enemies 

Let you get my last shot of Hennessy 

Ain't never had a friend like me 

Remember memories so vividly 

Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G 

Who can I call when they all fail 

Collect calls to my Dogz from the County Jail 

Sendin' me mail 

Heard the blocks in the same shape 

Ain't nothin' changed 

Niggaz slangin' at the same place 

The same faces 

We suppose to alwayz hate our foes 

This lifestyle is forever 

Watch the game unfold 

Shedding Crocodile tears 

Just got Life plus 

And you wonder if these white judges like us 

Just Stay Strong 

We'll appeal 

Nigga You'll be free 

Down with cha to the very end 

Cause you ain't never had a friend like me 

[Chorus X2] 

I'm down for you so ride with me 

My enemies your enemies 

Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me 

Nobody knows where we'll be 

My Enemies your enemies 

Cause you ain't never had a friend like me 

How can I be blamed 

Forgive me Lord I'm insane 

In search of fame 

Won't hurt to change 

Follow in foot steps of past dealers 

Equipped with ski masks 

No witnesses, as we blast fearless 

Reckon now they feel us 

In this act of war 

more casualties 

no survivors 

Any man the defies us 

Quickly dies 

Cuz we Ridahs 

In my quest for chips 

We wear vest 

Equipped with automatic fire 

We reply when my enemies trip 

Me and you against the nation 

Whispering while we conversatin' 

Cuz niggaz died over information 

How much more can we take? 

Expect us all to wait 

The world ain't ready for us yet 

So lets make Clinton pay 

(haha) 

They never wanted us to make it 

Everything that we posses 

We had to fight and take it 

I think the president is smoking weed 

Bumpin' his beat 

Makin' a livin' out of my misery 

Till he got a friend like me 

[Chorus X2] 

Promise to visit 

I know it's rough in your cell 

Receiving mail to the county jail 

This is hell 

When I was young 

I could picture livin' 

In Luxury 

So how the fuck did I end up in prison? 

Fuckin' snitches 

They got me crossed by my own side 

I found him by his self 

No drama, he alone die 

Nobody cry 

Should have never testified 

You got my nigga 25 

So now I sacrifice your life 

Help to separate me and my dog 

Broken ties 

Why the fuck should I let you live? 

When I'm dead inside 

Rapid fire my delivery 

I'm bustin' at their whole crew 

Nigga remember me 

Hit up my Outlaw set 

Then throw my pistol in the ocean 

Ditch my ski mask 

And get to straight coastin' 

It's visitin' day at San Quinton 

Always there to see your closest row dog 

Cuz You ain't ever had a friend like me 

[Chorus X4] 

[Small Chorus X2] 

Come after us, best be complete 

My enemies your enemies 

Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me 

Nobody knows where we'll be 

My Enemies your enemies 

Cause you ain't never had a friend like me 

You ain't ever had a friend like me 

[Till fade]
