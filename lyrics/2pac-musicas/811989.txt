Caught up in the middle, my life's a riddle, don't let it get cha, 
don't wanna be weak, but it's this hustle that get's me richer... 
One Love to my peoples makin' money, I can see you brotha, 
before it all troubled, beware of death, just continue strugglin'... 
cause nothin's impossible, if there's a will there's a way 
so get yo mind on official business, you can be paid... 
and it's been this way from the cradle to the grave, 
to get paid my niggas do this every fuckin' day, we parley... 
through politics and conversation, 
this information to my thug niggas in the congregation... 
watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation, 
separation and self-destruction, must needed if unification... 
it's the world, ain't harely scared, and 'bout prepared, be sure to be buried, 
and be no longer there... 
but no one cares, 
it's there to share, 
all we get is heads, 
because in feel will evaporate and say ya prayers... 
and what's next...
