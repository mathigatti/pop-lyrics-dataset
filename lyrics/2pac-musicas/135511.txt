They got a nigga shedding tears, reminiscin on my past fears 

Cause shit was hectic for me last year 
It appears that I've been marked for death 


My heartless breath, the underlying cause of my arrest 

My life is stressed, and no rest forever weary 

My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the 
cemetery 

Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary 
But at times unnessecary, I'm gettin worried 

Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic 

And certain death for us ghetto bastards 
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire 

Life in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die 
But don't cry through your despair 

I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggaz on welfare 

And who cares if we survive 
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutchin on a four-five 

My neighborhood ain't the same 
Cause all these little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game 

And I swear it's like a trap 
But I ain't given up on the hood it's all good when I go back 

Hoes show me love, niggaz give me props 
Forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block 

Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots 

Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops 
Black male slippin in hail when will we prevail 

Fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well 
And the system's sucidal with this Thug's Life 

Stayin strapped forever strapped in this drug life 
God help me, cause I'm starvin, can't get a job 

So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard 
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt 

Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers 
Mislead from childhood where I went astray 

Till this day I still pray for a better way 
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke 

From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark 
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent 

Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went 
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own 

I close my eyes and picture home... on my block 
And I can't help but wonder whhhy, so many young kids had to die 

Caught strays from AK's and the driveby 
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide 

Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside 
Cause our block is filled with danger 

Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers 

Time changes us to stone them crack pipes 
All up and down the block exterminatin black life 

But I can't blame the dealers 
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels 

Shit's real, I know ya feel, 
my tragedy 
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free 
Hangin out pickin up game, sippin cheap liquor 

Gamin the hoochies hopin I can get to sleep with her 
It's a man's world, stayin strapped 

Fantasies of a nigga livin phat, but held back 
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless 

Wide eyed and losin focus... on my block 
And block parties in tha projects lastin way past daylight 

A young nigga learned to break nine 
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen 

I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind 
I see the same motherfuckers ballin 

Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call 
I know the young niggaz understand this 

Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous 

I reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes 
Tryin to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime 

Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game 
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame 

And what's strange is that everybody knows my name, swear they all 
know me 
And lots of cash make a nigga change 

I hit the green just to maintain, feelin pain 
For all the niggaz that I lost to the game... from my block
