Keepin it real 

Verse One: 2Pac 
I take a shot of Henessee now I'm strong enough to face the madness 


Nickel bag full of sess weed laced with hash 
Phone calls from my niggaz on the, other side 

Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry 
A damn shame, when will we ever change 
And what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain 

Arguements with my Boo is true 
I spend mo' time with my niggaz than I do with you 

But everywhere it's the same thang, that's the game 
I'll be damned if a thang changed, fuck the fame 

I'll be hustling to make a mill-ion, lord knows 
Ain't no love for us ghetto children, so we cold 

Rag top slowin down, time to stop for gas 
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass, uhh 
It ain't easy, that's my motto 

Drinkin Tanqueray straight out the bottle 
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane 

My baby mama gotta mind full of silly games 
And all the drama got me stressin like I'm hopeless, I can't cope 

Me and the homies smokin roaches, cause we broke 
Late night hangin out til the sunrise gettin high 
Watchin the cops roll by 
It ain't easy... that's right 

Chorus: 2Pac 
It ain't easy, being me 
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free 
(repeat 3X) 

Verse Two: 2Pac 
I can't sleep niggaz plottin on to kill me while I'm dreamin 
Wake up sweaty and screamin, cause I can hear them suckers schemin 

Probably paranoid, problem is, them punks be fantasizin 
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died 
I wonder why this the way it is, even now 

Lookin out for these killer kids, cause they wild 
Bill Clinton can you recognize a nigga representin 

Doin twenty to life in San Quentin 
Gettin calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nuttin nice 

Yo 'Pac, do something righteous witcha life 
And even thou you innocent 
you still a nigga, so they figure 

Rather have you behind bars than triggers 
But I'm hold ya down and holla Thug Life, lickin shots 

Til I see my niggaz free on the block 
But no it ain't easy, hahahah 
Til I see my niggaz free, on the block, oh 
It ain't easy 

Chorus 2.75 

Verse Three: 2Pac 
Lately been reminiscin 
bout Peppermint Schnapps in Junior High hit the block 
Keep an eye on the cops while 

D-Boys slang rocks 
It's the project kid without a conscience, I'm havin dreams 
of hearin screams at my 

concerts, me all my childhood peers 
through the years tryin to stack a little green 

I was only seventeen, when I started servin fiends 
And I wish there was another way to stack a dollar 

So my apoli', casue these hard times make me wanna holler 

Will I live to see tommorrow, am I fallin off? 
I hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of y'all 

Ain't nobody down with me I'm thuggin, I can't go home 
Cause muh-fuckers think I'm buggin, so now I'm in 
this high powered cell at the county jail 

Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail, what 
do I do in these county blues 
Gettin battered and bruised by the you know who 

And these fakes get to shakin when they face me 
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me 

Sittin in this, livin hell, listenin to niggaz yell 
Tryin to torture em to tell, I'm gettin mail 

But ain't nobody sayin much, the same old nuts 
is makin bucks while these sluts is gettin fucked 

They violated my probation, and it seems 
I'll be goin on a long vacation, meanwhile 
It ain't easy 
No it ain't easy
