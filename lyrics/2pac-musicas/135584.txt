[Tupac Talking] 
They cuttin off welfare 
Think they crime is risin' now 


You got whites killin blacks 
Cops killin blacks 
And blacks killin blacks 
Shit just gonna get worse 
They just gonna become souljas 
Straight souljas 

Chorus 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me 

Crack done took apart of our family tree 
my momma's on tha shit, my dadies splitten, mom's steady 
blaming me 
is it my fault, just cause 

i'm a young black male 
cop sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sells 
only 15 and got problems 
cops on my tail, so I bail till I dodge 'em 
they finally pull me over and I laugh 

remember Rodney King and I blast on his punk ass 
now I gotta murder case 
you speak a' Heaven punk, I never heard of tha place 
what is it ta come up fast, got a Uz and a black mask 
drop tha fuckin task, now who's tha jack ass 

keep my shit cocked, cause tha cops got a glock too 
what tha fuck would you do 
drop them or let 'em drop you 
I chose droppin' tha cop 
I got me a glock, and a glock for tha niggas on my block 
4 of'em tried ta stab me, I moved out 
sold a pound a weed, made g's, bought a new house 
i'm only 17, I'm tha new kid 

I got me a crew, bought'em jewels, and a uzi 
but all good things don't last 
task came fast, and busted my black ass 
coolen in tha pen, where tha goods kept 
now my little brother wants ta follow in my footsteps 
a soulja 

Chorus 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me 

Buck, buck, pigs get fucked, don't step ta this 
Quiet has kept them blessed, on a quest with a death wish 
Tell 'em they come and test, and tha rest, nigga gets 
hectic 

Here's tha aneirexic, i'm making it to an exit 
Walkin' through tha streets on tha black tip 
Packed with several gats, cause i'm also payin' back shit 
Niggas don't wanna try me, brotha you'll get shot down 
Now i'm kick'en tha block, cause my bigger brothers locked 
down 

I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down 
Other cops see me on tha block, and they jock now 
That's what I call a kingpin 
Send my brotha what he needs is some weed up ta season 
Tell him just be ready set, pack ya shit up quick 
And when I hit, be prepared ta jet 
Niggas from tha block on tha boat now 

Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke pow 
These punks about ta get hit by tha best 
I'm wear'en double vest, so aim at my fuckin chest 
I'll be makin' straight dome calls 
Touch tha button on tha wall, you'll be picken up your own 
balls 

I can still hear my mother shout, hit tha pig nigga 
Break your bigga brother out 
I got a message for tha warden 
I'm commin' for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gorden 
We get surrounded in tha mess hall, yes ya'll 
A crazy motherfucka makin' death calls 
Just bring me my brother and we leavin 

For every minute you stall, one ya'll bleedin' 
They brought my brother in a jiffy 
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky 
And just as we was walken out, I caught a bullet in tha 
head 
Tha screams never left my mouth 
My brother caught a bullet too 

I think he gonna pull through, he deserve to 
Tha fast life ain't everything they told ya 
Never get much older, following tha tracks of a soulja 

Chorus 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me 

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja 
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me 
straight soulja, 1993, all of it.
