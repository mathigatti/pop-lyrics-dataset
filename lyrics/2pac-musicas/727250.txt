smokin' on big weed;
keyed the cali way;
don't like trickin' but i'll buy you a 'fit; (outfit)
I can't stand no sneaker wearin' nappy-haired bitch;

2nd Verse - 
 
I met you and I stuttered in passion;
though slightly blinded by that ass;
it was hard to keep my dick in my pants;
everytime you pass got me checkin' for you hardcore;
starin' and watchin';
me and you, one-on-one picture countless options;
was it prophecy;
clear as day, visions on top of me;
erotic, psychotic;
what possessed my body?;
far from a crush I wanna bust your guts;
and touch - everything inside you from my head to my nuts;
you got my sweatin' like a fat girl goin' for mine;
just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind;
back in time I recall how she used to be;
I guess - money and fame made you used to me;
what's up in nine-six?;
find tricks in drag;
fuck dre tell that bitch he can kiss my ass;
back to you;

got my hands on your thighs now;
let me in between as friends;
