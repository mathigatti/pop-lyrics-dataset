[Intro] 

[Storm] 

You can't fade me 
You can't fade me 
You can't fade me 
You can't fade me 


Verse 1 

[Kastro] 

True you a cutie and no i ain't tryin' to act a fool 
And be rude 
They call me Kastro 
( And you ) 
Storm 
Sound like a cutie too 
What's poppin' 
With me and you 
Just hit me 
With the seven 
It'll be my pleasure 
See what we can do 
Oh 
You ain't alone 
Got a man at home 
Answerin' the phone 
But he ain't the one 
Cause if he is 
Than why you gone 
What you drinkin' on 
Hennessey with me 
A glass of Thug Passion 
Or just a plain Pepsi 
Oh you cool 
Sure that I assume 
That you ain't 
Too much of a drinker 
Today 
You's alright 
I think I want you 
Right away 
See 
I'm only eighteen 
These groupies 
They just 
Want to sue me 
Push my hoopty 
Act like 
They don't 
Spend my dooky 
And I could see 
It'd be 
Twenty-two 
Or so 
Older soldier 
On my team 
I put you 
In my video 
And give you 
Plenty dough 
By my hotel room 
Four-fifty-four 
Hope that you go 
Baby 
Can you fade me 

[Chorus] 

[Storm] 

You can't fade me 
You can't fade me 
You can't fade me 
You can't fade me 

Verse 2 

[Napolean] 

See girl 
I'm laced with game 
But it ain't similar 
The shit that I'm talkin' 
Get more deeper 
Than callin' 
And comin' to visit you 
It's hard to feel you 
But I been playin' 
Since I been born 
And I moved 
Up in a edge 
Told the page 
Turn it down 
What's on 
Can it all 
The way you 
Hit the club 
To play the floor 
Hittin' up 
Every position 
And that's for sure 
But I think it's more 
And the situation 
That I'm facin' 
Your Shorty 
Was hesitation 
So I'm a replacement 
Plus it get's specific 
And it ain't no hoochie 
That's unlisted 
That the homies 
And I roll 
What's twisted 
And at the most 
We dissin' 
I ran through cousins 
Through aunties 
On down to triplets 
For droppin' 
The highest level 
Of game 
Ain't got no digits 
Now 
'Till you dig it 
But you ain't in 
No competition 
Cause most conversations 
You be kickin' 
You sure to get it 
Now baby 
Can you fade me 

Chorus 

[2Pac &amp; Storm] 

(Ah Moo) 
You can't fade me 
(You a little player Napolean) 
(But uh) 
You can't fade me 
(Let me show you somethin') 
(How the big dogs do it nigga) 
(You don't know how to rule no bitch nigga) 
You can't fade me 
(Hold up baby) 
(This is how you get) 
(Get your side) 
You can't fade me 
(Pick the all out) 
(Pick out nigga) 
(Which one) 
(That one) 
(Freak this shit) 

Verse 3 

[2Pac] 

Hold up baby 
Where you get off 
Thinkin' you can fade me 
Evade my niggas 
Like Brady's 
And then attempt 
To play me 
Oh yeah 
You crazy 
Thinkin' you can just 
Be Swayze 
Cause my conversation 
Gettin' you hot enough 
For love makin' 
Participation is needed 
Yeah I'm drunk 
And gettin' weeded 
In the back of my Jaguar 
The life of a rap star 
Completely freakable 
I get weak 
When I sit 
And thinkin' shit 
That we can do 
Let me introduce 
Mr. Makaveli 
Sue you speakin' to 
What's up with you 
As you can see 
I love freakin' you 
(Boo) 
(Who) 
Black 
Mexican 
Puerto Rican too 
Long as it's ghetto 
You can bet 
I'm gettin' deep in you 
Believable 
I got my eyes 
Concentrated 
On the size 
Of your thighs 
Now I ain't trade baby 
But won't you 
Let me ride 
Cause a nigga 
Want the pussy cat 
This Thug Passion 
So your man 
Can't have it back 
And that's a fact 
So 
How you want to act 
Baby 
Can you feel me 
Like Run D.M.C. 
It's like that 
Tell me 
Can you fade me
