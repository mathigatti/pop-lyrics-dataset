I wanna dedicate this one to Robert "yummy" Sanderford 
and all tha other little 


young niggas 
that's in tha rush to be gangstas... 
As a Young Nigga 
[???] 
give anythang 

to be that innocent again 
when I was ten 
I didn't bang 
but I was hangin with tha homies 
till them niggas started slangin' 
now they don't know me 

I got my hustle on 
learned to ignore 
what coulda fade me lately i been tryin to make a million 
can you blame me with that 
jelousy they wanna diss me 

don't sweat me 
if tha cowards really want me 
come get me 
and even I 
someday will die 
but i'm cautious up in my ride 

put down the top 
now we flossen 
hit the freeway 
let the wind blow 
drop the window 

workin with a 20 sack a indo 
feelin' good 
stop through the hood 
grab tha young thugs 
and I can't help but reminice back when we slung drugs 
it was bad 
but all we had was our hopes and dreams 
couldn't see, unless we learned to slang dope to fiends 

Chorus 

your the kind of G like everyone knows He's always G'ed up, from head 
to 
toe [My memories as a young nigga] always got it flown like Al Capone 
He's 
the kind of G out there, I know back in Jr. High when we was barely 
getting 

by when daddy died that's when my momma started getten high my 
neighborhood 
was full of drive-bys couldn't survive all my homies livin short lives 
I 

couldn't cry told my momma if I did die just put a blunt in my casket 
let 
me get my dead homies high then follow me throughout my history it's 
just 

me against the world stuck in misory as a young nigga my only thing is 
to 
get paid life full of riches avoid snitches cause they shadey back in 
the 
day we always had the time to play but after they taught them 
gangbangers 

how to spray not just LA but in the Bay and Chicago and even St. Louis 
every stadium that I go when will they change? stuck in the game like 
a 
dumb nigga remember how it was... to be a young nigga 

Chorus 

your the kind of G like everyone knows He's always G'ed up, from head 
to 
toe [My memories as a young nigga] always got it flown like Al Capone 
He's 
the kind of G out there, I know 
bridge 

I'm tellen you, if your young, have your brains and have every limb 
and all 
that.....ya'll niggas don't know how good you really do got it. 
Motherfuckers need to just calm down and peep what they wanna do for 
tha 

rest. before you end your life, before you begin your life ya dumb 
nigga 
Now that i'm grown I got my mind on being something don't wanna be 
another 
statistic out there doin nothin tryin to maintain in this dirty game 
keep 

it real and I will even if it kills me my young niggas brake away from 
these dumb niggas put down the guns and have some fun nigga tha rest 
will 
come figure fame is a fast thang they're gangbangin 

puttin niggas in a 
casket murdered for hangin at tha wrong place at the wrong time no 
longer 
livin cause he trew up tha wrong sign and everyday I watch tha murder 
rate 
increase and even worse tha 

eppidemics and diseases what is the 
future? the 
projects lookin hopless there, more and more brothas givin up a don't

sometimes I hate when brothers act up I hit tha 

weed and I procced to 
blow 
the track up for young niggas 
Chorus
