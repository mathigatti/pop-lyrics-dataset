If my enemies love their kids
Only if my enemies love thier kids
If my enemies love their kids
If my enemies love their kids
Only if my enemies love thier kids


Hey, why have drama
N-gga, your baby mama stay right around the corner
I could touch her if I f-cking wanna
So why you want insist on this
I got your name at the top of f-cking dead bitch list
Meet mr machiavelli's terror
Back of the year, thug of the era
Death row and outlawz, nobody does this sh-t better
My lyrics explode on contact
Best prepare for combat
Aint no stopping so bomb back
It's the last days, n-gga's is dying for bullsh-t
Mac 11 is heavy, yeah I'm ready to pull quick
N-ggas aint ready for a brother thats living major
Been waiting (?) muthaf-cker thats spittin' razors,
When I cut em they cut, when I stick 'em they stuck
My ambitions to bust, cause I aint giving a f-ck
Tore the neighbourhood up, look at all the sh-t that we did
Murder's a life long bitch
If my enemies love they kids

You don't wanna die
And I don't wanna kill ya,
Keep my name out ya mouth
'Fore a n-gga have to drill ya
All my enemies buggin' for all the sh-t that they did
Don't make me murder you n-gga
If my enemy's love their kids

Body's is wrapped in plastic
Look at this, it's drastic
Takes a n-gga with the right automatic to cause static
Like a mosberg jumpin, and muthaf-cker's be jumpin'
Play the role of a bitch
Like michael jackson, wanna be startin' something
Holla at my crew and they perish you through the cherish
Got the (?) in my sight
Tonight I'm bussin' off the terrace with multiple gun shots
N-ggas be droppin' rapidly, bussin' clip to cops
And bitches running after me tellin I'm high
When they ask why I'm trippin' out
Top of my drop, cause you know why, keep dippin' on my block
They sell rocks on box with frail cops
And then we buss shots from glocks, f-ck cops
My only fear of death, can you hear me, it's coming back
Had enough of this bullsh-t world so none of that
I felt no remorse for all the sh-t that we did
N-ggas die at any time if my enemy's love thier kids

You muthaf-cking right
You n-ggas better wise up
It's a real muthaf-cking war n-gga
You wanna get with me
How the f-ck you gon get with me
If you got kids muthaf-cker
If my enemies love they kids
I'ma let my lil homeboys ride on you busta muthaf-ckers
Cause y'all dont feel me

I don't even wanna talk no more
Losing your life, what for?
Facing a young muthaf-cker who puts it down for the dough
Get killed in front of your kids
God forbid if it happens
That's the sh-t I'm on now (?)
Gotta survive by myself
But at the same time they rappin'
Wont put my gun on the shelf,
It keeps me living like heaven
But when the sh-t jumps I'm ready
Cause I already knew
You better get this muthaf-cker before we come get you
Deep I my heart I think this sh-ts bout to pop any moment
Tryna do me like my parents but I'm a tougher opponent.

This n-gga scared
Must investagate all I'm prepared
For all the drama, you said
For all them n-ggas you feared
You f-cking busta, busta
Let the evil or the money trap you and thats life at you
Every second we coming at you
And you the last one
When l-rock is trying cast on ya
Cuz a young rida who would die,
Pump up and blast on the thug past you
Blastin on enemies passing
Giggling when they should have been figuring who would be the last one, laughing while I switch your wig
I gotta ask ya'll something
Don't you muthaf-ckers got kids
