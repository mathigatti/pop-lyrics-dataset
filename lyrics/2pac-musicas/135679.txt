[Tupac] 
Ohh shit! Jumped on my man's dick 
Heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick 
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie? 
Heard I was down with D.U., now she wants to do me 
Oooh-wee! This is the life 


New bitch every night, never tripped off a wife 
It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick 
Don't try to flip with the lip cause I run shit 
Hip hip, hooray for the AK 
Spray when I lay competition, what a great day 

Make pay, next is the wet sex 
Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex 
I'm set, wonder what I tote, check 
Bloody as a coat-check, snappin motherfuckers necks 

Revenge so sweet when it comes from 
niggaz get done with the drum, watch my foes run 
Nigga keeps comin when they can't slip 
Full of that shit, another hit from Tha' Lunatic 

[Stretch] 
Yeah, fuck that God! Word up 
Blowin niggaz out the motherfuckin frame yaknahmsayin? 
Constantly.. fuck that trick, we ain't havin it 

[Tupac] 
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this 
It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las 

Cause I'm nothin nice and, I'm icin like Tyson 
I'm grippin the mic and, my DJ is slicin 
I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin to me with the SAME OLD 

Tryin to do me like Nintendo 
How the fuck you think I ever got this far? 
By bootin motherfuckers like a shootin star 
Cause I'm out to show, that I'm a dope MC 
Think crack had you fiendin, wait'll they get a load of me 
Bitches on my dick, like a motherfuckin 'conda 

Niggaz wanna flip, let em step, and I'll bomb em 
See somethin you want, why don't you come and get it 
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government 
Then I leave you sittin there, wonder where your money went 
While your bitch is callin me, tellin me to come again 

Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo 
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window 
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out 
Lookin like a bitch, cause your whole fuckin posse, broke out 

Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on 
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga 
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this 
Feel the wrath.. and revenge of Tha' Lunatic 

[Stretch] 
Yeah Tu', tell them motherfuckers, word up 
We ain't havin it, NONE of that shit!! 
Bitch ass niggaz, niggaz can't fuck with us Tu', word up 

Ninety-one, we takin this WHOLE motherfucker over 
Niggaz got PROBLEMS in ninety-one 
Ninety-two, and ninety-three 
and all that other shit, word up! 

[Tupac] 
Recognize game when it smacks your bitch I'm back to rip 
Puttin this on the map with this mackin shit 
Time will tell if it's made well 
Well I raise hell and excel cause it pays well 

Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther 
I'm funky, that's word to the father 
Act like you know 'fore I thump, the bolo 
Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin for my solo 
Oh no, not another new jack, swearin that he's ruthless 

Ducked, and now he's fucked and left toothless 
I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared 
You're scared and you're bound to go 
It's somethin, I guess I let the beat keep bumpin 
Stop trippin off these niggaz cause they ain't about nuttin 

Or should I say NAYthin 
Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in 
I'm sick of the bullshit 
Come equipped and get ready to rip 
or get the dick of Tha' Lunatic 

[Stretch] 
Ahhhh yeah! FUCK THAT! (the motherfuckin lunatic) 

YouknowhatI'msayin? Yes Tu'! 
Tell them niggaz what time it is knahmsayin? 
(punk motherfuckers, get the dick of the lunatic) 
Niggaz can't fuck with us, word up 
Bitch ass niggaz, FUCK EM! 

[Tupac] 
Fuck all them niggaz 
I'm tellin these niggaz that they ain't got.. 
NAYthin on a nigga like me 
We squashin these punk motherfuckers in ninety-one 
ninety-two ninety-three.. and SO on 
So let the beat FLOAT on 

While I spray these PUNK BITCHES 
with these dope ass lyrics 
Thanks to Poppa for supplyin the DANK 
Now it's money in the BANK 
And all y'all niggaz shit STANK 
compared to this shit.. 

Fuck y'all punk bitches! 
Tha' Lunatic * echoes to fade *
