They claim that i'm violent 
Just cuz I refuse to be silent 
These hipocrites I havin' fears 


Cuz i'm not buying it, defying it 
Envious, because I will rebel against 
Any oppresor, and this is known as self defense 
I show no mercy, they claim that i'm tha Lunatic 
But when tha shit gets thick, i'm tha one you got and get 

Don't look so confused, tha truth is so plain ta see 
Cause i'm tha nigga tha you sell-outs are ashamed to be 
And every jeep and and every car, while they stop us 
I'm never ignorant, getten goals accomplished 
Tha underground railroad on an uprise 
This time tha truth is getten told 
Heard enough lies 
I told'em fight back, attack on society 

If this is violence then violents what I gotta be 
If you investigate you'll find out where it's coming from 
Look through our history, Americas tha violent one 
Unlock my brain, break tha chains of your misery 
This time tha pay back for evil shit you did too me 

They call me militant and racist cause I won't resist 
You wanna censor something 
Mothafucka censor this! 
My words are weapons, and i'm stepin to tha sirens 
Wakin up tha masses 
But you, claim that i'm violent 

Chorus 

(with tons of scratching in the chorus) 

Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent) 

Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent) 
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent) 
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent) 
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent) 
Tha cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me 
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats 
Jacked by tha police, didn't have my ID 

I said, excuse me, why ya tryin ta rob me 
He had tha nerve to, say that I had a curfew 
Get out tha car, or i'lI hurt you 
So here I go, I better make my mind up 

Pick my 9 up or hit tha line up 
I choose B steped into tha streets 
Tha first cop grabed me, tha other ripped my seat 
They grabed my homie and threw him to tha concrete 

(what ya doin man) they tried ta frame me 
They tried ta say I had some dope in tha back seat 
But, i'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend 

My homie packed, he tried ta run 
(freeze nigga) I heard a bullet fire from tha cops gun 
My homie dropped, so I hit tha cop 
I kept swingin,Yo, I couldn't stop 

Before I knew it, I was beaten tha cop senseless 
Tha other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless 
Now i'm against this cop who was racist 

Given him a taste, of tradin places 
And all this, cause tha [?...?] was tryin ta frame us, but 
I came up 
Now they claiming that i'm violent 

Chorus 

(with tons of scratching in the chorus) 

Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent) 
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent) 
Fuck a damn cop, (they 
claim'in that i'm violent) 

Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent) 
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent) 
As I was beatin on a cop, I heard a gun click 
Then tha gun shot, but I wasn't hit 

I turned around it was my homie with tha gun in hand 
He shot tha cop, now he's a dead man 
I said, come on, it's time for us ta get away 
They called for back up, and they'll be on their way 

Jumped in tha car, and tried ta get away quick 
Tha car wouldn't start, we in deep shit 
So we jumped out, (come on, let's take tha cops car) 
We drove a little ways thinking that we got far 

But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights 
If I die tonight, i'm dying in a gun fight 
I grabed tha AK, my homie took tha 12 gauge 
Load'em up quick, it's time for us ta spray 

We'll shot'em up with they own fuckin weapons 
And when we threw spraying, then we stepin 
This is a lesson, to tha rednecks and crooked cops 

You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin ass dropped 
So here we go, tha police against us 
Dark at dusk, and waiting for tha guns ta bust 
What's next, I don't know and 

I don't care 
One things for sure, tommorrow I won't be here 
But if I go, i'm taken all these punks with me 

Pass me a clip G, now come and get me 
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent 
Given them a reason, (a reason) 
Ta claim that i'm violent...
