What's up boo? 
Swear I'll never call you bitch again 
You ain't fucking with me remember I ain't hate you 
I swear I'll never call you bitch again 
I just wanna say that uh, I fucking apologize 
I didn't mean to call you a bitch 
I'll never call you bitch again 


Damn 

[Verse 1] 

Gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence 
I try to picture myself, in his position but remain silent 
I get to thinking bout the shit we been through 
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too 
This life of sin, that got the both of us in trouble 
But you you always stay down for a nigga so that's why I love you 
Reminiscing needing tissues 
Fighting over childish issues, swear I can't live with you 
but without you everyday I miss you 
Word on roll you hold my pistol 
My gangsta bitch that you always in the mood for love 
that's why I'm sleeping with you 
Though not the man of your dreams, my planted schemes to be rich like a king 
and live my life trouble free 
I see, yesterday I called you names, and played games on your mind 
I promise that I'll change in time 
It's a complicated world so girl just be a friend 
I swear I'll never call you bitch again 

And that's my word 

[Chorus] 

We came too far 
To throw it all away 
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me, ugh) 
We came way too far pretty thing yeaaah 
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey) 
Do it all away, do it all away baby ... 

[Verse 2] 

I wake up early in the morning, at the crack of dawn 
Nigga still tired so I'm yawning, and now I'm gone 
Tryin' to get my money on strong so an early riser 
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time 
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts 
They envy me, plus we be beefing with the east coast 
Two casualties, got stopped in traffic 
Had a warrant, so they gaffled me 
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me 
My enemies think they got me crossed they ain't knowing 
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards going 
You paid bail got me out of jail, home again 
I promise not to leave you on your own again 
Cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped 
It's so frantic but don't panic cause we forged to top 
I found a partner and a ridah, a woman and friend 
I swear I'll never call you bitch again 
Believe Me 

[Chorus] 

We came too far 
(I know, I know) 
To throw it all away 
(All that is dead don't change each other) 
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me) 
We came too far pretty thing, yeahh 
(I know what time it is) 
(You just gotta give a nigga time to grow up you know what I'm saying) 
(That was way back then) 
(I Swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey) 
Do it all away, do it all away baby ... 

Your my nigga, my best friend 
I'm never gonna call you, bitch again 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

[Verse 3] 

Witness evil men do, all this shit I been through 
Never meant to hurt you, can we make this work boo? 
I know you been feeling pain, things are not the same 
Waiting to exhale while I'm sitting in the country jail 
Keep your head up, cause things are getting better 
My cell mate shed tears off your last love letter 
Told him you would find a friend so keep your eyes peeled 
Sorry if I cuss, but it's the suffering that I feel 
Who can I trust, and if I bust, will she snitch? 
Even though your not the type to trip, sorry if I called you bitch 
You showed me the definition of feminine 
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women 
I see the board for a third time hope to see you soon 
Pictures of us kissing in the living room in the nude 
Thanks for being there much more than a friend 
I swear I'll never call you bitch again 
Believe Me 

[Chorus] 

We came too far 
To throw it all away 
We came way too far pretty thing yeaaah 
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again) 
Together, together 

We came too far 
To throw it all away 
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me) 
We came way too far pretty thing yeaaah 
To throw it all away, throw it all away baby 

Through all my ups, and downs 
You always, stayed around, stayed around
