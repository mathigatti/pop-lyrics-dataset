Are you afraid to die?
Or do you wanna live forever?


I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressing keep
A vest for protection
From the barrel of a Smith &amp; Wesson
And all my niggas in the
Pen, here we go again
Ain't nothing separating
Us from a MAC-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
Straight soldier, bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with
Hate, then we multiply
See me striking down the
Block hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker
Living like I wanna
Ain't no stopping at the
Red lights, I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they
Lights on, chase me, nigga
Zig-zagging through the
Freeway, race me, nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker
That you ever saw

Body gotta die say
Goodbye to the real G
Lord forgive me if you feel me!
Everybody gotta die say
Goodbye to the real G
Lord forgive me if you feel me!
Everybody gotta die say
Goodbye to the real G
Lord forgive me if you feel me!
Everybody gotta die say goodbye to the-
And ain't no love for the
Scrubs that be buyin' dimes

And all my niggas in the
Pen, here we go again
And ain't no love for the
Scrubs that be buyin' dimes

Ain't no escape from a deadly fate
And every day there's a
Million black bodies put away
I'm starting to lose hope
It seems everybody's on dope
Mama told me to leave
Cause she was broke
Sometimes I choke on the
Indo, creeping out the window
Alone, on my own, I'm a criminal
Got no love from the household
I'm out cold, on the streets
Screaming 'Motherfuck peace! '
I got nothing to lose, and
Something to prove, what do I do?
Live the THUG LIFE, nigga, stay true
I wonder when they kill me, is
There a heaven for a real G?
Lord forgive me, if you feel me
Cause all my life I was
Dirt broke with no hope
Little skinny motherfucker wanting dough

Body gotta die say
Goodbye to the real G
Lord forgive me if you feel me!
Everybody gotta die say
Goodbye to the real G
Lord forgive me if you feel me!
Everybody gotta die say
Goodbye to the real G
Lord forgive me if you feel me!
Everybody gotta die say goodbye to the-
And ain't no love for the
Scrubs that be buyin' dimes

THUG for LIFE
Feel me?
All my homeboys and my
Homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad
Especially come the
First and the fifteenth
Stay strong, and stay ballin', hold on
I'll catch y'all at the
Next light, we in traffic

I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on
I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on
I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on
I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on
I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on
I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on
I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on
I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
