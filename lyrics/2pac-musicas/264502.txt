Mr. Shakur, can you please explain the meaning behind your violent lyrics?

Explain tha meaning?? What tha fuck these niggas talkin about...


(Sounds of running and sirens in background)



Damn...


Police!! Freeze!!.... I said FREEZE you miserable black sonova bitch!


My attitude is shitty, my message to tha censorship comity
Who's tha biggest gang of niggas in tha city?


Tha critics are tha cops


Tha courts are tha crooks
Don't look so confused
Take a closer look


Niggas get they necks broke daily
Tryin' ta stay jail free


What tha fuck does Quayle know a young black males...


Please tell me


Message to tha censorship comity
Whos tha biggest gang of niggas in tha city


I pack a 9 milimeter cause I gottem liven hotter than tha 4th of July
If I gotta die, gotta


Momma told me 'Don't lett'em fade me...
Nigga don't lett'em make ya crazy' 
Game is what she gave me


Gotta watch your back, strapped
Real niggas laugh back
If you get your ass taxed, swing your gat back
That's not tha way we made it


That's just tha way it is...


So I'm wrong, to spare a niggas kids??


I came up, my message to tha censorship commity
Who's tha biggest gang of niggas in tha city?
Cops pull me over
Check my plates
But i'm legal


Ya couldn't get me, figure 'FUCK with a niggas people'


They got me trapped, gat'd with tha mothafucken hammer back
Cops on my back, just cause i'm black, SNAP


Now i'm guilty?
Message to tha censorship comity
Who's tha biggest gang of niggas in tha city?


All you punk Police will never find peace on tha streets 
Till' tha niggas get a piece
FUCK'EM 

They kill ya to control ya
Or PAY
Top dollar for ya soul
Real niggas don't fold
Straight souljah


Can't find peace on tha streets til tha niggas get a piece...
Fuck tha police
And we're screamin fuck'em
Can't find peace on tha streets til tha niggas get a piece...
Fuck tha police
I hear ya...(fuck'em)
Can't find peace on tha streets til tha niggas get a piece...
Fuck tha police
I hear ya...(fuck'em)
Can't find peace on tha streets til tha niggas get a piece...
Fuck tha police
I hear ya...(fuck'em)
Can't find peace on tha streets til tha niggas get a piece...
Fuck tha police
I hear ya...(fuck'em)
Can't find peace on tha streets til tha niggas get a piece...
Fuck tha police
I hear ya...(fuck'em)
Can't find peace on tha streets til tha niggas get a piece...
Fuck tha police
Niggas screamin'...fuck'em


Mothafucken punk police
They think they run tha streets (I hear ya)
There's more niggas than there's police...
(I hear ya...)
One nigga 
Teach 2 niggas
Teach 3 niggas 
Teach 4 niggas (I hear ya...)
Teach more niggas
We would run this shit...
(I hear ya...)


They finally pulled me over and I laughed,
Remember Rodney King and I blast on his punk ass


[Song continues with this line above, repeated and scratched upon]


SOULJAH...
