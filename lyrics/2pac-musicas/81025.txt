Yeah.. ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier..


[2Pac]
The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dawgs, official mob niggaz love to act up
The first to bomb we rob niggaz
I can be, lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thought's grip on chrome nines
Niggaz get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennesey
Talkin to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin "Fuck the police," as I ride through the night streets
Lil' child runnin wild, toward his danger
What's the cause don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin nigga unleash the Sandman
Promisin merciless retaliation, nothin is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier

[Chorus: singing + 2Pac]
Thug for Life I will be..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead..
(close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
It's a crazy world full of sin..
(close your eyes)

[2Pac]
Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switch now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm read' to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back (heh heh)
Upon my secret arrival
Two glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals, tell me what you want lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord (eh eh)
The situation's critical
Nothin is colder - than hear the ballad of a dead soldier

[Chorus: singing + 2Pac]
Thug for Life I will be..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead..
(close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
It's a crazy world full of sin..
close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier"

[2Pac]
Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my glocks rang out, the niggaz came out BOOM
Who wanna see me in the challenge?
So merciless I'm terrifyin niggaz in my ballads, do you feel me?
Capo or Capi-tan, one day I'll be the Don
Until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggaz facin sixty years, sheddin tattooed tears
Another suicidal on the peer
Takin private planes, tryin to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All he promised us is death nigga
Take a breath come be the last one left nigga, it's real now
Villain to fantasize, ain't nothin colder
Listen you can hear it - the ballad of a dead soldier

[Chorus: singing + 2Pac]
Thug for Life I will be..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead..
(close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
It's a crazy world full of sin..
close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier

[2Pac]
This go out to Cato, Mental
All the niggaz that passed away
To Geronimo.. (?).. all the down ass riders
All the niggaz that put it down, all the soldiers
All the niggaz that go through that day to day struggled
This is the ballad of a dead soldier!
All the niggaz that passed on
All the niggaz with ambition and money in they heart
All the niggaz that want some and that don't take none
Hahaha.. it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
The police are so scared of us
All the feds they aware of us
They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga head, ballad of a dead soldier!
Tryin to see me in chains, shit
Them niggaz'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole motherfuckin block, fuck the cops!
The police? We run these streets nigga
Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!
These niggaz can't see me, half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionaire; shit, it ain't fair
But nigga, you know - it's the ballad of a dead soldier
