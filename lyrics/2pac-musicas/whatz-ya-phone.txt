What'z ya phone number
Now I could make miracles with pimp hoes.


It's instrumental.
Waitin for the nimphoes.
That's the intro.
Shoot when ya rush me.
Walked up and touched me.

Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Just cuz I'm paid in the worst way? True.
Lookin kind a good in your birthday suit.
I wonder if your wild and ya act shy.

Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips, shake your hips.
Goddamn, I love that shit.
Yo, let's stop fakin and be real now.

I got a room and a hard on. Still down?
Met ya standin at a bar full of black dudes.
Said ya wanna see my scars and my tatooes.

When we head for my hideout, act right.
Boss playa when I ride out, that's right.
What'z ya phone number?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready.

Baby, let me give you a call.
How long will it take to break you off?
(Repeat once more)

Oh shit, baby is a dime piece.
Wanted this fine seat.
??????????????

If I see ya right.
Now she can get me.
Hor didn't wanna talk to me till she see my car.
Never had sez with a rich rap star

Till I got her in the back of my homeboy's car.
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches.
Let me here you say:
What'z your phone number?
Are you alone?

Got a pocket full of rubbers,
let's bone.
Time for your girlfriend to take you home.
I had fun,
But baby, gotta leave me alone.
Picture in my rhyme.
Take time to rewind these ? words I say.
If you open your mind,

Bet in a minute you'll find it's time.
Let the Outlaws play.
What'z ya phone number.
