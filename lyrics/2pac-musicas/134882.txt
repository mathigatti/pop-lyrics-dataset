wanna see me locked in chains 
droped in shame 
and getten socked by these crooked cops and game

and stay away from tha packed jails 
told tha judge i'm in danger 
and that's why I had that 45 with one in tha chamber 
Fuck tha World 

Chorus 
their tryin' ta say that I don't care 
I woke up screamin' fuck tha world 
their tryin' ta say that I don't care 
just woke up and scream fuck tha world 
their tryin' ta say that I don't care 
I woke up and screamed fuck tha world 
their tryin' ta say that I don't care 
Just got up and screamed fuck tha World 
When I was commin up ruff

and run with alcholics

a car full of motherfuckers when we roll 
sippen on that as I sit back

and even when you getten high

cause you could fall off or stay ballin'

Chorus

Damn, they wanna label me a menace 
cause i'm sitten here sippin on Guinness 
weighin' 165 and these tricks should die 
for being jelous of a brotha when he rides
