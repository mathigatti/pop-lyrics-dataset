There's gonna' be some stuff that your gonna' see
That's gonna' make it hard to smile in the future
(No doubt)
But whatever you see, through all the rain and pain
You gotta keep a sense of humor
Gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that
Just keep ya head up


Our lifesytles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairytales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell
Jail and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart of a nigga culture

Or the repercussion
While bustin' on back-stabbing vultures
Sellin' my soul
For material wishes
Fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend
Immortalized in pictures

Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years
Was spend burying my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns
Waiting to breath:
"If you believe
You can achieve, just look at me"

Against all odds
Though life is hard, we carry on
Living in the projects
Broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less but your still precious
Just smile for me now

Smile for me! Won't you smile for me
(2Pac: Just smile for me now)
Just smile for me!
(What cha lookin' all sad for
Nigga you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me
(You ain't got nothin' to worry about)
Won't you smile
(No doubt, smile for me now)
Just smile
(And the next generation)

Now as I open up my story
With the blaze of your blunt
So you can picture thoughts slowly
Up on phrases I run
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I can save everyone
But I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga
Who was strong in the game?

Over-looking his tomorrows
And they finally came
Look back on childhood memories
And I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to
Dealin' cocaine
To many hassels in my local life
Survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus

Life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy
Hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality
We broken and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy
Makin' it big

Over football
He did
And after all my mama's thankin' God
For blessing her child
All my mama gotz to do now is collect
And then smile
Smile for me! Won't you smile for me
(Smile for me now)

Fuck tha world
As we unload, we witness furious speeds
Un-answered questions keep us all stressin'
Curious g's
Back stabed and bleeding
Crooked thoughs
Laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots
Bullets be hot
They burnin'

Inhale the shurm smoke
Visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange wisdoms
Cowards conversate'
So quick to dis' us
Takin' pictures for the feds
In desperate hopes they get us
Hit us all, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my stance
Sense I entered many penitentiaries

The best revenge
Is fuck friends
We milatary minded soljahs
Bustin' shots blindly
Trying to find jahova
To help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed
Hopin' I ain't cursed babies
Maybe now
Niggaz feel me now
Picture my pain
Embrace my words
Make the world change
And still I smile nigga

And now a moment of silence, let's pray
And as your journey into outerspace
May the angels to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'pac
