Hold on, Be strong

I never had much
ran with a bad bunch
little skinny kid sneaking weed in my bag lunch
And off in junior high
we was just getting by
and drive bys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry
even though i had pain in my heart
I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothing
they all tried to help to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I traveled places
caught cases
what a ill year
I felt the pain in the rain
but I'm still here
never did like the police
let the whole world know
now i gets no peace
cause they chasing me down
and facing me now
well do i do these things that a thug goes through?
still i rise
so keep ya head up
and make ya mind strong
Its a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
hold on
be strong
hold on
be strong
when it's on it's on
