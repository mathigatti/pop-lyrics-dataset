Chorus: I wonder if heaven got a ghetto (4X) 
I was raised, the little young nigga doin bad shit 
Talk much shit cause I never had shit 


I could remember being whupped in class 
And if I didn't pass mama whupped my ass 

Was it my fault papa didn't plan it out 
Broke out left me to be the man of the house 

I couldn't take it, had to make a profit 
Down the block, got a glock, and I clock grip 
Makin G's was my mission 

Movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen and 
why must I sock a fella, just to live large like Rockefeller 

First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin now 
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down 
God damn it's a motherfuckin riot 

Black people only hate police so don't try it 
If you're not from the town then don't pass through 
Cause some O.G. fools might blast you 

It ain't right but it's long overdue 
We can't have peace til the niggaz get a piece too 

I want G's so you label me a criminal 
And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto 

Chorus 

Verse Two: 2Pac 
Here on Earth, tell me what's a blick life worth 
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts 
And even when you take the shit 

Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit 
Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many 
more 

It's been goin on for years, there's plenty more 
When they ask me, when will the violence cease? 

When your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street 
Niggaz had enough time to make a difference 
Bear witness, own our own business 

Word to God cause it's hard tryin to make ends meet 
First we couldn't afford shit now everything's free 

so we loot, please don't shoot when you see 
I'm takin from the, cause for years they would take it from me 

Now the tables have turned around 
You didn't listen, until the niggaz burne dit down 
And now Bush can't stop the hit 

Predicted the shit, in 2Pacalypse 
And for once I was down with niggaz, felt good 
in the hood bein around the niggaz, yeah 

And for the first time everybody let go 
And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto 

Chorus 

Verse Three: 2Pac 
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces 
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races 

We under I wonder what it take to make this 
one better place, let's erase the wait state 

Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right 
Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight 

And only time we deal is when we kill each other 
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other 
And though it seems heaven-sent 

We ain't ready, to have a black President, huh 
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact 

The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks 
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself 

Is life worth living should I blast myself 
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black 

My stomach hurts so I'm lookin for a purse to snatch 
Cops give a damn about a ne-gro 

Pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero 
Mo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz 

I'd rather be dead than a po' nigga 
Let the Lord judge the criminals 
If I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto 

Chorus (to :27 from fade) 
Just think, if niggaz decide to retaliate 
(Soldier in the house) 

I wonder if heaven got a ghetto (4X to fade)
