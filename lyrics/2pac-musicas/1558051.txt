1st Verse -

The plan;
to take a command of the whole family;
though underhanded;
to be the man it was planned;
all my roaddogz;
official mob figgaz love to act up;
the first to bomb when we rob niggaz - I can be;
lost in my own mind;
to be the boss only thought's grippin chrome nines;
niggaz get tossed up;
war scars, battlefield memories;
swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of hennessey;
talkin to a nigga on a tight leash;
screamin fuck tha police;
as I ride through the night streets;
little child runnin wild;
towards danger;
what's the cause;
don't be alarmed;
death to all strangers;
maybe I'm a madman;
a pistol grabbin nigga - unleash the sandman;
promise a merciless retaliation;
nothin' is colder;
close your eyes - hear the Ballad Of A Dead Soulja;

Completely lost;

a blind man and a dead body;
I'm ready to leave town;
and get my cash though;
hook up with Kastro;
homie had to blast on the task force;
stupid coppers tried to play us out;

they took my money and my stash;

3rd Verse -

Big coward put your hands to the moon;
when my glocks rang out;
the niggaz came out - boom;
who wanna see me in a challenge?;
so merciless I'm terrifyin' niggaz in my ballads;
do you feel me?;
coppo a copper time;
one day I'll be the don;
until then remain strong;
my only fear of death is reincarnation;
bustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient;
to all my niggaz facin' sixty years;
sheddin' tattoo tears another suicide out on the pier;
takin' private planes tryin' to survive the game;
for all my homies that'll never be alive again;
all they promise us is death nigga;
take a breath - could be the last one left nigga;
it's real now;
feel it and fantasize;
ain't nothin' colder;
listen you could hear it;
the Ballad Of A Dead Soulja;
