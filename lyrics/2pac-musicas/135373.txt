Ah yeah... 
Uhh 
Uhh 


Hollar if Ya Hear me 
Yeah... 
Here we go 
Turn it up 

Let's start 
From block ta block 
We're snatchin' hearts 
And jackin' marks 
And tha punk police can't fade me 

And maybe 
We can have peace someday 'G' 
But right now I got my mind set up 
Lookin down tha barrell of my 9 

Get up 
Cause it's time to make tha pay back phat 
To my brothers on tha block--better stay strapped black 

And accept no substitutes 
I bring truth to tha youth tear tha roof off tha ol' school 

Oh no, I won't turn tha other cheek 
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week 
Now we gotta make it smash 
Blast 

How long will it last, till tha broke get more cash 
Until then 
Raise up! 

Tell my young black males 
Blaze up! 
Lifes a mess don't stress 
Test 

I'm givin ..[????] 
Much love to my brothers in tha pen 
See ya when I free ya 
If not, when they shut me in 

Once again, is there no one else strapped 
Keep ya hands on ya gat 

Now ya boys watch ya back 
Cause in tha alleys of cali i'ma tell ya 
Mess with tha best and tha vest couldn't help ya 

Scream, if ya feel me 
See it clearly? your too near me 

Chorus 
Hollar if Ya Hear me 
Hollar if Ya Hear me 
Hollar if Ya Hear me 

Pump ya fists like this 
Hollar if ya hear me 
(pump, pump) if ya pissed 
To tha sell-outs livin' it up 

One way or another you'll be givin it up 
I guess cause i'm black boy 
I'm supposed to say 'peace', sing songs, and get capped on 
? 

But it's time for tha new plan, BAM! 
I'll be swingin' like a one man clan 

Here we go 
Turn it up 
Don't stop 
To my homies on tha block 
Gettin' dropped by cops 
I'm still around for ya 

Keepin' my sound 
Underground for ya 
And i'ma throw a changup 
Quayle, like you never brought my name up 

Now my homies in tha backstreets 
Tha blackstreets 
They fear me when they rollin in they phat jeeps 

This ain't just a rap song 
A black song 
Tellin all my brothers, get they strap on 

And look for me in tha struggle 
Hustlin' to tha other brotha's bubble 

Chorus 
Hollar if Ya Hear me 
Hollar if Ya Hear me 
Hollar if Ya Hear me 
Will I quit, will I quit? 

They claimin' that i'm violent 
But still I kick 
Representin' 

Never give up on a good thing 
Wouldn't stop it if we could 
It's a hood thing 
And now i'm like a major threat 

'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget 

Bring tha noise 
To all my boyz 
Know tha real from tha bustas 
And the decoys 

And if ya hustle like a real 'G' 
Pump ya fists if ya feel me 
Hollar if Ya Hear me 

Learn to survive in tha nine-tre 
I make crime pay 
I was in crime pay 

Whatever it takes to make a stand 
Cause nobody else'l give a damn 

So we live like caged beasts 
Waitin' for tha day to let tha rage free 
Still me, till they kill me 
I love it when they fear me 
Hollar if Ya Hear me 

Chorus 
Hollar if Ya Hear me 
Hollar if Ya Hear me 
Hollar if Ya Hear me
