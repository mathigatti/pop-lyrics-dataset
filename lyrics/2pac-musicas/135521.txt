Yeah these are my words to my firstborn, you know what time it is, 

these are 

my words to my firstborn, nothing left to hear 

(Tupac) 

Can you picture 

young niggas in the a rush to grow 

the hard times in the pen 

had to crush his throat 

probaly never even saw it coming 

to busy bullshitting 

caught him with his mouth runnin 

ain't that a bitch 

they got me twisted in this game 

the fedz, and the po police pointing pistols at my brain 

I wonder if I'm wrong 

cause I'm thugged out 

my homies murdered execution style 

runnin in the drug house 

what was suppose to be a easy hit 

now shit is flipped 

cause niggas died over bullshit 

It's not my dream 

seeing pictures of a broken man 

no witnesses 

only the question of a smoked man 

young addalicent in the prime live the life of crime 

but what ain't logical 

we hobble through these trying times 

living blind 

Lord help me with my troubled soul 

why all my homiez had to die before they got to grow 

and right before I put my head on the pillow 

I saw a prayer 

one love to the thug's in heaven 

I'll see you there 

It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born 

help me make it threw the storm 

the words to my first born feel me 

My words to my firstborn 

my words to my first born 

(Tupac) 

Since my very first day on this earth 

I was cursed 

so I knew the birth of a child would make my life worst 

though it hurst me 

there was no remorse 

cause wild seeds can't grow 

watch your soul 

cause you know what you had to do 

so the victims of the world came to 

I understand there is a better day coming 

sometimes catching you sleeping on the dead end 

driving with the car running blinded 

ain't no love in the hood 

only hearts torn 

love letters to the unsitting unborn 

all the babies that died up on the table 

wasn't able to breathe 

cause the family wasn't able 

can't blaim I would do the same 

all I could give it was my depth and my last name 

cause in the game things change living up and down 

this hard life got me walking with my head down 

flashing frowns wasn't meant to be 

was I wrong 

but i'll never get to know 

so I carry on 

It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born 

my words to my firstborn, feel me 

my words to my first born 

my niggas Nutso up in this bitch 

these are my words to my firstborn 

(Nutso) 

I'm just another thug nigga trapped in this ghetto life 

an endless hustla 

struggling trying to settle right 

and doing dirt ain't saving me 

but the streets is the only thing paying me, feel me 

running with G's 

stacking G's 

packing E's 

mobb life to these mothafuckas wack me 

stacking greenary 

thugging to I die 

picking up so much J 

I'm getting high 

got the fedz on me 

and they label me a bad grip 

thinking I'm the reason why this nigga got his head through 

on the run 

now daddy got to pack a gun 

cause these niggas want me to make you the last one 

about these riches 

these jealous bitches are going to sell through 

welcome to life 

and if I die 

remember that it is all love when I'm by your side 

every night 

don't be a loser 

choose your dreams through your things 

cause solo to the ho ho will twitch you up 

like shoe strings 

open your eyes 

don't let these haters get you 

roll up and diss you 

my words to my firstborn 

(Tupac) 

words to my mothafuckn seeds, you feel me, nigga doesn't know what's 

going to 

happen until tomorrow and the next day, your fuckn baby can be gone 

tomorrow, 

I already seen it happen, mothafucka got two bullets to his head, he 

no longer 

exists, that's what I'm talking about, what you going to tell your 

kids nigga, 

who was you, what was you doing, how did you put it down, these are my 

words 

to my mothafuckn firstborn, see now you know, know what I mean, ain't 

nothing 

but a mothafuckn rider, westside till I die, that's all it was, these 

crooked 

ass dealing hand mothafucka, just played to win, mothafucka got a bet 

against 

the odds, know what I mean, rolling those mothafuckn dice, sometimes 

you get 7 

or 11, sometimes we crap out, thats a chance a mothafucka takes, cause 

these 

are my words to my mothafuckn firstborn, me and my nigga Nutso, 

represtenting 

the thugs, all over this mothafucka, worlwide, you know what time it 

is, all
