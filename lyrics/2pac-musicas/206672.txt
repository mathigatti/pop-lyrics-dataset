I'm loyal to the game 

[2Pac] 
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast
me? 
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me 
Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these NARC's 
be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart 
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary 
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary 
Now tell me what you need when you see me 
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me 
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know 
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low 
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up 
I'm gettin paid, pullin razors on niggaz when they runnin up 
The first to pull a strap when there's drama - busta you ain't
heard? 
I've been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama 
There ain't a cop that can stop me 
My posse is cock D, and they don't quit until they drop me 
I'm loyal to the game 


[Chorus: 50 Cent] 
I do my thang, respect my hustle, I ain't playin 
-- nigga I'm loyal to the game 
You get in my way and I'll cock and pop that thang 
-- man, I'm loyal to the game 
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin 
-- I'm loyal to the game 
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out yo' brain 

[Young Buck] 
Posessed by the streets, you cain't tell me that this ain't home

I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone 
I'm gettin used to the needles on the bathroom sink 
Gotta close my do' because the backroom stinks 
See daddy don't work and, mama don't drink but 
daddy do dope and, mama can't think so 
Look like, I'ma be the man of the house 
Gotta have somethin to put in her hand when it's out 
Up early in the mornin, the first to get it 
They say if you really want it, then come on with it 
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars 
And I only spend 30 days behind bars 
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid 
I handled any beef that they sent my way 
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change 
It's thug in my veins, I'm loyal to the game 

[Chorus] 

[Lloyd Banks] 
Yeah, it ain't my fault I came up fast 
And you're the name niggaz bring up last 
And all the dames get a king of ass, ten grand on every ring I
flash 
Leap frog, and I'ma have to fling yo' ass 
I'm on the block where it's scorchin hot 
If you get caught in the crossfire, they'll have to peel you off
the block 
I get 'dro by the pickle jar 
These broke niggaz wanna get the star, so I don't keep the
four-nickel far 
My lips are zipped, I'm loyal to the game 
Bring your bitch around me, I'm spoilin her brain 
Leave more slugs to boil in your frame 
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain 
The paint's the same color as oil in the Range 
I'm stingy, ain't got nuttin for you but some change, yeah 
I'm good now but the fact still remains 
that the struggle that I'm from's attached to my name 

[Chorus] 

[2Pac] 
Heh, yeah, 2Pac's in this motherfucker 
G-Unit in the motherfuckin house
