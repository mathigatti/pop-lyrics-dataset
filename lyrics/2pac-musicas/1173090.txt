[Intro: TuPac]
I wont deny it, im a straight rider


[Chorus: Rihanna (TuPac)]
We Ride,When we ride we ride,It's 'til the day that we die
(Here we go, we gon send this one out to the old school)
(all these motherfuckers in the bronx, &amp; brooklyn, &amp; staten island)
We ride, When we ride we ride, It's 'til the day that we die
(Nothin but love for the old school, that what we gon' do this one for ya feel me)

[Verse 1: TuPac]
I see you remiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you - was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share
You're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passion it be yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?

[Chorus: Rihanna (TuPac)]
We Ride (I'm a straight rider) when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Visions in my mind, Of the day that we met
You showed me things, That i'll never forget
Took me swimming, In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Make me feel like I'm floating (yeah)
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses, And my loving
But ain't nobody, Better than us

[Pre-chorus: Rihanna]
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and
I see it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

[Chorus x2: Rihanna (TuPac)]
We Ride (I'm a straight rider) when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
And i remember what you used to say,
When we ride, we ride its till the day that we die

[Verse 3: TuPac]
Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
And checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony
But you was different - I got no need to be suspicious
Cause I can tell - my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
when he ain't lookin, now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care - that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can you get away?

[Chorus x2: Rihanna (TuPac)]
We Ride (I'm a straight rider) when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
And i remember what you used to say,
When we ride, we ride its till the day that we die

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Gonna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises
You made me
And now we'll let the memories
Just fade away
But I remember
What you used to say
(when we ride we ride it's 'til the day that we die)

[Chorus x4: Rihanna (TuPac)]
We Ride (I'm a straight rider) when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
And i remember what you used to say,
When we ride, we ride its till the day that we die

[Outro: Rihanna (TuPac)]
We Ride (I'm a straight rider)
