Makaveli in this killuminati, all through your body
The blows like a 12 guage shotty. Uhh
Feel me
God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild in to the ways of the man.
Follow me
Be my flesh, flesh and my flesh


Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, la la la, la, la, la la

I ain't a killa but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peep the weakness in the rap game and showed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listenin
Seein niggas comin for me, through my diamonds
When they glistenin
Now pay attention
Rest in peace, father
I'm a ghost in these killin fields
Hail mary catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a mad man
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip
Never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corupted
Fuck this shit, stuck
Niggas lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus momma told me never stop
Until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust
It's just as well
Hail Mary

Penitentiary is packed, with promise makers
Never realize the precious time the bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized I live my life a product
Made to crumble
Much to hardened for a smile
Were to crazy to be humble
We ballin catch me, father, please
Cause I'm fallin, in the liquor store
Pass the hennessy I hear ya callin
Can I get some more?
Hail till I reach hell, I ain't scared
Momma checkin in my bedroom I ain't there
I got a head wit no screws in it
What can I do
One life to live but I got nothin to lose
Just me and you
On a one way trip to prison
Sellin drugs we all wrapped up in this livin
Life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max, doin there bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights
I'll be down in the dark
Thuggin eternal through my heart
Now Hail Mary, nigga

Castro

They got an apb out, on my TThug family
Since the outlawz run these streets
Like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down K blasted off Hennessy and Ty
Chronic mixed
Now I'm twisted
Blisted and high
Visions of me thug livin
Gettin' me by forever live
And I multiply survive by thugs
When I die they won't cry
Unless they comin with slugs.

Young Noble

Peep the whole seen, and whatever goin on around me
Brain kinda cloudy
Smoked and out feelin rowdy
Ready wet the party up and
Whoever in that motherfucka
Nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckas on a regula
Mashin in a stolen black ack integera
Cock back sixty seconds
Till the draw that's when I deadin ya
Feet first ya gotta a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin preachin church
I gave you love now you eatin dirt
Needin work and
I ain't the nigga to put you up on, cause word in bond
When I was broke I had to hustle till dawn
That's when sun came up
There's only one way up, hold ya head stay up
To all my nigga's
Get ya pay and wait up

Castro

If it's on then it's on
We rate b-breaks
Outlaws on a paper chase
Can you relate
To this shit I don't got
Be the shit I gotta take
Dealin wit fate
Hoping god don't close the gate.

We've been traveling on this wavy road
Long time life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary

We won't worry everything with corine
We free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry everything with corine
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin from the penitentiary
This is the time for reliberty
Hail Mary, Hail Mary

Westside, Outlawz, Makaveli tha Don, Solo, Killuminati, the 7
