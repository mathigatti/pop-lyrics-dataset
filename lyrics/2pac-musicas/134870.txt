Against all odds, I'm still here nigga 
Aiyyy, I got to get my props for 2Pacalypse 
O.P.D. -- what??! 


When this album come out, niggaz can kiss my ass 
Did you think I'd fall? 
You think you could stop a motherfucker like me? 
Introducing you to my criminal crew 
Treach, A.D., Apache, Essential 

You got to deal with me on a whole new level motherfucker 
Above the Law, Lench Mob, the Underground 
Cause I'm gettin paid 
gets around and we down in this bitch 

And the more you try to keep niggaz away from me 
the more I unite with mo' niggaz and mo' niggaz and mo' niggaz 
Extra special thanks to my nigga Big John Major 

And it's a ghetto in every city and a nigga in every ghetto 
I owe him, thanks to my man Mike Cooley and the rest of out fathers 
Motherfucker we are unstoppable 
And uhh, I'm not goin alive!
