Intro:

To my unborn child
(Ohh)
To my unborn, unborn child
Incase I don't make it
Just remember daddy loves you
To my unborn child
(Ohh)
Did everything I could to make it up for you
Don't worry bout what people sayin
To my unborn
You know daddy loves you



Verse One:

Now ever since my birth
I've been cursed, since I'm born to wil'
Incase I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison
Bless the still livin
Tryin to earn every penny that I'm gettin
And reminiscin
To the beginnin of my mission
When I was conceived, &amp; came to be in this position
My momma was a panther loud
Single parent, but she proud
When she witness baby boy rip a crowd
The school, but I dropped out
And left the house
Cause my momma say I'm good for nothin
So I'm out
Since I only got one life to live
God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again
Or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wanting revenge for the agaony they did to me
See my life ain't promised
But it sure gettin better
Hope you understand my love letter
To my unborn child


Chorus:

Ohh
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
(To My Unborn)
Wanna let you know I love you
(To My Unborn Child)
Love you, but you don't know I feel this way [I feel]
(To My Unborn)
I think about you everyday
I have so much to say
(To My Unborn Child)


Verse Two:

So complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand til' we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty to being anxious
Ain't no way in hell, that I could ever be a rapist
It's hard to face this
Cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot 5 times, but I'm still breathin
Livin proof there's a God, if ya need a reason
And I believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?
Dear Mamma I'ma man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a worldwhind prophesize
I wanna go in peace
When I gotta die
On these cold streets
Ain't no love, no mercy, and no friends
Incase you never see my face again
To My Unborn Child


Chorus:

Ohh
I'm writing you a letter [I'm writing you a letter]
(To My Unborn Child)
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
(To My Unborn Child)
Love you, but you don't know I feel this way [Ohh I Love You]
(To My Unborn Child)
I think about you everyday [everday]
I have so much to say


Verse Three:

Dear Lord, can ya hear me?
Tell me what to say to my unborn seed
In - case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love
Or all we all just cursed to be street thugs
Cause being black hurts
And even worse if you speak first
Livin my life as an outlaw
What could be worse?
Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who I'm kiddin?
I'ma thug, til I die
I'ma ridah man
Touch bases
Eat lunch in plus places
Regular criminal oasis
Awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not being there
Just know your daddy was a soldier
Me against the world
Bless the boys and all my little girls
Tell the Lord I'm eternal
Restin in peace please
Take care of all my seeds
To My Unborn Child


Chorus:

[Ohhhh]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child [to my unborn child]
(To My Unborn Child)
Wanna let you know I love you
(Please take care of all my kids, my unborn child)
Love you, [I Love You] but you don't know I feel this way [How I feel]
(To My Unborn Child)
I think about you everyday
I have so much to say

Pac Over Repeated Chorus:

This Letter Goes Out To
Born seeds that I might not get to see
Cause of this lifestyle
Just know your daddy loved you
Got nothing but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I did
Cause I was out here on a 24 hour, 365 grind
When you get to be my age, you'll understand
Just know I got love for ya
And I see that there's a ghetto up in heaven
There's a ghetto heaven and I'ma be there
Ha, Take care, Run wild, Be Smart
Follow the rules of the game
Maybe sometimes it's confusin
But the rules of the game is gonna get you through it
All day, everyday
Watch out for these saints and fakes
First comin down to death
Be an individual, Work hard, study
Get your mind straight, trust nobody
