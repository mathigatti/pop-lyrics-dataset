Damn...another funeral, another mothafucken' funeral 

Chorus 
Lord Knows 
Lord Knows 
Lord Knows 


I smoke a bunt ta take tha pain out 
and if I wasn't high, probably try and blow my brains out 
i'm hopeless 

they shoulda tried to kill me as a baby 
but, now they got me trapped in tha storm, i'm goin crazy 
forgive me 

they wanna see me in my casket 
and if I don't blast i'll be a victim of tha bastards 
i'm loosing hope, they got me stressen, can tha Lord forgive me 

got tha spirit of a thug in me 
another sip of that drink, this hennesee got me queaze 
don't wanna hurl, young nigga take it easy 

picture your dreams on a triple beam 
and it seems 
don't underestimate tha power of a feind 

to tha homies on tha block 
slangin' rocks with ya glocks put this tape in your box 
when your runnin' from tha cops 

and never look back 
if they could be black 
then they would switch 

open fire on those busta-ass bitches 
and Lord Knows... 

Chorus 
Lord Knows 
Lord Knows 
Lord Knows 

I wonder if tha Lord will forgive me 
or bury me a 'G' 
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me 
and every single day it's a 
test 

wear a bullet-proof vest 
and still a nigga stressen over death 
If I could choose when a nigga die 

figure I, take a puff on tha blunt 
and let my trigga fly 
when everyday is another death 

with every breath, it's a constant threat 
so watch your step 
you could be next if ya want to 

who do ya run to? 
murderin niggas, look what it's come to 
my memories bring me misory 
and life is hard in tha 

ghetto, it's insanity 
I can't breath got me thinkin', what do hell got? 
cause I done suffered so much, i'm feelin' shell shocked 

and drive-by's are an everyday thang 
I already lost to many homies to this mothafucken' game 
and Lord Knows.... 

Chorus 
Lord Knows 
Lord Knows 
Lord Knows 

Fuck tha Five-o cause they after me 
kill me if they could 
I'll never lett'em capture me 

I lost too many niggas to this gangbangin' 
Homie dies in my arms, with his brains hangin' 
fucked up! 

I had to tell him it was alright 
and that's a lie, and he knew it when he shock and died 
my God 

even though I know i'm wrong man 
Hennesee make a nigga think he strong, man 

I cant sleep, so I stay up 
don't wanna 
fuck them bitches, try to clam me down 
I ain't given up 

i'm getten lost in tha weed, man 
gettin high 
livin' everday, like i'm gonna die (gonna die, gonna die) 

I smoke a blunt to take tha pain out 
and if I wasn't high 
probably try ta blow my brains out 

Lord Knows.... 
Lord Knows 
Lord Knows.....
