They finally did it (what's that?) They stole the mic I grip
Now that it's gone (what's wrong?) I'm feelin' tired and sick
(How did they do it?) I don't know I wasn't sleepin' that long
When I woke up (what happened brother?) 
My microphone was gone
At first i panicked (how?) I put the cops on the case
But they were stuck (damm?) Without a clue or a trace
So sure as smokin' cigarettes is bad for your health
If I want my microphone back I'll find it myself
So I picked up the phone (for what?) 
I called Dizzy
Dizzy: what's up? 
My mic is gone
Dizzy: Word? 
Let's get busy
Before I could tell Dizzy What I wanted to do
He was over at my house with the TMS crew
He said
Dizzy: Word is out in every mouth
In the street now that your mic is gone
It's not long yill your beatAnd then it hit me (Damm) 
I got a battle at six
Without my microphone I'm guaranteed to get whipped
U might think it's unbelivable But word to the strenght
when it comes to rockin' rhymes I'm a musical nymph
They gave me other mics But yo it wasn't no use
I tried to rock One two one two
But I couldn't get loose I said forget it
My microphone or not I gotta do it
Give it all that I go (What if u loose?) It be the first time I lost
But if I beat â€˜em I'll finally prove I'm the boss
I grabbed my leather jacket Walked through the streets
Suckers was hopin' and preyin Strictly Dope would get beat
I begin to get hyped I was ready to fight
Yo I was confident that I'd win
To hell with the mic
I hopped up to the stage Dizzy started the beat
suckers shivered cause he Tasted defeat
Then I signaled to Dizzy Bust a rhyme off my head
Perpetrator fell back (Huh?) And then he was dead
I was happy as hell Cause I was lucky that nite
Put my hand in my pocket And there was my mic
THE CASE OF THE MISPLACED MIC
STRICTLY DOPE IN THE HOUSE
