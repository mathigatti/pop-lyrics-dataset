I ain't saying I'm innocent of all this
I'm just saying
This song is for y'all
For all the times I mess up
when we mess up


Dear sister
Got me twisted up in prison
I miss yah
Crying
Looking at my nieces and nephews picture
They say don't let this cruel world get yah
Kinda suspicious,
Swearing one day you might leave me
for someone that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle
I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make if I have to Beg and Borrow
Reading love letters
late night, locked down, and quiet
If brothers don't receive their mail
Best believe we riot
Eating Jack mat
Staring at walls of Silence
Inside this cage
Where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons
Never fall for riches
Apologizies to my TRUE sisters
Far from bitches
Help me raise my black nation
Reperations are due
Its true
Caught up in this world
I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them
Precious boys and girls
Born black in this white mans world
and all I heard was

[Chorus]

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That You're not alone

Being born with less
I must confess
Only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homies head
Died in his rest
Shot him to death
and Left him bleeding for his family to see
I pass his casket
Gently asking
Is there heaven for G's?
My homeboys doing life
Baby mama be stressing
Shedding tears
When her son finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at?
Mama, Why we live so poor?
Why you crying?
Heard you late night
Throught my bedroom door
Now do you love me mama?
Why do they keep calling me nigger?
Get my wieght up, with my hate
and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
Still thugging in this jail cell
Missing my block
Hearing brothers screaming all night
Wishing they'd stop
Proud to be black
But why do we act like
We don't love ourselves
Don't look around
busta (you sucka)
Check yourselves
know what if means to be black
whether a man or girl
we're still struggling in this
White man's world

[Chorus]

(we must fight) 
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That You're not alone

So tell me why you changed
Choosing new direction
In a blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection
You think I'd die
Not gonna cry
Why should I care
Like we holding on to love
Thats no longer there
Can you please help me
God Bless me please 
Keep my seeds healthy
Making all my enemies Bleed
While my G's healthy
Hoping they bury me
With ammunition, weed, and shells
Just in case they trip in heaven
Ain't no G's hell
Sister sorry for the pain
That I caused your heart
I know I'll change 
If yah help me
But Don't fall apart
Rest In Peace
To Latasha, Little Yummy, and Kato
To much for this cold world to take
Ended up being fatal
Every women in America
Especially Black
Bear with me, can't you see
We're under attack
I never meant to cause drama
To my sister and Mama
Will we make it
To better times

In this white man worlds

[Chorus]

[Along with revolutionary talking]
