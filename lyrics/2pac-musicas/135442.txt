Dan Quayle, don't you know you need to get your ass kicked 

Where was you when there was niggas in the caskets? 
Mutha-fucker rednecks all the same 

Feel a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained 
That's why we burn shit and wreck 

Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet 
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price 

Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life 
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead 

Dred, jheri curl, process, or bald head 
Be prepared for the smoke to bust 

What niggas need to do is start loc'in up 
United we stand divided we fall 

They can shoot one nigga 
But they can't take us alll 
Let's get along with the Mexicans 

And we can all have peace on the sets again 
Imagine that if it took place [ha ha ha] 
Keeping the smile off their white fakes 
I ain't racist but lets trade places 

Trace the hate 'n face it 
One nigga teach two niggas 
three teach four niggas 
And them niggas teach more niggas 

And when we blast 
That'll be the biggest blast you've heard 
And them is my last wordz
