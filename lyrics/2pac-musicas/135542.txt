Verse 1 
The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out 
stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out 


Pray to my God everyday but he don't listen 
the poverty bothers me but mama's working wonders in the kitchen 

Listen I can hear her crying in the bedroom 
praying for money we never think would she be dead soon 
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else 

at 13 can't feed myself 
Can I blame daddy 'cause he left me 
wish he would've helped me 
too much like him 'til my mama don't love me 

On my own at a early age gettin' paid 
and I'm strapped so I'll never be afraid 

Where did I go astray I'm hanging in the back streets 
running with G's and dope fiends will they jack me? 

Can't turn back my eyes on the prize 
I got nothing to lose 
everybody gotta die 
say good-bye to the bad guy 
that one you fucked when you passed by 

Buck buck (gunshots) from a Glock 
tempured glass fly 

Do or Die walk a mile in my shoes 
and you'd be crazy too 
with nothing to lose 

Chorus 

I got nothing to lose 
(that's why I got gang related) 
got nothing to lose 5x 
nothing to lose 

Verse 2 
I thank the Lord for my many blessings 
though I'm stressin' keep a 

vest for protection 
from the barrel of the Smith &amp; Wesson 
and all my niggas in the pen' 
here we go again 

Ain't nothing seperating us from a mack 10 
Born in the ghetto as a hustla older 

straight soldier bucking at them bustas 
No matter how you try niggas never die 

We just retaliate with hate then we multiply 
see me striking down the 

block hittin' co'ners 
Mobbin' like a muthafucka livin' like I wanna 

Ain't no stoppin' at the red lights I'm sideways 
Thug Life muthafucka criiime pays 

Let the cops put they lights on 
chase me nigga 
zig-zaggin' through the freeway 
race me nigga 

In a high speed chase with the law 
the realest muthafucka that you ever saw 

I'm livin' raw 'til they bury me don't worry me 
I'm high livin' like I ain't afraid to die 

And you could walk a mile in my shoes 
and you'd be crazy too 

Chorus 

Verse 3 
Ain't no escape from a deadly fate 
and everyday there's a million black bodies put away 

I'm startin' to lose hope 
it seems everybody's on dope 
Mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke 

Sometimes I choke on the indo 
peepin' out the window alone on my own 
I'm a criminal 

Got no love from the household I'm out cold 
in the streets give me muthafucking peace 

I got nothing to lose 
and something to prove 
What do I do live Thug Life nigga stay true 

I wonder when they kill me 
is there a Heaven for a real G 
Lord forgive me if you feel me 

'Cause all my life I was dirt broke 

with no hope li'l skinny muthafucka wantin' dough 
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade 

but everyday it's a struggle to get major paid 
Anyway it's so hard on a nigga in this city 

no pity and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin' time 

If you could walk a mile in my shoes you'd be crazy too 
with nothing to lose 

Chorus 

Outro 
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga 
We be the craziest...Muthafucka! 

You know! 
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga 
We be the craziest!
