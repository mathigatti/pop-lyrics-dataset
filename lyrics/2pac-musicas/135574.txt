[Dee tha Mad Bitch] 
What goes on in the mind of a bad boy? Nothin but payback 
Whos next, the clip, callin murder could nothin the contract 
Better watch your back 
Since hes makin that comeback 
The 1-87 will stop em 
The hollow point, will drop ya 


Go on, heres a scene for your soul 
So take heed when you meet face-to-face, here comes the grim reaper 
You better ???? from the depths of hell 
Hes a real McCoy 
But aint no stoppin this girl is bad boy 

He aint no joke 
Muthafucka grab your throat 
Before you find yourself cut with a blade 
As your bloody body lays on top of cement 
In front of your president 
It was a murder for hire 

Hit an innocent child in the crossfire 
Now hes confined to a jail 
Got shot six times, in his spine 
But his mind is still down at the grind 
Hes willin to destroy 
Thats what he lives for, to be a bad boy 

Chorus: 
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, watcha gonna do? 
Watcha gonna do, watch out, we commin at you. 
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, watcha gonna do? 
Watcha gonna do, were comin after you 

Bad Boy, Bad Boy, watcha gonna do? 
Watcha gonna do, watch out, we comin at you 
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, watcha gonna do? 
Watcha gonna do, watch out, we comin at you

I got these bustas on my block and they after me 
Runnin round tellin these niggas, how they gonna capture me 
Its gettin crazy, its hard to make my mind up 
Now should I, buck em down, or put my nine up? 

You see, I aint a bad boy, just a boy who had it bad 
I graduated from 22s to 3-57 mags 
Runnin on these marks fore they stashin 
I aint askin, give it up, or get to blastin 
The penintnetiary dont scare me 

A straight thug nigga, the whole setll take care of me 
And tell me, who the fuck you gonna find 
Rough enough to tear these bitch-niggas, this is mine 
Now busta, meet my nine, 24 on the grind 
Im sick about mine, and uh, aint nothin wrong with gettin high 

A hustlin-ass nigga from the projects, Im makin loot 
And screamin Thug Life, nigga, when they shoot 
They made me a..... 
[Chorus] 
[Dee tha Mad Bitch] 

Now how many bad boys in the house 
So hurry boys got the biggest nuts 
What the fuck, I gave em the blunts 
Havin a grudge against the whole fuckin world 
A 16 shot-block-glock, thatll stop em 

Theyre sure to hit the ground 
Nothin, bustin a cap on no more every round 
A bad boy is the big, shot on the block 
He got knots, bigger rocks for the cops 
Before he gets props 

So you petty boys, you cant fuck with em 
You can eat the biggies good friend 
Or become a victim of a dead man 
Its sad to see, when you end up six-feet deep 

So rest in peace, muthafucka, join the pow 
he got nothin but the realest style 
Flavors when on the mic 
and packin the meal like life 
Savers, sweep up on you at night 
His grip on tight, and make you take a bite 
Thats all she wrote, barrel went down your throat 

Killin off these niggas for fun 
Murder one, and throw away your gun 
Hes livin his life like a soldier 
Thats what he lives for, to be a Bad Boy 
[Chorus]
