Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's getting crazy after dark, these narc's
Be like trying to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been moving these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stacking g's, buying all the things on tv, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still coming up
I'm getting paid, pulling razors on niggas when they running up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama - busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicing motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game


Prince of peace must hear our plea
Told life you'd be back
There you were
Prince of peace must hear our plea
Everybody look around
There is no hope
Prince of peace must hear our plea
Brothers we better get hip

[Big Syke]
My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggas swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my caddy
And I'm steady catching static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in cali niggas rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with baking soda and get the water to boil
Oh no can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggas feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yelling that he telling get to me, no surprise, nigga

Prince of peace must hear our plea
Told life you'd be back
There you were
Prince of peace must hear our plea
Everybody look around
There is no hope
Prince of peace must hear our plea
Brothers we better get hip

And come off this trip

[DJ Quik]
Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
Enemies in my family extorting scheming and scamming me (pop pop)
I'm like bruce nolan, I'm rollin' until the diesel hit me
I'm battered and bruised, and madder having to choose
'Tween happiness and the blues, and who be filling my shoes
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rapping I'm talking cool, and columbine is not new
In compton they shoot up schools too, riding by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no coming back
From him scrapping when niggas was packing and he wasn't packing too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em

Prince of peace must hear our plea
Told life you'd be back
There you were
Prince of peace must hear our plea
Everybody look around
There is no hope
Prince of peace must hear our plea
Brothers we better get hip

Thugs throw like wine down a nigga's throat
If this shit don't stop stop stop stop stop!
