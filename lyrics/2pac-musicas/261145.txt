Tupac: 

I lay awake tonite
Because I wanna be with u
If u were beside me I'd playfully kiss u
Each time I see u the feeling gets stronger
U sit with me closer we stare a lot longer
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words r muttered I stutter
Cause I want u taht much
The situation is a no win
Cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty
I'm fallin' for his girlfriend
I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
It's like a trap that I'm sinkin' into
I wake up sweaty when i'm thinkin' of u
Then we make our contact
And I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feeling comes right back
What have i gotten into
I feel possessed by u
I have these thought at nite of undressin' u
It's kinda obvious blind men might see
But he doesn't so he keps on trustin me
Leaves me alone with u when he's on vacation
But how could he leave me with this temptation
What do I do go or stay and play it smart
It's gettin' rougher cause I suffer from a burnin' heart
My burnin' heart


Ray: 

Girl u r my one and only
U r my angel and now u wanna leave me lonely
What did I do baby did I treat u bad? 
My heart is broken and now u wanna make me sad
I remember when this love affair first started
We were so in love and now we are departed
Girl I'll buy anything your heart desires
I have to let u know baby your my fire
Warm and wet each kiss I prolonged
It's your sweet caress that makes life too strong
Just being with u and see the two of us
Walking along the beach u know u r my peach
So sweet and my love i surrender
No need to pretend that u want it to end
I'll neva let u go your foreva my girl
U know why? 
Cause girl u r my world
My burnin' heart

Tupac: 

Totally tongue tied every few seconds I keep watchin' u
He's my best friend but I can't help clockin' u
How could this be how could we both love u
Now I'm trapped in this position and don't know whta to do
I could forget about u pretend taht we neva met
But when I hear bout u i start to heavily sweat
U give me looks to reinforce thoughts
That r already there
So many times my eyes r caught up in a passanger stare
Play the role like u don't matter
He swears taht we hate eachotha
Your my addiction cause I fiend for u desperately
Stand here fantasizing cause you're next to me
What can I do with this passion I feel
It's too hard to conceal so I know it's for real
Watched u so many times where every curve is
I think he reads my mind so I'm feelin nervous
I wanna tell u how i feel but that wouldn't help
I would only cause problems so I keep to myself
It drives me crazy to see u sittin' with him
A tear goes down my cheek because I see u kiss him
I know the words ya sayin' b4 they could be said
Hear the thoughts you're thinkin' b4 they come into your head
Wouldn't hurt the bratha for anything in this world
But damm I feel in love with his girl
My burnin' heart

Ray: 

My heart is burnin' u know it's yearnin'
For your sweet caress
I lay in exstacy as u kiss and rub my chest
U know u love me why must u deny yourself? 
What I could offer u yet u want somebody else
It's not taht girl well then girl what could it be
I hope I'm good for u cause girl you're good for me
Many nites I cried and tried to make this work
Then act a fool and croon the cruel like a jerk
Well I'm sorry baby i have to let u know
U r my life my strenght I refuse to let u go
U r so fruitful baby u light up my life
I close my eyes and dream that you'd become my wife
Day in and day out it's u I pray about
Don't lock the door to your heart don't make me stay out
I love u honey cause you're like a work of art
You've got me on fire My burnin' heart
Repeat first verse
