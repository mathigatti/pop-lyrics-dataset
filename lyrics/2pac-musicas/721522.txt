Haha
Thug for life nigga
Can't you read the signs?


(Whatchu doin?) Mobbin' like a motherfucker stuck
Can you put your middle finger out the window
gettin' fucked off - liquor
Get loaded can't control it
Nigga pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bones act to the whole stack
That's fo sho black
To be a mack and keep your dough fat
And tell me what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce and bounced to a key
You gotta watch your back stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young muthafucka doin' dirt
And now I'm in the rap game like the crack game
I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug muthafuckas wanna have fun
Stuck it, buckin' my muthafuckin magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus
Bust, shots at my adversaries
Dem niggaz scary best it's time to be buried
Cause I'll be buckin' in a fuckin hurry

Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Shootin' crooked ass cops let me fry
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me
Thug for life

Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert E's make MC's freeze
You wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apologizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
Realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
Our beef is my fiance, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
My first LP, beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
Collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin promos
Break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shine to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need four mo'

Thugs for life, high til i die
When them stupid ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

[Tupac]
Game thicker than most of these tricks
I got my mind on makin' money but you stuck on these fake, bitches
And jealous motherfuckers can't see
That's it's the fame that causes these stupid bitches pass the pussy free
So tell me why you sweat a motherfucker like me
A young nigga tryin' to hustle up some G's
You pussy-ass playa hatin' hoes
Freakin' down on niggas, jumpin' around at the shows
And you the first motherfucker to jump
To the trunk when it's time for funk, little trick-ass punk
Thug motherfuckers don't die
We get high and we multiply, motherfucker
Give a holla to my niggas in the Bay
I'm livin' in L.A., still clutchin' on my AK
Rest in Peace to my nigga Kato
til they bury me, nigga lay low
Thugs for Life

Thugs for life, high til i die
When them stupid ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

[Tupac]
