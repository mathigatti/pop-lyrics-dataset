[Tupac]

Love tha way you activate your hips
and push your ass out
gotta nigga wantin'
it's so bad
i'm about to pass out
wanna dig you
and I can't even lie about it
baby just eleviate your cloths
time to fly up out it
catch you at a club
oh shit, you got me fiendin'
body talken shit to me
but I can't comprehend the meaning
now if ya wanna roll with me
then here's ya chance
doin 80 on tha freeway
wait police, catch me if they can
forgive me i'm a ridah
still i'm just a simple man
all I want is money
fuck tha fame
i'm a simple man
Mr. International
Playa with tha passport
just like a ladder bitch
get you anything you ask for
it's either him or me
champagne, Hennessy
a favorite of my homies
when we floss on our enemies
witness as we creep to a low speed
peep what a ho need
puff some more weed
funk, ya don't need
approachin' hochies with a passion
been a long day
but i've been drivin' by attraction
in a strong way
your body is bangin'
baby I love it when ya flaunt it
time to give it to daddy nigga
now tell me how you want it...

[Tupac]

Tell me is it cool to fuck ?
you think I come to talk
am I a fool or what ?
positions on tha floor
it's like erotic
ironic
cause i'm somewhat psychotic
i'm hitten' switches on bitches
like i been fixed with hydraulics
up and down like a roller coaster
come up beside ya
I ain't quitin' till tha show is over
cause i'm a ridah
in and out just like a robbery
i'll probably be a freak
and let you get ontop of me
get her rockin' these
nights full of Alazhay
a livin' legend
you ain't heard about these niggas played in cali days
Deloris Tucker
you's a muthafucker
instead of tryin' to help a nigga
you destroy a brotha
worst than tha others
Bill Clinton
Mr. Bob Dole
You too old to understand tha way tha game is told
your lame
so I gotta hit you with tha high facts
won't someone listen ?
makin' millions
niggas top that
they wanna censor me
they ratha see me in a cell
livin' in hell
with only a few of us to live to tell
now everybody talken about us
I could give a fuck
I'd be tha first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga tell me how you want it...

[Tupac]

Raised as a youth
tell truth
I got tha scoop on how to get a bulletproof
cause I jump on tha roof
before I was a teenager
mobile phone
Skypager
game rules
i'm livin' major
my adversaries
is lookin' worried
they paranoid of getten' buried
one of us gonna see tha cemetary
My only hope is survive
If I wish to stay alive
getten' high
see tha demons in my eyes
before I die
I wanna live my life and ball
make a couple million
and then i'm chillin'
fade'm all
these taxs for me crossed up
with people tryin' ta sue me
media is in my business
and they actin' like they know me
but i'ma mash out
peel out
i'm murder quick
that's with the whip'n fucken steel out
yeah nigga, it's some new shit
so better get up on it
When ya see me
tell a nigga how ya want it
How do you want it ?
