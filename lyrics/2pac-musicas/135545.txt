"Alright now, here we go" 

Verse One: 2Pac 
Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt 
and freak the funk until 


these jealous motherfuckers kill me 
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero 
I'm 165 and staying high til I die, my competion's zero 

Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck 
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck 
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me? 
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me 

Niggaz know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure 
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser 
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born 
I don't want no shit but niggaz trip and yo it's on 

Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry 
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried 
It's a man's world, niggaz get played, another stray 
Hope I live to see another day, hey 

I'm getting sweated by these undercovers, who can I trust? 
Got my mama stressin thinkin it's a drug bust 
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached 
We living a Drug Life, Thug Life, each day could be my last 
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask 
That's the consequences when ya livin, fast 

Six bricks of tricks, for my niggaz, I gotta come up 
and recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures 
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover 
over the fence and open fire 
"Alright now, here we go" 
Verse Two: 2Pac 
These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic? 

I'm comin round the corner like I'm Magic 
Doin ninety on the freeway, and hittin switches 
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches 
Don't turn around I ain't givin up, cause they don't worry me 

Pussy ass bitches better bury me 
Runnin outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot 
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha 
I got away cause I'm clever 
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together 

I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin loogies 
at the coppers that persue me, beotch! 
I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker 
Open fire on you bustas 
"Alright now, here we go" 
Verse Three: 2Pac 
Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state 

I gotta pay my fuckin bills, so I'm transportin weight 
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin 
Droppin keys like they stolen, hehe 
Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear 

Enough dope to last a year 
They got me running from the police, nowhere to go 
With the lights out, rollin down a dirt road 
But I ain't goin alive, I'd rather die than be a convict 

I'd rather fire on my target 
I hit the corner doing ninety, ahhhh shit! 
Them bitches right behind me 
They take a shot and hit my fuckin tires 

Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka! 
Hahahaha, Thug Life!
