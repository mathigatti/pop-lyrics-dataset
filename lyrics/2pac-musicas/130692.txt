When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back in the time, never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that can take my mama's place
Suspended from school
Scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breaking all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I see the penitentiary, one day
Running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me put a whoppin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed, a poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated


Lady, don't cha know we love ya
Sweet Laaady, place no one above ya
Sweet Laaady, don't cha know we love ya

Ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the thug's and even thought they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good, putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low, you was there for me
Ya never left me alone, cause you cared for me
And I can see you coming home after work late
You in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
Just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
Trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady, don't cha know we love ya
Sweet Laaady, place no one above ya
Sweet Laaady, don't cha know we love ya

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
Ya never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle everyday, you gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady, don't cha know we love ya
Sweet Laaady, place no one above ya
Sweet Laaady, don't cha know we love ya
Sweet Lady

Lady
Lady
Lady
