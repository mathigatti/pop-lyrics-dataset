Now of course I want peace on the streets
But realistically
Painting perfect pictures ain't never work
My misery was so deep
Couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash
I learned fast
Using violent measures
Memories of adolescent years
Their was unity
But after puberty we brought war
To our community
So many bodies dropping
Its gotta stop
I want to help
But still I'm stepping
Keeping my weapon
Must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow
ain't never reach me
Plus my teachers were to petrified in class to teach me
Sipping thunderbird
And grape kool-aid
Calling Earl since my stomach was empty
It seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my 'lil homies
Lose there childhood to guns
Nobody cries no more
Cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace
If you cant grant it
Niggas fighting across the whole planet
So we can never be peace


[Chorus]

Will there ever be peace?
Or all we all just headed for doom,
Still consumed by the beefs,
And I know there never be peace,
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there can never be peace

[Verse 2: Kastro]

Somebody owes me
Will they control me?, nah
I ain't a hater playa
But I want all you got
Your babies have babies
Now we fighting each other
My dogs got rabies
They biting each other
'n' it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
Big fully is a bully
And he don't mind dying
And I gotta be bright
Miss sign after sign
Time after time
After time after time
And I don't like nobody
They don't like me more
And I'm cool with that finally
But they heard it before
Dog
We living in a prison
Losing our religion on em
Thanks given when thankful just for living in hell
Damn homey I don't mean to be harsh
But it's the devil in the ghetto trying to tear it apart
And if we make it up out
We still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace?
Just the peace in my heart
Never

[Kastro talking]
The only peace we got
Is the peace in our heart
Or the peace in our mind
Right there in piece that we hold in our waste line
Feel me dog?
Cm'on

[Chorus]

Will there ever be peace?
Or all we all just headed for doom,
Still consumed by the beefs,
And I know there never be peace, (never)
Thats why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Coz there can never be peace

[Verse 3: Napolean]

Things are changing
Nigga you better fantasize
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times
The world is a ghetto where peace is not a part of it
We all goin' need God if we plan to get out of this
Niggas spending too much time hating on each other
Niggas buyin' guns
Load em up
Aim at each other
And the victim is you and me
The secret is true indeed
The good die
Mostly over bullshit
Repeatedly
Deep in me there's a part that wants nothing but love
But the rest of me knows war is what's waiting for us
So I stays ready
Keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns
Never rely on luck
Asking God to point out the imposters
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
Cause they'll never be peace
So don't rely on it
Soldiers die for
And in the ghetto, they trying for it
FUCK PEACE

[Chorus X3]

Will there ever be peace?
Or all we all just headed for doom,
Still consumed by the beefs,
And I know there never be peace,
That's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets
Cause there can never be peace

[Tupac Talking]

Shit, fuck peace
On the strength till my niggas get a piece
We cant have peace
How the fuck we gonna live happy if we ain't got none?
You motherfuckers is smiling, but I'm mean mugging
Why? Cause gotta be thugging
I've seen drugs done turned this motherfucking hood out
All us niggas acting up
Wild ass motherfucking adolescents
These niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood and you have a funeral every motherfucking weekend
And you motherfuckers talking about peace?
Nigga, it ain't no motherfucking peace
You ain't seen the news motherfucker?
You ain't heard?
Little babies getting smoked
Motherfuckers killing there whole family
'Lil kids getting thrown off buildings
Motherfuckers gettin abused
Peace? Niggas you out your motherfucking mind?
Fuck peace
We can't never have peace, till you motherfuckers clean up this mess you made
'Till u fucking clean up the dirt u dropped
'Till we get a piece
Fuck peace
Westside
