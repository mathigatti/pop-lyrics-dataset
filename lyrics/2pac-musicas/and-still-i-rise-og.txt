Verse 1 [2Pac]

Somebody wake me I'm dreamin,
I started as a seed the semen
Swimmin upstream, planted in the womb while screamin
on the top, was my pops, my momma screamin stop
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, a product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me askin white Jesus
will a nigga live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
in the deep, dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine

No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, I'm tryin to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody
and they pops tryin to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks, glocks or a heroin bong
You can ask my man he's a mind reader
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetary
then get smoked out, pass the weed nigga
That Hennessey'll keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggaz holla at me, "Keep it real G"
And my reply til they kill me
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise

Chorus [2Pac &amp; Big Syke]
Ninety-six big body
Sittin' on chrome
( And still I rise )

Verse 2 [Khadafi]

I stay sharp as always
Runnin ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways
Dumpin crews like two's, nigga all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seems though,
Be placin triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinky ring got the loot poppin out my jeans

Verse 3 [Fatal]

Dynamically this dude or twist this shit ceramically
Able to write a Fatal verse with no profanity
It's on for Al G. Nikko Storm and Nasty New
Put a hole in your crew, tryin' to pass me
With no remorse
You get blasted full force
A Nike endorsement doin' shootings on a horse
World wide supremacy
All y'all remember me
Hung over from Hennessey
With a menace intendancy
Police be clockin' me
So I be dippin' Slippin' sloppily
Sippin' Vodka B
And ditchin' clips On private property
When five O be comin'
Niggas be runnin'
For they life and freedom
the type to beat 'em here engagin'
Breakin' and try to lead 'em
Two big terriers
Monclair gettin scarier
They nine's they shoot 'em in secluded areas
The barrier, Not me
I'm burried 'em once they ditched they in Scott-free
Two tass Harass my ass
Tried to have the F Lofty
My nigga fell
Givin a whole essance county trigger hell
Runnin' the fuckin' block and duckin' cops tryin' to get a bail

Verse 3 [Khadafi]
In ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blastin bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin jeans poppin
Leavin ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggaz is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker
and still I rise, and still I rise...
