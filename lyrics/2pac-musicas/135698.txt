Power.. pow.. power... 
Guess who's back? Hahaha, here we go 
It's ninety-fo', what's next? 


Power.. enter my world 
I guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggaz 
I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power 
It ain't all good in the hood 
Least not on my side, from where I stand 
And the law? Man, fuck the law! 

Niggaz must outthink, outstep, and continue to outsmart 
the motherfuckin law, in every way 
Key word in ninety-four is 'down low' 
Gots to be struggling 
I see how the rich got theirs 

Nigga I'm legit, shit 
Where do we go from here? 
(Who's afraid, of the punk police? 
To my niggaz run the streets, fuck peace) --&gt; repeat in background 
Heyyy niggaz, where your heart at? 
See motherfuckers killin babies, killin mommas 

Killin kids, puttin this in 
they motherfuckin mark 
Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race 
before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire? 
These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns 
Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs 
And they wonder why we loc'n up 

Where do we go from here? 
Where do we go? 
*singers singing variations of 'Where do we go from here'* 
All you niggaz out there 
The clouds shook, the world listened 
We stood together in April of ninety-two 

With duty, and a sense of honor 
There is no limit to what WE can achieve 
That's all on us... us... 
Not my niggaz, not the whites, not the enemies 
or none of them motherfuckers, US 

What can WE do? Shit 
I declare a death sentence to all child molestors 
Fake-ass bitches, male and female 
And all you punk-ass snitches 
We can do without your asshole 

Let no man break, what we set 
Where do we go from here? 
Rest in peace, to Cato, I miss you 
All the other real G's that passed away in ninety-three 
In ninety-four, and more 
What do we do? For us?
