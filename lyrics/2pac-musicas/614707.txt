Yes indeed - it's the mix king - Ron G
I got somethin - the world - ain't ready for
New York City - L.A. - Chicago - Atlanta
D.C. - Detroit - New Orleans, y'all know the deal
FLAVA!!!!

Hahahahahaha! Yeah nigga!
Yeah...that's right.. BAYY-BAYY!
That's how we do it

Follow me tell me if you feel me
I think niggaz is tryin to kill me
Picturin pistols, spittin hollow points til they drill me
Keepin it real, and even if I do conceal
my criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin steel
See niggaz is false, sittin in court, turned snitches
that used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryin to be strong, they sendin armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world til I'm gone
Bitches be warned, word is born you'll get torn
I'm bustin on Guiliani, he rubbin my niggaz wrong
And then it's on, before I leave picture me
I'm spittin at punk bitches and hustlin to be free
Watch me set it, niggaz don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggaz mad I said it
This' Thug Life nigga we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do',
with fo'-fo's.. 
hahahahaha, yeah nigga!
Thug Life!...

[Big L]
I be that young Freddie Fly smooth glorious kid
A Bad Boy, just like Notorious B.I.G.
A Roc-a-Fella like Shawn Carter
with more game than Ron Harper
The bomb sparker rapper slash charm robber
While y'all be on the corners bummy and high
I be out buyin the finest shit money can buy
You wish you was in a position that I'm in-ac
