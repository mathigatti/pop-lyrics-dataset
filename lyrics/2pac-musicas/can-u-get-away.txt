(Conversation between Pac and female)

[Tupac] Wussup, it's Tupac, can u get away?
let me come sooth you up



[Female] You know I gotta man.


[Tupac] I know you gotta man,
but he won't mind if I take you out


[Female] of course, he gonna mind.


[Tupac] let me take you to lunch, i'll have ya back before
he even get home, before anybody see


[Female] I can't.


[Tupac] aww Come on,


[Female] He won't let me.


[Tupac] Pleeeease....


[Female] naw


[Tupac] aight, what's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?


Ever since I met ya
I can't beat tha pressure
it's like your man don't understand
all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery
from tha introduction
ain't nobody suckin' and touchin'
this harmless discussion
maybe we can see a better way
find a brighter day
late night phone conversations
would that be ok?
I don't wanna take up all your time
or be tha next in line
tell me your size
and let me find things with you in mind
I can see your cautious
and i'm carefull not ta scare ya
but anticipation of love makein'
got ya shakin' when i'm standin' near ya
use of precision will prepare ya
in case you get scared
just ask the man in tha mirror
now tha pictures getten clearer
all he does is hit ya hard
I tell ya to leave
and you tell me keep my faith in god
I don't understand
I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave ya alone
find a woman of my own
all tha homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contimplate
but in my heart I know ya worth it
tell me
can U get away ?



Chorus
ebony, can U get away, let's go

So much pressure in tha air
and I can't get away
i'm not happy


I know what's wrong


So much pressure in tha air
and I can't get away
i'm not happy


do you love that man?


Could it be my destiny to be lonely
and be checkin' for these hoochies that be on me
cause they phoney
but you was different
I got no need to be suspicious
cause I can tell
my life with you would be delicious
tha way ya lick ya lips and shake ya hips
got me addicted
i'm sitten here hopen that we can find some way to
kick it
even though I got your digits gotta struggle to
resist it
slowly advance
and miss my chance
not to miss it you blow me kisses
when he ain't lookin
now your hearts tooken
my only wish is that you change your mind
and he get shook
I wanna take you there
but you scared to follow
come see tommorrow
hopen I can take you through tha pain and sorrow
and let you know I care
that someones there for your struggle
depend on me
when you have needs
or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before
not time to waste
we can hook up at the store
Can U get away ?



Chorus
There's so much pressure in tha air
and I can't get away
[yeah you can]
i'm not happy

[Can U get away]


So much pressure in tha air
and I can't get away
i'm not happy


I feel like reminiscin' and I hope ya listen
In tha position and tha pressure and all for competition
me and you
was meant to be my destiny
no longer lonely
cause it's time for you and me
all I can see
a happy home
that's my fantasy
but my reality
is problems with your man and me
what can I do?
don't wanna loose ya to tha sucker
cause if he touch ya
I got some drama for that busta
don't wanna rush ya
but make your mind up fast
nobody knows
or who controls
will it last
before I ask
I hope you see that i'm sincere
and even if ya stay with him
today i'm still here
I refuse to give up
cause I believe in what we share
ya livin' in prison
and what he's givin can't compare
cause everything I feel for you
I wanna let you know
passion will be yours
and i'll never let you go
tell me
Can U get away ?



Chorus
So much pressure in tha air
and I can't get away
i'm not happy

all I wanna know, can U get away


So much pressure in tha air
and I can't get away
i'm not happy


if you really wanted to get away, you could get away


[Tupac Speaking]


You ain't got to go through all this drama
and this stress
with this old half a man, you know what i'm sayin?
I ain't tryin to put you in a position
where you gotta give up your
lifestyle to hafta get with me but uh,
he ain't even takin care of you
he's beatin' on you and shit
look how you look
some motherfuckin' wanna be baby, you know what i'm sayin?
shake that sucker to tha left
and let me show you what this life is really about
you know what i'm sayin
you need to be on first class
need to be goin' to hawaii and seeing tha world
and seein what this world got to offer you
not goin to, you know what i'm sayin,
the emergency room and getten stitches
cause this nigga done got a temper
don't cry, it's all good


can U take me from here
can U take me from here
