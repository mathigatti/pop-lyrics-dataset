Intro: 
*the first three notes of Taps plays* 
M.A. Parks, C57797, you have a visitor 


Right there, stall three 
Hi baby. 
Whassup honey? 
Hey you know it's just only one more week until family visit. 

Yeah I'ma rock them drawers.

I made those deposits. 
Okay that's cool you bring that shit? 
Yeah I got it. 
Awright see that guard over there? 
Mmm-hmm. 

When you get done just hand him the shit, he know whassup. 
Awright. Hey you know E just got cracked, he's in jail now. 
What? 

Yeah, Go-Go's out. I just saw him runnin around the other day. 
Ahh, fuck that fool. But anyway, what's happenin with my moms? 

She gave me a message for you: 
She said she's sorry she couldn't be here today, but she'll be here 
next week. 
Awright well check this out, 

I got somethin real important 
I want you to tell her 
[guard] C'mon c'mon this shit's over with. 
*commotion breaks out* 
[girl] I'm not done talking to him! 

[guard] C'mon boy, back to your cell. 
Shut that shit up bitch! He's outta here, c'mon. 
[guy] Don't be callin my woman no bitch! I'll fuck you up! 

[guard] Yeah yeah fool, what? Yeah yeah that's what they all say fool. 
You institutionalized, and this is your home... 

Guess who's back, and ready to knock off a cop or two 
Cause me and the crew could still get our rocks off 
The penetentiary don't stop a nigga cause he's in jail 
Hell I'm makin more money on the street from here in a cell 

I'm livin proper, the coppers is havin fits 
I just made the profit, you punks ain't stoppin shit 
I still remember my momma told me 

Find the cop who killed your brother 
send him to Hell lookin homely 
Cause a real nigga love the law 
What's raw is a nigga that's above the law 

Keep pressin your luck and get fucked, huh 
Think a nigga don't know whassup cause he's locked up 
But in the meantime, it's get swoll get clean time 
Concentrate on gettin green time 

And as the years go by, they forgot 
about the small time soldier from the block, huh 

To kill the crook they threw the book at me 
Don't worry be nappy, don't even look happy 
Put me in the hole, gave me cold cuts 
Did push-ups until I swoll up 

And then they offer me a furlough 
But what they don't know as soon as I get free I'm killin five mo' 
They asked me if I changed much 
I told em 'Yeah' even though I'm still the same nut 

They started askin my questions about my brother 
And makin remarks about my mother, hmm 
Wait a minute, hold up 
Makin jokes about my folks'll get yours blown up 
They sent me back to the hole for what I told em 

I guess he didn't believe me, so I showed him 
He went home to find a tragedy 
Nigga, that's what you get for tryin to badger me 
And anybody else that wanna sweat me 

I'm already in jail so you punks can't get me 
You better pray they never see me 
Cause if they let me free, prepare for trouble on the streets. 
When I get free 
Chorus: When I get free (3X) 

Chorus
