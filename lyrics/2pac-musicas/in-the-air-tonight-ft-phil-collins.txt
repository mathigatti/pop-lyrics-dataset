Staring at the world through my rearview
Just looking back at the world
From another level you know what I mean?
Starin


Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops, people shot, nobody stop
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society, first they try
To murder me, then they lie to me, product of a dying breed

All my homies trying weed, now the little baby's
Crazed raised off hennesey, tell me will my enemies
Flee when they see me, believe me
Even thugs gotta learn to take it easy, listen
Through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turnin bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga rollin with a posse
Full of paranoid drug dealers, to the end my friend

I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin true
While I'm starin at the world through my rearview (see)
(They got me) starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die (we)
Gettin high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, hold on
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, hold on, hold on

Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin days in this livin black hell, do you feel me?
Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checkin

Turn to smith and wesson war weapons
Heavenly father I'm a soldier, I'm gettin hotter
Cause the world's gettin colder, baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin at the world through my rearview (I say)

(They got me) starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly -
And all my motherfuckers/nigga can die

Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin rules to these streets, somethin I learned
In school, on some million man march shit for the piece/peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed

We all die, breed bleed like humans, towns run
By young guns, outlawz and truants, shit's deep
Turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or chosin my dough
So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin through your rearview

Hahahaha, you ain't knowin what we
Mean by starin through the rearview
So since you ain't knowin what we mean
Let me break down understandin
The world, the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
And what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more

The world is a game to be played
So now we lookin at the world, from like, behind us
Niggaz know what we gotta do, just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggaz do they wanna do, bitch niggaz do what they can't

Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly, ya know/and we'll be
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, hold on
