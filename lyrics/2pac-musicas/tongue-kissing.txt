Excuse me sweet heart, do you like?
Ha ha yeah
Tongue kissin'


Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thing's I've been missin'
Uh

Listen
I can tell by the pain in your eyes you've been through so much
I feel ya' shiver at the slightest touch
It's like you scared, I might care
I'll never hurt you or desert you I'll be right there
Let's come together if you trust me then I can show you
Don't be shamed, it's the changes that people go through
Don't be scared of me
Come close to me please
I can see upset your mine give you what you need
Can I proceed?
Who do you believe in?
Afraid to leave but to scared that you need him
Set it free
I can take you to new places, anticipated it's a parade of new faces
Gettin' hotter now calm down get a grip
Slow baby ain't no need for rushin' this
I touch your lips
And give you kisses that you won't forget
Soft and wet
On your mark, get ready, set

Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thing's I've been missin'
Uh

I wanna take you home
We can sleep alone as I whisper in your ear
Disappear to a different zone
Promise not to move to fast
I got time, rather have some conversation's
Drop lines
Can ya hear me?
Tell me if you move, in my groove
Would you do what I ask you to?
See I love to make you moan your erogenous zone
Any a brother in his right mind love to spend some time at home
Though your hurtin' I can feel your pain
Try to understand, we ain't all the same
Let me take you away
Can you leave, some place
To find true peace?
Let me be your lover, a positive
Take your mind off the times
Of fucking, with the wrong nigga

Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thing's I've been missin'
Uh

I can't breathe, believe when times are low
It's like agony when I'm at home
Heart beatin' at a fast rate
Makin' moves in the nude I imaging it's the moves that your ass make
Don't be shy, I can't lie, pictures of me, inside you
On so bad I could die
I've been possessed so obsessed to undress you
No disrespect but my aim is to sex you
After that
Live your life as my wife at times
You'll understand how I had to live a life of crimes
Come let me put my hands on your
Hips and move
What your head do?
Bobbin' as we flip the mood
Give me good lovin' time to please
In and out, up and down
As we grind and freeze
Put your back in the the motion and caress a figure
Make her shamed
For fucking with the wrong nigga

Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thing's I've been missin'
Uh

(Right there, uh)
Tongue kissin'
(Oh don't move, right there, uh)
Uh, tongue kissin'
(Yeah)
Tongue kissin'
