*little kid* Tell me about these fake ass bitches 

[2Pac] 
Look here little nigga 
Most of these niggaz be bitches too 
but you'll never hear that side of the story 
So uhh, we finna do this shit like this 
It's like I tell my niggaz, keep your eyes on these bitches 


They love to G a nigga young dumb and gettin riches 
What the fuck you think a trick is nigga 
Nigga done stick and wet his dick 
and then get tricked out all his riches by a -- BITCH! 
I'm here to school you to the rules of the game, it'll cost ya 

Think you alla that just cause she let a nigga toss her 
It's like a motherfuckin priveledge 
So don't give up your conversation, give that bitch your 7 digits 

When she call ya, ask that tramp whassup 
And if she is the type of nigga hang up, worrrd up 
And let that bitch meditate to the dial tone 

And call me when you're ready to bone, and it's on 
A motherfucking mack tonight 
Stay that stay strapped cause my raps is tight 
You fuckin punks, I hate you snitches 
Went against the grain and the game to be fake ass bitches 

(God, damn! You can't just hit them niggaz with that game 
and expect them to accept it; girl your heard me it gets skanless. 
But we gonna kick this shit like this here) 

Chorus: 2Pac 
I can't stand fake ass bitches 
Lyin ass niggaz and you punk ass snitches 
(repeat 2X) 

Time to show these bustas who's boss 
Run up on a real motherfucker and get tossed 
The game is deep, and thicker than a motherfuckin jimmy 
Broke hoes runnin round yellin "Gimme!" 
I can't stand it, hoes talkin bout they got a man 
Shit all I wanted her to do is suck my DICK 

So how about hittin a motherfucker on my pager 
Busy now bitch but you can give me the pussy later 
Fly how I fade her, played her like a game of Sega 
Fuckin with the player that done made her, huh 
And I ain't sleepin caught you creepin for my money 

Got the dick and now you get the pistol honey (bitch) 
So get the bozack, knockin hoes back, keep my dough stacked 
So where the motherfuckin hoes at? 
Punk niggaz can't fade the mack, livin fat 

Gettin paid to rap, it's like that, you motherfuckin bitches 
Yeah, yeah that's my motto 
She educated a whole bunch of you old raggedy-ass niggaz 
So y'all take that shit back to y'all camp and uhh 
you sleep on that there, it's like 

Chorus 2X 
Oh you too nigga, don't think we ain't talkin bout your punk ass 
You old fake ass nigga 
Standin there wearin all them Pendletons and khakis and all that 
You soft as a motherfuckin grape 

Ain't this a motherfuckin bitch 
I can see right through your flower ass 
Some of these niggaz is bitches too, man I tell ya 
It's gonna be harder and harder to be a Thug in ninety-fo' 
but we gonna do this shit 

Y'all take this shit and you play this shit for every single 
fake ass bitch out there 
And there's plenty of em 
You probably got one sittin next to you right now 

Bobbin his fake ass head to this, dope ass shit that he listenin to 
Fake ass motherfuckin bitch, die in ninety-four
