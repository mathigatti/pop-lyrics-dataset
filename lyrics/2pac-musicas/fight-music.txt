(feat. Xzibit)

(Makaveli Talkin)

You know what? When you said that last time
I was kind a trippin right, but now
your right, I am crazy
but you know what else? I dont give a fuck


(Verse 1 Makaveli)
Check it out
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinnin, I'm hellbound
Rather be buried than be worried, livin held down
My game plan to be trained and, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sittin in the cemetary
Caught, I've been lost since my adolescence, callin to Jesus
Ballin as a youngster, wonderin if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Livin in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin?
Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's bitchin
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin warlike
Drop some shit, to any stupid bitches jaws tight

(Chorus)
Go, niggas wanna get it on that's right
i got some niggas in my click that make thay mother fucking jaws tight now
Go, niggas wanna get it on that's right
i got some niggas in my click that make thay mother fucking jaws tight
(repeatX2)

(Makaveli Talkin)
You gotta snatch some collars, and let them mother fuckers know
You that ?, remember, out

(Verse 2 XZibit)
