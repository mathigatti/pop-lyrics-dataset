2Pac and Lil' Mo...how gangsta is that?

[2Pac]
one-two, be a nigga nature
ha ha ha


[verse 1]

No Need to Cry now, Go wipe your tears be a woman
Why you actin suprised? you saw the bullshit comin
Fake hair, fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you bound to fuck with fake guys too
Ain't nuthin hard about it
Why you lookin sad? shoulda thought about it
Say you learned, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loser for love
Gettin freaky wit the thug niggaz up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Don Perrion
Knowin I got my cash getter, still I remain calm
Let you chill wit me,
Plus you was smiling till' bed wishing
That's what you get for tryin to dick with me
Missed me with that buy me this, buy me that syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin mad cause I curse, and I scream "I hate cha"
Introduce you to a nigga nature
Feel me


[chorus] Lil' Mo

Kiss the girls, make 'em cry
Thug life, gettin' high (yea, yea, yea)
Why you gangsta all the time?
That's a thugs nature

(That's A nigga nature)

Though sometimes I can deal with it
I realize that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
But that's a thugs nature

[verse 2]

I'm probably too nice at first
I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin busy slingin dick in the dirt
Bet you had a pool party cause it's cool to kick it
See us tongue kissin, you was truely wit it
Little ecstacy, hennesey mixed wit me
Picture me pay for pussy when this dicks for free
Hay now, with my niggaz that tell these hoes
Before I pay I jerk off , word to moses
Visions of you sittin there sweaty and wet
Pointin to the places that you want me to hit
Gimme room all up in the womb call the cops
Nigga, hitin' walls all til them bastards drop
Label me Makaveli thug nigga wit pipe
Livin life like a rocks stars friday night
Make money, get pussy always keep a pager
Cellphone in the ride to complete my nature now

[chorus] Lil' Mo

Kiss the gils, make 'em cry (make 'em cry)
Other night, gettin' high (yea, yea)
Why you gangsta all the time?
That's a thugs nature (everyday)

Though sometimes I can deal with it
I realize that I'm feelin' it (yea, yea)
It's a love and hate relationship
But that's a thugs nature

[verse 3]

Started as a seed from the semen
Straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin for creamin, bitches with big butts
Curves makin nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down, beggin you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoed so that ass is mine
Tell everybody Pac put it down for good
A local legend thru the whole hood
Follow me, I got a gun on me
Going for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, Is for some crazy
Why cry, when I'll be thuggin till I die
Picture a nigga in heaven high off weed I fly
Got me missin dead homies, wish these phoneys would die
Hit the weed &amp; hope it get me high
Dear god understand my ways, livin major
Blessed with a thugs heart, in a real live nigga nature


[chorus] Lil' Mo

Kiss the girls, make 'em cry
Thug life, gettin' high (whoa, euuu, whoa)
Why you gangsta all the time?
That's a thugs nature

(That's A nigga nature)

Though sometimes I can deal with it
I realize that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
But that's a thugs nature

(That's A nigga nature)

Kiss the girls, make 'em cry
Thug life, gettin' high
Why you gangsta all the time?
That's a thugs nature

(This be a nigga nature)

Though sometimes I can deal with it
I realize that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
But that's a thugs nature
