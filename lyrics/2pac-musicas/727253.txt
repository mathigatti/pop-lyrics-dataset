Oh man
(Hey)

Let's turn this house
Into a happy home

Verse 1:


Now we been kicking it, For quite some time
Remain beside me, Through my trials
In this life of crime, We done fought
So many times, I forgot to count
I never hit you, Now the coward
Rather leave your house, Remember Back in December
When we was tight, Sippin' Alize And Crystal
While in every night In my bedroom
Promise that I commit to you soon
Tongue kiss me Everytime you see
We step inside a room, Straight out the hood
We promise to be good To each other
Plus I love you So I know You goin' make A good mother
Just try to understand If I change a time
It's only cause I never owned Anything that's mine
So I'm trying, You can stay With my momma But keep the drama
To a low, Never call the police
I never call you Bitch or hoe
We were all Born hungry In this world Alone
Finally moved out
My mom's house
And got a happy home

Chorus : Female Singer (2Pac)


Hap-py home (lets turn the house into a happy home)
Hap-py home (Finally made it out of my momz house)
(Got a happy home)

Hap-py home (lets turn the house into a happy home)
Happy home
(huh)


Verse 2 : 

Born through hard times ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest It's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God
Knowin' you can be scarred though
Look at him walkin' and talkin'
A little child with my eyes and mouth
Father, Watch over little seeds
Help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now
I'm tryin' hard y'all
Maybe in time
I'll be a better man
Watching the older couples handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever
And together we rise if it would 
Help our child grow live together 
We die
Why question my love
It's so easy to see without my family
All I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguements and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life
Inside a happy home


Chorus : 

Hap-py home (turn the house into a happy home)
Hap-py home (Finally got to live a good live inside a happy
home)

Hap-py home (turn the house into a happy home)
Hap-py home (A happy home)

Male Singer (2Pac) :

All these problems got me gone,we got a family of our own
I just want a happy home (turn this house into a happy home)
Long as we just stand up alone, I'll promise I won't do you
wrong
I just want a happy home (Finally made it out of my momz house)
(Got a happy home)


Female Singer (2Pac)

Hap-py home (turn the house into a happy home)
Hap-py home (Finally got to live a good live inside a happy
home)

Hap-py home (Finally made it out of my momz house)
(Got a happy home)

(Turn This house into a happy home)

As long one of us got, Some of us got it

(Turn this house into a happy home)
