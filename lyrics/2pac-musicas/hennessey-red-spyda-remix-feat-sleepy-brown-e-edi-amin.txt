Nigga fuck that gin and juice, I'm fuckin' with Hennessy
Just pour me a glass of that dark shit
That's right


[2Pac &amp; Sleepy Brown]
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh
Hennessy (Hennessy) hahaha, yeah
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh

[2Pac]
Now I was born in the gutter facing life or death
I was a thug ever since my mama gave me breath
These motherfuckers wanna see me die, so who am I
To try to warn 'em, I buck and bomb 'em, them niggas fry
Hey, remember me? Down that Hennessy
The nigga you don't wanna see, let me proceed
My definition of some thug shit, y'all don't hear me
Now that it's popping ain't no love bitch
I maintain in the game in the gutter's where I still kick it
I'm trying to hustle up a meal ticket
I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler 'til my dying days
Ain't nuttin wrong with getting paid, so nigga blaze
Cause we some motherfuckin' fools
Walking through the streets wearing jewels, breaking niggas making moves
Even the cops can't stop us, my enemies flip
When they see me drink a fifth of that Hennessy

[2Pac &amp; Sleepy Brown]
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh
Hennessy (Hennessy) hahaha, yeah
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh

[Edi Amin]
Yeah
Up late nights (c'mon) under the city lights
The Henn got me feeling right, I'm trying to keep from swerving
She's so fine and she love Henn too
After a couple of shots she said, "I could do what I wanna do."
(That's right) We ain't sipping champagne (nah) we off the Henn-Rock
Alcoholics back at the liquor sto' cause we can't stop (can't stop)
And won't stop (we won't stop) all night long
'til the break of dawn, getting it on, Hennessy

[Sleepy Brown]
Oh, lady watching (lady watching) as I'm gliding by (gliding by)
And the place is jumping that I can't deny (no, no, no)
Ooh I can't wait to go in, throw my glass in the sky (glass in the sky)
For the people partying, 'til the morning light

[2Pac &amp; Sleepy Brown]
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh
