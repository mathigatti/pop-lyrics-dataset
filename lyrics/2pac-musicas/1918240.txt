[Verse 1]
You heard it wrong nigga, ain't nothing sweet about my techniques
you checkin' for my breathless quotes I wrote deadly
My history so thoroughly involves destruction
niggaz left with their ass bleedin', lyrical f-cking
Open up, first to bust, let me see your heart
turn the lights down, cause I might clown in the dark
When I check for the Heartz of Men what do we find?
niggaz watchin' for my pockets, planning plots on mine
Am I blind? Let my rhymes speak, for me in history
a legend you define me
Don Makaveli bitch bow down to Death Row
F-ck what you say we untouchable now that we done shook Doc Dre
He ain't made a beat in six years, swear he the shit
Won't get no record sales suckin' Nas dick
Let me get my preach on nigga drop the beat, I get my freak on
The wrong one for you to speak on
Motherf-cker watch ya mouth


[Verse 2]
Look I heard Nas got beef cause I'm dissin' his clique, cool
come bring your ass nigga you can get dissed
I worldwide steady war rappin',
Get your cash on nigga, five times platinum
What's that?
De-La got a problem with this hard shit
ever since "me myself and I", y'all been garbage
I'm gonna keep it real, show you how it feels to ride
Y'all went three feet and stopped risin'
Wendy Williams is a fat bitch, that's the truth
I got a jar full of niggas nuts that's for you
Let the Westside Eastside drama seize
I'll come alone to your own streets, Outlaw
Prepare for panic when I unleash
Niggas is lucky if they leave here in one piece
Queen Puff never had no heart to start
So how the hell Biggie Smalls get the part?
Watch ya mouth

[Verse 3]
What I bring to you is hard core, the very essence of my poetry
Dyslexic so you backward ass niggas will notice me
The only G to bleed for the shit I bring
And swing hard on motherf-ckers that's my thing
Vocally I'm pure so you O.D. tryin' to throw me
Don't get ya life took tryin' to run with ya homies, y'all know me
Same nigga so quick to blast
On this worldwide mash, trying to get some cash
Holla my name and the game will follow
Wait and I'll murder these snakes tomorrow
Bunch of washed up jealous ass punk though
Quit bullshitting Pac, flip the promo
Makaveli rise, all you niggas die when I come
I'll do some fly shit and be done
They say Pac ain't got love for the eastside
You a lying motherf-cker, nigga we ride
Watch ya mouth
