(Tupac Talking)

Heaven ain't hard to find
(All you gotta do is look)


(Tupac)

Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information, eleviates the hesitiation
I can see it clearly now
catch you smiling through your frown
I'm askin' Baby Boo are you down ?
Although I know you've heard about my reputation 
across the nation
"Mr. I get around"
My temptaion got me dripping wet 
perspiration
I'm activated by the moves your making
Baby why you faking? strip naked get the love making
See its all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wanting, never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what I'm missing
Stop with the beeper, baby Listen,
I know you're grown, but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tounge kissen'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes

Turn around one more time
Heaven ain't hard to find

(Chorus)

(Heaveeen)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)

Heaven ain't hard to find
Infact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believing in magic
It takes a lot of scarifice 
with all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes 
baby you're moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper, but first let me ask 
Are you afraid of a thug ? 
and have you ever made love 
with candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
Touch me and let me activate your bloodpressure
This Thug Passion 
help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that alazhay 
come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends 
perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life
baby and you'll be my soulja
And I know it takes some time
And you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven Ain't Hard to Find

(Chorus)

(Heaveeen)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)

You think we all dogs, thats why you cautious when I approached you
Been talking since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact, I wink and you respond back
Look at me 
whats all that ? Huh
its like the closer you get, Baby the quicker I'm speaking
I got a flight out Chicago, lets kick it this weekend
I'm sipping Heneesee and coke 
tho' addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh god help me identify me truest thoughts
your hidden motives full of passion who would of thought
Come hollar at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends 
I can soup you in my Benz 
we'll ride 
I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin 
until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind baby
Heaven ain't hard to find

(Chorus)

(Heaveeen)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
