Only God can judge me, is that right?
Only God can judge me now
Only God, baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business


Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'ma blind man doin time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin
I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin all the killin here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin for
Everybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me

Only God can judge me
That's right baby, yeah baby
Only God
Hahahahahahahaha
Only God can judge me, only God can judge
me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
And only God can
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me now

Flatline!

I hear the doctor standing over me
Screamin I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my IV
Cause everytime I breathe, I think they killin me *beeping sound stops*
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantansies
I wake up stranglin, danglin my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this?  I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin through the cemetary talkin to the, dirt
I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power
is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me?  And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin round strapped
Mista, Po-lice, please try to see that it's
a million motherfuckers stressin just like me
Only God can judge me

Only God can judge me
That's right baby, yeah baby
Only God
Hahahahahahahaha
Only God can judge me, only God can judge
me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
And only God can
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me now

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
(That's for real)
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
(You know?)
Let me live baby, let me live

Rappin 4-Tay:

Pac, I feel ya, keep servin it on the reala
For instance say a playa hatin mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him
After talkin behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin them niggaz, "You can fade him," punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
to get your safe, knowin you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I'll be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know you all in disguise

Guess you figure you know me cause I'm a Thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me

Only God can judge me
That's right baby, yeah baby
Only God
Hahahahahahahaha
Only God can judge me, only God can judge
me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
And only God can
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me now

4-Tay: Only God main

4-Tay: That's real

4-Tay: Fuck everybody else, yaknowhatI'msayin?
2Pac: Man, look here man
