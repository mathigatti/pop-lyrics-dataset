INTRO:

Dominique: What do you feel when you hear a record like Tupac's new one?


Man: I love Tupac's new record



Dominique: Right, but don't you feel like that creates tension between East and West?


Dominique: He's talking about killing people, I had sex with your wife
and not in those words, but he's talking about I wanna see you deceased.


Makaveli:


No doubt
To live and die in LA
California - Don't care what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me it never rains


To Live and Die in LA
Where everyday we try a fatten' our pockets
Us niggaz hustle for the cash so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got their own thang currency chasin'
World wide through the hard times worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggaz close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark
Cold hearted bout it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin to floss on em'
Blind to a broken man's dream


A hard lesson--court cases--keep em guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now--so I'm stressin'


Cost me more to be free than a life in the Penn
Making money off of cuss words--writin' again
Learn how to think ahead--so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset like in a sin
What's the worst they could do to a nigga
Get me lost in hell--To Live and Die in LA
On bail--my angels sing...


Chorus:


To Live and Die in LA, it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
Where everybody wanna see
To Live and Die in LA, it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
Everybody wanna see


It's the cities of angels and constant danger
South Central LA--can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera
On the curb watching the ghetto bird helicopters
I observe--so many niggaz
Gettin 3 strikes--tossed in jail
Swear the Penn's right across from hell
I can't cry--cause it's home now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin life thug style--so I can't smile
Writin to my peoples
When they ask for pictures
Thinkin Cali just fun and bitches
(hahaha)
Better learn about the dress code
B's and C's--all them other niggaz copycats
These is G's
I love Cali like I love woman
Cause every nigga in LA
Got a little bit of thug in em'


We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this
We'll burn this bitch down--get us pissed
To Live and Die in LA


~Chorus~


It wouldn't be LA with out Mexicans
Black love, Brown pride
and the sets again--Pete Wilson
Tryin to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit
Out for everything they owe
Remember K day
Weekends--Crenshaw--MLK
Automatics rang free niggaz lost they way
Gang signs bein shown
Nigga love your hood
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at--niggaz gettin shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this muthafucka burned out
M-O-B
Big Suge in the lo lo
Bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex
With an ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggaz with me OFCP
They got some hash
Took a stash
Left the rest for me
Neckbone--Dre, Heron, Bungy too
Big Rock got knocked
But this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel
Hoping it pay
Gettin high--watchin time fly
To Live and Die in LA


~Chorus~


Makaveli:


This goes out for 92.3, 106--all the radio stations
That be bumping my shit
Makin my shit sales Quadruple, Quadrople, platinum
This goes out to all the magazines
That support a nigga
All the real mufuckas
All the stores, the mom &amp; pop spots
A&amp;R people, all yawl mufuckas
LA--California love
Part mufuckin 2 without gay ass Dre
