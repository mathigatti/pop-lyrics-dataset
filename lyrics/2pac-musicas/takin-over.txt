Latino hip hop music was once a small scene of street rappers
And a handful of hardcore followers
The new wave of artists are hitting the musical scene tonight


When we come through with the takeover, we make the game over
I'm from the state of lowriders and street soldier
We drop like boulders 'cause we hittin' hard
Every single playa hater know just who we are
We the homies from the laylow I-n-c
Per-petrating motherfuckers gon' remember me
I don't pretend to be, so don't hate on me
Snitchin' to the cops 'cause they want to get rid of me
Ta-ta-talking about you murder me
Homie, I know you heard of me
Creeping through the dark in the oldsmobile
Drive-by shoot to kill, so watch your step
Big stalks won't stop, I keep the pussy wet
Break bread or [?]
1-8-7 On the motherfuckin' cops
Yeah, the streets are hard
If we want it, we get it
Homie, it's like that
If you got it, I'll take it
Homie, we ain't fake

Lay low inc. T-t takin' over, we takin' over
I see you trying hard, 'cause we do it better
I know what you think, when we coming over (I know what you think)
But you better not try to play 'cause the game is over
We took it over

You can't break me, never make me busta soft the beats
This outlaw style, got a brother off the streets
Miss delores tucker sue me, I won't stop
'Til we get justice for these crooked cops, on my block
Time warner full of sissies
Tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites, whistling dixie
Good riddance, 'cause you never should've touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure, I'ma make you sorry
Trust me
Did I cry when they dropped me? (nah), can they stop me? (yeah)
Tryna sell 4 million copies
If I wasn't spitting, it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we coming from
Life as an outlaw, ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we don't stop

We, t-t takin' over, we takin' over
I see you trying hard, but we do it better
I know what you think, when we coming over (I know what you think)
But you better not try to play 'cause the game is over
We took it over

Bigg di-dogg, push the big hid-ogg
You're hoppin' and poppin', how 'bout you hop up off my bid-alls
Got, dirt on my pid-aws, I, broke a few lid-aws
It, really don't matter 'cause I'm only here to spit on
And get on and shit on niggas
Do it to 'em d-o-double right on, nigga
I'm saggin' it, baggin' it, slangin' dubs
You motherfuckas think the wash is all soap and suds?
What's up cuz?
If you tryin' to get a dub sack, page me
The hoes say: Dee loc, you so crazy
Poppin' that shit, don't faze me
I need my chips and the dip, it's like gravy

Now back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is expected and I'm feelin' that demand
Los ang', broad day gunnin'
That ain't no earthquake, it's just dre comin'
If this shit ain't played, the party ain't bumpin'
If I don't show up, the hoes ain't fuckin'
(Real talk) cali sunshine, come visit
Just don't stop at stop signs with bullet holes in it
All-star league, you ridin' benches
I handles my bidness, fuck fake niggas
I sell game a quarter million a track
Snoop and the good doc back with a brand-new sack
Shit's wrong, money gone, I'll blast
Out of town, out of bounds, no pass
Runnin' up, talkin' shit, get smashed
Shoot first, ask questions last

Lay low inc. T-t takin' over, we takin' over
I see you trying hard, but we do it better
I know what you think, when we coming over (I know what you think)
But you better not try to play 'cause the game is over
We took it over, took it over, we took it over, t-t-took it over
