(feat. Outlawz)

[Spoken poem]
When your heart turns cold
It causes your soul to freeze
Spreads through your spirit
Like a ruthless, villain disease
The walls that were once down
Now stand firm and tall
Safe from hate, love, pain, joy
Till you feel nothing at all
When your heart turns cold
A baby's cry means nothing
A dead corpse is trivial
Mothers neglecting children is daily
Lonliness becomes your routine friend
Death seems like tranquility
Sleeping is never pleasant if you even sleep at all
We forgot our deals and turn off the reason
Till the product is sold
You don't understand how I behave
Wait till your heart turns cold


[Verse 1]
Know my cold heart turns warm at the front door
Love my family, love my Outlawz
But when I step outside I feel my blood freezing
Question if it's a blessing that 'm still breathing
Sometimes I wonder if I'm better off dead
They say God don't make mistakes but what if he did
But what if he didn't
So I'm supposed to be living this life that I'm living
And feeling how I'm feeling
Black rain shower, the pain builds character
My heart turned cold, yeah I learned to be a scavenger
Listen, no love received and no love given
Don't blame us blame the hate that you gave the children

[Verse 2]
No remorse for life and y'all forced to fight
In the event of my demise I hope God's the guiding light
In hind's sight, I'm lost, misguided by lies and truths
Confused bout what to do, refer to smoking, drinking brew
We be the hearts of the heartless, riding few from the bunch
Bosses have falled, bosses have caught you don't be the next one
Sleeping never pleasant even if you sleeping at all
The reason that I'm breathing is I'm an example for y'all

[Hook]
When your heart turns cold
It causes your soul to freeze
Spreads through your spirit like a deadly disease
When your heart turns cold
You feel nothing at all
A baby's cry means nothing at al
When your heart turns cold
A dead corpse is trivial
And death seems like tranquility
When your heart turns cold
I thank God above
Through the pain, hate, joy, and love
When your heart turns cold

[Verse 3]
Your soul is numb, your days are numbered (Cold)
Your kids cold, get old and younger (Cold)
Your lonliness becomes your only homie
So your sorrow all alone is just for your eyes only (Yeah)
The world against you and the odds are stacked (They stacked)
Your pockets short and your girls a wreck (That bitch)
Lose a piece of you survive all that
Plus you young and you black, it's hard enough being that (Yeah)
Your mom gone ain't nobody never cared (Yeah)
You call your mom but nobody never there (Shit)
Now it's on, you need a way up out of here
You click on some be next shit

[Verse 4]
When your heart turn cold that's when the heat go off
And the means die slow, that's how the streets show off
Cemetaries filled with vicitms those with cold hearts
Deep in the dark when the pistols spark
My life one big movie of strife
Scene after scene filled with nothing but sad dreams
No wonder my heart pumps ice water
Gotta live according to the lessons that life taught you
Lonley is the road of a tortured soul
Who only knows the roles of a heart turned cold
Caught in the middle when the pistols blow
That's how it go when your heart turns cold

[Hook]
