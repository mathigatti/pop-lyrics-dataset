Eternally thug nigga hilfigger made by tommy
So when i speak hope to reach my ?? mamis
Or come to papi i love it when its wet and sloppy
In and out the mouth peice 'till i cum no one can stop me
My bump and grind will do you everytime
Come get a blast of this thug passion and blow your mind
Hey, throw up your legs, wrap those shits around my back
