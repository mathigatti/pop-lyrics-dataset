Chorus
girl it's alright now
cause it's there in your eyes
yeah I can see that you want me
by the way that you smile
are you still down for me


jon b.

left once again at home
another noght on your own
ain't no fun in loving
if you're loving alone
how does it feel to be useless
oh no can you recall how
close we use to be then
can you still remember those feelings again
seems like everytime I see you
there's a tear in your eye
time to make some decisions
or go dying inside

Tupac

Tell'em all call me a fool
but I'm stuck in this love thang
plus I'm overheatin' from the rush
our tongues touch
kissin feelin fireworks
watch the sky
I make you smile
but you'd rather have
what makes you cry
say goodbye and leave now
with my heart on my sleeve
memories what I found is you
still care (still care) you had feelings
and they're still there baby
girl keep it real here
are you still down

Chorus
girl it's alright now
cause it's there in your eyes
yeah I can see that you want me
by the way that you smile
are you still down for me (repeat)

Jon b.

remember that evening
I knew that you were too scared
to go all the way
but you did it to please me
crying it was raining
when you gave it to me
the more I see you
the more that I feel inside
and I know one day
you'll make it back
to where you can fly
(watch time) go don't cry
tommorow brings better days
let me dry your eyes
take your burdens away

Tupac

only once in a lifetime
touch my soul
baby boo don't rush the flow
got me all weak baby
but I'm strong in parts
more bounce to the ounce
with the longest sparks
gettin' mine like fine wine
measured in time
many other brothers loved you
but the pleasure was mine
mama taught me how
to love a woman properly sprung
we committed so I hit it
so it's properly done
are you still down?

Chorus
girl it's alright now
cause it's there in your eyes
yeah I can see that you want me
by the way that you smile
are you still down for me
(repeat to fade)
