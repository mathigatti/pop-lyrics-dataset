Pssst... psssssst... 
aiyyo 
Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever 
Tell me, which one? 
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin my mind 


Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry 
Fallin to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord 
but he ignores me unfortunately cause I'm guilty 

Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless -- I'm chokin off 
marijuana smoke, with every toke it's like I'm losin focus 

Fallin to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die? 
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high 
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin, and goin nutty 

And reminiscin bout them niggaz that murdered my buddy 
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin funny 

Flashbacks of bustin caps, anything for money 
Where am I goin I discovered, can't nothin save me 

My next door neighbor's havin convo with undercovers 
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it 
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it 
Everybody's dyin am I next, who can I trust? 

Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust? 
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin, two to the head 
while I'm in bed, leakin blood on my satin sheets 
Is there a heaven for a baller? I'm gettin suspicious 
of this bitch the line busy everytime I call her 

Now she's tellin me to visit, who else is home? 
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone 
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later 
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her 

The bitch is tellin all her homies -- that I can fuck her 
like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me 
I'm under pressure gettin drunk, somebody help me 

I drink a fifth of Hennesey I don't think it's healthy 
I see my enemies they creepin, don't make me blast 
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass 
by me like they know me, smilin as they laugh 

I put up my middle finger then I dash 
Niggaz don't like me cause I'm Thuggin, and every day 
I'm a hustler lookin to get paid 
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie 

I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry 
Nowhere to rest I'm losin homies, ain't that a bitch 
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely 
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer 

I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there? 
Then tell me am I lost cause I'm lonely 
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely 
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares 

A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there 
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways 
But still that don't promise me the next day 
So I stay Thuggin with a passion, forever blastin 

I'm bustin on these motherfuckers in my madness 
They wonder if I'm hellbound... well Hell 
can't be worse than this, cause I'm in Hell now 

Don't make me hurt you I don't want to, but I will 
See motherfuckers killed over green bills 
Never will I die, I'll be back 

Reincarnated as a motherfuckin mack 
I love it cause in heaven there's no shortage on G's 
I'm tellin you now, you motherfuckers don't know me 
"Only fear of death.." "You ghetto niggaz" 

"Only fear of death is comin back reincarnated" 
(repeats continously w/ variations) 
Hahaha, I ain't scared to die 
I ain't scared to die 

To my homies in heaven 
I ain't scared to die 
Do you wanna live forever? 
Are you scared, to die? 
Or will you scream, when you fry? 

I don't fear death 
My only fear of death is comin back, reincarnated 
This is dedicated to Mental, R.I.P. 

And Big Kill, R.I.P. 
And all you other O.G.'s, who go down 
I don't fear death
