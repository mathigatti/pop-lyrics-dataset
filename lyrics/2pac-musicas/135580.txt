(Tupac Talking) 
Hey Nate you know you gots to focus on this mutha-fucka 
We gonna talk about these Skandalouz hoes 


[I can talk about Skandalouz bitches] 

I know you can, I know 
Thats why we gonna do this 
Daz on the beat 
Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin' around on the piano 
Nigga just drop this shit, like uhh this here 

(Tupac) 
I meet you through my homie 
Now you act like you don't know me 
So disappointed cuz baby that shit was so phony 

It's not phony, you see no love for my closest homies 
With my pager number uhh baby you was all up on me 
While you proceed with precision 
You had them taping hoes 
No, I ain't mad at you baby 

Go ahead an play them fools 
They choose no to listen 
So now he stuck inside his house 
And can't leave without his bitch permission 
My mission is to be a playa 
My alias is boss 

Drop the top on these jealous niggas 
Playa let me floss 
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain 
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, "Never breathing again" 
It's Skandalouz 

I never liked your back stabbing ass, trick 
Yous tha watchin' money who you baggin' bitch 
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust 
Cuz bitches live so Skandalouz 

(Chorus -- Nate Dogg) 
She so Skandalouz (Repeated several times) 

(Tupac) 
How's it hangin' 
cuz baby, from the back the shit is bangin' 
I'll be stressing in this ghetto game 

Trying to do my thang 
Won't be no bullshit, no ass kissing 
cuz bitch, I'll have you waking up 
with all your cash missing, I'm askin' 

As if I'm qualified, to analyze 
You looking at a bitch that specialize in telling lies 
she got a body that make a mutha-fucka fantasize 

Her face ain't never shed a tear through her Skandalouz eyes 
Blushin' , pressuring 'n popin' 
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch 

So why should it bother me 
I've finally been sprung 
Addicted to the heat of her tongue 
Although, I don't know where she going shes making me cum 

I've been trained as a Boss 
Playa 
so hoochie staying, we got some hookers we can toss later 
Before I let her get me I got up 
Went into her purse and took a hundred dollars 
Nigga, I'm so Skandalouz 

(Chorus -- Nate Dogg) 
She so Skandalouz (Repeated several times) 

(Tupac) 
Dangerous 'n Ambitious while scheming on gettin' riches 
I'm spitting at tricks, cuz I'm addicted to pretty bitches 
currency motivated, not easily terminated 
Now that we mad it, my niggas can never be faded 

This is my prophecy, I gotta be paid 
All you cowards that try to stop me, Are begging for early graves 
I thought we was cool, I was a fool 
thinkin' you could be true, when I don't fuck with your punk crew 

These are the tales of my niggas doing time in tha cell 
I went from hell to living well 
Busting at niggas who said my name in vain 
I ain't got no time for them tricks 

I'm Heavy in the Game 
I wanna be a balla please 
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin' me 
I'm totein' free on the highway 
formulating plans, I can't wait till I see L.A. 

(Chorus -- Nate Dogg) 
She so Skandalouz (till fade)
