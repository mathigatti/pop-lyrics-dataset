[Featuring Nate Dogg] 

How long will they mourn me 
Yeah! This for my nigga Kato 
It's still on nigga 


Thug Life, Thugs for life 
Ha Ha yeah, how long will they mourn me 
Yeah nigga 
2Pac in this muthafucka 

(Tupac) 
All my homies drinking liquor 
Tears in everybody's eyes 
Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide 

But I can't cry 
instead I'm just a shoulder 
Damn, why they take another soldier 

I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry 
I'll get them suckas back before your buried (shit) 
Retaliate and pull a 187 
do real niggas get to go to heaven ? 

How long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin 'G' 
Bitch don't wanna die 
then don't fuck with me 
It's kinda hard to be 
optimistic 

When your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted 
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm trying hard to make amends 
But I'm losing all my muthafuckin friends (damn) 
They should've shot me when I was born 

Now I'm trapped in the muthafuckin' storm 
How long will they mourn me ? 

(Chorus) 
I wish it would have been another 
How long will they mourn me 
How long will they mourn my brother 

(Got them niggas all dead and shit) 
How long will they mourn me 
I wish it would have been another 

(Nate Dogg) 
How long will they mourn me 
How long will they mourn my brother 
(Gotta keep this shit goin' on, Yo Syke) 

(Syke) 
How long will they mourn me 
Every muthafuckin' day homie 
You stayed down when tha other niggas didn't know me 
From my heart to the trigga 

you my fuckin' nigga 
And things won't be the same without ya nigga 
I remember kickin' back, you wanted to lack 
And goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack 

Smokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin' 
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin' 

Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato ? 
So confused not knowing which way to go 
I'm goin crazy and runnin' 
out of fuckin' time 

I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind 
So day after day 
ride after ride 

We'll hook up on the other side 
Watch over your family and your newborn 
Till we meet again homie 
How long will they mourn me ? 

(Chorus) 
I wish it would have been another 
(Yo Kato) 
How long will they mourn me 

(It's still on nigga) 
How long will they mourn my brother 
How long will they mourn me 

I wish it would have been another 
(Yeah) 
How long will they mourn me 
How long will they mourn my brother 

(Rated R, Double Jeopardy, Mack 10) 
(Rated R) 
Damn a nigga tired of feeling sad 

I'm tired of putting in work 
I'm tired of cryin while watching my homies leave the earth 

I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt 
And my peoples'll be mournin' 
When they get a call from the coroner 

All niggas can say is that's fucked up 
And get tossed up 
Reminiscing how we grew up 

(my nigga) 
Rest and love to my nigga Kato 
See you in the crossroads real soon 

For now let me pour out some brew 
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie 
Rest in peace 

How long will they mourn me ?

Ya know life's a fuckin' trip 
And everybody gotta go 
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato 

Another nigga fell victim to the chrome 
It's enough to make you crazy 
It's fuckin' with my dome 

Ya only live once on this earth 
A nigga had it bad, since the day of my mutahfuckin' birth 
But niggas say they down and 

they always be my homie 
But when a nigga gone 
How long will ya mourn me ? 

(Chorus) 
Yeah! 
I wish it would have been another 

(Mack 10 in this muthafucka) 
Yeah, how long will ya mourn me 
How long will ya mourn my bother 

(Thug Life boy, Nate blowin' that shit, 
Nate Dogg do that shit nigga) 
I wish it would have been another 

Yeah! How long will ya mourn me 
How long will ya mourn my brother 
(This for my nigga Kato and all his kids) 

How long will ya mourn me 
I wish it would have been another 
How long will ya mourn my brother
