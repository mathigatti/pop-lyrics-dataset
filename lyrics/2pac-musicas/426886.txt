So what I wanna do, hopefully is... I wanna be, uhm...not 'I wanna be' I am 2pac!

Tupac!

Guess who's back? G-g-guess who's back
G-g-guess who's back? G-g-guess who's back


Everywhere I see, a soldier a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me

Everywhere I see, a soldier a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me

Everywhere I see, a soldier a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me

Everywhere I see, a soldier a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me

Posse deep as I role through the streets
Motherfuck the police as we creep, in our jeeps
Layin so long you think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beef, I'm robbin niggaz through the teeth
And opd can get the dick if they play tuffy
Last time them niggaz rushed me, I aint bust but now I'm touchy
Trust me, aint nothing jumpin but these buck shots
Them niggaz got enough knots, I'm poppin corrupt cops
Ya motherfuckaz catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem, now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Motherfuckin soulja, ready to role and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin
Role to the door, through a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin, cuz wouldn't stop until they rugged out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunitions and them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke rising from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
20 Cops, one for every year in jail
Tryin to keep a nigga down, but ya failed
Before I let ya take me, I told ya
Fuck being trapped, I'm a soulja

[Chorus: Eminem]
I betcha that I got something you aint got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it aint scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no g, cuz that aint me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do, cuz that aint you, you just frontin
You aint?

[Verse 2:tupac]
It's tupac in the mad bitch
In them six-'fo, rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch
Gettin ghosts on them bitches in the town
Bustin out the backseat, nigga when we clown
Homie is you down?
B got the strap and she anxious
Hurry up 'fo she spank shit
Commin round the corners, spittin rounds
They payin homie down
Caught them sucka ass bitches outta bounce
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day
Stinkin biatch!

[Chorus: Eminem]
I betcha that I got something you aint got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it aint scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no g, cuz that aint me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do, cuz that aint you, you just frontin
You aint? (tupac)

[Outro:tupac]
Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me
