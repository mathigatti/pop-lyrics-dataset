(Tupac) 
Under Pressure 
Yeah, Babyyy 
When tha pressures on... 
Thug Life 
when it's on it's on 


(Tupac) 
One of these days i'll 
learn 
don't fuck with trick ass niggas 
cause they 
turn into bitch ass niggas 

i'm sick of bein stuck in tha county jail 
my niggas clown 
bring a pound 
when they posten bail 
smokein' blunts in tha driveway 
my four-five screamin 
fuck tha police 

won't fly away, thug, till I die 
you wonder why I'm made this way 
I wasn't 
turned out 
I was raised this way 
of thinkin 

these are tha dreams of a young teen 
sceam, and stack green on tha crack fiends 
one time can't hold me 
one of these days 
we gotta bust back for tha homies 

locked down in tha penitentry 
finaly loose my mind 
if tha pigs succeed 
stress, smoken weed and nicoteen 
but what a nigga really need is Thorozine 

right before I die 
i'll be curseing tha law 
reincarnated bitch even worse than before 
my four-four's givin payback 
my underhanded plan 
to get them niggas while they laid back 

and big stretch hit tha scene with tha mini 14 
servin suckers like dope fiends 
and lead tha whole team 
Under Pressure Nigga 
That's right 

(Stretch) 
Never run 
throw your gun in tha air 
oh yeah 
nigga bust ain't no time to spare 
called tha ruffest mothafucker and we fuck shit up 

and with tha stainless steel [???], we cut shit up 
flash and blast a nigga with tha quickness 
cock tha four pound motherfucker when I spit this and rip this 

damn, my mind is in tha depths of hell 
but when i'm walking on tha street kid my name rings bells 
and I never fell 
nigga I stand to tall 

i'm just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl 
givin my all 
so niggas wanna bring it to me 
so i'ma sell my cocain 
and lay they ass down 'G' 
Under Pressure 

(Tupac) 
yeah, look here tho 
Runnin wild 
I never smiled as a juvenile 
even now I keep a frown when I come around 
don't ask me about tha past 
it was all bad 
shots blasted 
will I last 
in tha wrong path 

in tha dark is where my heart saw tha most grief 
mothafuckers is getten shanked over gold teeth 
am I sick ? 
cause i'm addicted to get splifted 

watch tha stupid ass tricks get lifted 
nothens changed 
cause in tha came it's a steady aim 
fuck friends 
cause when in danger those niggas change 
puff weed 
and stuff G's in my sock G 
call Ki's and Hennessy where tha glock be 

Times passen will I last here another day 
I put my gun away 
and grab my AK 
it's getten hectic 
I can't call it 
house full of alcoholics 
now we're niggas under pressure 
yeah, that's right... 

Under Pressure, we're niggas under pressure 
yeah 
(Tupac and Stretch together repeated 11x) 
When tha Pressures on it's a hit 

Ski mask 
Extra Gats 
bring tha clips 
don't nobody move when we walk tha streets 
they stay silent 
cause talk is cheap
