[Tupac] 
Cause I hate to spend 
My life, my life, my life, my life 


Duckin one-time! (Lost Soul) 
How it start, how it start 
Started off with, runnin from copses duck and hide from helicopters 

We open fire, who can stop us 
Livin the life of trife juveniles, hopin for righteous 

Gettin twenty-five to life, if the judge don't like us 
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin to get us 

ATF state feds scandalous bitches 
I wasn't promised to it, wasn't bitter or sweet 

See if a, nigga don't hustle then the nigga don't eat 
Only streets livin do or die circle complete 

Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese 
Please understand my history a man of many acts 

Livin Thug Life, comin equipped, with many gats 
Maybe I was just a Lost Soul, trapped in time 

Livin in between life, and the cracks were blind 
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came 

Yet and still we all feel pain 
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine 

Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life 

Duckin one-time! Stranded in the County in the worst way 
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday 

Born in the ghetto as a street thug 
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love 
Lost Souls... 

Lost Souls nigga, for my homeboys that passed on 
Words from the mind of a Lost Soul 

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine 
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life 

Duckin one-time! 
[Young Noble] 
My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with 
a three-five when he get out 

would I be dead or alive 
He taught me the rules so much, but still In Thugs I Trust 

When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin trap shut 
My Mom Dukes got a little bit of Thug in her 

The Devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer 
Sometimes I feel like the 

streets are takin over 
Never stayin sober, the brain over and over backtrack 

My stack's fat, I used to take new 
One love to my crew aiyyo this one's for you 

[Tupac] 
R.I.P., rest in peace to Moo Brown 
Know what we gotta do baby, one-time 
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine 

Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life 
Duckin one-time! 
(repeat 2X) 
One-time! One-time! One-time! 

[Idi Amin] 
I was born twenty-two years ago, yesterday 
But see I saw no reason for me to celebrate, let me demonstrate 

Entered the world from out a poisonous womb 
Heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom, soon 
to be one of the many 
misguided 

Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it 

Lost before I had a chance to find my way 
Now I travel through life, not knowin the time of day 

Crime for pay, I'm on my way, but don't know, where I'ma end up 

I swear to God, it's just a setup 
And these are the words from the mind of a Lost Soul (I'ma Lost Soul) 

[Tupac] 
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine 
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life 

Duckin one-time! 
(repeat 8X) 
All of y'all, keepin y'all in health 

To all of y'all, keepin y'all in health 
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself 

(repeat 2X) 
For all my Doggz, keepin y'all in health 

Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself 
(repeat 3X) 

Throw your hands up (4X to fade)
