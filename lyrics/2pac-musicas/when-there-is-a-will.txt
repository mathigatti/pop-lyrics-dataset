(feat. Boot Camp Click)

Where there is a will there is a way
Search and discover a better day
Where a positive heart is all you need
To rise from beyond and succeed
And young minds grow and respect each other based on their deeds
And not their color
Look and them and say as I say
Where there is a will there is a way


[Verse 1]
I don't know why the caged bird sings
But as long as Thug Life in my veins I be doin' my thing
These blocks raised me to hustle for change
I learned the hard way without pain there is no gain
My life experience is trapped on page
My thoughts in my brain release when I be rappin' on stage
I'm like a prophet of rage with a glock and a guage
I bang for my gang, won't hesitate to cock it and blaze
Some years in this game can teach ya some things
I've seen many try and fail but the strong remain
My uncle Boo been locked away since I signed my name
And I opened to family and friends for fortune and fame
I'm dedicatin' every song that I sing
In appreciation of loved ones from here to the grave
And I know this shit ain't easy but ya help me to maintain
Struggle continues, where there is a will there is a way

[Chorus x2]
He said
Where there is a will there is a way
To search and discover, find a better day
Where a positive heart is all you need
To rise beyond and succeed

[Verse 2]
I let my heart in the pen speak
I just guide the words and let 'em touch who they reach
They even fall upon the ears of the deaf
But you can read it in Braile or come to me in the flush
I'm authentic, I fire back if I'm fired on
But I'm human I bleed if my skin gets torn
And I was born within a Gemini astrology
I'm in the hood and boys see the two sides of me
That's why he said where there's a will there's a way
Ya have to think about tomorrow if ya livin' today
No one's worthless the girl with no father
Lookin' for love from any man that will bother
She takes the money and she whispers his name
Like the paper and the tears gon' wash away all that pain
Yeah, it's sad but that's how it goes down
So keep ya head up and smile for me now

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
Just get ya click together and ya chips together
When y'all sit together and ya shit together, never
Let no man show ya no hand and no plan
That didn't show his home card, no fam
Where there's a will there's a way
And the jungle is a maze
When they rumble it's the strays that be duckin' like hey
I ain't tryin' to go to bed in the same night
Ricochet shots cover my head in the same sights
All I see so, all be is doin' this, pursuin'
The same dream to make cream
And the same fiends I pass by I ask why
Get the answer smoke cancer and slide
I look up in the sky give praise for everyday
That I'm sure to get paid like the sun give rays
Listen, it's hard enough to get a job but
It's harder to help us, hype, hustle, and tight the squad

[Chorus x4]

[Ad-libs to fade]
