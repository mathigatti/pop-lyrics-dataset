Monster,
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window


1, 2, 3 And to the 4
Eazy mothafuckin' e
With the chrome to your dome
Cruisin' in my '64 rag top
I got a lot of juice
A lot of fuckin' block

Now when I hit that switch
I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
Keep the gat in my lap
Cuz I'm fully strapped

For the car jackers
Fuck no hapsters
I pack a tech-9
Plus a ak-47
Send a one way ticket to my hell
Or maybe heaven, peep

Nigga, I don't sleep
Burry muthafuckas
In the concrete
You try creep kinda slow
In a astro
But I peep you niggas
Out in my left window

So I blast and I blast
Till I blast no mo
Yo, they call a mothafucka john doe
Monster,
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Now ever since was a seed
Only thing promised to me
Was the penitentiary, still ballin!

Rindin' on these niggaz cause they lame
In a six-one chevy,
Still heavy in this game,
Can you feel me?
Blame it on my momma
I'm a thug nigga
Up befo' the sun rise

Quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on,
Nigga then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggaz
Hit 'em up, westside

Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger
Lord forgive me if I smoke niggaz
I love my famales strapped,
No fuckin' from the back
I get my currency in stacks,
California's where I'm at - right?

Passed by while
These niggaz wonder why
I got shot but didn't die,
Let 'em see who's the next to try
Did I cry, hell nah,
Nigga, tear I shed
For all my homies in the pen,
Many peers dead
Niggaz still ballin

Monster,
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
[The notorious b.I.g.]
So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back,
Talkin' 'bout the gats in your raps

But I can't feel that hardcore appeal
That you're screamin',
Baby I'm dreamin'
This ain't christopher williams, still some
Mc's got to feel one,
Caps I got to peel some

To let niggaz know
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who?
Says me, the lyrical
Niggaz sayin
"Biggie off the street, it's a miracle"

Left the drugs alone
Took the thugs along with me
Just for niggaz actin' shifty
Sticks and stones break bones,

But the gat'll kill you quicker
Especialy when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin' funk by the boxes,
Packin' glocks is natural to eat you niggaz
Like chocolates. The funk baby

Monster,
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window!
