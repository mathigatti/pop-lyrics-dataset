(What y'all want?) 

Unconditional Love 

(no doubt) 

Talking bout the stuff that don't wear off 
It don't fade 


It'll last for all these crazy days 
These crazy nights 
Whether you wrong or you right 
I'm a still love you 
Still feel you 
Still there for you 
No matter what (hehe) 

You will always be in my heart 
With unconditional love 
Verse One: 
Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings 
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing 

How many caskets can we witness 
Before we see it's hard to live 
This life without God, so we must ask forgiveness 

Ask mama why God deserved to die 
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes 
Before she could reply 

Though we were born without a silver spoon 
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey) 

One day I hope to make it 
A player in this game 
Mama don't cry, long as we try 
Maybe things change 

Perhaps it's just a fantasy 
A life where we don't need no welfare 
Shit with our whole family 
Maybe it's me that caused it 
The fighting and the hurting 

In my room crying cause I didn't want to be a burden 
Watch mama open up her arms to hugging 
And I ain't worried bout a damn thang, with unconditionl love 

Chorus: 2x 

In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see 
Though things change, the future's still inside of me 

We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark 
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love 

Verse Two: 
Just got the message you've been calling all week 
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak 
But you know, with you and me it's on G 

We could never be enemies, cause you been such a good friend to me 
Where would I be without my dogs 
No wonder why when times get hard 

Cause it ain't easy being who we are 
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions 
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission 

Is to be more than just a rap musician 
The elevation of today's generation 
If could make 'em listen 
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed 
Time to play and strategize, my family's gotta eat 

When we make somethin out of nothing 
No pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good 
If they could cut out all the busting 

The liquor and the weed the cussing 
Sending love out to my block 
The struggle never stops (unconditional love) 

Chorus 

Verse Three: 
I'll probably never understand ya ways 
With everyday I swear I hear ya 

Trying to change your ways while gettin paid at the same time 

Just had a baby with the same eyes 
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times 
How come I never made it 

Maybe it's the way the played it in my heart 
I knew one day I gotta be a star 
My hopes and all my wishes 
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency 

I'll never even get to see 
This fast life soon shatter us 
Cause after all the lights and screams 
Nothing but my dreams matter 
Hoping for better days 

Maybe a peaceful night, baby don't cry 
Cause everythang gonna be alright 
Just lay your head on my shoulder 
Don't worry bout a thang baby 

Girl I'm a soldier (huh) 
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was 
You still came with that, unconditional love 
Chorus 3x until fade
