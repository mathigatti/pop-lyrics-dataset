[Eminem] Feel the wrath of a psychopath, wrath of a psychopath, Feel the wrath of a psychopath, The wrath of a psychopath

Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the valentines day massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her laying a blood bath

[2Pac]
Murderous mind state,
Can't keep my nine straight,
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waiting for the time to break,
Show up and muthafuckas bow down, recognize
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw, Ridaz,

[Eminem] My have your attention please, I repeat, My have your attention please, We're gonna have a problem here.

[Eminem] Feel the wrath of a psychopath, wrath of a psychopath, Feel the wrath of a psychopath, The wrath of a psychopath

Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the valentines day massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her laying a blood bath

[2Pac]
Murderous mind state,
Can't keep my nine straight,
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waiting for the time to break,
Show up and muthafuckas bow down, recognize
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw, Ridaz,
Untouchable mob of pistol packers,
Well-known felons labeled for 'drug-selling merciless jackers',
Forever buzz, roll with thugs and dogs,
Commence the letting off rounds, then escape in the fog

[Eminem] Feel the wrath of a psychopath, wrath of a psychopath, Feel the wrath of a psychopath, The wrath of a psychopath

[Proof]
I was raised by drunks, so I became a drunk.
80 Proof for this rocker, that's the name I want.
Or the aisle in the back, bump a seven deuce.
See that top on that 40, you know it's comin' loose.
See me on the Av. daily, we runnin' this shit.
If your chick get loud, I g-money that bitch.
Packin mags and clips, I'll smash your clique.
Because of Proof they put the "G" in the alphabet.

[Eminem] I'm the devil. if ever there was such a thing
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing
I'm a mindfuck, completely dis-(gus)-ting
I'm (white), a human mutt, fuck a being
I'm a dog - fuck lambs, I'm silencin 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor

[Eminem] Feel the wrath of a psychopath, wrath of a psychopath, Feel the wrath of a psychopath, The wrath of a psychopath
