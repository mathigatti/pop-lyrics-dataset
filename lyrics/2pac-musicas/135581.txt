2Pac: 

There's gonna' be some stuff that your gonna' see 
That's gonna' make it hard to smile in the future 
(No Doubt) 
But whatever you see, through all the rain and pain 


You gotta keep a sense of humor 
Gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit 
Remember that 
Just keep ya head up 

Our lifesytles be close caption 

Addicted to fatal attraction 
Pictures and actions be played back 
In the mist of mashin' 
No fairytales for this young black male 
Some see me stranded in this land of Hell 
Jail and crack cells 
???? culture 
Or the repercussion 

While bustin' on back-stabbing vultures 
Sellin' my soul 
For material wishes 
Fast cars and bitches 
Wishin' I live my life a legend 
Immortalized in pictures 
Why shed tears, save your sympathy 
My childhood years 

Was spend burying my peers in the cemetary 
Here's a message to the newborns 
Waiting to breath: 
"If you believe 
you can achieve, just look at me" 
Against all odds 
Though life is hard, we carry on 

Living in the projects 
Broke with no lights on 
To all the G's that follow me 
Protect your essence 
Born with less but your still precious 
Just smile for me now 

Chours: 
Ohhh Won't you smile for me 

(2Pac: Just smile for me now) 
Ohhh Won't you smile for me 
(Nigga you black, smile for me now) 

Ohhh Won't you smile for me 
(You ain't got nothin' to worry about) 

(Smile for me now) 

Ohhh Won't you smile for me 

(and the next generation) 

Scarface: 

Now as I open up my story 
With the blaze of your blunt 
So you can picture thoughts slowly 

Upon phrases I run 
And I can walk you thru the dayz that it done 
I often wish that I can save everyone 
But I'm a dreamer 
Have you ever seen a nigga 
Who was strong in the game? 

Over-looking his tomorrows 
and they finally came 
Look back on childhood memories 
And I'm still feelin' the pain 
Turnin' circles in my 9th grade 
Dealin' Cocaine 
To many hassels in my local lights 

Survivin' the strain 
And a man without a focused life 
could drive him insane 
Stuck inside a getto fantasy 
Hopin' it'd change 
But we're not focused on reality 
We broken in Jane 
Had a dream of livin' wealthy 
Makin' it big 

Over football 
???? 
What take it 
He did 
And after all my mama's thankin' god 
For blessing her child 
All my mama gotz to do now is collect 
And then smile 
(2Pac: Smile) 

Chours: 
Ohhh Won't you smile for me &lt;X4&gt; 
(Smile for me now) &lt;X1&gt; 

2Pac: 

Fuck tha world 
As we unload, we witness furious speeds 
Un-answered questions keep us all stressin' 
Curious G's 

Back stabed and bleeding 
Crooked thoughs 
Laced with weed 
Learnin', duckin' stray shots 
Bullets be hot 
They burnin' 
Inhale the shurm smoke 
Visualize the flames 
Will I be smothered by my own pain? 

Strange wisdoms 
Cowards conversate' 
So quick to dis' us 
Takin' pictures for the Feds 
In desperate hopes they get us 
Hit us all, give us plenty centuries 
Forgive my stance 
Sense I entered many penitentiaries 

The best revenge 
Is fuck friends 
We milatary minded soljahs 
Bustin' shots blindly 
Trying to find Jahova 
To help me 
Somebody save me 
Lost and crazy 
Scared to drop a seed 

Hopin' I ain't cursed babies 
Maybe now 
Niggaz feel me now 
Picture my pain 
Embrace my words 
Make the world change 
And still I smile nigga 

Chrous till fade.... 
(Background singer till fade)
