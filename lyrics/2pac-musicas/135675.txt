(Tupac) 
Yah nigga, Drop the top on your muthafuckin ride 
This how we do it on the west coast BAABBBY 
Rollin' down the Four O Five 
Gettin' high 
White boys done wrecked their shit 
Tryin to check my ride 
I ain't being bootsy 


Crusin' in a Six-o Impala 
Drivin' like I'm in a Hooptee 
car full of ballin' caps 
keep yo hand on the strap 
and take all the craps 
Niggas know my steel-lo 
all legit 
but I'm drapped 

like a nigga movin' kilo 
Shit don't stop 
cuz i can make that ass drop 
make the front pop 
And Hit the three wheel motion 
All Day 
Hit the freeway 
take it easy, uhh 
Let's slide 

And pick-up some hoochies 
ride 
right back to the movies 
High 
talking back to the screen drinkin' liquor 
Havin' big dreams of gettin' richer 
I'm livin that 
Chorus (4x) (Tupac) 

Thug Life, y'all know the rules 
gotta do whatcha gotta do (Stay True) 
Big Stretch represent the real nigga 
flex, Live squad and this mutha fucker catch wreck 
(Stretch) 
Thug Life 
sharp as a roughneck 

Shakin' the dice, we roll long, ain't nothin' nice 
so the vice wanna follow us around (raize up) 
Got 'em runnin' as we clown thru the town (blaze up) 
Another one, had to throw another gun 
Don't need another case 
you can see it on my face son 

But I ain't fallin' yet 
And I gotta give a shout to where my ball is at 
(Tupac) 
Mophreme Tell 'em why the hoes dream 
gettin high off a nigga like a dope fiend 
(Mophreme) 

Cuz I'm non-stop, and I'm always hustlin' 
twenty four seven, ain't nothin buck 
but when a young G's flippin keys for a livin' 
Try to make a mill off the time I'm givin' 
trippin' 
mad 
I'm crazy 
Can't nobody fade me 

And I been goin' insane lately 
And everybody tryin ta hold me back 
I'm about to snap 
You better move back 
You know I led a..... 
Chorus (4x) (Tupac) 
Thug Life, y'all know the rules 
gotta do whatcha gotta do (Stay True) 

Maaaannnn, I don't worry about the Five-O 
if they start, 
cuz it's all about survival 
Just stay smart 
Keep your mind on your bank roll 
always 
stay ahead of these stank hos 
These days 
It's an all out rat race 

And look at MEEE just caught another cat case 
That makes three 
My laywers getting cash up the ass 
Don't even ask 
Why I'm buck wild ? 
Don't smile 
don't laugh 

To the young G's comin up 
peep game 
Don't let the money make you change 
or act strange 
Stay broke 
It's all in together now 
Keep pumping loud 
till the crowd 
bring the top down 
Is that Tupac Thug Life ? 
Hell Yah 

Try to dirty up my name 
but it's still here 
which way do I turn ? 
i'm strapped 
Lost in the storm 
I can't turn back 
with that... 
Chorus (4x) (Tupac) 
Thug Life, y'all know the rules 
gotta do whatcha gotta do (Stay True)
