Drop the drums here it comes
Only got two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press, wreck on your tek
Here we go, set passed on Moet
My trickery more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass lines thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, its like a hobby
But more like a job, cause bootleggers trying to rob me
And little man wants to be a rap star
Make papes, hit skins, and drive a phat car
It ain't easy, sleazy, even decieveing
No scheme believeing
No bitter [???]
[???]
Knock a pig to pick
so here's a stick to lick
I shoot to give
till there ain't nothing left
And if I find that the tracks sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
Thats how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I stay high and try to stay high
Lifes a mess don't stress
test
[? I'm giving, won't think without 'cha living ?] bless
Guess who's back
coming back with the track supply
With Special Ed and Ak, coming right and attack
I'm fighting back, now snap, where they at
When its time to go to combat
Guess who's back


Yes I'm back
Tupac is back (4x)

Drop the drums here it comes
Only got one minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin' big, to makin' hits
While some tricks
I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes, on tapes to make
Lets trace the base, to the tape
With the badest bass to date
I try to shake it, but the pace is hard to break
Thoughts I wait, cause they hate my black take
Yeah, its on, its back in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, its a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw dude
Trying to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me
WHY ME?
No lie, nothing tried when they try me
Giving up the roughness, justice
I'm a bust as I ripping up enough hits
And Guess who's back
No longer trapped
Cuz, I snapped on the ones that held me back
feeling contact
ride the track
get I grip as I flip
get a licking as I kick
Guess who's back

Yes I'm back
Tupac is back (4x)
