[Intro:Tupac] 
So what I wanna do, hopefully is... I wanna be, uhm not I wannabe I am Tupac Shakur! 


Tupac! 

2005! 

Guess who's back… G-G-Guess who's back 

G-G-Guess who's back… G-G-Guess who's back 

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja 
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me 

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja 
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me 

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja 
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me 

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja 
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me 

[Verse 1:Tupac] 
Posse deep as I roll through the streets 
Motherfuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps 
Layin so low you think I'm sleep 
But at the slightest beef, I'm robbin' niggaz sold they teeth 
And no P.D can get the dick if they play toughie 
Last time the niggaz rushed me I ain't bust but now I'm touchy 
Trust me, ain't nothing jumping but these buckshots 
And niggaz got enough knots at poppin at corrupt cops 
Ten motherfuckaz catch a hot one 
You wanted to start a problem, now you coward cops have got one 
And there's no prison that can hold a 
Motherfuckin' souljah ready to roll and take control 
So now jack him while he's sleepin 
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct 
some people panic, brothaz bugged out 
I had to keep poppin' cause they wont stop until they rubbed out 
And their vest don't protect from the head wounds 
Reload ammunitions and the bitches will be dead soon 
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shottie 
I finally got revenge now count the bodies 
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail 
Trying to keep a nigga down but ya failed 
Before I let you take me I told ya 
Fuck being trapped, I'm a soulja 

[Chorus: Eminem] 
I betcha that I got something you aint got, that's called courage 
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it aint scotch, it's not bourbon 
I don't walk around like no G, cuz that aint me, I'm not that person 
I don't try to act like you do, cuz that aint you, you just frontin 
You aint… 

[Verse 2:Tupac] 
My crew, 2Pac, and the Mad Bitch 
In the '64 rag on them thangs that's a bad bitch 
Gettin' ghost on them bitches in the town 
Bustin' out the backseat nigga when we clown 
Homie is you down? 
Dee got the strap and she anxious 
Hurry up before she spanks shit 
Comin' round the corner spittin' rounds 
They can't hold me down 
Caught them sucka ass bitches outta bounds 
Now tell me how that sound 
A double date laced with hate 
Make em pray for the judgment day 
Now tell me how that sound 
A double date laced with hate 
Make em pray for the judgment day 
Stinkin' biaatch!! 

[Chorus: Eminem] 
I betcha that I got something you aint got, that's called courage 
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it aint scotch, it's not bourbon 
I don't walk around like no G, cuz that aint me, I'm not that person 
I don't try to act like you do, cuz that aint you, you just frontin 
You aint… {Tupac} 

[Outro:Tupac] 

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja 
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me 

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja 
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me 

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja 
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me 

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja 
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me 

Everywhere I see, a soulja a soulja 
Everywhere I see, a soulja like me
