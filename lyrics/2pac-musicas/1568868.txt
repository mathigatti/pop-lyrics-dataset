(Tupac talking)

Well, I just heard some shit on this record
(Fuckin' in the midst of my comrades)
I send this out to that biatch
You too nigga
(Standin' in the midst of my comrades)
You fuckin' with some thug niggas
(That's right)
Believe that like you believe crack kills you stupid muthafucka
(Fuck you)
(Standin' in the midst of my comrades)


(Chorus: Tupac)

You must be
So so crazy
Bitch i'll beat yo' boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades (comrades)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploy's crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades (comrades)

(Verse One: Tupac)

Have you really thought about your part in this participation
My prediction bloody murder similar to ministration
Now in fairness to conversation
Cause it's your fate so take the time to contemplate what you'll be facin'
Talkin' that
Hip-hop shit, don't get shot bitch
Cause you can tell
All in your click to eat 'Pac's dick
The clip's in, prepare for the muthafuckin' death blow
Cause every rapper in the industry is history it's death Row
Not Bad Boy or So So Def
Before I make you bow before Tha Row
Just like them other hoes
The intricate design of my lethal lines criminal rhymes
From the mind of a thug shakin' state time
Take it to the next phase
You had your time to talk shit
Now bitchless busta's gettin' checkmated
These days muthafuckas talk shit and turn snitch when you see 'em they ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Westside

(Chorus: Tupac)

(Verse Two: EDI)

See by now the way this shit is situated
Niggas is gettin' eliminated
Simply for being affiliated
Clearly stated and man I know you hate it
We got a whole list to play with
And y'all niggas is at the top
Now let's make this
Happen
Fuck the rappin'
Let's get to scrappin'
So niggas can see what happens when you get caught up in dirty mackin'
EDI'll send you packin'
You know what we love action
Sneak up on attack
Pull back
Let's the slug's snappin'
Yo' chest section
Death has now stepped in
Bitch should have learnt your lesson
While your chance was still present
But now it's past tense
No question askin'
Out West it's called mashin'
Bailin' the corner blastin'

(Chorus: Tupac)

(Verse Three: Napoleon)

You must be
So so crazy
Bitch I'll beat yo' boy bad
Drivin' in the truck with my black mac
Thinkin' about the shit I never had
So I'm loadin' up one
And the two thing's that I cherish
Is money and gun's
I love my ones
And now I put blood on you
Snatch money from you
Leave slug's in you
Ain't no nigga breathin' fuckin' with 'Pac
Every album that he drop nigga
Number one spot nigga, locked nigga
Let me represent for my dead ones
Eat with my loved ones
Squeeze when the beef come
Chill when the freeze comes
I do that shit
You think you heavy in the game watch me move you bitch
This Napoleon, why did I say I again?
You punk niggas already know I ain't for show
And I'll die for the dough nigga that's fo' sho'
Never die for a hoe nigga that's a no no

(Chorus: Tupac)

(Verse Four: Big Syke)

Who I'm gonna call when a muthafucka feelin' sad?
My muthafuckin' comrades
Who I'm gonna call when a muthafucka doin' bad?
My muthafuckin' comrades
And fuck yo' bitch
Cause you a trick anyway
Cause my comrades was raised on pistol play
And boss playerism mixed with this thugism
So ain't no love in 'em nothin' but the fuckism

(Verse Five: Tupac)

Last verse is for them trick people
This is the sequel
I'ma treat you with evil
Livin' forever illegal
Now homicide got me preoccupied
Be a lie if I told you that I never wonder
When will I die
Be assured nigga word born
Cause now it's on you can only survive if you be strong
Until I'ma gone
I bust on Bad Boy middle finger to Da Brat
Don't get your young ass smacked

(Chorus x3)

(Tupac talking)
