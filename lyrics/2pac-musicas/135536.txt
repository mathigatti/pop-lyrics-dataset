[Tupac] 
Fumble suckers tumble goddamm I'm good 
since i was born I was strong 
Always knew that I could 
Don't care anywhere anyplace I rock 


Give me a mic tonight competition I'll drop 
Fast or slow I'll go and no one is gonna stop me 
Yo you must be kidding you swear you gonna drop me no 
Well sure as battlin is bad for your health 

I know your confident boy but don't fool yourself 
My mic's a weapon I'm steppin with a capable rhyme 
Yo your time for playin is ova you got your crew I got mine 

Not braggin I'm bad and I could only get betta 
Your girl came on to me she wanted me I wouldn't let her 

Don't make sense to come against me and my man "D" 
How it is how it was that's the way it'll be 

You still think you can beat me get it together 
Cause I'll never be beat, never be beat, never 

[Ray] 
Boldly you steppin to the top of the piece 
Cause I'm the predator competitor and I'm risin like yeast 

I'm the microphone musician musically I'm the most 
When I rumble you tumble like a burnt piece of toast 
Proceed with caution i cannot be stopped 

A deadly weapon that's kept inside a Sentry lock 
Strong hold holding on but there's no holds barred 

Fuck around feel the wrath and your forever scarred 
Anybody want to battle step the hell up 

Toss your ass like a salad and eat you all up 
You climb the rope of success but you know you can't win 
You get discouraged cause I hold the otha end 

If I let you go like all the others you will fall 
The vicious vocalist consoloist will still be raw 

[Tupac] 
Your bein waxed like a sucker but you'll neva recoup 
I'm a veteran a breathren goin in like a troop 

Try to stop me you can't you puff and you pant 
Try to beat me at this game you gettin stomped like an ant 

In the long run I'm the one that's holding the mic 
Upset to get to me sweatin me for the rhymes that I write 
This time we're goin at it get ready 

Cause I'm your worst nightmare, fuck Freddy 
Where's that mothafucker that said that I was a dope 
Tyin up rhymes like a rope I'll pull it tight and I'll choke 

You swear that you could beat me punk get it together 
Cause I'll never be beat you punk, never 

[Ray] 
Hard is what you wanted knowledge is what you gettin 
I'm movin and groovin and proven, you're still sittin 
Got me blowin up, like a 

Hawaiian vulcano 
Runnin things like Drano 
Lettin you know that there ain't no-body 
gonna diss me now I'm comin exact 

I'm paid got it made cause I'm makin tracks 
This is a lesson at bein dope that is 

Cordless mics are mine and the wheels are his 
Tons and tons of freaks I'm a mack daddy-o 

Writin def jams while I'm chillin on my patio 
You are useless as a toothless piranha 

I'm ruthless now I'm gonna 
Bust it and discuss it make it funky to hear 
Paragraph to the people penetratin your ear 

You wanna taste of it ooh here take a full dose 
Burn you up like radiation if you get too close 

[Tupac] 
Cause my mouth is like an uzi when it moves so quick 
And my lyrics are the bullets that I'm loadin it with 

You wanna beat me homeboy I think you'll be destroyed 
Get dropped like a habit and 

played like a toy 
Never defeated I'm not conceited but let's face the facts 

Couldn't beat me with a motherfuckin baseball bat 
If I gave you a bomb that was nuclear armed 

You could shoot it at me and I wouldn't get harmed 
Cause punk you can't stop me bullets couldn't drop me 
Stand on a mountain and still you couldn't top me 

You think you'll beat me boy get it togetha 
Cause I'll never be beat you punk, never 

[Ray] 
When you hear my thumpin it's a maximum charge 
Cause I'm the hip hop hood the ringleader at large 

Got a Ph.D in history 
I'm deadly boy not a toy like a poetry, prodigy 
Young beat conisseur hummin like a bird 

It was true when uou heard I'm the wiz the word 
Your eyes delate your eardrums expand 
When my voice comes through speaker from the mic in my hand 

Woofers stompin like thunder 
all about to explode 
The needle on the nuance stuck in overload 
Don't laugh cause I'm serious Mr. Mysterious 
Don't make me wad (why) cause I get furious 

Countless time is he just when you think I'm through 
I let my melody stretch to make more for you 

Just bust it cause I'm just too clever 
and I'll never be beat ya punk, never
