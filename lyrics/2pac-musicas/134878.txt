Child: Why you by the window?, what's wrong daddy? 
Mother: I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker 


He's just stand by the goddamn window 
with that fuckin' AK all day 
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't, 
you don't do a goddamn thing 
I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while 

I survive 
In the city where the skinny niggas die 
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry 
I expect retaliation in a hurry 

I see death around the- corner, anyday 
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway 
Strugglin and strivin, my destiny's to die 

Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes 
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy 
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me 

I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me 
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy 
Am I paranoid? - Tell me the truth 

I'm out the window with my 
AK, ready to shoot 
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress, 
I'm out of breath 
Make me wanna kill my damn self, 
but I see death around the corner 

Chorus 
(When we were kids, belonging felt good) 
I see death around the corner 

(But having respect, that feels even better) 

I see death around the corner 
(When we were kids, belonging felt good) 
I see death around the corner 

(But having respect, that feels even better) 

I see death around the corner, 
the pressure's getting to me 
I no longer trust my homies, 
them phonies tried to do me 
Smoking too much weed, 
got me paranoid, stressed 

Pack a gat and my vest, 
under my clothes when I dress 
Here's hopin I die the way I lived, 
straight thuggin' 
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas 
who was buggin' 

My homie told me once, 
don't you trust them other suckers 
They fought like they your homies 
but they phony motherfuckers 

And even if I did die young, who cares 
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares 
I got homies in my head 
who done passed away screamin, please 
Young nigga, make Gs 

I can't give up, although I'm hopeless, 
I think my mind's gone 
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner 
Chorus 
I was raised in the city, shitty 
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty 

Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty 
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household, 
And drinking liquor til' you out cold 

And tho' i'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow 
Bustin on them niggas til they gone 
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin for my riches 
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone 

Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless, 
them bitches will start shit 
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch 
No more game for free, please explain to me 

Why niggas trip bitch, who 
you came to see? 
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops 
I got homies that will hunt you til you drop 
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G 

And gettin high was a way of gettin free 
I see death around the corner 
Chorus 
This is for all the real mothafuckin niggas out there 
I know you ain't scared to die 

We all gotta go, ya know ? 
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes 
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin business 
Y'all niggas stop acting like pussies out there, 
all right 

(Movie bites) 
I'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that 
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground 

I want to got there in the middle of the night, 
I wanna piss on his head 
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground 

I want to got there in the middle of the night, 
I wanna piss on his head 
I want that sonova bitch dead, I want him dead 
I want him dead, I don't care
