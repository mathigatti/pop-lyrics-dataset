You niggas kill me
Why ya'll niggas don't wanna talk that shit when we in the physical form?
Why ya'll niggas get all shy when we right there next to you at the premiers?
(Laughs)
Ya'll niggas get alot of heart when you get up in the studio, huh?
[?] talk in the mic
Well do this for me would ya?
Next time you get the notion to talk about an outlaw nigga
Or a nigga on the westside, the best side
Call me, call me nigga, reach out and touch a nigga
Cause if you don't do that
And I hear one of you niggas sayin' something on the record
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I'm commin'


From the pressure
Yeah!
You know how we do it
Outlaw
Ride on these suckas
Ride on these suckas

After the fire comes the rain
After the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Time to make ya'll, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
Bitches too scary, get to near me we rush 'em
Visions of over packed prisons
Million's of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crate's (shh)
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas is defenceless I'm hitting fence's then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless
At these niggas throats
Only wish to breed
I explode into a million seeds
Ya'll remember me
Legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screaming peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take them to places, stake they face then erase 'em and brake 'em
Murder motherfucker's at a rate and then quicken the pace

Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
Outlawz, bustin' while we rushin'
We Untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
We Outlawz, rushi you, bustin' you
We untouchable

Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
Outlawz, bustin' while we rushin'
We Untouchable

[Gravy]
Uh huh, yeah
Ayo we won't stop
I let the four four pop
Tanqueray and alize
Man niggaz get shot
I smokin' on some?? Baby
You know it's all gravy
Calico's, AKs, niggas yellin' mayday, Payday
Soon as the red dots connect
All that haze and that dro', that Cali sticky icky
Strictly 213, 818, 323, 310
We Outlawz baby

[Yaki Kadafi]
I'm surrounded by thugs, slugs
Crystal's and pistols, callin'
Copy murderers that be softer than tissues
Got my persona soulja dedicated to the fuckin' drama
My foes, retreat like crows when opposed by pros
Mashin' like piranhas or a pack of pits
Bodies get wasted, paper chasin' tryna stack a grip
Then my mob touched, for lots of loot to clutch
Clinging for a life which ain't much
And a lust for these guns to bust
Ain't no trust, for these herbs tryna question
Keep my burner on the dresser, wake up bustin' in the morning from the pressure

[Tupac]
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
Outlawz, bustin' while we rushin'
We Untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
We Outlawz, rushin you, bustin' you

Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
Outlawz, bustin' while we rushin'
We Untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
We Outlawz, rushin you, bustin' you

[Fatal]
I never had a chance to be a buster I was raised hard
With the homies sheddin' tattoo tears out near the graveyard
I rep my Outlawz deeply
Done seen to many real playas fall, To let the industry cheat me
Only behind the scenes do they see me as Tupac
The Don In this bitch with two glocks, I'm wrong
The homies still gon' roll
And standin' with ya biggest G, You still gon' fold
I can guarantee you a loss
The homie Pac told me, I can guarantee you a boss
And it was him for a brief minute
Far as my life since he dissappeared
I still ain't found peace in it
But still strugglin' like Mumia Abu
It was 'bout to end truely, I knew
Named my daughter Asada
For that alone, make her more than a rider
Got every homie trigga finga under the set
Dope or guaranteed [?], my one-o-one will connect

[Tupac]
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
