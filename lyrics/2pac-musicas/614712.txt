[Verse 1 - Tupac]
I was so money orientated initiated as a thug
Fiending for wicked adventures ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of living insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell me if I'm wrong, but saying fuck the world got ya deeper in my songs
Drinking till I hurl, spending money till it's gone, it's the good life
Baby niggaz got it going on
No maybe if I died and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways
Fuck a bitch
Bad boys eat a dick a day bumping this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wetting niggaz like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked as hood fights
But I'm a baller now
Nigga
I live the good life


[Chorus] 2X
This is the good life
Fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggaz
That trust the hoes
I found a way to stack money
Guaranteed to rise
I live the good good life
Cause thug niggaz don't die

[Verse 2 - Big Syke]
No one knows, what the future holds, for you, huh huh
Listen closely
They say reach in your heart and you will find your mind
Everyday in these streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is now, peeping down the barrel of a fo'
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know, so
Who makes the call?
Will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
The desperation, constantly drinking and I can't sleep
Make deep tryin' to survive, some wanna die I wanna stay alive
Eyes on the prize let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucka ducking season
Ya need a reason, why she turned into a softy
After living so loftly
It cost me my soul out of control in the Devil's world
Me, and my niggaz and my girl
Living the good life

[Chorus] 2X

[Verse 3 - EDI]
I spend my days and nights, not knowing if strays in flight
Will finally catch me
It's the good life can ya hear me
Cleary, over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook doing way too much
But it's the fast lane on that, big dealing, big sinnin', all for the money
Some kill, some squeal, all for the money
Most ain't even real but we still call them homies
Now what the fuck is that fake love, fake thugs all in the game
I watch em all plot and fall, while I come up again
Outlaw never surrender is the call when the day is comin'
But this nigga get to running for my click get to gunnin
Str8 in the mist of all this stress and pain
We're trying to get a hold of the game
Living that good life

[Chorus] 4X
