[2Pac talking]
Ey

For the mother****ers that be out in the corner
This right here is some live shit
Ain't one word written down
Ain't no words from my mind
This is the shit right off the level

Because most of the time it's like


[2Pac singing]
Niggas know meee
But they don't know the D-O-double-G
They don't know oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: 2Pac &amp; Snoop Dogg]
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg &amp; 2Pac]
[Snoop Dogg]
I'm up early in the morning
Trying to get paid
Cause my mind is on my money
Everything is so made
I play game in the youngster
As a youngster
Trying to make my money
Trying to become a hustler
Finally made the status
Glad it's night in the pimp
Snoop Dogg 'bout to trip
Catch you grippin down our jiff
Making money is a must for me
I gots to have it
Cause you know my lifestyle is like Tupac's
It's just so lavish
Just moving on paper
Moving making and shaking
Leaving fools in a daze
Just if it's I was a Laker
Break 'em down and shake 'em
Pass it off to Tupac
And let him take a jump shot
Because he go give it all...

[2Pac]
Back in the old days
Niggas was suckers trying to belittle me
But that was when I was much smaller
Just a little G
But now I'm a just a bigger baller
Niggas don't want to see me
Because I'm larger and taller
Made my money get bigger
Bank account is larger
Niggas don't want to see me
They label Dogg the father
When they see us on the street
Niggas scream peace
They don't want it
Cause they screaming they can't see me
You heard the album, All Eyez On Me

[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg &amp; 2Pac]
[Snoop Dogg]
Take a trip around the world
Cause that's what a nigga love to do
I'm having money
Like a nigga is suppose to
You know this money be the topic that I'm spitting on
Cause I gots to get my grip and fingers got to keep it on
I'm scratching for some scratch and some scrilla
Trying to get the big paper
Cause yo paper is a killer
Leaving niggas on daze
Cause yes, money pays
Cause if you ain't got it
Then it seems you weren't plotting
Trying to do you a robbery
Or some type of assault
But you just might get caught
But you know it ain't my fault
I'm going to dip away and sniff away
And find me a hide away
And look for my nigga Pac
Going to take the ride away

[2Pac]
Well I'll be right there homie, uh
What's up baby
You looking crazy like you don't really know me
I know you heard the album
I Ain't Mad at Cha
So move closer
Big baby let me stab at cha
You know the rules
Big Pac in this mother****er
Don't look at me crazy
Cause baby I'm with them other suckers
This Thug Life baby
Outlaw Immortalz
I thought I taught you
Baby we don't do it
But we fought you
And when we did we beat you ass niggas in the street
Til the mother****er studio
Sounding like Phil Collins singing su-su-sudio
You niggas is b...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg &amp; 2Pac]
[Snoop Dogg]
It's like a family
Corleoni style
Mafioso
Snoop Dogg about to do it like Mousilli slow
E.D.I. what up nigga
I see you
I feel you real now
Snoop Dogg about to show how you how I feel the crowd
I step back, relax
New jacks, they get smacked up against the wall
When they think that they can get with that nigga Doggy Dogg
I'm so smo-o-o-th
I keep it on the real-a
Cause I'm a true kill-a
When it comes to making scrill-a

[2Pac]
Them niggas know
I suppose they froze
Once they seen me and the Dogg doing clothes in the videos
*****es pause
We all up in them draws
Baby you know the secret
I got to keep it
Money, paper and *****es my only motto
Drinking out the cold 40 bottle
My dog
You know these niggas is hogs
Now me and Snoop came up
And built our name up
*****es thought they had us crossed but ***** I got my game
Plus I'm a mother****ing balla alcoholic
You can ask my homie K
He'll tell you I've been balin since around the way
And E.D.I. had a baby
He's needed but he's crazy
Got these niggas running wild from his ****ing 83, uh
