The next heavy weight champion of the worldd...

I won't deny it I'm a straight fighta,
Ain't no stopping me
So why u suckaz keep boxing me?
Wanna see me cuffed up and call the cops on me
On a mission to be champs cause they let me free.

Prepare for combat my adversaries crumble
Face it I got a reputation for damage bustas get ready to rumble
They lock me in a cell have me trapped in a livin hell
Though not guilty I'm still in jail
Brother I serve my time like a soldier
Maintain composure

My shadow boxing or fight to the death bustin boulders
Every boxer with a pair of gloves
Best give up love
Heres a man from the making of a thug
A lethal weapon mind sharp
And in my heart there's a wish
To shake the world with the flury of my black fist
I was a highschool dropout
Now I'm the million dollar champ whos the next to get knocked out
Straight out of brooklyn I'm world wide ya'll all know me
Droppin all that come before me
Noone can hold me
And uh.

I won't deny it I'm a straight fighta,
Ain't no stopping me
So why u suckaz keep boxing me?
Wanna see me cuffed up and call the cops on me
On a mission to be champs cause they let me free.
