Get money nigga. Yeah aw yeah. 
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers 
that get up every muthafuckin' morning 
and put they work down. 
I see you I see you boy. 


Verse 1 
I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block 
li'l bad muthafucka with a pocket full of rocks 
Learned to throw them thangs 
get my skinny li'l ass kicked 
Niggas laughed 'til the first muthafucka got blasted 

I put the nigga in his casket 
and now they covering the basket with plastic 
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck peelin' caps 
tryin' to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce 

Gettin' chased by the five O fuck them hoes 
Gotta 45 screamin' out survival 

Hey nigga can I lay low 
cook some ya-yo and holla five O when I say so 
Don't wanna go to the pen 

I'm hittin' fences 
cops on a nigga back missin' me by inches 
And they say how do you survive 
weighing 155 in the city where the little niggas die 

Tell mama don't cry cause even if they kill me 
they can never take the life of a real G 

Chorus 
I'm gettin' money (4x) 

Verse 2 
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga 
servin' postin' liquor on the curb 
for my homies that deserve it 

If I wanna make a million 
gotta stay ill and kinda cool around the way 
I think today I make a killing 

Dressed down like I'm dirty 
but only on the block just a clever disguise 
to keep ya runnin' from the cops 

Gettin' high I think I die if I don't get no ends 
In a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz 
I hit the strip I let my music buck 

drinking liquor and I'm looking for a bitch to fuck 
Rather die making money than live poor and legal 

As I slang another ounce I wish it was a kilo 
I need money in a major way 
try to fuck my girl she gettin' paid today 

I live Thug Life and let the money come to me 
cause they can never take the game from a young G. 

Chorus 

Verse 3 
Damned if I don't and damned if a nigga do 
now watch a young muthafucka pull a trigger too 
Craaze out and don't let them see ya cry 

dry ya eyes young nigga time to Do or Die 
I pack a pistol in my pocket 
ready on my Glock 
ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit 

I done seen a muthafucka peep pain 
at point blank range cause he slept on the game 
ain't a damn thing changed 

They checking the time 
snap rolling if you can't stand playin' betta hoe 
Cause ain't no telling what ya might roll 

you might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold 
You better live ya life to the fullest 

Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol 
muthafucka better pull it 

And even if they kill me they can never take the life of a young G. 
Chorus'til end
