That's right nigga you gotta get your papers 
up in this motherfucker

[Tupac]

[Tupac] 
How old are you nigga 
[Rah Rah] 
i'm 11 

[Tupac] 
cause all I see is 
Murder murder 
my mind state 
preoccupied with homicide 
tryin to survive through this trial and rape 
dead bodies at block parties 

those unlucky bastards 
gunfire now they require maybe closed casket 
who can you blame ? 
it's insane what we did do 
witness an evil that these men do 
bitches see it too 

infact they be the reasons niggas get to bleeden 
but i'll fucken fire when I leave'em 
I shoulda seen'em 
hostile ho's catch elbows and grows disposed of 

and snitches get dealt with, with no love 
body bags of adversaries that I had to bury 
I broke tha law and their jaw 
all in tha same flurry 

but never worry 
they'll remember me through history 
causen motherfuckers to bleed 
they'll label me an 

Chorus 

Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
they came into sin 
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
Dear God, I wonder can you save me? 

Before I close my eyes 
I fantasize i'm livin well 
and I awaken 
realizen i'm just in prison in hell 
just as well 

cause in my cell i'm keeping pictures of these bastards 
excersisein' 
visualizing' 
everyone inside a casket 
picture me blasted 
surrounded by niggas in masks 
sent with tha task 

to harass and murder my ass 
will I last ? 
Heaven or Hell ? 
Freedom or Jail ? 
shit's hard who can you tell ? 
and if we fail ? 

high speeds 
and tie weed on tha freeway 
when will they learn to take it easy ? 
driveby's 
and niggas die 

murder without a motive by making motherfuckers fry 
got me runnin' from these coward ass crooked ass cops 
helicopters tryin ta hover over niggas till we drops 

Got no time for tha courts 
my only thought is open fire 
hit tha district attorney 
but, fuck that bitch, cause she's a lie 
now it's time to expire 

I see tha judge 
spray tha bitch 
'motherfuckers is crooked !' is what I scream 
and hit tha fence 
I cominse to get wicked 

spitten rounds as tha plot 
thickens 
never missen 
an early grave is my only mission 
If I die 
never worry, bury me beside my four-five 
may God forgive me, I was high 
and label me an 

Chorus 

Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
they came into sin 
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
Dear God, I wonder, could ya save me ? 

Society lied to me 
I ain't never gonna try ta be 
my mob will be doin roberies 
and stickups on these wannabe's 
I witnessed niggas lose they chest 

for ordinary reasons niggas 
bodies put ta rest 
so I just.. 
swallow my becks and holla 'fuck'em' 
and if i'm next 
just leta nigga step with somethin' 
I ain't fearin nothen 
young and thugin 
prepared for bustin if that's my destiny 

ready for whatever 
see you niggas can't get tha best of me 
(hold me down) 
definately no need for askin 
(now he mad) 
top speed 
(smokin weed) 
Blasted (biotch) 
cause when I bust'em they gonna shiver 
tha killers cry 

soldiers got bodies floaten in tha river 
what is they sayin ? 
talken about prayin' 
they need to stop 
that ain't gonna help 
these niggas sprayin up my block 
tryin ta take my wealth 

Chorus 

Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
They came into sin 
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
Dear God, I wonder could ya save me ? 
Outlaw, Outlaw 
They came into sin 
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
Dear God, I wonder could ya save me ? 

[Tupac]

these punk police is crooked as me 
but all I see
