hahaha
yeah, these r my words to my firstborn
u know what time it is
these r my words to my firstborn
nothin left to give


verse 1

now can ya picture young niggaz in a rush to grow
to old timers in the pen had to crush his throat
probably never even saw it comin
too busy bullshittin, caught him wit his mouth runnin
ain't this a bitch they got me twisted in this game
the feds and the punk police pointin pistols at my brain
i wonder if i'm wrong cause i'm thugged out
my homies murdered execution style runnin out the drug house
what was supposed to be a easy hit
now things r changed cause niggaz died over bullshit
inside my dreams i'm seein pictures of a broken man
no witnesses only questions of who smoked the man
young adolescents in our prime livin a life of crime
though it ain't logical we hobblin through these tryin times
livin blind Lord help me with my troubled soul
why all my homies had to die before they got to grow
and right before i put my head on the pillow say a prayer
one love to the thugs in heaven i'll see ya there
it's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
help ya make it through the storm
my words to my firstborn, feel me

my words to my firstborn
my words to my firstborn

since my very first day on this earth i was cursed
so i knew that the birth of a child would make my life worse
and though it hurt me there was no distortion
cause wild seeds can't grow we need more abortions
quiet ya soul, cause ya know what ya had to do
and so did victims of a world they never came to
i understand it's a better day comin
sometimes catch me sleepin on a dead end drivin with the car runnin
blinded
ain't no love in the hood only hearts torn
love letters to the innocent and unborn
all the babies that died up on the table
cause the family wasn't able
can't blame em i would do the same
all i had to give it was my debt and my last name
cause in the game things change livin up and down
this hard life got me walkin with my head down
flashin frowns wasn't meant to be was i wrong
but i'll never get to know so i carry on
it's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
my words to my first born, feel me

my words to my firstborn
(my nigga nutso up in this bitch)
these are my words to my firstborn
(hey nigga talk to ya boy, talk to ya seed nigga)

(nutso)

i'm just another thug nigga trapped up in this ghetto life
and endless hustle, strugglin tryin to settle right
and doin dirt ain't savin me
but the streets is the only thing payin me
feel me
runnin with G's stackin G's packin heat
mob life till this muthafuckas wack me
stackin greenery thuggin till i die
pickin up so much drank i'm gettin high
got the feds on me
and they label me a bad crook
thinkin i'm the reason this nigga got his hat took
on the run, now daddy gotta pack a gun
cause these niggaz wanna make u the last one
about these riches and jealous bitches and things u gon be sellin through
and if i die, remember that it's all love and i'm by your side every night
don't be a loser, choose your dreams do your thing
go solo cause these cold ho's will twist u up like shoe strings
open your eyez don't let these haters get you
roll up and diss you
my words to my firstborn

(2pac talking)
