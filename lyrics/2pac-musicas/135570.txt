Yah, Pour out a little liqour for ya homie nigga 
This one here go out ot my nigga Mike Coolage 
Light up fat one for this one 
How you come up man? 
Started young kickin dust and 
livin' rough you watch you mouth around my mama 
you couldn't cuss maaannn 
I had a down ass homie thou 


We ran the streets on the scene at the age of fourteen 
I packed a nine and my nigga packed a forty-five 
We drinkin' forties, real shorties livin' all the lies 
You couldn't stop us 
who cares ? 
i got my glock 
FUCK the coppers 
Hangin on the block 
slangin' rocks and makin' propers 

I couldn't Fuck with the schhhoooollll life 
I was a fool 
I'll play that mutha fucka for a toooollll man 
Tonight will be the night that's what we figurin' 
Hustlin in the rain felt no pain cuz we drinkin' 
Playin' them hoes like munure 
First let my nigga fuck then i fuck 
that's how we do it (Ha ha ha) 

It's two niggas comin up out da hood 
livin lfe just as good as we could 
Since a bitch can't be trusted 
Hoes snitch to the police 
Now my niggas busted 
Cops whoopin' on my nigga in jail 
tryin' to get a muthafucka to tell 
and couldn't nobody diss my nigga 
damn I miss my nigga 

Pour out a little liqour 
This goes out to all you so called G's 
pour out a little liquor for real muthafuckin partners 
Don't let the drink get like that y'all, Huh. 
Pour out a little liqour 
Pour out a little liqour 
What's that you drinkin on ? 
Drinkin' on Gin 
smokin' on blunts and it's on 
reminicin' about my niggas 
that's dead n' gone 

Now they burried 
sometimes my eyes still get blurry 
cuz I'm losin all my homies and I worry 
I got my back against a brick wall 
Trapped in a circle 
boxin' with them suckas 
'till my knuckles turn purple 
Mama told me, 'son they'll be days like this' 
Don't wanna think so 
I hit the drink n' stay blitz 
We had plans of being big time G's 
Rolling in marked cars movin' them keys 

Now I roll down the window 
blaze up some endo 
And get towed down for my niggas in the penn yo 
Your son's gettin' big and strong 
and i'd love'm like one of my own 
Till you come homie 
the years sure fly away the quickness 
you doin' the time 
And i'll keep handle your business 

That's the way it's supposed to be 
Homie 
If it was me 
you'd do the shit for me 
Homie 
I can remember 
scrapin' back to back 
Throwin' dogs on them suckas 
while runnin' up on this young hog 
I hope these words paint a perfect picture 
let ya know how much ya 
nigga miss ya 
Pour out some little liqour 
look at ya 
drinkin got you and ya 
don't even give respect to 

your partners 
Pour out some little liqour nigga 
it ain't like that tip that shit over 
Pour out a little liqour 
Pour out a little liqour... 
....Oakland still in the mutha fuckin house my nigga Richie Rich.... 
Pour out a little liqour
