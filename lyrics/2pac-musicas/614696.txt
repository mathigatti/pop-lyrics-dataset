4 My Hero (My Mother)

When your hero falls from grace
all fairy tales are uncovered
myths exposed and pain magnified
the greatest pain discovered
You tought me to be strong
but I'm confused to see you so weak
You said never to give up
and it hurts to see you welcome defeat
When your hero falls so do the stars
and so does the perception of tomarrow
without my hero there is only
me alone to deal with my sorrow
Your heart ceases to work
and your soul is not happy at all
What are you expected to do 
when your only hero falls
