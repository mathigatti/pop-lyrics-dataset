Would you ride for me?
Would you ride for me?
You lyin' if you want to ride for me
I mean all out, not just to fuck
I mean all that shit


Look, I need more than just romantic feelings
When shit is frantic need a bitch
That’s just as scandalous when fuckin' this killer
To be appealin', have a bachelor in cold feelings
Mind for numbers same to wonder with this drug dealin'
Thug feelings make me a villain to the PH imbalance of civilians
Don't let those hurt feelings turn this lesson into a killin'
Game spillin', my prophecy fulfillin'
To be involved with the killin' must be a immune to squealin'
Listen lady what does it take to get you hot and crazy
Pass you a loaded 38 and bust on fools who play me
This is how I plan a night
First we ride on the bustas then we dine
Eatin' dinner by candlelight
Be alert and put in works with a thugz passion
I'm a king, and you the queen up in thugz mansion
Me, I'm a never be a busta, I ride for keeps
I know you shy but please reply, would you ride for me?

Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Bust on them mother fuckers when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me? Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bang on them niggas when they lie to me?
Don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me? Tell me baby would you ride for me?

Come on baby, won't you ride for me?
Do the time for me just cock back the 9 and see
How many niggas put a gun in your hand
Tell you to take what you can while you runnin' with your man
On my order you shoot, straight countin' the loot
You disguised in my boots, slip and slide in the coupe
Unorthodox trippin' catch him on missions
Styles twisted daily weak MC's trail me show me how tellin' me
Smoke me instead of jailin' me
You know it ain't no Fatal dog and J without felony at the telly they yellin' me
Play me I give you one try
And I'll let you live long enough to let you see your son die
This evilness and wizardry Thug Life specifically it can be
Found as deadly as them bullets that keep missin' me
So what I'm 'posed to do
Just to open up your eyes and see (that's right) you got it good
All you have to do is ride for me

So Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me? Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me? Tell me baby would you ride for me?

It was a nice sunny day I was dippin' through the hood
Seen all my homies and it was all to the good
I'm Kurupt, the half-inch villian cold chillin'
From the floor to the ceilin' and illegal livin' civillians
So much cash is in the bundles
Been there and done done it everything you've done seen and ever wanted
I'm Kurupt, piece me up a piece of the pie
Many try but many die in attempts to ride
Who's the man with ten thousand plans got the grants and my my squad
We world wide homicidal clan
So many strech their arms out to touch my loot but fuck 'em dog
Beware of the owner cuz the owner will shoot
Meet the dog in the worst way and a nigga like me's tight on my worst day
I been rockin fuckin' mics since the first day my eyes opened wide
And finally realized tell me baby would you ride for me

So Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me? Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me? Tell me baby would you ride for me?

Open up my eyes, can't get up I'm feelin' weak
One too many nickies, take a quickie hit them streets
Pass the coke to me no weed, I'm already high
Don't need no Indo, crack the window
Bump the deck and let me ride
Niggas always fuckin' with me cause they don't know
Named me crazy when I was a baby, I'm not that ho
Heard I was a Brood Lord, struck a nerve
I'm swervin' off of Alizé so eat a word
This one in '96 for cruisin' off ?
Hard dick thriller still bitch killer
Fuckin' kibbles and bits
Niggas won't admit, got this industry on lock down
Ego trippin' I got tits
I got my crazed bitches and get my shouts out
Catch you with your pants down
Blow your fuckin' brains out
Steelo kind of sick, you know I be that bitch
And fuck Judge Ido cause he can eat a dick
It didn't have to be like this to see you made me trip
So pull a bullet out your ass fool, ego trip

So Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me? Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me? Tell me baby would you ride for me?
