Staring at the world through my rearview
Just looking back at the world,
From another level yaknowhatimean?
Staring...
Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops, people shot, nobody stop
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society,
First they try to murder me,
Then they lie to me, product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed,
Now the little baby's crazed raised off
Hennesey, tell me will my enemies feed when they see me,
Believe me
Even thugs gotta learn to take it easy, listen
Through the intermissions search your heart
For a plan and we turnin bad boys to grown men,
It's on again I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga rollin with a posse
Full of paranoid drug dealers,
To the end my friend I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin true
While I'm starin at the world through my rearview (see)
(They got me) starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to god, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die (we)
Gettin high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers


I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh lord

Now you see him, now you don't
Some niggaz be here for the moment
And then they gone, what happened to em?
Well let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the, truest
Thug life until I check out this bitch
I thought you knew this
Who is, gonna catch me when
I fall or even care to
While you thinkin I see you lost up in my rearview
Half you, is down with them
Outlawz outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin til our dreams come through
Staring at the world through my rearview

Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin days in this livin black
Hell, do you feel me?
Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checkin
Turn to smith and wesson war weapons
Heavenly father I'm a soldier
I'm gettin hotter cause the world's gettin colder, baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin at the world through my rearview (I say)
(They got me) starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to god, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly
And all my motherfuckers, nigga can die

Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin rules to these streets, somethin
I learned in school, on some million man march shit for the piece peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed c
Riminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans, towns run by young guns
Outlawz and truants, shit's deep turn eighteen
'Roll my well and lockup'
Burnt my body with my shotty, or chosin my dough
So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin through your rearview

Hahahaha, you ain't knowin what we mean by starin through the rearview
So since you ain't knowin what we mean let me break down understandin
The world, the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
And what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more
The world is a game to be played
So now we lookin at the world, from like
Behind us niggaz know what we gotta do
Just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round real niggaz do they wanna do
Bitch niggaz do what they can't
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to god, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly, ya know, and we'll be
