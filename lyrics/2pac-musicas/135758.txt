Verse One: 
Young black male 

I try to effect by kicking the facts 
and stacking much mail 
I'm packing a gat cuz guys wanna jack 
and fuck goin to jail 
Cuz I ain't equipped to stop how I look 
I don't sell ya-yo 

They teachin a brother like I was in books 
Follow me into a flow 
I'm sure you know, which way to go 
I'm hittin em out of the dopes 
So slip on the slope, let's skip on the flow 
I'm fuckin the sluts and hoes 

The bigger the butts the tighter the clothes 
The gimminy jimminy grows 
Then whaddya know, it's off with some clothes 
Rowd when the crowd says hoe 
That let's me know, they know I can flow 
Love when they come to my shows 

I get up and go, with skins before 
When I'm collecting my dough 
I never respect, the one that I back 
The quicker the nigga can rap 
The bigger the check, now watch how they sweat 

What kind of style is that? 
The style of a mack, and ready to jack 
I rendered up piles of black 
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack 
I hate it when real nigga bust 

They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust 
I had enough of the fuss 
I bust what I bust, and cuss when I must 
They gave me a charge for sales 
For selling the tales... of young black males 

Yes nigga, N-I-G-G-A niggaz 
Ay nigga you can't handle that shit! 
Pass that man! 
Hit that shit, that's the shit! 
It smell like skunk, skunk smell like that nigga momma 

We ain't nuttin but some low down dirty niggaz 
Keep it real nigga, fuck you nigga! 
You ain't givin me near a dime on this real motherfucker 
Fuck St. Ide's it's an Old E thing baby 

Strictly some of that Hennesee 
Can I drink with you fellas? Can I get it on it? 
Fuck you capo. You ain't in baby. 

I tell you what! You guys are not gonna be talking 
all that shit, when I come back, OK? 
We gonna say who the big mouth, when I come back 
YOUNG BLACK MALE!
