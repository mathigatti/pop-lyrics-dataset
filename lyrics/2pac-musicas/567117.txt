[Babatunde Olatunji] 
Please.. wake me when I am free 
I cannot bear captivity 
Where my country, I am told, "Hold no significance" 
I withered and died in ignorance 
but my inner eye can see, a race, 
who reigned as kings in another place 
The green trees were rich and full 
and every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as people 


War was gone because all was at peace 
but now like a nightmare, I woke to see 
that I live like a prisoner of poverty.. 

Please.. wake me when I am free 
I cannot bear captivity 
For, I would rather be stricken blind 
than to live without expression of mind
