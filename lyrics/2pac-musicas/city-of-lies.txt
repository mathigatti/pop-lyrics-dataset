They got me jocked
But now I'm strapped and gettin' hotter
Runnin' from the cop, as I try to cock my Glock
The war won't stop
That's why they wanna ban the music
You ever notice how the cops can't stand the music
See a black man coolin' with a mexican
We can all have peace on the sets again
One time make it worst when they sweat us
Send a army of pigs to come get us


Watch me clown, give me lovin' when I'm high
I'm a outlaw baby, I'll be thuggin' 'til I die
In my drop-top, double-R, life as a rap star
Hustle like a crack fiend 'til they catch me
Go ask somebody to your show
Watchin niggas out of sight, in my night scope
Cookin' white dope, got my nigga 25-to-life stressed out
Tryin' to have all the better things in life
While Makaveli, a born leader, 10 millimeter
Change a nigga's future like a schizophrenic palm reader
Heed, from out the Bible I read
See the meek shall inherit the Earth and the strong will lead
Hittin' weed like it's alright
I'm in the studio makin' music all night
My enemies cry whenever I rise, they hated 'til the death
Tryin' to beat me out my last breath
Whatcha gonna do?

They got me jocked
But now I'm strapped and gettin' hotter
Runnin' from the cop, as I try to cock my Glock
The war won't stop
That's why they wanna ban the music
You ever notice how the cops can't stand the music
See a black man coolin' with a mexican
We can all have peace on the sets again
One time make it worst when they sweat us
Send a army of pigs to come get us

Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead and buried, now the stress is through
They try to ban me, cause the brothas makin' noise a lot
I tear that asses and the boys
Bout to poison the block

They got me jocked
But now I'm strapped and gettin' hotter
Runnin' from the cop, as I try to cock my Glock
The war won't stop
That's why they wanna ban the music
You ever notice how the cops can't stand the music
See a black man coolin' with a mexican
We can all have peace on the sets again
Give a shout-out to my homies in the Pen'
They try to keep us down 'fore
We clown everytime we hit the Top-10
Once again it's yo friend out of Oakland
Hopin' they keep the hip-hops clubs open
Now we can fight and let 'em close [?]
We can have peace and so we control them
Ain't nobody gettin' paid, it's a damn shame
Why gangbang brothas in the same gang take security to blame
'Cause they lettin' it off, brothas come to have fun
But they settin' it off
So I'm runnin' out of time, and it's cool
Down with my (homeboy put it down
