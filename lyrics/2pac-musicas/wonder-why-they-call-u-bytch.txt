Chorus:

You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.



Look here Miss Thang
hate to salt your game
but yous a money hungry woman
and you need to change.


In tha locker room
all the homies do is laugh.
High five's cuz anotha nigga
played your ass.


It was said you were sleazy
even easy
sleepin around for what
you need


See it's your thang
and you can shake it how you wanna.
Give it up free
or make your money on the corner.


But don't be bad and play the game
get mad and change.
Then you wonda why these muthafuckas
call you names.


Still lookin' for a way out
and that's OK
I can see you wanna stray
there's a way out.


Keep your mind on your money,
enroll in school.
And as the years pass by
you can show them fools.


But you ain't tryin' to hear me
cuz your stuck,
you're headin' for the bathroom
'bout to get tossed up.


Still lookin' for a rich man
you dug a ditch,
got your legs up
tryin' to get rich.


I love you like a sista
but you need to switch
and that's why they called
U bitch, I betcha.



Chorus
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch. I betcha.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch. I betcha.

You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch. Betcha.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.


You leave your kids with your mama
cuz your headin' for the club
in a skin tight miniskirt
lookin' for some love.


Got them legs wide open
while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga
'bout his car.


I guess he said he
had a Lexxxus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex


I pass by
can't hold back tears inside
cuz, lord knows
for years I tried.


And all the other people
on my block hate your guts
Then you wonda why they stare
and call you slut.


It's like your mind don't understand
you don't have to kill your
dreams ploten'
schemes on a man


Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'
I'm hearin' rumors so you need to switch
and niggas wouldn't call you bitch, I betcha.



Chorus
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch. I betcha.

You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch. Betcha.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.


I guess times gettin' hard
even harder for you
cuz, hey now, got a baby
on the way now


More money from the county
and thanks to the welfare
you're about to
get your hair done.


Got a dinner date
can't be late
trick or treat, sweet thang
got anotha trick to meet.


The way he did it
it was smooth
plottin' while he gamin' you
So baby, peep tha rules.


I shoulda seen it in the first case
the worst case
I shoulda never called you back
in the first place.


I remember back in high school
baby you was fast
straight sex
and barely move your ass.


But now things change
cuz you don't look the same
let the ghetto get the best of you
baby, that's a shame


Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
and finally be in peace.


So where your niggas at now
cuz everybody left
they stepped
and left you on your own


See I loved you like a sista
but you died to quick
And that's why we called U bitch, I betcha.



Chorus
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch. I betcha.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch. I betcha.

You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.


(Tupac speaking)


Dear Ms. Deloris Tucker
keep stressen me
fuckin' with a muthafucken mind
I figured you wanted to know
you know
why we call them hos bitches
and maybe this might help you understand
it ain't personal
strictly business baby
strictly business


So If you wonder why we call U bitch
You wonder why we call U bitch
If you wonder why we call U bitch
You wonder why we call U bitch
