Hahahaha, man you crazy, see

[verse one]
It ain't easy bein me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasin me around
And it's always drama, whenever i wanna get around
Momma told me, long before i ever came up
Gotta be true, to what you do and keep the game up
Cause thangs change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin at my door
And i got no time to worry, i'm steady wantin more
Every day is a test yes, i try hard
But i'm strugglin with every breath, i pray to god
That the woman that i left at home, all alone
There ain't nothin like tryin to bone, over the phone
In my mind i can see her naked, i can't take it
Got me shakin at the thought that we can make it
I torture me


[chorus: nate dogg]
I'm rollin out on tour today, you gettin sad cause i'm goin
Away, the...
... chickenheads wanna play with me, you gettin mad cause you
Think i'ma sway
Some of 'em cute some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as i hit the stage, nah...
Still i be gettin lonely for you
I'm comin home soon as i make this pay, make this pay

[verse two]
I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though i can't make it home
I whisper thangs in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me, from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
Cause i'm hustlin and makin money, with the fellas
In the backstreets, tryin to track me, baby hold up!
Thugs get lonely too, but i'm a soldier
And there's no way i'ma stop makin money
Cause your attitude's changed and you're actin a little funny
Always complainin, sayin we don't spend time
Can't you see i got enough stress on my mind?
And hangin up like you all that
Then get mad when i tell you that i'm busy baby, call back
Please, ain't nothin left to say to you
Thugs, get lonely too, you know

[chorus]

[verse three]
I sit alone in my room drinkin, without a care
Talkin out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man it's on
You're the first face i wanna see, when i get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touchin every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin sweat on top of you, sink and see
This in yo' head that i'm makin love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax, cause baby right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
Cause everything i'm givin to you, is so true
And thugs get lonely too, you know

[chorus]

[2pac]
Yeah, thug life bay-bee!
Steady thuggin
Ay so you remember that next time you sweatin me when i'm on the
Road baby
Thugs get lonely too, we ain't gotta go through all this
Bullshittin ass problems
If you wanna be real with me, be real with me
If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me
You know
