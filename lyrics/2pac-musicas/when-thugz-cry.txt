Intro:

When Thugz Cry
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray to Lord my guns to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray to Lord my soul to take
Got us dying
When Thugz Cry
Times is hard



Verse One:

Born thuggin' and lovin'
The way I came up, big money clutchin'
Bustin' while evadin' cocaine bust
My po's rushin'
To my cushin' into insanity
They shot at my cousin now we bustin' at they whole family
These cowards wanna see me burried, I ain't worried
I got a line on the D.A. cause I'm fuckin' the secretary
I black out, start cussin, bust 'em, and touch 'em all
They panicin' bitches duckin', I rush 'em, and fuck 'em all
Probably be an old man before I understand
Why I had to live my life with pistols close in hand
Kidnapped my homie sister cut her face up bad
They even raped her so we blazed they pad
Automatic shots rang out, on every block
They puttin hits on politicians even cops
I ain't lyin', they got me sleepin' with my infrared beams
And in my dreams I hear muthafuckas screamin'
What is the meanin'?
When Thugz Cry


Chorus:

Oh Why
Should you send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk
When they die
Let the rocks cry out
When Thugz Cry
Dear God
(When Thugz Cry)
Oh Why
Does It Have To Be This Way Ahh
Children of today won't stay wise
(When Thugz Cry)
Let the children hear
When Thugz Cry
Dear God
Oh Why
(Ha)


Verse Two:

Maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'
Where is the love, never quit my ambitionz to thug
Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
Niggaz I used to love they closed the penitentiary
Still homie keep it real, how does it feel?
To loose your life over somethin' that you did as a kid
You all alone no communication, block on the phone
Don't get along with your pops and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in this song
To help us grow in time but now our minds is gone
We went from brothas and sistas to niggaz and bitches
We went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches
But somethin' change in this dirty game
Everythin' strange, lost all my homies over cocaine, Man
See they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie
See, you gotta get high or die
Cause even thugz cry


Chorus:

Oh Why
Should you send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk
(When Thugz Cry)
When they die
(We don't shed tears, we shed blood)
Let the rocks cry out
When Thugz Cry
(Do you still wanna be a thug)
Dear God
Oh Why
Does It Have To Be This Way Ahh
Children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear
When Thugz Cry
Dear God
Oh Why


Verse Three:

And all I see are these paraniod bitches, illegal inventions
Bustin' muthafuckas with upper cuts, I leave 'em with dentures
Cause in my criminal mind nobody violates the Don
I write your name on a piece of paper, and now your family's gone
Well perpetrate like you could handle my team
So merciless in mind try to take command of your dreams
Leavin muthafuckas drowin in they own blood
Clown and taking pictures
Later, laugh about the punk bitches
That turn snitches
Regulate my area the terror I represent
Make your people disappear, your wonderin' where they went
Am I cold, or is it just I sold my soul?
Addicted to the streets
Never find true peace I'm told
Come take my body, God
Don't let me suffer any longer
Smoke a pound of marijuana so I know it ain't long
Where is the end to all my misery?
Is there a close?
I suppose that's why I murder my foes
When Thugz Cry


Chorus:

Oh Why
Should you send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk
(I Shed Tattoo Tearz For Years)
When they die
Let the rocks cry out
(To My Dead Homeboyz and the prison peace)
When Thugz Cry
Dear God
Oh Why
(Yall ain't never heard my cries, nigga, what about if you would die)
Does It Have To Be This Way Ahh
Children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear
When Thugz Cry
Dear God
