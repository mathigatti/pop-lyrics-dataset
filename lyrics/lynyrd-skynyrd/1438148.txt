That's right, come on
Long tall Sally's looking good to me
Shaking that thing for everybody to see
Oh, everyone's thinking just like me
Wonder who the lucky fool's going to be


Get it while the gettin's good baby
Take it 'cause the others would
Ain't no hesitating
They just might be waiting
Get it while the gettin's good

Look at that dude in the parking lot
Taken it for granted, everything he's got
So if he hands you a dollar
Say, Thank you sir
'Cause I've been up and down
And I know what it's worth

Get it while the gettin's good baby
Take it 'cause the others would
Ain't no hesitating
They just might be waiting

Get it while the gettin's good
You know I gotta have it
Ain't no doubt about it
Get it while the gettin's good

You can say you don't want it
But deep inside you know, you really do
You know what I'm talking about
Well everybody's thinking just like me
Wonder who the lucky fool's going to be

Get it while the gettin's good baby
Take it 'cause the others would
Ain't no hesitating
They just might be waiting
Get it while the gettin's good

Get it while the gettin's good baby
Take it 'cause the others would
Ain't no hesitating
They just might be waiting
Get it while the gettin's good

You gotta get it while the gettin's good
You gotta get it while the gettin's good baby
You gotta get it while the gettin's good
You better get it while the gettin's good baby
