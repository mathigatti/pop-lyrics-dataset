Disillusions fillin' my head 
Never happy, I wished I was dead 
Can't remember things I used to know 
Take another hit Lord, let the four winds blow 
Junkie, junkie man 
Feel so lonely, I wish I could cry 
Suicidal, not man enough to die 
Can't remember ever feelin' this low 
Take another hit babe, here I go 
Junkie, junkie man 
Yonder come a man, Lord he's got my snow 
Help me out babe, get down low 
But I can't remember things I used to know 
The Lord knows I'm to blame. 
Take another hit Lord, and let the four winds blow 
Junkie, junkie man
