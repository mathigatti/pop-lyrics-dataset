Have you heard that rumor that's goin' around?
My baby's got a man, lord way across town
Its the same old story
Tell me, where will it end?
Yes, I heard the news, its the same old blues again


Well I wrote you a letter, must have read it wrong
Stood at the doorway and baby you was gone
Took a lot of courage
To let the telephone ring
I got the same old blues, same old blues again

Well you gave me the business, though I didn't mind
'Cause I got a lot of patience, lord got a lot of time
Its the same old story
Tell me where will it end
I got the same old blues, same old blues again
Here come my blues

Gonna find me a mountain and gonna hide out
Ain't talkin' to you babe, lord I ain't comin' back
Well, I heard that rumor, tell where will it end
I got the same old blues, same old blues again

Have you heard that rumor that's goin' around?
My baby's got a man, lord way across town
It's the same old story
Tell me where will this end
Yes, I heard the news, its the same old blues again
I got the same old blues, same old blues again

I got the blues, same old blues
