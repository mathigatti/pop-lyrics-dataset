There’s a little place down in Jackson county
Right off the river road
If you wanna take a ride to the end of the rainbow
And find yourself a pot of gold


Everybody asks me where I’m going
Yeah everybody wants to know
Your sister said she wants to come along with me
I know she really wants to go
Yeah I know she really wants to go

Down down down down
Down is where I wanna go
Down down down down
Down to the honey hole

If you wanna check it out a hot summer night
Climb over the garden wall
Grab your little baby and hold her tight
Underneath the sugar falls
Underneath the sugar falls

Down down down down
Down is where I wanna go
Down down down down
To the honey hole, to the honey hole

Sugar cane grows wild in the fields
Like corn jelly sticky sweet
Late at night you can hear ‘em all buzzing
Searching for the queen bee
Calling for the queen bee

Down down down down
Down is where I wanna go
Down down down down
To the honey hole, to the honey hole
To the honey hole

To the honey hole, uuuuuhhhh
To the honey hole, uuuuuhhhh
